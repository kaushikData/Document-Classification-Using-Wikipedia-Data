The '''second Handsworth riots''' took place in the [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] district of [[Birmingham]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], from 9 to 11 September 1985.  The riots were reportedly sparked by the arrest of a man near the Acapulco Cafe, [[Lozells]] and a police raid on the ''Villa Cross'' [[public house]] in the same area. Hundreds of people attacked police and property, looting and smashing, even setting off fire bombs.  

Two brothers (Kassamali Moledina, 38, and his 44-year-old brother Amirali)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birminghammail.net/news/crime-news/2011/07/14/from-the-archives-police-parking-ticket-sowed-seeds-for-riots-97319-29053622/ "From the Archives: Police parking ticket sowed seeds for riots"], ''Birmingham Mail'', 14 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were burnt to death in the [[post office]] that they ran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=TIM&amp;SrchText=handsworth+and+riot&amp;DateFromDD=01&amp;DateFromMM=Sep&amp;DateFromYY=1985&amp;DateToDD=31&amp;DateToMM=Dec&amp;DateToYY=1991&amp;ResultListMax=100&amp;head=&amp;byline=&amp;sect=&amp;Caption=&amp;edn=&amp;page=&amp;SortOrder=Asc&amp;SortField=SDate&amp;Submit1=Search&amp;BackDD=Day&amp;BackMM=Month&amp;BackYY=Year&amp;source=thetimes&amp;SortField=Pub&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;SortField=EDN&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;SortField=Page&amp;SortOrder=asc&amp;ST=NS&amp;SortSpec=&amp;ResultMaxDocs=100&amp;Site=ALL&amp;Collection=NI&amp;ResultCount=20&amp;summreqd=yes&amp;indexkey=48625459815003314420&amp;advsrch=0&amp;QueryText=%28handsworth+and+riot%29+%3CAND%3E+%28PUB%3DTIM%29+%3CAND%3E+%28%28SDate%3E%3D9%2F1%2F1985%29+%3CAND%3E+%28SDate%3C%3D12%2F31%2F1991%29%29&amp;_P=1]&lt;/ref&gt; Two other people were unaccounted for, 35 others injured, more than 1500 police officers drafted into the area, about 45 shops looted and burnt, and a trail of damage running into hundreds of thousands of pounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-drum.org.uk/event_info.php?id=328&amp;eid=56]&lt;/ref&gt; As well as racial tension, unemployment was seen as a major factor in the riots; by the time of the riots, fewer than 5% of the black population to have left school that summer had found employment.

The riots were the first of a series of similar riots across the country during the autumn of 1985, notably the [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in London which also resulted in a fatality (the murder of policeman [[Keith Blakelock]]). Filmmaker and artist [[Pogus Caesar]] extensively photographed the second Handsworth riot; it was also witnessed by Bronx graffiti artists Brim and [[Goldie]], who documented the devastation in the [[Channel 4]] documentary ''[[Bombing (film)|Bombing]]''.

Together with [[Widukind]] he opposed the aggressive east expansion of the [[Carolingian Empire]]. 785 after being defeated in the [[Saxon wars]] he was baptized together with [[Widukind]], possibly in [[Attigny, Ardennes|Attigny]], with [[Charlemagne]] as his [[Godparent|godfather]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11561">A number of [[Arab people|Arabs]] participated in efforts to help save [[Jews|Jewish]] residents of Arab lands from [[the Holocaust]] while [[fascist]] regimes controlled the territory. From June 1940 through May 1943, [[Axis powers]], namely [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], controlled large portions of North Africa. Approximately 1 percent of the Jewish residents, about 4,000 to 5,000 Jews, of that territory were murdered by these regimes during this period. The relatively small percentage of Jewish casualties, as compared to the 50 percent of European Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust, is largely due to the successful [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[North African Campaign]] and the repelling of the Axis powers from North Africa.&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt; 

No occupied country in Africa or Europe was free of collaboration with the genocide campaign against the Jews, but this was more common in European countries than Arab ones. The offer made to Algerians by colonial French officials to take over confiscated Jewish property found many French settlers ready to profit from the scheme, but no Arab participated and, in the capital, [[Algiers]] itself, Muslim clerics openly declared their opposition to the idea.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Paul Harris, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/11/arab-schindler-honour-israel 'Israel called on to honour the 'Arab Schindler'], at [[The Guardian]], 11 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; While some Arabs collaborated with the Axis powers by working as guards in labor camps{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}, others risked their own lives to attempt to save Jews from persecution and genocide.

Arab rescue efforts were not limited to the Middle East&amp;nbsp;– [[Si Kaddour Benghabrit]], the rector of the [[Great Mosque of Paris]], according to different sources, helped from 100&lt;ref name="WP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Holocaust's Arab Heroes (Satloff)"/&gt; to 500 Jews disguise themselves as Muslims. There are examples of non-Arab Muslim populations assisting Jews to escape from the Holocaust in Europe, in Albania for example. In September 2013, [[Yad Vashem]] declared an Egyptian doctor, [[Mohammed Helmy]], one of the [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for saving the life of Anna Gutman (''née'' Boros), putting himself at personal risk for three years, and for helping her mother Julie, her grandmother Cecilie Rudnik, and her stepfather Georg Wehr, to survive the holocaust. Helmy is the first Arab to have been so honoured.&lt;ref&gt;Ofer Aderet,[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.549718 'Yad Vashem names Egyptian first Arab Righteous Among the Nations,'] at Haaretz, September 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In North Africa==

===Si Ali Sakkat===
During his career Si Ali Sakkat held positions of a [[Minister (government)|government minister]] and mayor of [[Tunis]]. By 1940 Si Ali Sakkat was enjoying retirement on his farm at the base of Jebel Zaghouan. There was a [[forced labor camp]] for the Jews not far away from Sakkat's farm. Jews from the camp were put to work repairing an airfield, which was regularly bombed by Allies. Arabs saw how [[Germans|German]]s who ran the camp beat Jews on a regular basis. One night, during an especially heavy battle, sixty Jewish laborers were able to escape. The first structure they encountered was the wall of Sakkat's farm. They knocked on the gate, and were allowed shelter and food. They were also allowed to stay until the liberation of [[Tunisia]] by Allied forces.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;

===Khaled Abdul-Wahab===
{{main|Khaled Abdul-Wahab}}
Abdul-Wahab was a son of a well-known Tunisian historian. He was 32 years old when the Germans occupied Tunisia. He was an [[Interlocutor (politics)|interlocutor]] between the Nazis and the population of the coastal town of [[Mahdia]]. When he overheard German officers planning to rape a local Jewish woman, Odette Boukhris, he hid the woman and her family, along with about two dozen more Jewish families, at his farm outside of town. The families stayed there for four months, until the occupation ended. Abdul-Wahab is sometimes called the Arab [[Oskar Schindler]].&lt;ref name="Arab Schindler"/&gt;  In 2009 two trees were dedicated to honor his bravery. One tree was planted in Adas Israel Garden of the Righteous in Washington, D.C., the other was planted in the Garden of the Righteous Worldwide. His daughter Faiza attended the ceremony in Milan.&lt;ref name="gariwo"/&gt;

===Shaykh Taieb el-Okbi===
Taieb el-Okbi was a member of [[Algeria]]n Islah (Reform) Party, and a friend of the prominent Algerian reformist [[Abdelhamid Ben Badis]], who was tolerant of different religions and cultures. Ben Badis founded and directed the Algerian League of Muslims and Jews. He died before [[Vichy]] forces occupied Algeria, but Taieb el-Okbi took his place. Taieb el-Okbi discovered that the leaders of the pro-fascist group the Légion Français des Combattants were planning a Jewish [[pogrom]] with the help of [[Muslim]] troops. He did everything he could to prevent it and issued a [[fatwa]] ordering Muslims not to attack Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://972mag.com/jews-stand-up-for-muslims-as-muslims-once-stood-up-for-them/125014/|title=Jews stand up for Muslims, as Muslims once stood up for them {{!}} +972 Magazine|website=972mag.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His actions were compared to French archbishops [[Jules-Géraud Saliège]] and [[Pierre-Marie Gerlier]], both of whom saved some Jews in [[France]].&lt;ref name="Satloff"/&gt;

==Muslim rescue efforts in Europe==
Albania, a predominantly Muslim country, saved almost all of its resident Jewish population.&lt;ref name="Sarner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sarner|first1=Harvey|title=Rescue in Albania: one hundred percent of Jews in Albania rescued from Holocaust|date=1997|publisher=Brunswick|location=Cathedral City, Calif.|isbn=9781888521115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paldiel in Norman H. Gershman, [''Besa: Muslims Who Saved Jews in World War II,'']Syracuse University Press, 2008 p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albanian Muslims Rescued Jewish Lives From Nazis|url=http://unitedwithisrael.org/albanian-muslims-rescued-jewish-lives-from-nazis/|website=United with Israel|accessdate=19 April 2016|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survival rate in the then-Yugoslavian province of [[Kosovo]] was 60%, making it one of the areas with the highest Jewish survival rate in Europe.&lt;ref&gt; Sarner, Harvey (1997) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refik Veseli===
Most of the 2,000 Jews of [[Albania]] were sheltered by the mostly Muslim population.&lt;ref name="Besa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Besa: A code of honor - Muslim Albanians who rescued Jews during the Holocaust|url=http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/exhibitions/besa/introduction.asp|website=yadvashem.org|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refik Veseli, a 17-year-old Muslim boy, took in the family of Mosa and Gabriela Mandil, including their five-year-old son Gavra and his sister Irena, then refugees from [[Belgrade]] but originally from [[Novi Sad]], for whom he had been working as an apprentice in their [[Tirana]] photographic shop. When the Germans took over from the Italians, he took them, and another Jewish family on a long night journey to his family village at Kruja, where they were protected by his parents until the war's end, some 9 months later, even against [[Enver Hoxha]]'s partisans. His example inspired his whole village to risk their lives in order to protect Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Illouz, ['Big brother: When secrecy becomes a norm in Israel, it comes with a price,'] at [[Haaretz]], 2 February 2, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On receiving Gavra Mandil's request for them to be recognized as righteous, the authorities of Yad Vashem inscribed both Refka and Drita Veseli in 1988 among the Righteous. The story became better known after Albania's surviving Jewish community was allowed to perform aliyah in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt; Sarner, Harvey (1997) p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Many survivors told how their Albanian hosts vied for the privilege of offering sanctuary, on the grounds that it was an Islamic ethical obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Paldail in his forward to Norman H. Gershman, [''Besa: Muslims Who Saved Jews in World War II,''] 2008 p.xiv., attributes the extremely high survival rate to the code of ''besa'' or one's word of honour. Gershman quotes the Veselis as saying:'We never received any money from our Jewish guests. Besa exists in every Albanian soul. Our parents were devout Muslims and believed, as we do, that every knock on the door is a welcome from God.'(p.90)&lt;/ref&gt; Since that date, a further 50 Albanians have been registered among the ranks of the Righteous.&lt;ref&gt;Mordecai Paldiel,[https://books.google.com/books?id=gRdUvDLC3pg ''Saving the Jews: Amazing Stories of Men and Women Who Defied the "Final Solution",''], Schreiber, 2000 pp.111-113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Sarner, Harvey (1997) p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For a summary of Comanche history see [[Comanche]].''
[[Image:Comanche lang.png|thumb|250px|right|Comanche territory c.1850]]

Forming a part of the Eastern [[Shoshone]] linguistic group in southeastern [[Wyoming]] who moved on to the [[American bison|buffalo]] [[Great Plains|Plains]] around AD 1500 (based on [[glottochronological]] estimations), proto-Comanche groups split off and moved south some time before AD 1700.&lt;ref name=hamalainen&gt;{{cite book |last= Hamalainen |first= Pekka |title= The Comanche Empire |year= 2008 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 978-0-300-12654-9 |pages= 18–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shoshone migration to the Great Plains was apparently triggered by the [[Little Ice Age]], which allowed bison herds to grow in population.&lt;ref name=hamalainen/&gt; It is not clear why the proto-Comanches broke away from the main Plains Shoshones and migrated south. That move may have been inspired as much by the desire for Spanish horses released by the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680 as by pressures from other groups drawn to the Plains by the changing environment.&lt;ref name=hamalainen/&gt;

The earliest known use of the term "Comanche" comes in 1706, when Comanches were reported to be preparing to attack far outlying [[Pueblo]] settlements in southern Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;Governor Cuervo y Valdez Report, 18 Aug 1706&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish may have translated from the [[Ute people|Ute]] name for them, ''kɨmantsi'' (enemy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bright,  William |work=Native American Placenames of the United States|date=2004| publisher=University of Oklahoma Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were fewer than 7,999 Comanches in 1870. At the low point in 1920, the census listed fewer than 1,500. Comanche tribal enrollment now numbers 15,191 with approximately 7,763 members residing in the Lawton-Ft Sill{{clarify|date=August 2012}} and surrounding areas of Southwest Oklahoma. Of the three million acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;km²) promised the Comanche, [[Kiowa]] and [[Kiowa Apache]] by treaty in 1867, only 235,000 acres (951&amp;nbsp;km²) have remained in native hands. Of this, 4,400 acres (18&amp;nbsp;km²) are owned by the tribe itself.

==Comanche expansion: 1700-1800==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
Between 1700 and 1750, the Comanche mostly resided in the central plains of eastern [[Colorado]] and western [[Kansas]], between the [[Platte River|Platte]] and [[Arkansas River]]s. From here they fought not only with the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] and [[Apache]], but with most of the tribes of the central plains. It is believed that contact with Europeans was made when Comanches accompanied the Ute to a trade fair in [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], around 1700.

===Spanish===
[[File:Comancheria.jpg|thumb|350px|Comancheria]]
[[Spain]] had relatively neglected [[Texas]] during the 17th-century, but this ended when the French began to expand west from [[Louisiana]]. A mission-presidio was built at [[Nacogdoches|Nagadoches]] in 1716, followed by other missions and settlements in eastern Texas. These were generally beyond the usual range of Comanches, but not beyond the effects of the Comanche war with the Plains Apache. By 1728, several groups of Plains Apache had retreated into southern Texas and were pressed up against the mid-[[Rio Grande]]. They generally annihilated or absorbed the [[Coahuiltecan]], [[Chisos]], [[Jano]], and [[Manso Indians|Manso]] peoples they found there, and began to raid northern Mexico. These groups of Apache became known as [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]], and they not only alternately fought and traded with the [[Tonkawa]] and [[Caddo]] tribes in eastern Texas, but were dangerous to the Spanish. They also continued to fight with Comanches, and this, together with French trade along the Red River, drew Comanches east and south into northern Texas.

Beginning in the 1740s the Comanches began crossing the Arkansas River from their previous range of between the Platte and Arkansas Rivers in eastern Colorado and western Kansas, and established themselves on the edges of the [[Llano Estacado]] (Staked Plains) which extended from western [[Oklahoma]] across the Texas Panhandle into [[New Mexico]].

The area they controlled became known as [[Comancheria]], and extended south from the Arkansas River across central Texas to the vicinity of [[San Antonio]] (including the entire Edwards Plateau west to the [[Pecos River]]), and north following the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the Arkansas.

The earliest mention of Comanches in Texas was in 1743, when they were attacking the [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]]. Some accounts call them Norteños, a collective term that probably included [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]] and [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]. The Spanish solution to Lipan hostility was to convert them to Christianity, but like most Apache, they were not very receptive. However, the Lipan, who had little love for the Spanish, saw an opportunity to lure the Spanish and Comanches into a war. In 1757 they approached the Spanish priests and requested that a mission be built for them. The suggested location was on land the Lipan knew was claimed by Comanches. The Spanish took the bait and built the [[Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá]] and the [[Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas]] near present-day [[Menard, Texas]]. The Lipan plot worked perfectly. Comanche and Wichita warriors massacred the priests, burned the mission, and attacked the presidio. When the Spanish tried to retaliate, Colonel [[Diego Parilla]]'s army was defeated by the Wichita and Comanches on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] in 1759 in the [[Battle of the Twin Villages]].

In 1761 Comanche raiders struck a second mission for the Lipan on the [[Nueces River]], and the Lipan had the war they wanted. For the next twenty-five years, Comanche raids struck throughout eastern Texas and across the Rio Grande into northern Mexico. The fighting and raiding evolved into three separate wars - Comanches versus Spanish, Comanches versus Lipan, and Lipan versus Spanish.

The French transferred Louisiana to Spain in 1763, but this did not change the trading patterns of the eastern groups of Comanches. Spain continued to administer Texas from Mexico City, while Louisiana was placed under the control of the Viceroy of Havana. Meanwhile, French traders from Louisiana continued to use the Wichita to trade for Comanche horses just as before. By 1770 Spain had gained better control of Louisiana, and for the next three years the Spanish used the French traders to make their first peace overtures to the Wichita and eastern Comanches. There was some success with the Wichita, but Comanche raids into Texas continued until a major smallpox epidemic (1780–81) decimated both the Wichita and Comanches.

By 1778 the Lipan and other Apaches along the Rio Grande had become a major problem for the Spanish, and they began to consider the possibility of an alliance with the Wichita and Comanches against the Apaches. After several small military successes against Comanche raiders, Texas Governor [[Domingo Cabello]] sent [[Pedro Vial]] as an emissary to the Wichita villages in 1785 to discuss a peace agreement with the eastern bands of Comanche.  By September they had agreed to a peace treaty which was signed in October at Bexar. In exchange for gifts and a promise of regular trade with Texas, the eastern Comanches agreed to help the Spanish fight the Lipan and to urge the western Comanches to make peace with New Mexico. As a result, New Mexico's war with the Comanches ended the following year.

New Mexico's peace endured because of [[Comanchero]] trade and lavish gifts, but for Texas and northern Mexico, the peace achieved was only relative. During 1786, many of the Comanche treaty chiefs in Texas either died or were killed. As a consequence, groups of Texas Comanches resumed raiding, but the number of raids never returned to previous levels.

===Apache===

By 1716, attacks by mounted Comanches had driven the [[Jicarilla Apache]] into the mountains of northern New Mexico, while other Plain Apaches had abandoned many of their settlements north of the Arkansas River, and were rapidly giving way across northeastern New Mexico, the [[Texas]] Panhandle, and western [[Oklahoma]]. Only a few Apache settlements still remained  above the Arkansas River. During the summer of 1716, Comanches and Ute visited several settlements in New Mexico to trade. Believing that the true purpose of these visits was to spy for defensive weaknesses, the Spanish attacked a Comanche-Ute village northwest of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].  Prisoners were later sold as [[Slavery|slaves]].

In 1719 the first recorded Comanche raids for horses in New Mexico occurred. A Spanish military expedition was sent to retaliate, and travelled as far north as the Arkansas River ([[Pueblo, Colorado]]), but found only abandoned campsites. Meanwhile, the advance of the Comanches had destabilized the entire region, and the Apache retreat southward had become a major problem for the Spanish. Groups of refugee Plains Apache (Lipan and Mescalero) concentrated in southern Texas and New Mexico and began to attack the nearby Spanish settlements.

Other Apache bands continued west across southern New Mexico into [[Arizona]], threatening to isolate Santa Fe from [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and northern Mexico. To make matters worse for the Spanish, persistent rumors of [[French people|French]] traders on the plains were reaching Santa Fe. A military expedition sent to investigate in 1720 was annihilated (probably by [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]]). Sometime during 1723 the war between the Comanches, Utes, and Plains Apache reached its climax. Two Spanish military expeditions sent to help the Apache failed to locate either Comanches or Ute.

In 1724 a critical nine-day battle was fought at El Gran Cerro del Fierro (Great Mountain of Iron), resulting in a major defeat for the Apache. Within a few years, the last Apache settlements along the upper Arkansas River had disappeared.
  
New Mexico historian Sherry Robinson doubts that the nine-day battle actually occurred. "The hatred was real but probably not the battle. The teller of this tale, decades after it allegedly occurred, was the Apache-hating Texas Governor [[Domingo Cabello y Robles]]. Lipan anthropologist Enrique Maestas dismisses the story as folklore or one of many battles between Apaches and Comanches. Anthropologist [[Morris Opler]] wrote that 'authenticated nine-day battles between tribes are not too common in American Indian annals. Yet this bit of recorded hearsay — far removed in time and space from the putative event— has been cited with all earnestness again and again.'" &lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Sherry. ''I Fought a Good Fight: A History of the Lipan Apaches'' (p. 56). University of North Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ute===

By 1730, the Comanches, still living north of the Arkansas, controlled the Texas Panhandle, central Texas and northeastern New Mexico. At about this time, the alliance between the Comanches and the Ute collapsed, marking the beginning of a fifty-year war. Their warfare was sporadic, and never reached the intensity of the struggle with the Apache. At first the Ute held their own, but as the full weight of the Comanche came to bear, they were forced to retreat from the plains into their mountain strongholds.

By 1749, the Ute were asking the Spanish for protection against Comanches, and in 1750, they entered into an alliance with the Jicarilla against their common enemy. Although the warfare between the Ute and Comanche continued until 1786, groups of the Kotsoteka felt confident enough during the 1740s to cross the Arkansas River and move into northeast New Mexico. Other Comanche groups followed after 1750 and settled on the perimeter of the Staked Plains of the Texas Panhandle. However, large numbers of Yamparika and Jupe remained north of the Arkansas until the early 19th century. As the Ute gave ground, the Comanche became dominant, and constituted a serious problem for New Mexico. During the late 1720s, groups of Plains Apache (friendly with the Spanish) had chosen to settle near the [[Rio Grande]] [[pueblo]]s rather than retreat farther south.

===New Mexico===
In 1725 the Spanish had noted that the Comanches were still using [[dog]]s for transport. By 1735 this was no longer the case, and the Comanches had more than enough horses for their own needs. However, they were now supplying them to other plains tribes through trade. The level of horse thefts by Comanches bothered the Spanish, but was bearable, and the trade with Comanches for [[American Bison|buffalo]] robes and slaves was important for the New Mexican economy, so the Spanish continued to trade, but a military expedition was dispatched in 1742 which unsuccessfully tried to stop the raids.

In the early 1720s the Comanche began trading with the French. After the French arranged a peace between the Comanches and [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]] in 1747 (reconfirmed in 1750), the exchange of French trade goods for Comanche horses expanded rapidly. In Texas the Comanche and Wichita defeated a Spanish expedition in 1759 in the [[Battle of the Two Villages]]. The Spanish in New Mexico also became alarmed, as the Comanches were now armed with French [[firearms]], which they paid for with horses and [[mule]]s stolen in New Mexico. Beginning with the Comanche raid on [[Pecos, New Mexico|Pecos]] in 1746, New Mexico was under siege. For the next forty years Comanche raids struck virtually every place in Spanish New Mexico. Both Taos (1760) and Pecos (1746, 1750, 1773, and 1775) were attacked by the Comanche. Some of the Comanche continued to trade peacefully, as the Comanche were not a unified tribe, but several independent divisions, each with the power to make war or peace.

Another Spanish military campaign against the Comanche in 1768 ended in frustration. The Comanche had blocked Spanish expansion to the east from New Mexico and prevented direct communication with the new Spanish settlements in Texas. The Spanish enjoyed their first military success against the Comanche in 1774 when a combined force of 600 soldiers, militia, and Pueblo Indians under [[Carlos Fernandez (soldier)|Carlos Fernandez]] attacked a Comanche village near Spanish Peaks ([[Raton, New Mexico]]) capturing over one hundred prisoners.

In 1779 the new governor of New Mexico, [[Juan Bautista de Anza]], organized a 500-man army with 200 Ute and Apache auxiliaries. His campaign captured a large Comanche village, and, in a later battle, killed Green Horn ([[Cuerno Verde]]), an important leader of the Comanche raiders. Raids dropped off noticeably but did not halt entirely. In the summer of 1785, De Anza let it be known that he was interested in making peace with the Comanches if they could agree on a single leader to represent them. The idea took root and received a major push when the Texas Comanche signed a peace treaty that autumn with Texas Governor [[Domingo Cabello]].

Among the New Mexico Comanche, the main opposition to peace was a parabio named White Bull ([[Toro Blanco]]). The Kotsoteka assassinated him and scattered his followers. A meeting of the Kotsoteka, Jupe, and Yamparika gave the power to make peace to [[Ecueracapa]] (Leather Cape). After two meetings at Pecos and another in a Comanche camp early in 1786, De Anza sent a signed treaty to Mexico City in July (ratified in October). De Anza also arranged a truce between the Ute and Comanche, while gaining a Comanche alliance with the Spanish against the Apache.

For many years, the Comanches remained at peace with New Mexico. Regular trade continued, and the New Mexicans who traded with Comanches became known as [[Comanchero]]s. This trade relationship lasted well into the 1870s, and persisted even when Comanches used weapons and [[steel]] provided by Comancheros to fight enemies living in Texas and northern [[Mexico]].

===Lakota, Cheyenne, Arikara, Pawnee, Kansa, and Osage===

Although many Comanches had moved south of the [[Arkansas]] after 1750, the Yamparika and Jupe bands remained to the north of the Arkansas. As late as 1805, the North Platte was still known as the Padouca Fork, and by this time, Padouca meant Comanche. As late as 1775, the Yamparika were still fighting the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] and [[Cheyenne]] near the Black Hills and raiding the [[Arikara]] villages along the [[Missouri River]]. Frequent wars also occurred with the Pawnee, [[Kaw (tribe)|Kansa]], and [[Osage Nation|Osage]], usually over horses. Comanches usually had more horses than they needed; Pawnee, Kansa, and Osage did not, and dealing with a Comanche horse trader could be frustrating. Often, the solution was to shoot the Comanche (having recently acquired guns from French traders on the Missouri River) and take the horse, and this meant war.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Comanches eventually learned how to minimize the advantage of single-shot firearms.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Meanwhile, the Pawnee and Osage had their own horses, many of them stolen from Comanches. A major war erupted in 1746 between Comanches and the Osage and Pawnee. In 1750 the Wichita arranged a truce between the Comanches and Pawnee.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The immediate effect was to allow the Pawnee and Comanches to ally and defeat the Osage in 1751. Afterwards, the Pawnee left Kansas and moved north to the Platte Valley in [[Nebraska]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} At about the same time the Comanches were moving south to the Staked Plains or concentrating closer to the Arkansas River. Despite the physical separation, Pawnees still traveled great distances to steal Comanche horses in Texas and New Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} They usually went out on foot and rode back, if successful. The result was more fighting between Comanches and Pawnee (1790–1793 and 1803).{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1832 the Comanches caught some Pawnee raiders still on foot near the Arkansas River, and killed every one of them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Although defeated by the Pawnee/Comanche alliance in 1751, the Osage continued to expand west during the last half of the 18th century. In the process, there were several wars and regular skirmishes with Comanches. The tall Osage usually got the worst of it when they fought Comanches, and lost another war in 1791. In 1797 Comanches destroyed an entire Osage village near the Kansas-[[Missouri]] border.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Kiowa===

From the times when they had lived along the upper Platte in Wyoming, Comanches had known and occasionally fought with the [[Kiowa]]. Before 1765, the Kiowa had lived in or near the Black Hills of [[South Dakota]], but soon after this they were displaced by Lakota migrating from east of the Missouri River.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The Kiowa were forced to move south, first to the upper Platte, then across it into Kansas, and finally the southern plains near the Arkansas River.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The move put them in competition for territory with Comanches.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

By 1780, their fighting with the Yamparika and Jupe had become serious, although each respected the other's bravery and fighting abilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Peace between the Kiowa and Yamparika sprang from a chance meeting (and near battle) at a Spanish trading post, probably around 1805.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} While the Spanish trader nervously tried to keep them separated, a Kiowa warrior volunteered to go with the Comanches and spend the summer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} When he returned unharmed in the autumn, the Kiowa and Yamparika met and made peace.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The peace process with other Comanche divisions probably took several more years, but in the end, a lasting alliance was made and never broken.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This also extended to the Kiowa's unusual friends, the Kiowa-Apache, who must have sounded a lot like Plains Apache to Comanches when they spoke.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Cheyenne and Arapaho===

The other major alliance for the Comanches was with the southern branches of the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]]. The area of the central plains vacated by the departure of the Pawnee and Comanches was soon occupied by groups of Cheyenne and Arapaho. At first these newcomers were harassed by just about everyone: Comanches, [[Kiowa]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], and [[Ute people|Ute]], all of whom still claimed the area as hunting territory. With so many enemies, the Cheyenne and Arapaho first formed their own alliance and fought all comers. One of the things that had attracted them south was trade: first with the Spanish in New Mexico, and then with the Americans.

==Raiding Mexico: 1779-1870==
''See: [[Comanche-Mexico Wars]]''

The Comanche raided south of the [[Rio Grande]] as early as 1779, their target being the Lipan Apache.  In the 1820s the long-term peace the Comanche had forged with Spanish colonies in New Mexico and Texas began to come apart.  The newly independent Mexican state could not defend its northern outposts, nor provide the Comanche the yearly gifts to which they were accustomed.  Beginning in 1826, the government of [[Nuevo Leon]] forbade its citizens in the northern portions of the state to travel in the countryside except in groups of at least 30 armed and mounted men.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, David B. Ëmbattled Borderland: Northern Nuevo León and the Indios Bárbaros, 1686-1870" ''The Southwestern Historical Quarterly'', Vol. 93, No. 2 (Oct 1991), pp 205-220&lt;/ref&gt;  Large scale raids began in 1840 and continued until 1870.  The Comanche and their allies, the [[Kiowa]], raided hundreds of miles south of the border, killing thousands of people and stealing hundreds of thousands of head of livestock. In 1848, traveler [[Josiah Gregg]] said that "the whole country from New Mexico to the borders of Durango is almost entirely depopulated.  The haciendas and ranchos have been mostly abandoned, and the people chiefly confined to the towns and cities."&lt;ref&gt;Hamalainen, Pekka, ''The Comanche Empire''. New Haven: Yale U Press, 2009, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas and the United States:1800-1850==
With the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, the Americans acquired territory that included a portion of Comancheria, but during the next twenty years, American penetration of the Great Plains focused on the fur trade of the [[Missouri River]]. On the southern Plains, French traders, now American citizens, continued their contacts with Wichita and Comanches. They were soon joined by an increasing number of Americans. Since much of the trade was conducted through the Wichita, Comanches remained distant and mysterious. American Indian agents in Louisiana were urged to make contacts with the "Hietans." {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Several incidents in Texas, including the killing of the son of a Yamparika chief in 1803, almost led to war, but the intervention of the western Comanches maintained peace. In both Texas and New Mexico, Comanches joined with the Spanish army to fight Apaches. The most noteworthy success was when they helped General Ugaldi crush the Lipan in southern Texas (1789–90). The Lipan were badly mauled, and retreated across the Rio Grande into northern Mexico, but this was not beyond the reach of Comanches who continued to attack them for many years.

During the last years of Spanish rule, Texas was in chaos. The [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Hidalgo]] [[Mexican War of Independence|Revolt]] (1810) was followed by an attempt by American and Mexican [[Filibuster (military)|adventurer]]s to [[Gutiérrez-Magee Expedition|seize Texas (1812–13)]]. American traders along the Red and [[Arkansas River]]s were trading guns to Comanches for horses, and this new market increased the tempo of Comanche raids in Texas. A Comanche chief, El Sordo, split from his own people in 1810 and gathered a combination of Comanches and Wichita to raid Texas and Mexico for horses. He was arrested during a visit to Béxar in 1811 and imprisoned in Coahuila. A large Comanche war party went to Béxar to demand an explanation, only to be confronted by 600 Spanish soldiers. There was no battle, but relations between Texas and the Comanches were never the same.

Spanish rule was replaced by that of the Mexican Republic in 1821. The following year [[José Francisco Ruiz|Francisco Ruiz]] arranged a truce with the Texas Comanche followed by a treaty of friendship signed in Mexico City in December. However, Mexico did not have the means to provide the gifts it had promised, and raiding resumed within two years. The Comanche peace with New Mexico disintegrated, and by 1825 there was war along the entire length of the Rio Grande. [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] was hit particularly hard. Treaties signed at Chihuahua and El Paso (1826 and 1834) with the Comanches did not halt the raids. In 1831, New Mexico temporarily suspended Comanchero trading and stopped the cibolero (New Mexico buffalo hunters), but this also had little effect.

After the end of Spanish rule of Mexico in 1821, Anglo-Americans began to settle in Texas, increasing contact with the Comanches and other tribes. The [[Santa Fe Trail]] opened that year, between [[Missouri]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. Contact between the anglos and Comanches was almost always friendly. There were exceptions, and as the most powerful tribe in the area, the Comanche were sometimes blamed for the actions of other tribes, such as the Wichitas, [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] and [[Osage Nation|Osage]].

During the 1830s, the major trading center on the southern Plains was [[Bent's Fort]], an American trading post on the [[Arkansas River]] in southeast [[Colorado]]. Although married to a Cheyenne woman, [[William Bent]] also traded with Kiowa and Yamparika, and became tired of the aggravation of keeping them apart when they came to trade. At his suggestion, the Cheyenne and Arapaho decided to meet with their adversaries, and a lasting peace was arranged between them. The "Great Peace of 1840", a landmark of southern Plains diplomacy, was cemented by the gift of large numbers of Yamparika and Kiowa horses to the Cheyenne and Arapaho.

In 1835 [[Sonora]] re-established its bounties for scalps. Chihuahua and [[Durango]] followed, but by the 1840s, Comanche war parties were ranging all over northern Mexico, some staying for as long as three months. Comanche war parties usually found easy victims in Texas, and when Americans began to settle there after 1821, Comanches did not distinguish between Anglo and Hispanic settlers. In 1833, [[Sam Houston]] arrived in Texas as a United States representative to arrange a treaty with the Texas Comanches. There were some meetings, but Mexican officials began to wonder what he was doing in their country arranging a treaty with their Comanches, and he was asked to leave. Soon after Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836, Houston became president of the new republic.

In May 1836 (less than three months after the [[Battle of the Alamo]]), over 500 Comanche and Kiowa warriors approached Fort Parker located 100 miles south of [[Dallas]].  Feigning a desire for peaceful trade, the Comanche initiated hostilities and killed five men and captured two women and three children in what became known as the [[Fort Parker massacre]]. A 9-year-old girl, [[Cynthia Ann Parker]], was captured and spent most of the rest of her life with the Comanche, marrying a Chief, [[Peta Nocona]], and giving birth to a son, [[Quanah Parker]], who would become the last Chief of the Comanches.  The remainder of the Fort Parker residents made a long trek to Fort Houston, ninety miles to the south.

In May 1838, Texas signed a treaty of peace and friendship with the Comanches, but the treat did not address the Comanches' main concern, a line between Comancheria and the white settlements. In the absence of an agreement on this, the whites steadily encroached, and the Comanches continued to raid. Houston wanted to set a line but was replaced in December by [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], a man determined to deal with problems with Indians by war.

In March 1840, a meeting between Texan officials and Comanche chiefs was held in [[San Antonio]], under a flag of truce, to negotiate the release of thirteen known kidnap victims, mainly women and children, taken by Comanches during the previous ten years of Mexican rule. The chiefs met with the commissioners in the council house, while the accompanying Comanches waited under guard in the Court House yard. The Comanches brought a single captive to the meeting, claiming that the others had been sold on to other tribes. This was disputed by the captive, Matilda Lockhart, who said that other prisoners were being held for later ransoms. The commissioners were outraged, and the negotiations collapsed. Soldiers surrounded the council house to take the Comanche leaders hostage for exchange with the white captives still held. The Comanche chiefs tried to escape, and the Texans killed them. Fierce fighting between the Texans and the Comanches outside soon spread, leading to the deaths of thirty-three Comanches and six Texans.

The Comanches were outraged by the killing of their chiefs under a flag of truce. Hundreds of warriors approached San Antonio screaming their rage, but remained just beyond rifle-range. Then, suddenly, they were gone, and the Texans thought the crisis had passed. The Comanches had left to plan retaliation. When they got back to their camps, they killed many of the white prisoners they were planning to exchange.

Thirty-two Comanches, mostly women, had been taken prisoner. Negotiations led to the release of five white children in exchange for five Comanches. The remaining prisoners were strictly guarded for a time, but the guard was later relaxed, and all eventually escaped.

In August, several hundred Comanche warriors raided the heart of eastern Texas. Homes were burned, hundreds were killed, and before they stopped, the Comanches had reached the [[Gulf of Mexico]] near [[Durango, Durango|Victoria]]. Then, loaded with loot, the war party began an atypical slow retreat to the north. Perhaps because of their numbers, the Comanches were overconfident, but this gave the Texans time to organize. With the help of Tonkawa scouts, Texas militia ambushed the main body in the [[Battle of Plum Creek]] at [[Lockhart, Texas]]. Abandoning most of their spoils, the surviving Comanches escaped north. Afterwards, they would never again give the Texans such an easy target.

The Anglos in Texas were Americans, and the only reasons they had not been annexed by the United States in 1836 were northern Congressional resistance to another slave state and a dispute with Mexico over the southern boundary of Texas. While waiting for admission, the Texans in 1839 expelled the [[Cherokee]], [[Shawnee]], and most of the [[Lenape|Delaware]] that the Mexican government had encouraged to settle in eastern Texas to keep Americans out in the first place. Houston was re-elected president and set about repairing the damage done by Lamar's administration. He not only had to deal with Comanches, but a second war with Mexico (1841–42).

Without resources for a standing army, Texas created small ranger companies mounted on fast horses to pursue and fight Comanches on their own terms. Eventually armed with the first [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] revolvers, the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] enjoyed considerable success against Comanches during the 1840s. However, Houston wanted peace, not war, and he was trusted by Comanches.

A treaty between the Republic of Texas and Texas Comanches was signed October, 1845 and ratified in December. It established a line of trading houses which would later function as the line between Texas and Comancheria, but this deliberately vague definition would be the source of future troubles. Spain had been an ally of the Americans for much of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], but after the rebel triumph in 1783, had become concerned about the territorial ambitions of the new United States. Its fears proved justified as American settlement swept across the [[Appalachians]] into the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys. To supply horses and mules for these immigrants, American traders were soon looking to the southern plains and were dealing with Comanches and Wichita.

[[John Sibley (doctor)|Dr. John Sibley]] had the first official meeting with a Comanche "principal chief" in 1807 at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]]. He gave presents, and later licensed an American trader for them. Other licenses followed. One of his successors, John Jamison, had other visits from Comanche chiefs in 1816 and 1817. These contacts and trading licenses were viewed with alarm in Spanish Texas. The traders not only sold firearms to Comanches and Wichitas, but provided a ready market for stolen horses and mules.

American problems with Comanches began during the 1820s with the relocation of tribes from east of the [[Mississippi River]] to Kansas and Oklahoma. The problem at first was not much with Comanches, but with the Osage, whose territory was directly affected. To defend themselves against the Osage, the Delaware, Fox, Sauk, Cherokee and others began to consider alliances with Comanches and other Plains tribes. However, when the newcomers began hunting west of their new homes, they came into conflict with Comanches. To preclude the possibility widespread warfare, Colonel Henry Dodge led a large force of dragoons from Fort Gibson to western Oklahoma during the summer of 1835 as a show of force and to meet the Comanches. In August, the Hois (with the Wichita) signed the Camp Holmes Treaty with American representatives, pledging peace and friendship with the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Quapaw]], [[Seneca tribe|Seneca]], [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Creek (people)|Creek]]. The treaty also reflected another American concern and guaranteed safe passage on the Santa Fé trail.

Within a year the Comanches regretted this agreement, and had destroyed their copy. When the United States annexed Texas in 1846, it inherited its problem with Comanche raiding and a boundary line between the settlements and Comancheria. An immediate step by the United States was to announce its authority and sign a treaty with the Comanches and other Texas tribes to replace the Texas treaty of the previous year. This was done in May 1846 on the upper [[Brazos River]] (Butler-Lewis Treaty). Signed by the Penateka/Hois Comanches (also [[Hainai|Ioni]], [[Nadaco|Anadarko]], [[Caddo]], [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apache]], [[Wichita people|Wichita]], and [[Waco people|Waco]]), the treaty promised, besides peace and friendship, trading posts, a visit by a Comanche delegation to Washington, D.C., and a one-time payment of $18,000 in goods. A boundary line was alluded to, but not defined.

The Comanche delegation went east shortly afterwards and met President [[James K. Polk]], but with the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] just beginning, Congress had more important concerns, and the Senate adjourned without ratifying the treaty. By the time the treaty was amended and ratified in March 1847, the Comanches were certain they had been betrayed. War was averted only when traders and Indian agents advanced credit to send part of the promised gifts. When the amendments were read to the Comanches, the meeting almost ended, but eventually they agreed to the changes. Additional money was appropriated for more gifts, but once again, a boundary line was never established.

Meanwhile, there was a serious question over whose responsibility it was to deal with the Texas tribes, the federal or the state government. The problem was not settled until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In the interim, policy was set by both, and this was confusing, so the 1846 peace treaty brought very little peace to Texas.

In May 1847, Texas allowed the German settlers near Fredericksburg and New Braunfels to make their own treaty with the Texas Comanches. In exchange for land, the Germans promised a trading post and gifts. Unfortunately, the Germans not only encroached beyond the agreed boundary, but were slow to pay, and in response the Comanches made raids. A boundary line was eventually set by the Texas governor but was to be enforced by the American army which had taken over the line of Texas forts on the frontier. Army commanders felt they had no authority to enforce state laws, and meanwhile, Texas continued to operate its ranger companies, which were not under federal control, as military units. The Rangers did nothing to prevent encroachment on Comanche lands but would retaliate if the new settlements beyond the line were attacked. To make matters worse, only the Penateka had signed the 1846 treaty. The Nokoni, Tenawa, and other Comanches did not consider themselves bound by the agreement and continued to raid in Texas.

On the other side of Comancheria, many things had changed with the beginning of the Mexican War in 1846. An American army under General [[Stephen W. Kearny]] seized Santa Fé and moved on to [[California]]. The Santa Fé Trail became a heavily-travelled military supply route, and forts were built to protect it. Five companies of [[Missouri]] volunteers were sent to garrison these posts during the summer of 1847 and quickly became engaged in fights with Plains Indians. At least one of these at Fort Mann involved the Pawnee. In the other cases, the fights were probably with [[Kiowa]], [[Cheyenne]], and [[Arapaho]], and the amount of Comanche involvement is uncertain.

The first part of 1848 was relatively calm, and during that year, Texas Comanches even provided guides for the survey of the route of the new Butterfield (California) trail across southern Texas to El Paso and California. The calm changed suddenly with the [[California Gold Rush]]. As thousands of gold-seekers raced west, they needed horses, and the Comanches moved to meet this new demand. Horse raids increased in Texas, but the major target was northern Mexico. Comanche raids struck deep into [[Coahuila]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Sonora]], and [[Durango]], reaching their peak during 1852 when they struck [[Tepic]] in [[Jalisco]], {{convert|700|mi|km}} south of the border at El Paso. To protect the immigrant routes across the plains, the United States called the "Peace on the Plains" conference at [[Fort Laramie]] ([[Wyoming]]) in 1851. This was an attempt to end, or at least limit, intertribal warfare by defining boundaries between tribal territories.

Almost every plains tribe attended and signed the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|1851 Fort Laramie Treaty]], and received gifts. The Comanches and Kiowa did not attend. A [[smallpox]] epidemic had broken out in their villages, and there was a deep distrust of the northern tribes. Since the Santa Fé Trail was a vital route, it was essential to reach an agreement with them. As the southern Plains tribes gathered around [[Fort Atkinson (Nebraska)|Fort Atkinson]] for the distribution of the annuities from the Fort Laramie treaty, large groups of Kiowa and Comanches also came, and they were not in a good mood.

Eventually, 6,000 to 9,000 Indians were gathered in the vicinity, and the situation was becoming dangerous. The American agent took it upon himself to distribute $9,000 in gifts to the Comanches and Kiowa, and in 1853 the Kiowa and Yamparika signed their own treaty at Fort Atkinson. In return for safe passage and a promise to stop raiding in Mexico, the United States agreed to pay those tribes $18,000 per year for ten years.

==United States: 1850-1900==

There were several reasons the Comanches and [[Kiowa]]s had been angry in 1852. The first was they had recently been devastated by epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[cholera]]. Their first experience with smallpox had been an epidemic (1780–81) so severe that it caused the disappearance of some Comanche divisions. The Comanche were hit again by smallpox during the winter of 1816-17. The wave of immigration from the [[California Gold Rush]] first brought smallpox (1848) and then cholera (1849) to the [[Great Plains]]. These were devastating to every [[Plains Indians|plains tribe]], but especially to the Comanches and Kiowa. The government census estimated a drop in the Comanches' 1849 population of 20,000 to 12,000 by 1851, and the Comanches never recovered from this loss. Smallpox struck again from [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] during 1862 and is believed to have been equally devastating. Cholera returned in 1867. By 1870, the Comanches numbered less than 8,000, and their numbers were still dropping rapidly.

The Comanches kept their promise for safe passage on the [[Santa Fe Trail]], but remained angry about events in [[Texas]]. White settlement was steadily taking more and more of [[Comancheria]], and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] were still attacking them. As the frontier advanced, the American army had built a new line of forts, followed by a third line. At first these had been manned by infantry, and the Comanche simply by-passed them. Within a few years, the infantry was replaced by new light-cavalry regiments. In all, it took three lines of forts and most of the army's pre-Civil War strength to keep the Comanches out of Texas.

Even more aggravating from the Comanches' point of view were posts like [[Fort Stockton, Texas|Fort Stockton]] at Comanche Springs, which were intended to block the "Great Comanche War Trail" leading to northern Mexico. The Americans were required by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] to prevent raids into Mexico. Between 1848 and 1853, Mexico filed 366 separate claims for Comanche and Apache raids originating from north of the border.

Not all efforts to deal with the Texas Comanches were limited to military force. In 1854 the Texas legislature provided 23,000 acres (93&amp;nbsp;km²) for the United States to established three reservations on the upper [[Brazos River]] for the Texas tribes. Besides Caddo, Delaware, Wichita, and Tonkawa, the United States Indian agent, [[Robert Neighbors]], convinced some Penateka Comanche to move to these locations. [[Throckmorton County, Texas|Camp Cooper]] (commanded in 1856 by LTC [[Robert E. Lee]]) was built nearby. Almost immediately, local settlers began to accuse the reservation tribes of stealing horses and other depredations. Many of these accusations were either exaggerations, lies, or referred to raids by Comanches from the [[Llano Estacado|Staked Plains]]. The situation became dangerous in 1858 after the army abandoned Camp Cooper.

During the spring of 1859, a mob of 250 settlers attacked the reservation, but were repulsed. As the United States Indian Agent, Robert Neighbors was hated by local Texans. Rather than fight them, he arranged to close the reservations and move the residents to [[Indian Territory]]. The peaceful Penateka were forced to leave Texas, along with tribes that had never fought Texans, including the Tonkawa, Caddo, and Delaware, who had served loyally as scouts for the Texas Rangers.

After leaving his charges at the new Wichita agency at Anadarko, Neighbors started back to his home in Texas. He never made it. Near Belknap, Texas he was ambushed and shot in the back.

After its victory against the Brazos reservation, Texas urged the army to make greater efforts against Comanches beyond its borders. Texas Rangers had discovered that Kiowa and Comanches were using the Indian Territory as a sanctuary from which to raid in Texas and then elude pursuit.

Between 1858 and 1860, the army's new light-cavalry regiments were used for an offensive against Comanches in Oklahoma. In May, 1858 Colonel John Ford's Texas Rangers, ignoring the state-line, attacked a Comanche village on Little Robe Creek. Three months later his Caddo, Delaware, and Tonkawa scouts were expelled from Texas as undesirables. In October, 1858 Captain [[Earl Van Dorn]] attacked a Comanche village at Rush Springs killing 83. The following May, Van Dorn struck the Comanches at Crooked Creek in [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]].

The result of this offensive by the army and Rangers was to cause trouble elsewhere. Attacked from Texas, Comanches and Kiowa separated into small bands and moved north near the [[Santa Fé Trail]]. In response to increased Indian attacks on the trail during the summer of 1860, three columns of cavalry were sent into the area on a [[punitive expedition]]. In July, the command of Captain [[Samuel D. Sturgis]] made a major contact. After an eight-day chase, he fought a battle with [[Kiowa]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho]], and, presumably, some Comanches.

When federal soldiers withdrew east at the beginning of the Civil War, [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]] replaced them. [[Albert Pike]], the Confederate Indian agent, signed two treaties with Comanches in August, 1861; one with the Penateka, and a second with the Nokoni, Yamparika, Tenawa, and Kotsoteka. Besides the usual promises of peace and friendship, the Comanches were promised a large amount of goods and services. Because the Confederacy needed every cent it had to fight the war, the Comanches never received what was promised.

When Texas sent its men east to fight for the Confederacy, most of the old federal army posts were abandoned. With the frontier defenseless and the Confederate treaty promises unfulfilled, Comanches began raids intended to drive settlement back. The Texas frontier retreated over {{convert|100|mi|km}} during the Civil War, and northern Mexico was hit by a new wave of Comanche raids.

The war also provided the Comanches with an opportunity to seek revenge against the Tonkawa. and not just for their service as scouts with the Texas Rangers; the Texas Comanches had a special hatred for the Tonkawa ever since they had killed and eaten the brother of one of their chiefs. The Comanches were not a gentle people, but they found cannibalism repulsive.

After Texas Indian agents had taken over administration of the Wichita Agency in Oklahoma, Comanches participated in an attack on the agency (October, 1862) by pro-Union Delaware and Shawnee from Kansas. When it was over, 300 Tonkawa had been massacred. The survivors crossed the Red River and settled near Fort Griffin. In the years following, they would exact their revenge by serving as army scouts against the Comanches.

After 1861 Comanches, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Arapaho almost succeeded in closing the Santa Fé Trail. When federal officials at [[Fort Lyon|Fort Wise]] learned the Comanches had signed treaties with the Confederacy, they were certain that they had become hostile. While the rest of the nation was bleeding itself to death on eastern battlefields, the ranks of the Union army on the frontier were filled with men who were unemployed, did not wish to fight in the war, and hated Indians. By the fall of 1863, the performance of these "soldiers" had provoked a general alliance between the [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Arapaho]], [[Kiowa]], Comanches, and Kiowa-Apache.

In the autumn of 1864, Colonel [[Kit Carson]] was sent at the head of a column from [[Fort Bascom]], [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] into the [[Llano Estacado|Staked Plains]] to chastise the Comanches and Kiowa. His [[Jicarilla Apache|Jicarilla]] and [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] scouts located their camps on November 24. Carson had found more Comanches and Kiowa than he could chastise, and the [[First Battle of Adobe Walls]] came very close to being "Carson's Last Stand." Only the skillful use of artillery kept the Yamparika and Kiowa from massing and overrunning his position. Afterwards, Carson returned to New Mexico and left the chastising of Comanches to others.

In the final days of the Civil War, the Confederacy made a final attempt to exploit the hostility of the plains tribes that had been provoked by the federal volunteers. In May, 1865 a council was held on the [[Washita River]] in western Oklahoma. It was well attended by the Comanches and other tribes, but [[Robert E. Lee]] had surrendered in Virginia two-weeks previously, and the Confederacy was finished.

That summer, while the Union celebrated its victory, the plains were in turmoil. The Santa Fé and Overland trails were closed, and virtually every plains tribe was at war with the United States. As federal troops began to re-occupy their posts in Texas, the Great Plains and [[Indian Territory]], government commissioners met with the plains tribes in October on the [[Little Arkansas River]] near Wichita to arrange a peace. The Little Arkansas Treaty gave the Comanches and Kiowa western Oklahoma, the entire [[Texas Panhandle]], and promised annuities of $15 per person for forty years.

Of the Comanche divisions, only the Yamparika, Nokoni, Penateka, and Tenewa had taken part in the agreement; the Kwahada and Kotsoteka had not. The Kiowa-Apache did not sign the Comanche-Kiowa version but asked to be included under the Cheyenne-Arapaho treaty. This served as an indication of how unstable the situation was. When the annuities arrived, there was widespread disappointment. The Comanches had expected guns, ammunition, and quality goods; what they got were rotten civil war rations and cheap blankets that fell apart in the rain. The peace was soon violated by both sides, and war resumed for another two years. It was a bitter struggle, and General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William Sherman]] finally ordered the army not to pay ransom for white captives held by Indians to avoid giving them incentive for further kidnappings.

While the army was making its own plans to deal with the hostiles by force, the federal government decided to make one final effort to resolve the conflict through treaty. The result was a milestone peace conference held at Medicine Lodge Creek in southern [[Kansas]] (October, 1867). In exchange for a wagon train of gifts brought by the commissioners and the payment of annual annuities, the Comanches and Kiowa signed the Medicine Lodge Treaty exchanging Comancheria for a 3 million acre (12,000&amp;nbsp;km²) reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. The arrangement did not work as intended. Because of an outbreak of cholera in their camps, the Kwahada neither attended the conference nor signed the treaty. Afterwards, they did not consider themselves bound by the Medicine Lodge Treaty, and chose to stay on the Staked Plains.

Most of the other Comanches moved to the vicinity of [[Fort Cobb, Oklahoma|Fort Cobb]] and remained on the reservation for the winter, but since the treaty was not yet ratified, there was no money to pay for rations. After a hungry winter, most of the Comanches and Kiowa left Fort Cobb, and returned to the plains during the summer of 1868. Once again raids were made into Texas and Kansas, and the new reservation was used as a sanctuary to prevent pursuit by the army. Even [[Fort Dodge, Kansas|Fort Dodge]] was attacked, and its horses stolen. The frustrated Indian agent at Fort Cobb resigned and went east, leaving the mess in the hands of his assistant.

The treaty was ratified in July, and funds were made available, but the responsibility for the administration of annuities was placed with the army. After  all tribes were ordered to report to Fort Cobb or be considered hostile, General [[Philip Sheridan]] set plans in motion for the winter campaign of 1868-69 against the hostiles in western Oklahoma and the Staked Plains. LTC [[George Custer]] and the [[7th Cavalry Regiment|7th Cavalry]] attacked a southern Cheyenne village on the [[Battle of Washita River|Washita River]] in November, and Major Andrew Evans struck a Comanche village at Soldiers Spring on Christmas Day. Afterwards, most of the Comanches and other tribes still on the plains returned to the agencies.

In March, 1869 the Comanche-Kiowa agency was relocated to [[Fort Sill]] and the Cheyenne-Arapaho agency to [[El Reno, Oklahoma|Darlington]]. Only the Kwahada were still on the Staked Plains. The Kiowa and other Comanches were on the reservation, but by the fall of 1869 small war parties were occasionally leaving to raid in Texas. During one of these raids near [[Jacksboro, Texas|Jacksboro]] (May, 1871), the Kiowa almost killed [[William Sherman]], commanding general of the American army. "Great Warrior" Sherman was conducting an inspection tour of western posts, when a Kiowa war party noticed his lone ambulance and small escort. They chose instead to attack a nearby supply train. When Sherman learned of his narrow escape, he was furious and proceeded directly to Fort Sill. When he discovered the Kiowa chiefs were openly bragging about the latest raid, he ordered their arrest and sent them to Texas for trial. After a Texas court sentenced them to life imprisonment, the Comanches and Kiowa launched a series of retaliatory raids that killed more than 20 Texans in 1872. At the same time, Texas civilians stole 1,900 horses from the tribes at Fort Sill.

Meanwhile, the army in Texas was trying to deal with the raids from the reservation and massive thefts of Texas cattle by the Kwahada for sale to [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] [[Comanchero]]s. In October, 1871 a raid led by [[Quanah Parker]] stole seventy horses from the army at Rock Station. The commanding officer, Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]], did not take this lightly. For the next two years, Mackenzie and his black cavalry troopers ranged the Staked Plains chasing the Kwahada. The campaign ended with an attack on a Comanche village at McClellan Creek (September, 1872). Mackenzie captured 130 women and children and held them hostage at [[Fort Concho]]. This slowed the raiding while the Comanches negotiated for their release. In April, 1873 they were released and sent under escort to Fort Sill. A detour had to be made around Jacksboro to prevent a riot. At the request of the Secretary of the Interior, Texas Governor [[Edmund J. Davis]] paroled the Kiowa chiefs in October after they had served only two years on the condition that the raiding stop. The Kiowa were grateful, but an occasional war party still slipped off the reservation, crossed the Red River, and headed south into Texas.

===Buffalo hunting===
Meanwhile, the [[Bison hunting#19th century bison hunts and near extinction|great slaughter of the plains buffalo]] had begun. Between 1865 and 1875, the number of [[American bison|buffalo]] on the [[Great Plains]] fell from fifteen million to less than one million. Unofficially sanctioned by army commanders who issued free ammunition to hunters, it destroyed the basis for the [[Plains Indians|plains tribes]]' way of life. During the winter of 1873-74, [[Cheyenne]] hunters returned to the Darlington agency to report that [[Kansas]] buffalo hunters were destroying the southern buffalo herds. As this news spread, violence erupted at the Darlington and Wichita agencies, which had to be put down by troops. Afterwards, large groups of Cheyenne left the reservation and headed for the plains. At first the Comanches and [[Kiowa]] thought the Cheyenne were mistaken, but their story of the plains littered with dead buffalo was eventually confirmed.

===Second Battle of Adobe Walls===
In December, the government decided to deal harshly with the [[Kiowa]] and Comanches to end the raids in [[Texas]]. The agent at [[Fort Sill]] was ordered to limit rations and suspend the distribution of ammunition. A sense of general panic set in, and by May several groups of Comanches and Kiowa had left the reservation. At first they were uncertain what to do. Several Comanches had recently been killed in Texas by [[Tonkawa]] scouts, and some of the first thoughts were of revenge. However, the agent had learned of their departure and purpose and had alerted the army.

After some discussion, a decision was made to attack the buffalo hunters on the Staked Plains. In June, 1874 a large Comanche-Cheyenne war party attacked twenty-three buffalo hunters camped in the [[Texas Panhandle]] at the site of Carson's 1864 battle at Adobe Walls. The [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls]] marked the beginning of the Buffalo War (or [[Red River War]]) (1874–75), the last great Indian war on the southern plains. After the initial rush failed, the Comanches came under fire from the hunters' long-range buffalo guns and were forced to retire. The uprising spread rapidly as more warriors left the agencies and joined the hostiles on the Staked Plains. To halt this, soldiers began to disarm the Comanches and Kiowa who had remained on the agencies. In August, groups of Penateka were peacefully drawing rations at the Wichita agency when soldiers stationed at the agency demanded they surrender their weapons. When this was refused, a fight broke out and the Comanches fled, but the agency was under siege for the next two days until it was relieved by troops from Fort Sill.

By September only 500 Kiowa and Comanche were still on the reservation; the others were out on the Staked Plains. That same month the army began to move. Three converging columns moved into the heart of the Staked Plains. Trapped between them, the Comanches, Kiowa, and Cheyenne had little rest. Colonel [[Nelson A. Miles]]' column made the first contact and defeated a group of Cheyenne near [[McClellan Creek]]. For the Comanches, Cheyenne, and Kiowa, the major blow occurred when Mackenzie located a mixed camp hidden in [[Palo Duro Canyon]] (September 26–27). After driving off the warriors during [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon|a short battle]] on September 28, he burned the camp and killed 2,000 captured horses.

There were few other encounters, but the relentless pressure and pursuit throughout the fall and winter had its effect. Starving, the remaining Comanches, Kiowa, and Cheyenne began to return to the agencies, mostly on foot because they had been forced to eat their horses. By December there were 900 on the Fort Sill reservation. In April, 200 Kwahada, who had never submitted, surrendered at Fort Sill. In June the last 400 Kwahada, including [[Isatai'i]] and [[Quanah Parker]], surrendered. The war was over. Mackenzie disposed of many of the Comanche and Kiowa horses. After giving 100 to his Tonkawa scouts, he sold 1,600 horses and mules for $22,000. The proceeds were used to buy sheep and goats for his former enemies.

By 1879, the buffalo were gone. That year, the Kiowa-Comanche and Wichita agencies were merged into a single agency. Always pragmatic, the Comanches adjusted, but in typical Comanche style. Taking advantage of his Texas heritage, Quanah Parker emerged as an important Comanche leader. He collected tolls on cattle herds that used the [[Chisholm Trail]] to cross the reservation and sold [[grazing rights]] to nearby Texas ranchers. Few argued with him about price. With his five wives he moved into a large comfortable house. It had eight large stars painted on the roof to insure he had more stars than any army general. He was elected a sheriff and served as a tribal judge. By the time he rode in [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s inaugural parade in 1905, Quanah had amassed 100 horses, 1,000 cattle, and {{convert|250|acre|km2}} of cultivated farmland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1863">'''Cratippus''' ({{lang-grc|Κράτιππος}}; fl. c. 375 BC) was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[historian]]. There are only three or four references to him in ancient literature, and his importance derives from his being identified by several scholars (e.g. [[Friedrich Blass|Blass]]) with the author of the historical fragment discovered by Grenfell and Hunt. The fragment itself was published in [[Oxyrhyncus|''Oxyrhynchus Papyri'']], vol. v, and is known as the ''[[Hellenica Oxyrhynchia]]''. It may be regarded as a fairly certain inference from a passage in [[Plutarch]] (''{{lang|la|De Gloria Atheniensium}}'', p.&amp;nbsp;345 E, ed. Bernardakis, ii. p.&amp;nbsp;455) that he was an [[Athens|Athenian]] writer, intermediate in date between [[Thucydides]] and [[Xenophon]], and that his work continued the narrative of Thucydides, from the point at which the latter historian stopped (410 BC) down to the [[Battle of Cnidus]].

A recent edition of the surviving papyrus fragments is V. Bartoletti, ''Hellenica Oxyrhynchia'' (Leipzig, 1959), which includes a bibliography.

This is a '''list of movies featuring recognizable dance forms''', demonstrating them, shedding light on their origin, or being the base of a plot.

This article is not about [[Dance film]] or [[Dance for camera]] which are separate genres. It is also not about [[Musical film]]s, although they often contain a significant amount of dancing. However, they are a specific form of art in itself, therefore their listings generally pertain to the articles specifically related to the topic of musicals. This by no means prevents musicals from being included here, but they are required to meet the outlined criteria. [[Fred Astaire]]'s and [[Gene Kelly]]'s filmographies may significantly contribute to these lists.

[[File:Coast Garter Snake.jpg|thumb|[[Garter snake]] is an example of escape and radiate coevolution.{{why|date=April 2017}}]]
'''Escape and radiate coevolution''' is a multistep process that hypothesizes that an organism under constraints from other organisms will develop new defenses, allowing it to "escape" and then "radiate" into differing species. After a novel defense has been acquired, an organism is able to escape predation and rapidly multiply into new species because of relaxed selective pressure. There are many possible mechanisms available varying between different types of organisms, however they must be novel in order for escape to allow for radiation. This theory applies to predator-prey associations, but is most often applied to plant-herbivore associations.

This form of [[coevolution]] can be complex but is essential to understanding the vast biological diversity among organisms today. Out of the many forms of coevolution, escape and radiate is most likely responsible for providing the most diversity. This is due to the nature of the "evolutionary arms race" and the continuous cycle of counter adaptations. It is a relatively new field of study and is rapidly gaining credibility. To date, there has not been a formal study published specifically for escape and radiate coevolution.

== Origin of Theory ==

This theory originated in a paper by Ehrlich and Raven, 1964, "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution".&lt;ref name=EhrlichRaven1964/&gt; It outlined and laid the foundations of the concept. However, the term "escape and radiate" was not coined until Thompson's 1989 "Concepts of Coevolution".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The theory has not yet been fully analyzed, however, as since its origins it has grown in importance among evolutionary biologists and botanists.

== Escape ==

In order for an organism to "escape", and then radiate into varying species it needs a mechanism to escape. These defense mechanisms vary widely and differ for different types of organisms. Plants use chemical defenses in the form of secondary metabolites or [[allelochemicals]]. These allelochemicals inhibit the growth, behavior, and health of herbivores, allowing plants to escape.&lt;ref&gt;Haig, Terry. "Allelochemicals in plants." Allelopathy in Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry. Springer New York, 2008. 63-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a plant allelochemical are alkaloids that can inhibit protein synthesis in herbivores. Other forms of plant defense include mechanical defenses such as [[Thigmonastic movements|thigmonasty movements]] which have the plant leaves close in response to tactile stimulation. Indirect mechanisms plant include shedding of plant leaves so less leaves are available which deters herbivores, growth in locations in that are difficult to reach, and even mimicry. For organisms other than plants, examples of defense mechanisms allowing for escape include camouflage, [[aposematism]],&lt;ref&gt;Mappes, Johanna, Nicola Marples, and John A. Endler. "The complex business of survival by aposematism." Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20.11 (2005): 598-603.&lt;/ref&gt; heightened senses and physical capabilities, and even defensive behaviors such as feigning death. An example of an organism using one of these defense mechanisms is the [[granular poison frog]] which defends itself through aposematism. It is important to understand that in order for escape and radiate coevolution to occur, it is necessary that the developed defense is novel rather than previously established.

Induced defense stemming from adaptive [[phenotypic plasticity]] may help a plant defend itself against multiple enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Anurag A. "Induced plant defense: evolution of induction and adaptive phenotypic plasticity." Inducible plant defenses against pathogens and herbivores: biochemistry, ecology, and agriculture. American Phytopathological Society Press, St. Paul, MN (1999): 251-268.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenotypic plasticity occurs when an organism undergoes an environmental change forcing a change altering its behavior, physiology, etc. These induced defenses allow for an organism to escape.

== Radiate ==

Radiation is the evolutionary process of diversification of a single species into multiple forms. It includes the physiological and ecological diversity within a rapidly multiplying lineage.&lt;ref&gt;Schluter, Dolph. The ecology of adaptive radiation. Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of radiation including adaptive, concordant, and discordant radiation however escape and radiate coevolution does not always follow those specific types.

This eventually leads to the question, why does escape allow for radiation?  Once a novel defense has been acquired, the attacking organism which had evolved adaptations that allowed it to predate is now up against a new defense that it has not yet been evolved to encounter. This gives the defending organism the advantage, and therefore time to rapidly multiply unopposed by the previously attacking organism. This ultimately leads to the physiological and ecological diversity within the rapidly multiplying lineage, hence radiation.

== Importance ==

A full study analyzing the effects of escape and radiate coevolution has not yet been completed which hinders knowing how applicable this form of coevolution could be to other areas of study, or global concerns, only hypotheses of its effects can be made. Improved agriculture, conservation, biological diversity, and epidemiology are just some of the areas that could potentially be helped through the study of coevolution and its specific hypotheses such as escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "The raw material for coevolution." Oikos (1999): 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
A theory as to why we see such vast biological diversity today may be because of escape and radiate coevolution. After the organism escapes, it then radiates into multiple species, and spreads geographically. Evidence of escape and radiate coevolution can be seen through the starburst effect in plant and herbivore [[clades]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "Coevolution: the geographic mosaic of coevolutionary arms races." Current Biology 15.24 (2005): R992-R994.&lt;/ref&gt; When analyzing clades of predator-prey associations, although it varies, the starburst effect is a good indicator that escape and radiate coevolution may be occurring. Eventually this cycle must come to an end because adaptations that  entail costs (allocation of resources, vulnerability to other predators) that at some point outweigh their benefits.&lt;ref&gt;"Coevolution." Interactions Among Species. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 Nov. 1993. &lt;http://neko.bio.utk.edu/~ijuric/EEB460_&lt;/ref&gt;
Escape and radiate coevolution may support parallel [[cladogenesis]], wherein plant and herbivore [[phylogenies]] might match with ancestral insects exploiting ancestral plants. This is significant because it allows researchers to hypothesize about the relationships between ancestral organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Insect Ecology: Behavior, Populations and Communities By R. F. Denno, M. D. Eubanks&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, there have not yet been any known examples specifically involving escape and radiate coevolution being used for hypothesizing ancestral relationships.

Many times the organism that has "escaped" continuously undergoes selective pressure because the predator it has escaped from evolves to create another adaptation in response, causing the process to continue. These "offensive" traits developed by predators range widely. For example, herbivores can develop an adaptation that allows for improved detoxification which allow to overcome plant defenses, thus causing escape and radiate coevolution to continue. Often the term "evolutionary arms race" is used to illustrate the idea that continuous evolution is needed to maintain the same relative fitness while the two species are coevolving. This idea also ties in with the [[Red Queen hypothesis]]. Counter adaptations among two organisms through escape and radiate coevolution is a major driving force behind diversity.

Escape and radiate coevolution produces much more biological variation than other evolutionary mechanisms. For instance, cospeciation is important for diversity amongst species that share a symbiotic relationship, however this does not create nearly as much diversity in comparison to reciprocal evolutionary change due to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John N. "Coevolution." eLS (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
Evidence of rapid diversification following a novel adaptation is shown through the evolution of resin and latex canal tubes in 16 different lineages of plants. Plants with resin or latex canals can easily defend themselves against insect herbivores. When lineages of canal bearing plants are compared to the lineages of canal free plants, it is apparent that canal bearing plants are far more diverse, supporting escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Brian D., David E. Dussourd, and Charles Mitter. "Escalation of plant defense: do latex and resin canals spur plant diversification?." American Naturalist (1991): 881-900.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associations ==

=== Plant-herbivore ===
[[File:Monarch In May.jpg|592 KBpx|thumb|right|Erlich and Raven's Classic butterfly model]]

The most popular examples of escape and radiate coevolution are of plant-herbivore associations. The most classic example is of butterflies and plants outlined in Ehrlich and Raven's original paper, "Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution.". Erlich and Raven found in 1964 that hostplants for butterflies had a wide range of chemical defenses, allowing them to escape herbivory. Butterflies who developed novel counter detoxification mechanisms against the hostplants chemical defenses were able to utilize the hostplant resources.&lt;ref name=EhrlichRaven1964&gt;Ehrlich, P. R., &amp; Raven, P. H. (1964). Butterflies and plants: a study in coevolution. Evolution, 586-608.&lt;/ref&gt;  The process of stepwise adaptation and counteradaptation among the butterflies and hostplants is continuous and creates vast diversity.

Tropical trees may also escape and defend themselves. Trees growing in high light were predicted to have few chemical defenses, but rapid synchronous leaf expansion and low leaf nutritional quality during expansion. Species growing in low light have high levels of different chemical defenses, poor nutritional quality and asynchronous leaf expansion. Depending on the level of light the trees were growing in influenced the type of defenses they obtained, either chemical or through leaf expansion. The trees exposed to less light developed various chemicals to defend themselves against herbivores, a defense not utilizing light. This study was significant because it illustrates the separation between defenses and their relationship with an organism escaping and radiating into other species. Development of novel defenses does not necessarily imply that escape is possible for a species of plant if herbivores are adapting at a faster rate.&lt;ref&gt;Kursar, Thomas A., and Phyllis D. Coley. "Convergence in defense syndromes of young leaves in tropical rainforests." Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 31.8 (2003): 929-949.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Asclepiascommon.JPG|thumb|[[Common milkweed]] plant bears [[latex]] tubes to ward off herbivores.]]

Milkweed plants contain [[latex]]-filled canals which deter insect herbivores. Latex is toxic for small herbivores because it disrupts sodium and potassium levels. This has allowed for milkweeds to "escape" and become extremely diverse. There are over 100 different species of milkweeds which shows how diverse the plant is, with escape and radiate coevolution playing a very large role in creating such a high number of species.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Anurag A. "Natural selection on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) by a community of specialized insect herbivores." Evolutionary Ecology Research 7.5 (2005): 651.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fish-water flea ===

Key adaptations are adaptations that allow a group of organisms to diversify. ''Daphnia lumholtzi'' is a water flea that is able to form rigid head spines in response to chemicals released when fish are present. These phenotypically plastic traits serve as an induced defense against these predators. A study showed that ''Daphnia pulicaria'' is competitively superior to ''D. lumholtzi'' in the absence of predators. However, in the presence of fish predation the invasive species formed its defenses and became the dominant water flea in the region. This switch in dominance suggests that the induced defense against fish predation could represent a key adaptation for the invasion success of ''D. lumholtzi''. A defensive trait that qualifies as a key adaptation is most likely an example of escape and radiate coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Katharina, and Ralph Tollrian. "Inducible defences as key adaptations for the successful invasion of Daphnia lumholtzi in North America?." Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 276.1663 (2009): 1865-1873.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacteria-phage ===

The theory can be applied at the microscopic level such as to [[bacteria]]-[[phage]] relationships. Bacteria were able to diversify and escape through resistance to phages. The diversity among the hosts and parasites differed among the range of infection and resistance. The implication of this study to humans is its important to understanding the evolution of infectious organisms, and preventing diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Best, A., et al. "The Evolution of Host‐Parasite Range." The American naturalist 176.1 (2010): 63-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scientific theory]] of evolution by natural selection was proposed by [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in the mid-19th century and was set out in detail in Darwin's book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859).&lt;ref name=Darwin&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink = Charles Darwin |year=1860 |title=On the Origin of Species |place=London |publisher=John Murray |edition=2nd |pages=490 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F376&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolution by natural selection was first demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are often produced than can possibly survive. This is followed by three observable [[fact]]s about living organisms: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to their morphology, [[physiology]] and behaviour ([[Phenotype#Phenotypic variation|phenotypic variation]]), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and [[reproduction]] (differential [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]) and 3) traits can be passed from generation to generation ([[heritability]] of fitness).&lt;ref name="Lewontin70"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewontin |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard Lewontin |date=November 1970 |title=The Units of Selection |url=http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.01.110170.000245 |jstor=2096764 |issn=1545-2069 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206172942/http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/167/lewontin%2070%20-%20the%20units%20of%20selection.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in successive generations members of a population are more likely to be replaced by the [[offspring|progenies]] of parents with favourable characteristics that have enabled them to survive and reproduce in their respective [[biophysical environment|environments]].

=== Classical times ===
The proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] Greek [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Anaximander#Origin of humankind|Anaximander]] and [[Empedocles#Cosmogony|Empedocles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|Raven|Schofield|1983|pp=100–142, 280–321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such proposals survived into Roman times. The [[poet]] and philosopher [[Lucretius]] followed Empedocles in his masterwork ''[[De rerum natura]]'' (''On the Nature of Things'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucretius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sedley |first=David |authorlink=David Sedley |year=2003 |title=Lucretius and the New Empedocles |url=http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Leeds International Classical Studies |volume=2 |issue=4 |issn=1477-3643 |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823062637/http://lics.leeds.ac.uk/2003/200304.pdf |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medieval ===
In contrast to these [[Materialism|materialistic]] views, [[Aristotelianism]] considered all natural things as [[potentiality and actuality|actualisations]] of fixed natural possibilities, known as [[Theory of forms|forms]].&lt;ref name="Torrey37"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torrey |first1=Harry Beal |last2=Felin |first2=Frances |date=March 1937 |title=Was Aristotle an Evolutionist? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=1–18 |doi=10.1086/394520 |issn=0033-5770 |jstor=2808399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hull67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hull |first=David L. |authorlink=David Hull |date=December 1967 |title=The Metaphysics of Evolution |journal=[[The British Journal for the History of Science]] |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=309–337 |doi=10.1017/S0007087400002892 |jstor=4024958}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a medieval [[teleology|teleological]] understanding of [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] in which all things have an intended role to play in a [[divinity|divine]] [[cosmos|cosmic]] order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the [[Middle Ages]] and were integrated into [[Christianity|Christian]] learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mason|1962|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
In the 17th century, the new [[scientific method|method]] of [[History of science#Modern science|modern science]] rejected the Aristotelian approach. It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of [[physical law]]s that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order. However, this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences, the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types. [[John Ray]] applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types, "species," to plant and animal types, but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|pp=256–257}}
* {{harvnb|Ray|1686}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biological classification introduced by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1735 explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships, but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |title=Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) |last=Waggoner |first=Ben |date=July 7, 2000 |website=Evolution |publisher=[[University of California Museum of Paleontology]] |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430160025/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/linnaeus.html |archivedate=2011-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Natural history|naturalists]] of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws. In 1751, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms, and [[Erasmus Darwin]] proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism (or "filament").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html |title=Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) |date=October 4, 1995 |website=Evolution |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |location=Berkeley, California |type=Online exhibit |accessdate=2012-02-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119004316/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/Edarwin.html |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s "transmutation" theory of 1809,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; which envisaged [[spontaneous generation]] continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency, and postulated that on a local level, these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents.&lt;ref name="Nardon_Grenier91"&gt;{{harvnb|Nardon|Grenier|1991|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould02"&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The latter process was later called [[Lamarckism]].)&lt;ref name="Nardon_Grenier91" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ImaginaryLamarck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghiselin |first=Michael T. |authorlink=Michael Ghiselin |date=September–October 1994 |title=The Imaginary Lamarck: A Look at Bogus 'History' in Schoolbooks |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |journal=The Textbook Letter |oclc=23228649 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212174536/http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |archivedate=2008-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magner|2002}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jablonka07"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |authorlink1=Eva Jablonka |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion J. |authorlink2=Marion J.

In particular, [[Georges Cuvier]] insisted that species were unrelated and fixed, their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs. In the meantime, Ray's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by [[William Paley]] into the ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (1802), which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by Charles Darwin.&lt;ref name="Darwin91"&gt;{{harvnb|Burkhardt|Smith|1991}}

=== Darwinian revolution ===
The crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection, which was formulated by Charles Darwin in terms of variable populations. Partly influenced by ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (1798) by [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], Darwin noted that population growth would lead to a "struggle for existence" in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished. In each generation, many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources. This could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism.&lt;ref name="Sober09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sober |first=Elliott |authorlink=Elliott Sober |date=June 16, 2009 |title=Did Darwin write the ''Origin'' backwards? |journal=Proc.

[[Thomas Henry Huxley]] applied Darwin's ideas to humans, using [[paleontology]] and [[comparative anatomy]] to provide strong evidence that humans and [[ape]]s shared a common ancestry. Some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Desmond |first=Adrian J. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]] |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/Thomas-Henry-Huxley |title=Thomas Henry Huxley |accessdate=2014-12-02 |date=July 17, 2014 |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |location=Chicago, Illinois |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119231241/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/277746/Thomas-Henry-Huxley |archivedate=January 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pangenesis and heredity ===
The mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of [[pangenesis]].&lt;ref name="Liu09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Y. S. |last2=Zhou |first2=X. M. |last3=Zhi |first3=M.

=== The 'modern synthesis' ===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}
In the 1920s and 1930s the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] connected natural selection and population genetics, based on Mendelian inheritance, into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology. The modern synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations, through [[Transitional fossil|fossil transitions]] in palaeontology, and complex cellular mechanisms in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name="Gould02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1989}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the structure of [[DNA]] by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] with contribution of [[Rosalind Franklin]] in 1953 demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance.&lt;ref name="Watson53"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watson |first1=J.

=== Further syntheses ===
Since then, the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the [[Biological organisation|biological hierarchy]], from genes to species. One extension, known as [[evolutionary developmental biology]] and informally called "evo-devo," emphasises how changes between generations (evolution) acts on patterns of change within individual organisms ([[Developmental biology|development]]).&lt;ref name="Kutschera"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kutschera |first1=Ulrich |authorlink1=Ulrich Kutschera |last2=Niklas |first2=Karl J. |authorlink2=Karl J.

[[File:ADN static.png|thumb|upright=0.6|[[DNA]] structure. [[nucleobase|Bases]] are in the centre, surrounded by phosphate–sugar chains in a [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]].]]
Evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism. In humans, for example, [[Eye color|eye colour]] is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the "brown-eye trait" from one of their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Richard A. |last2=Frudakis |first2=Tony N. |date=August 2004 |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Genetics]] |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–332 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |issn=0168-9525 |pmid=15262401}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] (genetic material) is called its genotype.&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Helen |date=May 25, 2006 |title=Genetics: What is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..398P |doi=10.1038/441398a |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16724031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype. These traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Visscher |first1=Peter M. |last2=Hill |first2=William G. |authorlink2=William G. Hill |last3=Wray |first3=Naomi R. |date=April 2008 |title=Heritability in the genomics era — concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–266 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=18319743}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in genotypic variation; a striking example are people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Oetting |first1=William S. |last2=Brilliant |first2=Murray H. |last3=King |first3=Richard A. |date=August 1996 |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Molecular Medicine Today]] |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–335 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |issn=1357-4310 |pmid=8796918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via DNA, a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name="Pearson_2006" /&gt; DNA is a long [[biopolymer]] composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.&lt;ref name="Futuyma_2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Futuyma|2005}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|quantitative trait loci]] (multiple interacting genes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Phillips |first=Patrick C. |date=November 2008 |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=855–867 |doi=10.1038/nrg2452 |issn=1471-0056 |pmc=2689140 |pmid=18852697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rongling Wu |author2=Min Lin |date=March 2006 |title=Functional mapping — how to map and study the genetic architecture of dynamic complex traits |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=229–237 |doi=10.1038/nrg1804 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=16485021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by changes to the sequence of [[nucleotide]]s in the DNA. These phenomena are classed as [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] inheritance systems.&lt;ref name="Jablonka09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |last2=Raz |first2=Gal |date=June 2009 |title=Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance: Prevalence, Mechanisms, and Implications for the Study of Heredity and Evolution |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=84 |issue=2 |pages=131–176 |doi=10.1086/598822 |issn=0033-5770 |pmid=19606595|url=http://compgen.unc.edu/wiki/images/d/df/JablonkaQtrRevBio2009.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.617.6333 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA methylation]] marking [[chromatin]], self-sustaining metabolic loops, gene silencing by [[RNA interference]] and the three-dimensional [[Protein structure|conformation]] of [[protein]]s (such as [[prion]]s) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.&lt;ref name="Bossdorf10"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bossdorf |first1=Oliver |last2=Arcuri |first2=Davide |last3=Richards |first3=Christina L. |last4=Pigliucci |first4=Massimo |authorlink4=Massimo Pigliucci |date=May 2010 |title=Experimental alteration of DNA methylation affects the phenotypic plasticity of ecologically relevant traits in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=541–553 |doi=10.1007/s10682-010-9372-7 |issn=0269-7653|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/318722/files/10682_2010_Article_9372.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jablonka|Lamb|2005}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in [[gene regulatory network|genetic networks]] and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in [[developmental plasticity]] and [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]].&lt;ref name="Jablonka02"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jablonka |first1=Eva |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion J. |date=December 2002 |title=The Changing Concept of Epigenetics |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=981 |issue=1 |pages=82–96 |bibcode=2002NYASA.981...82J |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2002.tb04913.x |issn=0077-8923 |pmid=12547675}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritability may also occur at even larger scales.

{{main|Genetic variation}}
{{Further|Genetic diversity|Population genetics}}
An individual organism's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation.&lt;ref name="Lin" /&gt; The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation. The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene. Variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of [[fixation (population genetics)|fixation]]—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.&lt;ref name="Amos"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amos |first1=William |last2=Harwood |first2=John |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Factors affecting levels of genetic diversity in natural populations |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=177–186 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0200 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692205 |pmid=9533122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough [[genetic variation]] in a population. Before the discovery of Mendelian genetics, one common hypothesis was [[blending inheritance]]. But with blending inheritance, genetic variance would be rapidly lost, making evolution by natural selection implausible. The [[Hardy–Weinberg principle]] provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with Mendelian inheritance. The frequencies of alleles (variations in a gene) will remain constant in the absence of selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift.&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ewens|2004}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variation comes from mutations in the genome, reshuffling of genes through [[sexual reproduction]] and migration between populations ([[gene flow]]). Despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow, most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Butlin |first1=Roger K. |last2=Tregenza |first2=Tom |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Levels of genetic polymorphism: marker loci versus quantitative traits |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=187–198 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0201 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692210 |pmid=9533123}}

=== Mutation ===
{{Main|Mutation}}
[[File:Gene-duplication.svg|thumb|upright=0.45|Duplication of part of a [[chromosome]]]]
Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of a cell's genome. When mutations occur, they may alter the [[gene product|product of a gene]], or prevent the gene from functioning, or have no effect. Based on studies in the fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene, this will probably be harmful, with about 70% of these mutations having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sawyer |first1=Stanley A. |last2=Parsch |first2=John |author3=Zhang Zhi |last4=Hartl |first4=Daniel L. |date=April 17, 2007 |title=Prevalence of positive selection among nearly neutral amino acid replacements in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Proc.

Mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming [[gene duplication|duplicated]] (usually by [[genetic recombination]]), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hastings |first1=P.

New genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function.

In [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] organisms, genes are inherited together, or ''linked'', as they cannot mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction.

(This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many [[invertebrate]]s.) The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes.&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;{{harvnb|Ridley|1993}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms.

== Mechanisms ==
[[File:Mutation and selection diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Mutation]] followed by natural selection results in a population with darker colouration.]]
From a [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-Darwinian]] perspective, evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms,&lt;ref name="Ewens W.J. 2004" /&gt; for example, the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common. Mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection, genetic drift, genetic hitchhiking, mutation and gene flow.

=== Natural selection ===
{{Main|Natural selection}}
{{Further|Sexual selection}}
Evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population. It has often been called a "self-evident" mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts:&lt;ref name="Lewontin70" /&gt;
* Variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation).
* Different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness).
* These traits can be passed from generation to generation (heritability of fitness).

More offspring are produced than can possibly survive, and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction. Consequently, organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage.&lt;ref name="Hurst"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hurst |first=Laurence D. |authorlink=Laurence Hurst |title=Fundamental concepts in genetics: genetics and the understanding of selection |date=February 2009 |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=83–93 |doi=10.1038/nrg2506 |issn=1471-0056 |pmid=19119264}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[teleonomy]] is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are [[teleology in biology|seemingly fitted]] for the [[function (biology)|functional]] roles they perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|loc=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=477 Chapter XIV]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequences of selection include [[Assortative mating|nonrandom mating]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Otto |first1=Sarah P. |author-link1=Sarah Otto |last2=Servedio |first2=Maria R. |last3=Nuismer |first3=Scott L. |title=Frequency-Dependent Selection and the Evolution of Assortative Mating |journal=Genetics |date=August 2008 |volume=179 |issue=4 |pages=2091–2112 |issn=0016-6731 |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.084418 |pmc=2516082 |pmid=18660541|bibcode=2001gpm..book.....L }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetic hitchhiking]].

If an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene, then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population. These traits are said to be "selected ''for''." Examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased [[fecundity]]. Conversely, the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer—they are "selected ''against''."&lt;ref name="Lande"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lande |first1=Russell |authorlink1=Russell Lande |last2=Arnold |first2=Stevan J. |date=November 1983 |title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters |journal=Evolution |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=1210–1226 |doi=10.2307/2408842 |pmid=28556011 |issn=0014-3820 |jstor=2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic; if the environment changes, previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful.&lt;ref name="Futuyma_2005" /&gt; However, even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way, traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form (see [[Dollo's law of irreversibility|Dollo's law]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldberg |first1=Emma E. |last2=Igić |first2=Boris |date=November 2008 |title=On phylogenetic tests of irreversible evolution |journal=Evolution |volume=62 |issue=11 |pages=2727–2741 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00505.x |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=18764918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collin |first1=Rachel |last2=Miglietta |first2=Maria Pia |date=November 2008 |title=Reversing opinions on Dollo's Law |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=602–609 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2008.06.013 |issn=0169-5347 |pmid=18814933}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a re-activation of dormant genes, as long as they have not been eliminated from the genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations, can lead to the re-occurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in [[dolphin]]s, teeth in [[chicken]]s, wings in wingless stick [[insect]]s, tails and additional nipples in humans etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomić |first1=Nenad |last2=Meyer-Rochow |first2=Victor Benno |year=2011 |title=Atavisms: Medical, Genetic, and Evolutionary Implications |journal=[[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=332–353 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2011.0034 |issn=0031-5982 |pmid=21857125}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Throwbacks" such as these are known as [[atavism]]s.

Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is [[directional selection]], which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hoekstra |first1=Hopi E. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=Jonathan M. |last3=Berrigan |first3=David |last4=Vignieri |first4=Sacha N. |last5=Hoang |first5=Amy |last6=Hill |first6=Caryl E. |last7=Beerli |first7=Peter |last8=Kingsolver |first8=Joel G. |date=July 31, 2001 |title=Strength and tempo of directional selection in the wild |journal=Proc.

This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in [[stabilising selection]] there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in [[variance]] around the average value and less diversity.&lt;ref name="Hurst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felsenstein |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Felsenstein |date=November 1979 |title=Excursions along the Interface between Disruptive and Stabilizing Selection |journal=Genetics |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=773–795 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214112 |pmid=17248980}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would, for example, cause organisms to eventually have a similar height.

Natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits, are more or less likely to survive. "Nature" in this sense refers to an [[ecosystem]], that is, a system in which organisms interact with every other element, [[Abiotic component|physical]] as well as [[Biotic component|biological]], in their local environment. [[Eugene Odum]], a founder of [[ecology]], defined an ecosystem as: "Any unit that includes all of the organisms...in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e., exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system...."&lt;ref name="Odum1971"&gt;{{harvnb|Odum|1971|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct [[Ecological niche|niche]], or position, with distinct relationships to other parts of the system. These relationships involve the life history of the organism, its position in the [[food chain]] and its geographic range. This broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which, together, comprise natural selection.

Natural selection can act at [[unit of selection|different levels of organisation]], such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species.&lt;ref name="Okasha07"&gt;{{harvnb|Okasha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=February 28, 1998 |title=Gulliver's further travels: the necessity and difficulty of a hierarchical theory of selection |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=353 |issue=1366 |pages=307–314 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0211 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692213 |pmid=9533127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayr |first=Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |date=March 18, 1997 |title=The objects of selection |journal=Proc.

=== Genetic hitchhiking ===
{{Further|Genetic hitchhiking|Hill–Robertson effect|Selective sweep}}
Recombination allows alleles on the same strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of recombination is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as [[genetic linkage|linkage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lien |first1=Sigbjørn |last2=Szyda |first2=Joanna |last3=Schechinger |first3=Birgit |last4=Rappold |first4=Gudrun |last5=Arnheim |first5=Norm |date=February 2000 |title=Evidence for Heterogeneity in Recombination in the Human Pseudoautosomal Region: High Resolution Analysis by Sperm Typing and Radiation-Hybrid Mapping |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=557–566 |doi=10.1086/302754 |issn=0002-9297 |pmc=1288109 |pmid=10677316 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to [[independence (probability theory)|expectations]], which is called their [[linkage disequilibrium]]. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a [[haplotype]]. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a [[selective sweep]] that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barton |first=Nicholas H. |authorlink=Nick Barton |date=November 29, 2000 |title=Genetic hitchhiking |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=355 |issue=1403 |pages=1553–1562 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0716 |issn=0962-8436 |pmc=1692896 |pmid=11127900}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.&lt;ref name="gillespie 2001" /&gt;

=== Gene flow ===
{{Further|Gene flow|Hybrid (biology)|Horizontal gene transfer}}
Gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species.&lt;ref name="Morjan C, Rieseberg L 2004 1341–56" /&gt; The presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution. Due to the complexity of organisms, any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes, as in the [[Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Model|Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model]], even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment.

If genetic differentiation between populations develops, gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations, eventually resulting in the appearance of new species. Thus, exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the [[Species problem#Mayr's Biological Species Concept|''Biological Species Concept'']] (BSC).

During the development of the modern synthesis, Sewall Wright developed his [[shifting balance theory]], which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |authorlink=Sewall Wright |year=1932 |title=The roles of mutation, inbreeding, crossbreeding and selection in evolution |url=http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |journal=Proceedings of the VI International Congress of Genetrics |volume=1 |pages=356–366 |accessdate=2014-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063103/http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/wright.asp |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory.&lt;ref name="Coyne 1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry A. |authorlink1=Jerry Coyne |last2=Barton |first2=Nicholas H. |last3=Turelli |first3=Michael |date=June 1997 |title=Perspective: A Critique of Sewall Wright's Shifting Balance Theory of Evolution |journal=Evolution |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=643–671 |doi=10.2307/2411143 |pmid=28568586 |issn=0014-3820|jstor=2411143 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding [[Predation|predators]] or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by [[Co-operation (evolution)|cooperating]] with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial [[symbiosis]]. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.

These outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as [[macroevolution]] versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in [[allele frequency]] and adaptation.&lt;ref name="ScottEC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Matzke |first2=Nicholas J. |authorlink2=Nick Matzke |date=May 15, 2007 |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc.

For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new [[habitat]]s, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|species selection]] acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.{{sfn|Gould|2002|pp=657–658}}&lt;ref name="Gould_1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |date=July 19, 1994 |title=Tempo and mode in the macroevolutionary reconstruction of Darwinism |journal=Proc.

Adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=483}}: "Adaptation... could no longer be considered a static condition, a product of a creative past and became instead a continuing dynamic process."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The sixth edition of the ''Oxford Dictionary of Science'' (2010) defines ''adaptation'' as "Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment."&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism's survival. For example, the adaptation of [[horse]]s' teeth to the grinding of grass. By using the term ''adaptation'' for the evolutionary process and ''adaptive trait'' for the product (the bodily part or function), the two senses of the word may be distinguished. Adaptations are produced by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Orr |first=H.

# ''Adaptation'' is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dobzhansky|1968|pp=1–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature, or the loss of an ancestral feature.

Adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms. This is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within [[bat]] wings, for example, are very similar to those in [[mouse|mice]] feet and [[primate]] hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Nathan M. |last2=HallgrÍmsson |first2=Benedikt |date=December 2005 |title=Serial homology and the evolution of mammalian limb covariation structure |journal=Evolution |volume=59 |issue=12 |pages=2691–2704 |doi=10.1554/05-233.1 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=16526515}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since all living organisms are related to some extent,&lt;ref name="Penny1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=David |last2=Poole |first2=Anthony |date=December 1999 |title=The nature of the last universal common ancestor |journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=672–677 |doi=10.1016/S0959-437X(99)00020-9 |issn=0959-437X |pmid=10607605}}&lt;/ref&gt; even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as [[arthropod]], [[squid]] and [[vertebrate]] eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called [[deep homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Brian K. |date=August 2003 |title=Descent with modification: the unity underlying homology and homoplasy as seen through an analysis of development and evolution |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=409–433 |doi=10.1017/S1464793102006097 |issn=1464-7931 |pmid=14558591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shubin |first1=Neil |authorlink1=Neil Shubin |last2=Tabin |first2=Clifford J. |authorlink2=Clifford Tabin |last3=Carroll |first3=Sean B. |date=February 12, 2009 |title=Deep homology and the origins of evolutionary novelty |journal=Nature |volume=457 |issue=7231 |pages=818–823 |bibcode=2009Natur.457..818S |doi=10.1038/nature07891 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=19212399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Coevolution}}
Interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, such as a [[pathogen]] and a [[host (biology)|host]], or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wade |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael J.

For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]] that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Paszkowski |first=Uta |date=August 2006 |title=Mutualism and parasitism: the yin and yang of plant symbioses |journal=[[Current Opinion (Elsevier)|Current Opinion in Plant Biology]] |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=364–370 |doi=10.1016/j.pbi.2006.05.008 |issn=1369-5266 |pmid=16713732}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a [[Reciprocity (evolution)|reciprocal]] relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from [[photosynthesis]]. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending [[signal transduction|signals]] that suppress the plant [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hause |first1=Bettina |last2=Fester |first2=Thomas |date=May 2005 |title=Molecular and cell biology of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis |journal=[[Planta (journal)|Planta]] |volume=221 |issue=2 |pages=184–196 |doi=10.1007/s00425-004-1436-x |issn=0032-0935 |pmid=15871030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved. An extreme case is the [[eusociality]] found in social insects, such as [[bee]]s, [[termite]]s and [[ant]]s, where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] that are able to reproduce. On an even smaller scale, the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism, which then supports a small number of the animal's germ cells to produce offspring. Here, somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow, remain as they are, or die. If cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately, their uncontrolled growth [[carcinogenesis|causes cancer]].&lt;ref name="Bertram"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bertram |first=John S. |date=December 2000 |title=The molecular biology of cancer |journal=[[Molecular Aspects of Medicine]] |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=167–223 |doi=10.1016/S0098-2997(00)00007-8 |issn=0098-2997 |pmid=11173079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gavrilets |first=Sergey |date=October 2003 |title=Perspective: models of speciation: what have we learned in 40 years? |journal=Evolution |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2215 |doi=10.1554/02-727 |issn=0014-3820 |pmid=14628909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are multiple ways to define the concept of "species." The choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned.&lt;ref name="Queiroz"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Queiroz |first=Kevin |date=May 3, 2005 |title=Ernst Mayr and the modern concept of species |journal=Proc.

Despite the diversity of various species concepts, these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches: interbreeding, ecological and phylogenetic.&lt;ref name="Ereshefsky92"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ereshefsky |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Ereshefsky |date=December 1992 |title=Eliminative pluralism |journal=[[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=671–690 |doi=10.1086/289701 |issn=0031-8248 |jstor=188136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Biological Species Concept'' (BSC) is a classic example of the interbreeding approach. Defined by evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] in 1942, the BSC states that "species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1942|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its wide and long-term use, the BSC like others is not without controversy, for example because these concepts cannot be applied to prokaryotes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraser |first1=Christophe |last2=Alm |first2=Eric J. |last3=Polz |first3=Martin F. |last4=Spratt |first4=Brian G. |last5=Hanage |first5=William P. |date=February 6, 2009 |title=The Bacterial Species Challenge: Making Sense of Genetic and Ecological Diversity |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5915 |pages=741–746 |bibcode=2009Sci...323..741F |doi=10.1126/science.1159388 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=19197054 |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this is called the [[species problem]].&lt;ref name="Queiroz" /&gt; Some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species, while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species.&lt;ref name="Queiroz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ereshefsky92" /&gt;

[[Reproductive isolation|Barriers to reproduction]] between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their [[most recent common ancestor]], it may still be possible for them to produce offspring, as with horses and [[donkey]]s mating to produce [[mule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Short |first=Roger Valentine |date=October 1975 |title=The contribution of the mule to scientific thought |journal=Journal of Reproduction and Fertility.

In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species, or possess a totally new phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gross |first1=Briana L. |last2=Rieseberg |first2=Loren H. |date=May–June 2005 |title=The Ecological Genetics of Homoploid Hybrid Speciation |journal=Journal of Heredity |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=241–252 |doi=10.1093/jhered/esi026 |issn=0022-1503 |pmc=2517139 |pmid=15618301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of hybridisation in producing [[hybrid speciation|new species]] of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burke |first1=John M. |last2=Arnold |first2=Michael L. |date=December 2001 |title=Genetics and the fitness of hybrids |journal=Annual Review of Genetics |volume=35 |pages=31–52 |doi=10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.085719 |issn=0066-4197 |pmid=11700276}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[gray tree frog]] being a particularly well-studied example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vrijenhoek |first=Robert C. |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Polyploid Hybrids: Multiple Origins of a Treefrog Species |journal=Current Biology |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=R245–R247 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.03.005 |issn=0960-9822 |pmid=16581499|bibcode=1996CBio....6.1213A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four primary geographic modes of speciation. The most common in animals is [[allopatric speciation]], which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically, such as by [[habitat fragmentation]] or migration. Selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herrel |first1=Anthony |last2=Huyghe |first2=Katleen |last3=Vanhooydonck |first3=Bieke |last4=Backeljau |first4=Thierry |last5=Breugelmans |first5=Karin |last6=Grbac |first6=Irena |last7=Van Damme |first7=Raoul |last8=Irschick |first8=Duncan J. |date=March 25, 2008 |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proc.

The second mode of speciation is [[peripatric speciation]], which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment. This differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population. Here, the [[founder effect]] causes rapid speciation after an increase in [[inbreeding]] increases selection on homozygotes, leading to rapid genetic change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Templeton |first=Alan R. |authorlink=Alan Templeton |date=April 1980 |title=The Theory of Speciation ''VIA'' the Founder Principle |url=http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |journal=Genetics |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1038 |pmid=6777243 |issn=0016-6731 |pmc=1214177 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063455/http://www.genetics.org/content/94/4/1011.full.pdf+html |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third mode is [[parapatric speciation]]. This is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat, but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations. Instead, speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations.&lt;ref name="Gavrilets" /&gt; Generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species' habitat. One example is the grass ''[[Anthoxanthum|Anthoxanthum odoratum]]'', which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Antonovics |first=Janis |authorlink=Janis Antonovics |date=July 2006 |title=Evolution in closely adjacent plant populations X: long-term persistence of prereproductive isolation at a mine boundary |url=http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |journal=[[Heredity (journal)|Heredity]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=33–37 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800835 |issn=0018-067X |pmid=16639420 |accessdate=2014-12-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823063443/http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v97/n1/full/6800835a.html |archivedate=2014-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil. Selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants, which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation. Selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause [[Reinforcement (speciation)|reinforcement]], which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species, as well as [[character displacement]], which is when two species become more distinct in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nosil |first1=Patrik |last2=Crespi |first2=Bernard J. |last3=Gries |first3=Regine |last4=Gries |first4=Gerhard |date=March 2007 |title=Natural selection and divergence in mate preference during speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=309–327 |doi=10.1007/s10709-006-0013-6 |pmid=16900317 |issn=0016-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in [[sympatric speciation]] species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat. This form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savolainen |first1=Vincent |last2=Anstett |first2=Marie-Charlotte |last3=Lexer |first3=Christian |last4=Hutton |first4=Ian |last5=Clarkson |first5=James J. |last6=Norup |first6=Maria V. |last7=Powell |first7=Martyn P. |last8=Springate |first8=David |last9=Salamin |first9=Nicolas |last10=Baker |first10=William J. |date=May 11, 2006 |title=Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7090 |pages=210–213 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..210S |doi=10.1038/nature04566 |issn=0028-0836 |pmid=16467788 |display-authors=3}}

One type of sympatric speciation involves [[crossbreed]]ing of two related species to produce a new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during [[meiosis]] the [[homologous chromosome]]s from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair.

Speciation events are important in the theory of [[punctuated equilibrium]], which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short "bursts" of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis, where species remain relatively unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eldredge|Gould|1972|pp=82–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, speciation and rapid evolution are linked, with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations.

Past species have also left records of their evolutionary history.

However, this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts, such as shells, bones or teeth. Further, as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies, their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry.

[[File:Editorial cartoon depicting Charles Darwin as an ape (1871).jpg|upright|thumb|As evolution became widely accepted in the 1870s, [[caricature]]s of Charles Darwin with an [[ape]] or [[monkey]] body symbolised evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2003|pp=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the 19th century, particularly after the publication of ''On the Origin of Species'' in 1859, the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists.&lt;ref name="Kutschera" /&gt; However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some [[Theism|theists]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the philosophical, religious and cosmological controversies, see:

The teaching of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the 20th century.  The [[Scopes Trial]] decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 ''[[Epperson v. Arkansas]]'' decision.  Since then, the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] form as [[intelligent design]] (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v.

Macintosh was a lecturer in English at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths’ College, University of London]] until 2000. when she moved to Oxford as Senior Research Fellow at the [[Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama|APGRD]]. She was [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in Greek and Roman Drama from 2008 to 2014 when she became Professor of [[Classical reception studies|Classical Reception]]. Macintosh became the Director of the [[Archive of Performances of Greek and Roman Drama|APGRD]] in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk/about-us/people|title=People {{!}} APGRD|website=www.apgrd.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=4874|title=REF Case study search|website=impact.ref.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macintosh's research focuses on the adaptation of Greek plays for the modern theatre and the reception of Greek tragedy from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] to the present day. She has taken a particular interest in the adaptation of Greek tragedy for the Irish stage and has interviewed [[Frank McGuinness]] on the subject&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/frank-mcguinness-conversation-fiona-macintosh|title=Frank McGuinness in conversation with Fiona Macintosh {{!}} University of Oxford Podcasts - Audio and Video Lectures|website=podcasts.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed with Wayne Jordan his adaptation of [[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]] for the [[Abbey Theatre]], [[Dublin]], in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://interestingtalks.in/Oxford/event/oedipus-director-wayne-jordan-conversation/|title=On Oedipus: Director Wayne Jordan in conversation - Interesting Talks Oxford|website=interestingtalks.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Macintosh has also researched adaptations of [[Antigone (Sophocles play)|Antigone]] for the Irish stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintosh|first=Fiona|date=2011-06-16|title=Irish Antigone and Burying the Dead|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586196.001.0001/acprof-9780199586196-chapter-4|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199586196.001.0001/acprof-9780199586196-chapter-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''First Carlist War''' was a [[civil war]] in [[Spain]] from 1833 to 1840, fought between factions over the succession to the throne and the nature of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]]. It was fought between supporters of the regent, [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]], acting for [[Isabella II of Spain]], and those of the late king's brother, [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos de Borbón]] (or ''Carlos V''). The Carlists goal was the return to an absolute monarchy. Portugal, France and the United Kingdom supported the regency, and sent volunteer and even regular forces to confront the Carlist army.

==Historical background==
At the beginning of the 19th century, the political situation in Spain was extremely problematic. During the [[Peninsular War]], the [[Cádiz Cortes|Cortes]] met in [[Cádiz]] and elaborated the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], at that point possibly the most modern and most liberal in the world.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} After the war, when Ferdinand VII returned to Spain (1814), he annulled the constitution in the Manifest of Valencia, and became an absolutist king, governing by decrees and restoring the [[Spanish Inquisition]], abolished by [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph I]], brother of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]].
[[File:Francisco Cea Bermúdez.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Francisco Cea Bermudez, an important official during the ''Trienio Liberal'', presided over the 1832-1834 cabinet]]
[[File:James_de_Rothschild_by_J._Robert.jpg|thumb|160px|right|James (Jacob) Rothschild, head of the French branch of the family]]
[[File:Nathan_Rothschild.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Nathan Rothschild and his brother James increasingly involved in Spain, providing the key financial platform for the Spanish governments]]

The 1805 [[Battle of Trafalgar]] had all but shattered the Spanish navy, with the [[Peninsular War]] leaving the Spanish society overwhelmed by continuous warfare and badly damaged by looting. While the Spanish Empire collapsed, the maritime trade trickled to the Americas and Philippines, and Spain's military struggled to keep their colonies, with [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico getting its independence in 1821]]. The customary overseas revenue to the metropolis was at a historic low, the royal coffers were empty. Financing (solvency) and recruitment to the military became an overriding concern for the Spanish Crown, with the governments under King [[Ferdinand VII]] failing to provide new solutions and stability.

During the ''Trienio Liberal'' (1820-1823), the progressive liberals decided to resort to the international money lenders to revert the economic meltdown Spain was facing. They turned to Paris, and particularly London, where many liberals (many of them [[Freemason]]s) had fled on Ferdinand VII's comeback (1814). In London and Paris, the liberals ruling (shortly) Spain engaged in negotiations with the financiers [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild|Nathan Rothschild]] and [[James Rothschild]]. They bailed out the Spanish liberal regime, with Great Britain also supporting it on its last stage, not so much on the strength of its liberal tenets but with a vested view to securing the debt engaged in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;López-Morell, Miguel A. 2015, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1823 intervention of a reactionary international alliance, the [[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis|Sacred Alliance]], restored Ferdinand VII on the Spanish throne, but the Bourbon king refused to assume the debt incurred by the 1820-1823 liberal rulers with the Rothschilds based in London and Paris. For more than a decade, the pending liberal debt became for Ferdinand VII's negotiators a persistent sticking point with these financiers during talks for new loan requests.&lt;ref&gt;López-Morell, Miguel A. 2015, pp. 51, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Against a backdrop of on-off bankruptcy and solvency issues, towards the end of his life, Ferdinand VII promulgated the Pragmatic Sanction giving hopes for a liberal rule. [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] had no male descendant, but two daughters, Isabella (later known as [[Isabella II of Spain]]) and [[Infanta Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier|Luisa Fernanda]]. So he promulgated the above "[[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830|Pragmatic Sanction]]", to allow Isabella to become Queen after his death, returning to traditional rules of Spanish succession. Without the above ''Pragmática Sanción'', [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos de Borbón]], the king's brother, would have normally become king.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of the 18th century, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], the first [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] king of Spain, promulgated the [[Salic Law]], which declared illegal the inheritance of the Spanish crown by women. His purpose was to thwart the [[Habsburg]]s' regaining the throne by way of the female dynastic line.&lt;/ref&gt;
He and his followers, such as Secretary of Justice [[Francisco Tadeo Calomarde y Arría|Francisco Tadeo Calomarde]], pressed Ferdinand to change his mind. But the agonizing Ferdinand kept his decision and when he died on 29 September 1833, Isabella became the legitimate queen. As she was only a child, a regent was needed, so her mother [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Queen Consort Maria Christina]] was appointed.

A strong absolutist party did not want to lose its position. Its members knew that regent Maria Christina would make liberal reforms, so they looked for another candidate for the throne; and their natural choice, with the background of the Salic Law, was Ferdinand's brother [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos]]. The differing views on the influence of the army and the Church in governance, as well as [[1833 territorial division of Spain|the forthcoming administrative reforms]] paved the way for the expulsion of the ultra-Conservatives (absolutists advocating for Carlos) from the higher governmental circles, not that it opened the doors to the most progressives.

[[Francisco Cea Bermúdez|Cea Bermudez]]'s centrist government (October 1832-January 1834) inaugurated a period of opening and return to Spain of many exiles in London and Paris, e.g. [[Juan Álvarez Mendizabal]] (born Méndez). The rise of Cea Bermudez was followed by a closer collaboration and understanding with the Rothschilds, who in turn clearly encouraged the former's reforms and liberalization, i.e. the new liberal regime and the incorporation of Spain to the European financial system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=López-Morell|first=Migule Á.|date=2015|title=Rothschild; Una historia de poder e influencia en España|location=Madrid|publisher=MARCIAL PONS, EDICIONES DE HISTORIA, S.A. |pages=56–57, 61|isbn=978-84-15963-59-2|access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with state coffers yet again empty, the impending war, and the ''Trienio Liberal'' loan issue with the Rothschilds still not settled, Cea Bermudez's government fell.&lt;ref&gt;López-Morell, Miguel A. 2015, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Confronted with war breaking out in Basque territory and before matters ran out of control, the envoy of regent Maria Cristina's government, the Marquis of Miraflores (a middle-of-the-road liberal), contacted London's City bankers to open a line of credit with the Spanish Treasury (thus pay the next installment of external debt due in July 1834 and get new credit), as well as the British Government in order to garner its political endorsement. An agreement with Nathan and James Rothschild and a loan advance of 500,000 pounds to the Marquis of Miraflores paved the way to the establishment of the Quadruple Alliance that sealed British and French protection to the Spanish government, including military operations (April 1834).&lt;ref&gt;López-Morell, Miguel A. 2015, p. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt;

As written by one historian:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first Carlist war was fought not so much on the basis of the legal claim of Don Carlos, but because a passionate, dedicated section of the Spanish people favored a return to a kind of absolute monarchy that they felt would protect their individual freedoms (fueros), their regional individuality and their religious conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Smith, ''Spain: A History in Art'' (Gemini-Smith, Inc., 1979), 259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A vivid summary of the war describes it as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Christinos and Carlists thirsted for each other's blood, with all the fierce ardour of civil strife, animated by the memory of years of mutual insult, cruelty, and wrong. Brother against brother – father against son – best friend turned to bitterest foe – priests against their flocks – kindred against kindred.&lt;ref&gt;"Evenings at Sea," ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', Vol. 48, July–December 1840 (T. Cadell and W. Davis, 1840), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The autonomy of Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia had been abolished in the 18th century by the [[Nueva Planta Decrees]] that created a centralised Spanish state. In the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque Country]], the kingdom status of Navarre and the separate status of Álava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa were challenged in 1833 during the central government's one-sided [[1833 territorial division of Spain|territorial division of Spain]]. The resentment against the growing intervention of Madrid (e.g. attempts to take over Biscayan mines in 1826) and the loss of autonomy was considerably strong.

Meanwhile, the Spanish courtiers wanted to suppress the [[Basques|Basque]] [[fueros]] and to move the customs borders to the [[Pyrenees]]. Since the 18th century, a new emergent class had an interest in weakening the powerful Basque nobles and their influence in commerce, including that extending throughout the world with the help of the [[Jesuit]] order.

The newly appointed Spanish courtiers supported some of the great powers against the Basques at least since the abolition of the Jesuit order and the [[Manuel de Godoy|Godoy]] regime. First they sided with the French Bourbons to suppress the Jesuits, following the formidable changes in North America after the victory of the United States in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Then Godoy sided with the English against the Basques in the [[War of the Pyrenees]] of 1793, and immediately afterwards with the French of [[Napoleon]], also against the Basques. The British interest was to destroy, for as long as possible, Spanish commercial routes and power, which were mainly sustained by the Basque ports and merchant fleet.

[[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] found an important support base in the Basque Country. The 1812 [[Constitution of Cádiz]] suppressed the Basque home rule, speaking of a unified Spanish nation and rejecting the existence of the Basque nation, so the new Spanish king garnered the [[History of the Basque people#Revolution and war|endorsement of the Basques]] as long as he respected the Basque institutional and legal framework.

[[Charles Frederick Henningsen|Charles F. Henningsen]], Michael B. Honan, or Edward B. Stephens, English writers and first-hand witnesses of the First Carlist War, spent time in the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque districts]] during the Carlist engagement. They did not hide their sympathies for Carlos V's cause, one they regarded as representing the cause of the Basque home rule. Just the opposite, John Francis Bacon, an English diplomat based in the Liberal Bilbao during the Carlist investment of the city (1835), while also praising Basque governance, could no hide his hostility towards the Carlists, whom he regarded as "savages." He went on to contest his compatriots' approach, denying any connections of the Carlist cause to the defense of the [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Basque liberties]], and considering that Carlos V the pretender would be quick to erode or suppress them as soon as he rose to the Spanish throne. He also deems a Liberal government like the one led by [[Isabella II of Spain]] as more inclined to respect the Basque liberties.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The privileges of the Basque provinces are odious to the Spanish nation, of which Charles is so well aware, that if he was king of Spain next year, he would quickly find excuses for infringing them, if not their total abolition. A representative government will endeavour to raise Spain to a level with the Basque provinces, – a despot, to whom the very name of freedom is odious, would strive to reduce the provinces to the same low level with the rest.&lt;ref&gt;John Francis Bacon, quoted in {{cite journal |last=Santiago |first=Leoné |date=2008 |title=Before and after the Carlist war: Changing images of the Basques |url=http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/rievcuadernos/02/02055074.pdf |journal= RIEV (Revista Internacional de Estudios Vascos |publisher=EuskoMedia Fundazioa |volume=2 |issue= |pages=59 |ISBN=978-84-8419-152-0 |accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar to what [[John Adams]] had pointed 60 years before, John F. Bacon (''[https://books.google.es/books?id=TV8EAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Six years in Biscay...]'', 1838) considers the [[Basques]] living to the north of the Ebro river as free citizens, as compared to the Spanish whom he sees as "a mere flock" liable to be mistreated by their masters. For Edward B. Stephens, the Basques were fighting at once for their own sources of legitimacy, their practical freedom, for the rights of their sovereign, and their own constitutional foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, Edward.B. 1837 (1), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The excellence of the Basque home rule and its republican character is also highlighted by other authors, such as [[Wentworth Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esparza Zabalegi|first=Jose Mari|title=Euskal Herria Kartografian eta Testigantza Historikoetan|year=2012|publisher=Euskal Editorea SL|isbn=978-84-936037-9-3|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; A deeper insight into the Basques and their relation to the Spanish during this period is offered by Sidney Crocker and Bligh Barker (1839), stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the Vasques, or as they term themselves, the Escaldunes, do not consider themselves Spaniards, and differ widely from them, in character and language.&lt;ref&gt;Crocker&amp;Barker (1838), quoted in {{cite journal |last=Santiago |first=Leoné |date=2008 |title=Before and after the Carlist war: Changing images of the Basques |url=http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/rievcuadernos/02/02055074.pdf |journal= RIEV (Revista Internacional de Estudios Vascos |publisher=EuskoMedia Fundazioa |volume=2 |issue= |pages=59 |ISBN=978-84-8419-152-0 |accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The interests of the Basque liberals were divided. On the one side, fluent cross-Pyrenean trade with other Basque districts and France was highly valued, as well as unrestricted overseas transactions. The former had been strong up to the French Revolution, especially in Navarre, but the new French national arrangement (1790) had abolished the separate legal and fiscal status of the [[French Basque Country|French Basque districts]]. Despite difficulties, on-off trade continued during the period of uncertainty prevailing under the French Convention, the [[War of the Pyrenees|War of the Pyrenees (1793-1795)]], [[Manuel Godoy]]'s tenure in office, and the Peninsular War. Eventually, Napoleonic defeat left cross-border commercial activity struggling to take off [[Peninsular War|after 1813]].

Overseas commerce was badly affected by the end of the [[Guipuzcoan Company of Caracas]] (1785), the French-Spanish defeat at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805), [[Spanish American wars of independence|independence movements in Latin America]], [[Siege of San Sebastián|the destruction of San Sebastián]] (1813), and the eventual breakup of the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)#Royal Company of the Philippines|Royal Philippine Company (1814)]]. By 1826 all the grand Spanish (including the Basque) fleet of the late 18th century with its renowned Basque navigators was gone for the benefit of the British Empire, and with it, the Atlantic vocation of the Enlightened Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cayuela Fernández |first=José |last2= |first2= |date=2006 |title=Los marinos vascos en Trafalgar |url=http://um.gipuzkoakultura.net/itsasmemoria5/cayuelafernandez.pdf |journal=Itsas Memoria.Revista de Estudios Marítimos del País Vasco |publisher=Untzi Museoa/Museo Naval|volume= |issue=5 |pages=415, 431 |doi= |accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the ideology of Basque liberals, overall supportive of home rule, the Basques were getting choked by the above circumstances and customs on the [[Ebro]], on account of the high levies enforced on them by the successive Spanish governments after 1776. Many Basque liberals advocated in turn for the relocation of the Ebro customs to the Pyrenees, and the encouragement of a Spanish market.

On Ferdinand VII's death in 1833, the minor Isabella II was proclaimed queen, with Maria Christina acting as regent. In November, a new Spanish institutional arrangement was designed by the incoming government in Madrid, [[1833 territorial division of Spain|homogenising Spanish administration]] according to provinces and conspicuously overruling Basque institutions. Anger and disbelief spread in the Basque districts.

==The contenders==

[[File:María Cristina de Borbón-Dos Sicilias, reina de España.jpg|160px|right|thumb|[[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]]]]

The people of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|western Basque provinces]] (ambiguously called "Biscay" up to that point) and [[Kingdom of Navarre#Later history and the end of the fueros|Navarre]] sided with Carlos because ideologically Carlos was close to them and more importantly because he was willing to uphold Basque institutions and laws. Some historians claim that the Carlist cause in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] was a pro-''fueros'' cause, but others ([[Stanley G. Payne]]) contend that no connection to the emergence of Basque nationalism can be postulated. Many supporters of the Carlists cause believed a traditionalist rule would better respect the ancient region specific institutions and laws established under historical rights. Navarre and the rest of the Basque provinces held their customs on the Ebro river. Trade had been strong with France (especially in Navarre) and overseas up to the Peninsular War (up to 1813), but getting sluggish thereafter.

Another important reason for the massive mobilisation of the western Basque provinces and Navarre for the Carlist cause was the tremendous influence of the Basque clergy in the society, one that still addressed to them in their own language, [[Basque language|Basque]], unlike school and administration, institutions where Spanish had been imposed by then. The Basque [[History of the Basque people#Under the nation-states|pro-''fueros'']] liberal class under the influence of the Enlightenment and ready for independence from Spain (and initially at least allegiance to France) was put down by the Spanish authorities at the end of the [[War of the Pyrenees#Western Pyrenees|War of the Pyrenees]] ([[San Sebastián]], [[Pamplona]], etc.). As of then, the strongest partisans of the [[Fuero#The end of the fueros|region specific laws]] were the rural based clergy, nobility and lower class&amp;mdash;opposing new liberal ideas largely imported from France. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], in his book ''Memories of a Federalist'' (Buenos Aires, 1967), accused the Basque clergy of being "the heart, the brain and the root of the intolerance and the hard line" of the Spanish Catholic Church.{{When|date=January 2015}}

[[File:Infante don Carlos, by Vicente Lopez.JPG|160px|thumb|[[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Carlos de Borbón]]]]

Meanwhile, in [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragón]], the people saw the chance of recovering their foral rights, which were lost after the [[Spanish Succession War]] when [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] defeated the armies that fought for [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Karl of Austria]], the other candidate to the throne after the death of [[Charles II of Spain]]. Carlos never addressed the issue of the foral rights.

On the other side, the liberals and moderates united to defend the new order represented by María Cristina and her three-year-old daughter, Isabella. They controlled the institutions, almost the whole army, and the cities; the Carlist movement was stronger in rural areas. The liberals had the crucial support of [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Portugal]], support that was shown in the important credits to Cristina's treasury and the military help from the British (British Legion or [[Westminster Legion]] under [[George de Lacy Evans|General de Lacy Evans]]), the French (the [[French Foreign Legion]]), and the Portuguese (a Regular Army Division, under General [[Francisco Xavier da Silva Pereira, 1st Count of Antas|Count of Antas]]). The Liberals were strong enough to win the war in two months. But, an inefficient government and the dispersion of the Carlist forces gave Carlos time to consolidate his forces and hold out for almost seven years in the northern and eastern provinces.

As [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] has written, "both royalists and liberals began to develop strong local followings, which were to perpetuate and transmute themselves, through many open commotions and deceptively tranquil intervals, until they exploded in the merciless civil war of 1936-39."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''The Birth of the Modern World: Society 1815-1830'' (New York: HarperCollins, 1991), 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The combatants==
[[File:Infanteria Castellana-album.jpg|thumb|right|Carlist forces]]

Both sides raised special troops during the war. The Liberal side formed the volunteer Basque units known as the [[Chapelgorris]], while [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]] created the special units known as [[aduaneros]]. Zumalacárregui also established the unit known as [[Guías de Navarra]] from Liberal troops from [[La Mancha]], [[Valencia (province)|Valencia]], [[Andalusia]] and other places who had been taken prisoner at the [[Battle of Alsasua]] (1834). After this battle, they had been faced with the choice of joining the Carlist troops or being executed.

The term [[Requetés]] was at first applied to just the Tercer Batallón de Navarra (Third Battalion of Navarre) and subsequently to all Carlist combatants.

The war attracted independent adventurers, such as the [[British people|Briton]] [[C. F. Henningsen]], who served as Zumalacárregui's chief bodyguard (and later was his biographer), and [[Martín Zurbano]], a ''contrabandista'' or [[smuggler]], who:

&lt;blockquote&gt;soon after the commencement of the war sought and obtained permission to raise a body of men to act in conjunction with the queen's troops against the [[Carlists]]. His standard, once displayed, was resorted to by smugglers, robbers, and outcasts of all descriptions, attracted by the prospect of plunder and adventure. These were increased by deserters...&lt;ref&gt;"A Night Excursion with Martin Zurbano", ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', Vol. 48, July–December 1840 (T. Cadell and W. Davis, 1840), 740.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

About 250 foreign volunteers fought for the Carlists; the majority were French [[monarchists]], but they were joined by men from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[Belgium]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont]], and the [[German Confederation|German]] states.&lt;ref name="zm.gipuzkoakultura2.net"&gt;[http://zm.gipuzkoakultura2.net/19thcenturymilitaryhistory/biografia-henningsen.php?titulo=KARL%20FERDINAND%20HENNINGSEN.%20(1815-1877)&amp;negrita=kfm 19th Century bibliography of military history in the Basque Country]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich, Prince of Schwarzenberg (soldier)|Friedrich, Prince of Schwarzenberg]] fought for the Carlists, and had taken part in the [[French conquest of Algeria]] and the [[Sonderbund War|Swiss civil war]] of the Sonderbund. The Carlists' ranks included such men as Prince [[Felix Maria Vinzenz Andreas, Fürst Lichnowsky|Felix Lichnowsky]], [[Adolfo Loning]], Baron [[Wilhelm Von Radhen]] and [[August Karl von Goeben]], all of whom later wrote memoirs concerning the war.&lt;ref name="zm.gipuzkoakultura2.net"/&gt;

[[File:Tropas Reina 1-album.jpg|thumb|right|Liberal forces]]

The Liberal generals, such as [[Vicente Genaro de Quesada]] and [[Marcelino de Oraá Lecumberri]], were often veterans of the [[Peninsular War]], or of the wars resulting from independence movements in [[South America]]. For instance, [[Jerónimo Valdés]] participated in the [[battle of Ayacucho]] (1824).

Both sides executed prisoners of war by [[firing squad]]; the most notorious incident occurred at [[Heredia, Spain|Heredia]], when 118 Liberal prisoners were executed by order of Zumalacárregui. The British attempted to intervene, and through [[Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans|Lord Eliot]], the [[Lord Eliot Convention]] was signed on April 27–28, 1835.

The treatment of prisoners of the First Carlist War became regulated and had positive effects. A soldier of the British Legion wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The British and Chapelgorris who fell into their hands [the Carlists], were mercilessly put to death, sometimes by means of tortures worthy of the North [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]; but the Spanish troops of the line were saved by virtue, I believe, of the Eliot treaty, and after being kept for some time in prison, where they were treated with sufficient harshness, were frequently exchanged for an equal number of prisoners made by the Christinos.&lt;ref&gt;Charles William Thompson, ''Twelve Months in the British Legion, by an Officer of the Ninth Regiment'' ([[Oxford University]], 1836), 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Henry Bill, another contemporary, wrote that, although "it was mutually agreed upon to treat the prisoners taken on either side according to the ordinary rules of war, a few months only elapsed before similar barbarities were practiced with all their former remorselessness."&lt;ref&gt;Henry Bill, ''The History of the World'' (1854), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The war in the Northern Front==
[[File:Cordova-mapa Norte.jpg|thumb|Theater of operations of the Liberal Army of the North, May 1836]]
[[File:Rahden-Expedición Real.jpg|thumb|Basque, Catalan, and Valencian Carlist outbreaks, as well as military expeditions across the north-east of Spain]]

The war was long and hard, and the Carlist forces (labeled "the Basque army" by John F. Bacon) achieved important victories in the north under the direction of the brilliant general [[Tomás de Zumalacárregui]]. The Basque commander swore an oath to uphold home rule in Navarre (''fueros''), subsequently being proclaimed commander in chief of Navarre. The Basque regional governments of Biscay, [[Álava]], and Gipuzkoa followed suit by pledging obedience to Zumalacárregui. He took to the bush in the Amescoas (to become the Carlist headquarters, next to [[Estella-Lizarra]]), there making himself strong and avoiding the harassment of the Spanish forces loyal to [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]] (Isabella II). 3,000 volunteers with no resources came to swell his forces.

In summer 1834, Liberal (Isabeline) forces set fire to the [[Sanctuary of Arantzazu]] and a convent of [[Bera, Navarre|Bera]], while Zumalacárregui showed his toughest side when he had volunteers refusing to advance over [[Etxarri-Aranatz]] executed. The Carlist cavalry engaged and defeated in Viana an army sent from Madrid (14 September 1834), while Zumalacárregui's forces descended from the [[Basque Mountains]] [[Battle of Alegría de Álava|over the Álavan Plains]] (Vitoria), and prevailed over general [[Manuel O'Doyle]]. The veteran general [[Espoz y Mina]], a Liberal Navarrese commander, attempted to drive a wedge between the Carlist northern and southern forces, but Zumalacárregui's army managed to hold them back (late 1834).

In January 1835, the Carlists took over Baztan in an operation where the general Espoz y Mina narrowly escaped a severe defeat and capture, while the local Liberal Gaspar de Jauregi ''Artzaia'' ('the Shepherd') and his ''[[chapelgorris]]'' were neutralized in [[Zumarraga, Spain|Zumarraga]] and Urretxu. By May 1835, virtually all [[Gipuzkoa]] and seigneury of [[Biscay]] were in Carlist hands. Opposing his advisers and Zumalacárregui's plan, Carlos V decided to conquer [[Bilbao]], defended by the [[Royal Navy]] and the British Auxiliary Legion. With such an important city in his power, the Prussian or Russian Tsarist banks would give him credit to win the war; one of the most important problems for Carlos was a lack of funds.

In the siege of [[Bilbao]], Zumalacárregui was wounded in the leg by a stray bullet. The wound was not serious, he was treated by a number of doctors, famously by Petrikillo (nowadays meaning in Basque [http://hiztegiak.elhuyar.org/eu/petrikilo 'quack' or 'dodgy healer']). The relationship of the pretender to the throne and the commander in chief was at least distant; not only had they differed in operative strategy, but Zumalacárregui's popularity could undermine Carlos' own authority, as in the early stages of war, the Basque general was offered the crown of [[Kingdom of Navarre#Later history and the end of the fueros|Navarre]] and the lordship of [[Basque Autonomous Community|Biscay]] as king of the Basques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/152945/138124 Zumalacárregui y el Independentismo vasco]&lt;/ref&gt; The injury did not heal properly, and finally General Zumalacárregui died on June 25, 1835. Many historians believe the circumstances of his death were suspicious, and have noted that the general had many enemies in the Carlist court; however, to date no further light has been shed on this point.

In the European theatre all the great powers backed the Isabeline army, as many British observers wrote in their reports. Meanwhile, in the east, Carlist general [[Ramón Cabrera]] held the initiative in the war, but his forces were too few to achieve a decisive victory over the Liberal forces loyal to Madrid. In 1837 the Carlist effort culminated in the Royal Expedition, which reached the walls of Madrid, but subsequently retreated after the [[Battle of Aranzueque]].

==The war in the Southern Front==
In the south, the Carlist general [[Miguel Gómez Damas]] attempted to establish a strong position there for the Carlists, and he left [[Ronda]] on November 18, 1836, entering [[Algeciras]] on November 22. But, after Gómez Damas departed from Algeciras, he was defeated by [[Ramón María Narváez y Campos]] at the [[Battle of Majaceite]]. An [[England|English]] commentator wrote that "it was at Majaciete that [Narváez] rescued [[Andalucía]] from the Carlist invasion by a brilliant ''[[coup de main]]'', in a rapid but destruction action, which will not readily be effaced from the memory of the southern provinces."&lt;ref&gt;T. M. Hughes, ''Revelations of Spain in 1845'' (London: Henry Colburn, 1845), 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Arcos de la Frontera]], the Liberal [[Diego de Leon]] managed to detain a Carlist [[column]] by his squadron of 70 cavalry until Liberal reinforcements arrived.

[[Ramon Cabrera]] had collaborated with Gómez Damas in the expedition of Andalusia where, after defeating the Liberals, he occupied [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] and [[Extremadura]]. He was pushed out after his defeat at [[Battle of Villarrobledo|Villarrobledo]] in 1836.

==The end of war==
[[File:Museo Zumalakarregi Albumsigloxix 000553.JPG|thumb|The Embrace of Bergara put an end to the First Carlist War in the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque Country]] (1839)]]
After the death of Zumalacárregui in 1835, the Liberals slowly regained the initiative but were not able to win the war in the Basque districts until 1839. They failed to recover the Carlist fortress of Morella and suffered a defeat at the [[Battle of Maella]] (1838).

The war effort had taken a heavy toll on Basque economy and regional public finances with a population shaken by a myriad of war related plights&amp;mdash;human losses, poverty, disease&amp;mdash;and tired with Carlos' own absolutist ambitions and disregard for their [[Fueros#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|self-government]]. The moderate Jose Antonio Muñagorri negotiated as of 1838 a treaty in Madrid to [[Muñagorriren bertsoak|put an end to war]] ("Peace and Fueros") leading to the Embrace of Bergara (also Vergara), ratified by Basque moderate liberals and disaffected Carlists across all the main cities and countryside.

The war in the Basque Country ended with the ''[[Embrace of Vergara|Convenio de Bergara]]'', also known as the ''Abrazo de Bergara'' ("the Embrace of [[Bergara]]", ''Bergara'' in Basque) on 31 August 1839, between the Liberal general [[Baldomero Espartero, Prince of Vergara|Baldomero Espartero, Count of Luchana]] and the Carlist General [[Rafael Maroto]]. Some authors have written that General Maroto was a traitor who forced Carlos to accept the peace with little focus as to the precise context in the Basque Country.

In the east, [[Ramón Cabrera|General Cabrera]] continued fighting, but when Espartero conquered Morella and Cabrera in [[Catalonia]] (30 May 1840), the fate of the Carlists was sealed. Espartero progressed to [[Berga]], and by mid-July 1840 the Carlist troops had to flee to France. Considered a hero, Cabrera returned to Portugal in 1848 for the [[Second Carlist War]].

==Consequences==
[[File:Mapa político de España, 1850.jpg|thumb|right|Spain in 1854. It shows what areas remained with different law, tax and military draft systems after the First Carlist War, merged into a sole Spanish jurisdiction after the [[Third Carlist War]] (1876)]]
{{Main|End of Basque home rule (Spain)}}
The [[Embrace of Vergara|Embrace of Bergara]] (August 1839) put an end to war in the Basque districts. The Basques managed to keep a reduced version of their previous home rule (taxation, military draft) in exchange for their [[s:es:Decreto de Confirmación de Fueros|unequivocal incorporation into Spain]] (October 1839), now centralized, and divided into provinces.

The October 1839 Act was confirmed in Navarre, but events took an unexpected turn in Madrid when General Baldomero Espartero rose to office with the support of the [[Progressive Party (Spain)|Progressives]] in Spain. In 1840, he became premier and regent. The financial and trading bourgeoisie burgeoned, but after Carlist war the Treasury's coffers were depleted and the army pending discharge.

In 1841 a separate treaty was signed by officials of the Council of Navarre (the ''Diputación Provincial'', established in 1836), such as the Liberal [[Yanguas y Miranda]], without the mandatory approval of the parliament of the kingdom (the ''Cortes''). That compromise (called later the ''Ley Paccionada'', the Compromise Act) accepted further curtailments to self-government, and more importantly officially turned the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] into a province of Spain (August 1841).

In September 1841, Espartero's uprising had its follow-up in the military occupation of the [[Southern Basque Country|Basque Country]], and subsequent suppression by decree of Basque home rule altogether, definitely bringing the Ebro customs over to the Pyrenees and the coast. The region was gripped by a wave of famine, and many took to overseas emigration at either side of the Basque Pyrenees, to America.

Espartero's regime came to an end in 1844 after the [[Década moderada|moderate Conservatives]] gained momentum, and a settlement was found for the stand-off in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Provinces]].

The '''Hallaton Helmet''' is a decorated iron [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] cavalry parade helmet originally covered in a sheet of silver and decorated in places with gold leaf. It was discovered in 2000 near [[Hallaton]], [[Leicestershire]] after Ken Wallace, a member of the Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from the University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration have been undertaken by experts from the [[British Museum]], supported by a [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the [[Harborough Museum]] in [[Market Harborough]] alongside other artefacts from the [[Hallaton Treasure]] hoard.

Although it was found shattered into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with [[silver-gilt]] and decorated with images of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would have been used by a Roman [[Roman auxiliaries|auxiliary cavalryman]] for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the [[Roman conquest of Britain]].

==Description and interpretation==
The helmet is an example of a three-piece Roman ceremonial cavalry helmet, made of sheet iron covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with [[gold leaf]].&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2012/01/10/finishing-a-3d-2000-year-old-roman-jigsaw-puzzle-the-hallaton-helmet-unveiled/|last=Hill|first=Jeremy|title=Finishing a 3D, 2,000 year-old Roman jigsaw puzzle: the Hallaton helmet unveiled|publisher=British Museum|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06aW1f7?url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2012/01/10/finishing-a-3d-2000-year-old-roman-jigsaw-puzzle-the-hallaton-helmet-unveiled/|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such helmets were worn by Roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as ''[[hippika gymnasia]]'' and may also have been worn in battle, despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration.&lt;ref name="Dixon2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Karen R.|last2=Southern|first2=Pat|title=The Late Roman Army|pages=91–92|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7134-7047-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans.&lt;ref name="British Archaeology"&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Worrell, Sally | author2=Jackson, Ralph | author3=Mackay, Andrew | author4=Bland, Roger | author5=Pitts, Mike | title=The Crosby Garrett Roman Helmet | url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba116/feat1.shtml | journal=[[British Archaeology]] | date=Jan–Feb 2011 | issue=116 | accessdate=3 March 2011 | archivedate=9 March 2013 | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06b27LA?url=http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba116/feat1.shtml | deadurl=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only Roman helmet ever found in Britain that still has most of its silver-gilt plating attached.&lt;ref name="ArtFund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/news/1277/magnificent-2000-year-old-roman-helmet-unveiled|title=Magnificent 2,000-year-old Roman helmet unveiled|publisher=Art Fund|date=9 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06fLf5o?url=http://www.artfund.org/news/2012/01/09/magnificent-2000-year-old-roman-helmet-unveiled|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The helmet would originally have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards. It has a prominent browguard, the shape of which is similar to that of the 3rd-century [[Guisborough Helmet]], discovered in 1864 near [[Guisborough]] in [[Redcar and Cleveland]]. The rear of the helmet bowl descended to form a neckguard.&lt;ref name="DecUpdate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hallaton Helmet Update December 2010|url=http://www.leics.gov.uk/hallaton_helmet_update_december_2010.pdf|publisher=Leicester County Council|date=December 2010|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06fnxUJ?url=http://www.leics.gov.uk/hallaton_helmet_update_december_2010.pdf|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hallaton helmet cheekpiece 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The "Emperor" cheekpiece (no. 1), depicting a Roman emperor being crowned by Victory while trampling a barbarian under his horse's hooves]]
As is the case with other Roman cavalry helmets, the Hallaton Helmet was very ornately decorated. The closest parallel to the Hallaton Helmet in terms of overall appearance is a helmet found in Xanten-Wardt in Germany which, like the Hallaton example, is made of silver-gilded iron with a wreath on the crown, a central figure on the browguard and a garland of flowers on the neckguard.&lt;ref name="CA264" /&gt; A number of similar features have survived on the Hallaton Helmet. Its bowl is decorated with laurel wreaths while the scalloped browguard is edged with elaborate cabling. In the centre of the browguard is the (now heavily damaged) bust of a woman flanked by [[repoussé]] lions.&lt;ref name="Sharp" /&gt; Her identity is unclear, but she may have been an empress or goddess. The iconography is reminiscent of depictions of [[Cybele]], the ''Magna Mater'' or "Great Mother" whose image was used to promote the values of the Augustan period a few decades after the helmet was deposited. However, the depiction has a number of features that are more in common with funerary art.&lt;ref name="CA264"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sharp, Helen|author2=James, Simon|title=Reconstructing the Hallaton Helmet|journal=Current Archaeology|issue=264|date=March 2012|pages=38–41|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/specials/hoards/reconstructing-the-hallaton-helmet.htm|accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earguards are in the shape of silver ears, and the neckguard is decorated with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough.&lt;ref name="DecUpdate" /&gt; It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his arm in the air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]] (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large [[cornucopia]], and a Roman helmet and shield below.&lt;ref name="Sharp"&gt;{{cite news|title=New Hallaton Helmet Discoveries|last=Sharp|first=Helen|work=Branchline|publisher=Leicester County Council|date=Spring 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The helmet was found along with some 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30–50, the largest assemblage of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; They had been buried at what appears to have been a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were from pigs. Many appear to have been buried without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade, with a possible processional way leading up to it. In Roman times it would have been located in the territory of the [[Corieltauvi]], who inhabited an area of the [[East Midlands]] stretching from [[Northamptonshire]] to [[Lincolnshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hallaton Treasure: evidence of a new kind of shrine?|url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/the-hallaton-treasure-evidence-of-a-new-kind-of-shrine.htm|work=Current Archaeology|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06kIfKA?url=http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/the-hallaton-treasure-evidence-of-a-new-kind-of-shrine.htm|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very unusual to find a helmet of this type on a native ceremonial site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leics.gov.uk/helmetandditch.pdf|title=The Hallaton Helmet|publisher=Leicestershire County Council|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06ofass?url=http://www.leics.gov.uk/helmetandditch.pdf|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably made between 25 and 50 AD, close to the date of the [[Roman Conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] in 43 AD;&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; this makes it one of the earliest Roman helmets ever found in Britain.&lt;ref name="ArtFund" /&gt; Other British examples of later date were found in isolation away from settlements, as in the cases of the Guisborough Helmet and [[Crosby Garrett Helmet]], or on Roman sites, as with the [[Newstead Helmet]]. Various suggestions have been put forward as to why the helmet ended up at Hallaton; it may have been owned by a Briton who served in the Roman cavalry, it may have been a [[diplomatic gift]] from the Romans or it may have been captured in war.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; According to Dr Jeremy Hill of the British Museum, the first explanation is the most likely: "Here you probably have a situation where local Britons are fighting on the Roman side."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hallaton helmet unveiled after nine-year restoration|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-16475224|publisher=BBC News|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06kpJKj?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-16475224|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman cavalry at this time was mostly recruited from native allies, not Italians, suggesting that Britons fought alongside the Romans as they carried out their conquest of Britain.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;

==Discovery and restoration==
[[File:Hallaton helmet exhibition.jpg|right|thumb|The Hallaton Helmet and cheekpieces on display at the Harborough Museum, Market Harborough]]
The helmet was discovered by 71-year-old Ken Wallace, a retired teacher and amateur archaeologist. He and other members of the Hallaton Fieldwork Group had found fragments of Roman pottery on a hill near Hallaton in 2000.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/10/unique-roman-helmet-pieced-together|title=Unique Roman cavalry helmet pieced together 10 years after discovery|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|work=The Guardian|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06lFXYX?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/10/unique-roman-helmet-pieced-together|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited the site with a second-hand metal detector late one afternoon and found about 200 coins, which had been buried in a series of small pits dug into the clay.&lt;ref name="BBC-07042003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/2925299.stm|title=Iron Age coin hoard uncovered|publisher=BBC News|date=7 April 2003|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06lgv0v?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/leicestershire/2925299.stm|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found another artifact, which he left in the ground overnight. The following day he returned to examine his discovery and found it that it was a silver ear. He reported the find to Leicestershire's county archaeologist, who called in the University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS) to excavate the site.&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/archaeology/9005994/Roman-helmet-turns-history-on-its-head.html|title=Roman helmet turns history on its head|work=Daily Telegraph|last=Singh|first=Anita|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06mCVEy?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/archaeology/9005994/Roman-helmet-turns-history-on-its-head.html|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dig took place in the spring of 2003.&lt;ref name="BBC-07042003" /&gt;

The helmet was too fragile to be excavated ''[[in situ]]'' so it was removed within a block of earth held together with [[plaster of Paris]]. It was taken to the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt; Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces,&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Jigsaw’ helmet sheds new light on Britain’s relations with Roman Empire|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/archaeology/article3282577.ece|last=Malvern|first=Jack|work=The Times|date=11 January 2012|accessdate=12 January 2012|archivedate=9 March 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6F06vrZ7N?url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/science/archaeology/article3282577.ece|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.&lt;ref name="Hill" /&gt;

The helmet was put on permanent public display at the end of January 2012 at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough, nine miles from the site where the hoard was found, alongside other objects found at Hallaton.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

'''Hans Dragendorff''' (15 October 1870 in [[Dorpat]] ([[Tartu]]), [[Estonia]] &amp;ndash; 29 January 1941 in [[Freiburg]], [[Germany]]) was a [[Baltic German]] scholar who introduced the first classification system for the type of [[Ancient Roman pottery]] known as  [[Samian ware]] or [[Terra sigillata]], in 1896, using type numbers.&lt;ref name="Dragendorff1895"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hans Dragendorff|title=Terra sigillata: ein Beitrag. zur Geschichte der griechischen und römischen Keramik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNJNAAAAYAAJ|year=1895|publisher=Universitäts-Buchdruckerei von Carl Georgi}}&lt;/ref&gt; His scheme was based on the varying forms the vessels took and although it has since been augmented and refined by others, it is still common to refer to 'Dragendorff type 37' bowls for example.

[[File:Jews of Salonika-1917.jpg|thumb|260px|Jewish family of Salonikiin 1917]]

The '''history of the [[Jews]] of [[Thessaloniki]]''' ([[Greece]]) reaches back two thousand years.

The city of [[Thessaloniki]] (also known as '''Salonika''') housed a major [[Jews|Jewish]] community, mostly [[Eastern Sephardim]], until the middle of the [[Second World War]]. It is the only known example of a city of this size in the [[Jewish diaspora]] that retained a Jewish majority for centuries.

Sephardic Jews immigrated to the city following their expulsion from Spain by Christian rulers under the [[Alhambra Decree]] in 1492. This community influenced the Sephardic world both culturally and economically, and the city was nicknamed '''''la madre de Israel''''' (mother of Israel). The community experienced a "golden age" in the 16th century, when they developed a strong culture in the city. Like other groups in the [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman Empire]], they continued to practice traditional culture during the time when western Europe was undergoing industrialization. In the middle of the 19th century, Jewish educators and entrepreneurs came to Thessaloniki from Western Europe to develop schools and industries; they brought contemporary ideas from Europe that changed the culture of the city. With the development of industry, both Jewish and other ethnic populations became industrial workers and developed a large working class, with labor movements contributing to the intellectual mix of the city. After Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire, it made Jews full citizens of the country in the 1920s.

During [[World War II]], the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] occupied Greece in 1941, and started to systematically persecute the Jews as they had in other parts of Europe. In 1943 they forced the Jews in Thessaloniki into a [[ghetto]] near the rail lines, and started deporting them to [[concentration camps]] and labor camps, where most of the 60,000 deported died. This resulted in the near-extermination of the community. Only 1200 Jews live in the city today.

== Early settlement ==
[[File:ElGrecoPaul.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Paul the Apostle]]'' by [[El Greco]]]]

Some scholars believed that [[Paul the Apostle|Paul of Tarsus]]' ''[[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]]'' mentions [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Jews in the city about 52 CE. This is based on certain interpretation of the First Epistle to Thessalonias, 2:14 "''For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus. For you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, just as they did from the Judeans.''" (NKJV). Others believe that this Christian community consisted only of gentiles (pagans) and others that Jews were a small minority in that church of Thessalonike. The Greek word for "your own countrymen" in the original text is "συμφυλέται" (''of the same tribe/race/nation''). The interpretation of "συμφυλέται" as "Jews" is debated by many scholars. Also, there is no firm archaeological and other written evidence for the existence of Jewish community in Thessaloniki during the 1st half of the 1st century AD. However, the existence of such a community is considered as very likely, even if its character is not known.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/download/556/455 NH Taylor (2002) "Who persecuted the Thessalonian Christians?", Hervormde Teologiese Studies (HTS)  58(2), pp 789-793]&lt;/ref&gt; Rearchers have not determined yet where the first Jews lived in the city.&lt;ref name="Vacalopoulos9"&gt;A. Vacalopoulos, ''A History of Thessaloniki'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1170, [[Benjamin of Tudela]] reported that there were 500 Jews in Thessaloniki. In the following centuries, the native [[Romaniotes|Romaniote]] community was joined by some [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. A small Jewish population lived here during the Byzantine period, but it left virtually no trace in documents or archeological artifacts.&lt;ref name="Veinstein42-45"&gt;Gilles Veinstein, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Under the Ottomans==
In 1430, the start of Ottoman domination, the Jewish population was still small. The Ottomans used population transfers within the empire following military conquests to achieve goals of border security or repopulation; they called it ''[[Population transfer#Population transfers in early modern times, 1300–1600|Sürgün]]''. Following the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, an example of ''sürgün'' was the Ottomans' forcing Jews from the Balkans and [[Anatolia]] to relocate there, which they made the new capital of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Islam'', Gallimard, 2005, pp. 563–567.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, few Jews were left in Salonika; none were recorded in the Ottoman census of 1478.&lt;ref name="Veinstein42-45"/&gt;

=== Arrival of Sephardic Jews ===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Turkey}}
[[File:Diaspora salonika.svg|thumb|250px |Paths of Jewish immigration to Salonika]]

In 1492, the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] had promulgated the [[Alhambra Decree]] to expel [[Sephardic Jews]] from their domains. Many immigrated to Salonika, sometimes after a stop in [[Portugal]] or [[Italy]]. The Ottoman Empire granted protection to Jews as ''[[dhimmi]]s'' and encouraged the newcomers to settle in its territories. According to the historians Rosamond McKitterick and Christopher Allmand, the Empire's invitation to the expelled Jews was a demographic strategy to prevent ethnic Greeks from dominating the city.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;Rosamond McKitterick, Christopher Allmand, ''The New Cambridge Medieval History'', p. 779 –&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Sephardim came in 1492 from [[Majorca]]. They were "repentant" returnees to Judaism after earlier forced conversion to Catholicism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In 1493, Jews from [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] joined them. In subsequent years, other Jews came from those lands and also from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Provence]]. Later, in 1540 and 1560, Jews from [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] sought refuge in Salonika in response to the political persecution of the ''[[marranos]]''. In addition to these Sephardim, a few [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] arrived from [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Transylvania]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526–1867)|Hungary]]. They were sometimes forcibly relocated under the Ottoman policy of "[[Population transfer#Ottoman Empire|sürgün]]," following the conquest of land by [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] beginning in 1526. Salonika's registers indicate the presence of "[[Buda]] Jews" after the conquest of that city by the Turks in 1541.&lt;ref name = "Veinstein42-45"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;&lt;!---not always clear here whether they were forced into Thessaloniki or forced OUT of the city---&gt; The Jewish population of the city was 20,000 in 1553.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Salonika |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/salonika |website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration was great enough that by 1519, the Jews represented 56% of the population and by 1613, 68%.&lt;ref name="Veinstein42-45"/&gt;

=== Religious organization ===
Each group of new arrivals founded its own community (''aljama'' in Spanish), whose rites ("''[[minhag]]im''") differed from those of other communities. The synagogues cemented each group, and their names most often referred to the groups' origins. For example, Katallan Yashan (Old Catalan) was founded in 1492 and Katallan Hadash (New Catalonia) at the end of the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;

A government institution called ''Talmud Torah Hagadol'' was introduced in 1520 to head all the congregations and make decisions (''haskamot'') that applied to all. It was administered by seven members with annual terms. This institution provided an educational program for young boys, and was a preparatory school for entry to [[Yeshiva|yeshivot]]. It hosted hundreds of students.&lt;ref name="yeshivot"&gt;Moshe Amar, Le Monde sépharade, Volume II, Seuil, 2006, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Jewish studies, it taught [[humanities]], Latin and Arabic, as well as medicine, the natural sciences and astronomy.&lt;ref name="diaspora"&gt;Jacob Barnaï, ''The Jews Spain: story of a diaspora, 1492–1992'', Liana Levi, 1998, p. 394–408.&lt;/ref&gt; The yeshivot of Salonika were frequented by Jews from throughout the Ottoman Empire and even farther abroad; there were students from Italy and Eastern Europe. After completing their studies, some students were appointed rabbis in the Jewish communities of the Empire and Europe, including cities such as [[Amsterdam]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="yeshivot"/&gt; The success of its educational institutions was such that there was no illiteracy among the Jews of Salonika.&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt;

=== Economic activities ===
[[File:Jewish east mediterranea.svg| thumb|250px|Salonika (Salonique in French) was located in the heart of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The city names are in French.]]

The Sephardic population settled mainly in the major urban centers of the Ottoman Empire, which included Salonika. Unlike other major cities of the Empire, the Jews controlled trading in Salonika. Their economic power became so great that the shipping and businesses stopped on Saturday ([[Shabbat]])—the Jewish sabbath. They traded with the rest of the Ottoman Empire, and the countries of Latin [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], and with all the Jewish communities scattered throughout the [[Mediterranean]]. One sign of the influence of Salonikan Jews on trading is in the 1556 boycott of the port of [[Ancona]], [[Papal States]], in response to the ''[[auto-da-fé]]'' issued by    [[Paul IV]] against 25 [[marrano]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Veinstein, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salonikan Jews were unique in their participation in all economic niches, not confining their business to a few sectors, as was the case where Jews were a minority. They were active in all levels of society, from porters to merchants. Salonika had a large number of Jewish fishermen, unmatched elsewhere, even in present-day [[Land of Israel|Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;Haïm Bentov, ''Le Monde sépharade'', p. 720.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jewish speciality was [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] [[wool]]. They imported technology from Spain where this craft was highly developed. Only the quality of the wool, better in Spain, differed in Salonika. The community made rapid decisions (''haskamot'') to require all congregations to regulate this industry. They forbade, under pain of excommunication (''cherem''), exporting wool and indigo less than three days' travel from the city.&lt;!---the intent of this is not obvious. Something to do with local competition?---&gt;&lt;ref name="Veinstein52"&gt;Gilles Veinstein, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 52–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The Salonikan sheets, blankets and carpets acquired a high profile and were exported throughout the empire from Istanbul to [[Alexandria]] through [[Smyrna]]. The industry spread to all localities close to the [[Thermaic Gulf]]. This same activity became a matter of state when Sultan [[Selim II]] decided to dress his [[Janissary]] troops with warm and waterproof woollen garments. He made arrangements to protect his supply. His [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]] issued a ''[[firman]]'' in 1576 forcing sheep raisers to provide their wool exclusively to the Jews to guarantee the adequacy of their supply. Other provisions strictly regulated the types of woollen production, production standards and deadlines.&lt;ref name="Veinstein52" /&gt; Tons of woollen goods were transported by boat, camel and horse to Istanbul to cloak the janissaries against the approaching winter. Towards 1578, both sides agreed that the supply of wool would serve as sufficient payment by the State for cloth and replace the cash payment. This turned out to be disadvantageous for the Jews.&lt;ref name="Veinstein52"/&gt;

=== Economic decline ===
The increase in the number of [[Janissary|Janissaries]] contributed to an increase in clothing orders putting Jews in a very difficult situation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Contributing to their problems were currency inflation concurrent with a state financial crisis. &lt;!---Something wrong here somewhere. There were a heck of lot more Janissaries than 4,000. I suppose not all required wool garments.---&gt;

Only 1,200 shipments were required initially. However, the orders surpassed 4,000 in 1620.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"&gt;Gilles Veinstein, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Financially challenged, the factories began cheating on quality. This was discovered.
Rabbi Judah Covo at the head of a Salonican delegation was summoned to explain this deterioration in Istanbul and was sentenced to hang. This left a profound impression in Salonika.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt; Thereafter, applications of the Empire were partially reduced and reorganized production.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt;

These setbacks were heralds of a dark period for Salonican Jews. The flow of migrants from the Iberian Peninsula had gradually dried up. Jews favored such Western European cities as [[London]], [[Amsterdam]] and [[Bordeaux]].&lt;ref name = "Veinstein54-58" /&gt; This phenomenon led to a progressive estrangement of the Ottoman Sephardim from the West. Although the Jews had brought many new European technologies, including that of [[printing]], they became less and less competitive against other ethno-religious groups. The earlier well-known Jewish doctors and translators were gradually replaced by their Christian counterparts, mostly Armenians and Greeks. In the world of trading, the Jews were supplanted by Western Christians, who were protected by the western powers through their consular bodies.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt; Salonika lost its pre-eminence following the phasing out of Venice, its commercial partner, and the rising power of the port of Smyrna.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt;

Moreover, the Jews, like other [[dhimmi]]s, had to suffer the consequences of successive defeats of the Empire by the West. The city, strategically placed on a road travelled by armies, often saw retaliation by janissaries against "infidels."&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt; Throughout the 17th century, there was migration of Jews from Salonika to Constantinople, Palestine, and especially [[Izmir]]. The Jewish community of Smyrna became composed of Salonikan émigrés.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt; Plague, along with other epidemics such as cholera, which arrived in Salonika in 1823, also contributed to the weakening of Salonika and its Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt;

Western products, which began to appear in the East in large quantities in the early-to-mid-19th century, was a severe blow to the Salonikan economy, including the Jewish textile industry. The state eventually even began supplying janissaries with "[[Provence|Provencal]] clothing", which sold in low-priced lots, in preference to Salonican wools, whose quality had continued to deteriorate.&lt;ref name = "Veinstein54-58" /&gt; Short of cash, the Jews were forced into paying the grand vizier more than half of their taxes in the form of promissory notes. Textile production declined rapidly and then stopped completely with the abolition of the body of janissaries in 1826.&lt;ref name="Veinstein54-58"/&gt;

===Taxation===
[[Ottoman Jews]] were obliged to pay special "[[Jewish tax]]es" to the Ottoman authorities. These taxes included the ''[[Cizye]]'', the ''[[İspençe]]'', the ''[[Haraç]]'', and the ''[[Rav akçesi]]'' ("rabbi tax"). Sometimes, local rulers would also levy taxes for themselves, in addition to the taxes sent to the central authorities in [[Constantinople]].

=== Later Ottoman era ===
{{Main|Sabbatai Zevi}}
[[File:Brockhaus and Efron Jewish Encyclopedia e13 783-0.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Sabbatai Zevi]]. Portrait by an eyewitness, Smyrna, 1666.]]

Jewish Salonikans had long benefited from the contribution of each of the ideas and knowledge of the various waves of Sephardic immigration, but this human contribution more or less dried up by the 17th century, and sank into a pattern of significant decline.&lt;ref name="Tsevi"/&gt; The [[Yeshiva|yeshivot]] were always busy teaching, but their output was very formalistic. They published books on religion, but these had little original thought. A witness reported that "outside it is always endless matters of worship and commercial law that absorb their attention and bear the brunt of their studies and their research. Their works are generally a restatement of their predecessors' writings."&lt;ref name="Tsevi"/&gt;

From the 15th century, a messianic current had developed in the Sephardic world; the [[Redemption (theology)|Redemption]], marking the end of the world, which seemed imminent. This idea was fueled both by the economic decline of Salonika and the continued growth in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] studies based on the [[Zohar]] booming in Salonican ''yeshivot''. The [[end time|end of time]] was announced successively in 1540 and 1568 and again in 1648 and 1666.

It is in this context that there arrived a young and brilliant Rabbi who had been expelled from nearby Smyrna: [[Sabbatai Zevi]]. Banned from this city in 1651 after proclaiming himself the messiah,&lt;ref name="Judaica"&gt;''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Judaism'', Éditions du Cerf, Paris, 1993, article Sabbataï Tsevi&lt;/ref&gt; he came to Salonika, where his reputation as a scholar and Kabbalist grew very quickly.&lt;ref name= "Tsevi"&gt;Gilles Veinstein, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 58–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest numbers to follow him were members of the Shalom Synagogue, often former [[marranos]].&lt;ref name="Tsevi"/&gt; After several years of caution, he again caused a scandal when, during a solemn banquet in the courtyard of the Shalom Synagogue, he pronounced the [[Tetragrammaton]], ineffable in Jewish tradition, and introduced himself as the [[Jewish Messiah claimants#List of Jewish messiah claimants|Messiah son of King David]].&lt;ref name= "Tsevi"/&gt; The federal rabbinical council then drove him from the city, but Sabbatai Zevi went to disseminate his doctrine in other cities around the Sephardic world. His passage divided, as it did everywhere, Thessaloniki's Jewish community, and this situation caused so much turmoil that Sabbatai Zevi was summoned and imprisoned by the sultan. There, rather than prove his supernatural powers, he relented under fire, and instead converted to [[Islam]]. The dramatic turn of events was interpreted in various ways by his followers, the [[Sabbateans]]. Some saw this as a sign and converted themselves, while others rejected his doctrine and fully returned to Judaism. Some, though, remained publicly faithful to Judaism while continuing to secretly follow the teachings of Sabbatai Zevi.&lt;ref name="Tsevi"/&gt; In Salonika, there were 300 families among the richest who decided in 1686 to embrace Islam before the rabbinical authorities could react, their conversion already having been happily accepted by the Ottoman authorities.&lt;ref name = "Tsevi" /&gt; Therefore, those that the Turks gave the surname "[[Dönmeh|Dönme]]," ("renegades") themselves divided into three groups: Izmirlis, Kuniosos and Yacoubi,&lt;ref name= "Donme"&gt;Francis Georgeon, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 115–118.&lt;/ref&gt; forming a new component of the Salonikan ethno-religious mosaic. Although they chose conversion, they did not assimilate with the Turks, practicing strict [[endogamy]], living in separate quarters, building their own mosques and maintaining a specific liturgy in their language.&lt;ref name= "Judaica"/&gt; They participated greatly in the 19th century in the spread of modernist ideas in the empire.&lt;ref name= "Donme"/&gt; Then, as Turks, the Donme emigrated from the city following the assumption of power by the Greeks.&lt;ref name= "Donme"/&gt;

== Modern times ==

From the second half of the 19th century, the Jews of Salonika had a new revival. ''Frankos'', French and Italian Jews from [[Livorno]], were especially influential in introducing new methods of education and developing new schools and intellectual environment for the Jewish population. Such Western modernists introduced new techniques and ideas to the Balkans from the industrialized world.

=== Religion ===
A prime factor in the development of Salonika into an economic center was its complex rabbinical authority. This stemmed from, according to K.E. Fleming, the rabbi's openness and tolerance of different groups of people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/503640777|title=Greece : a Jewish history|last=1965-|first=Fleming, K. E. (Katherine Elizabeth),|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691146126|oclc=503640777}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true of ''conversos,'' or Jews whos families converted to Christianity whilst living in Spain or Portugal in order to avoid persecution or potential expulsion. A common practice among conversos who wished to live in Salonika was the practice of ''Teshuvah''. This was the concept of Jews returning to Judaism after previously converting, or after an ancestor previously converted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Fleming, the amount of conversos returning to the faith whilst also immigrating to Salonika, made for a dynamic rabbinic establishment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In many cases, the process of reconverting back to Judaism was automatic and it required no extended arbitration by the rabbis. The ''kehalim'' -- or congregations of Salonika -- wanted to make sure that the process of ''Teshuvah'' was as smooth as possible for the participants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The process had gone on for centuries before the modern era. Multiple responsums document the ''Teshuvah'' proceedings. In one instance, a converso man claimed that he was Jewish in his fathers side and was accepted back into the Jewish faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This willingness to accept those back into the faith, made Salonika into an economic powerhouse, much to the ire of Greece. By the late 1800's, Salonika had grown to be much larger and more prosperous than Athens, and a target of Greek conquest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Industrialization ===
From the 1880s the city began to industrialize, within the Ottoman Empire whose larger economy was declining.  The entrepreneurs in Thessaloniki were mostly Jewish, unlike in other major Ottoman cities, where industrialization was led by other ethno-religious groups. The Italian Allatini brothers led Jewish entrepreneurship, establishing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] and other food industries, [[brick]]making, and processing plants for [[tobacco]]. Several traders supported the introduction of a large textile-production industry, superseding the weaving of cloth in a system of artisanal production.

With industrialization, many Salonikans of all faiths became factory workers, part of a new proletariat. Given their population in the city, a large Jewish working class developed. Employers hired labor without regard for religion or ethnicity, unlike the common practice in other parts of the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In the city, workers movements developed crossing ethnic lines;{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} in later years, the labor movements here became marked by issues of nationalism and identity.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== Haskalah ===
[[File:Lemonade-seller-Thessalonika.jpg|thumb|200px|The Jews of Thessaloniki occupied places throughout the social ladder: from the wealthy entrepreneur to the street seller of lemonade]]

The [[Haskalah]], the movement of thought inspired by the Jewish [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], touched the Ottoman world at the end of the 19th century, after its spread among Jewish populations of Western and Eastern Europe. These western groups helped stimulate the city's economic revival.

The ''[[maskilim]]'' and [[Moses Allatini]] from [[Livorno]], Italy, brought new educational style. In 1856, with the help of the [[Rothschild Family|Rothschilds]], he founded a school, having gained consent of rabbis whom he had won over with major donations to charities. The Lippman School was a model institution headed by Professor Lippman, a progressive rabbi from [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"/&gt; After five years, the school closed its doors and Lippman was pressured by the rabbinat, who disagreed with the school's innovative education methods. He trained numerous pupils who took over thereafter.&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"/&gt;

By 1862, Dr. Allatini led his brother Solomon Fernandez to found an Italian school, thanks to a donation by the Kingdom of Italy.&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"/&gt; French attempts to introduce the educational network of the ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' (IAU) failed against resistance by the rabbis, who did not want a Jewish school under the patronage of the French embassy. But the need for schools was so urgent that supporters were finally successful in 1874. Allatini became a member of the central committee of the IAU in Paris and its patron in Thessaloniki.&lt;ref name = "Molho68-78"/&gt; In 1912, nine new IAU schools IAU served the education of both boys and girls from kindergarten to high school; at the same time, the rabbinical seminaries were in decline. As a result, the [[French language]] became more widely used within the Jewish community of Salonika.&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"/&gt; These schools had instruction in both manual and intellectual training. They produced a generation familiar with the developments of the modern world, and able to enter the workforce of a company in the process of industrialization.

=== Political and social activism ===
[[File:Workers March in Salonica 1908 - 1909.jpg|thumb|220px|Jewish workers of the [[Socialist Workers' Federation]] march, 1908 - 1909]]

The eruption of modernity was also expressed by the growing influence of new political ideas from Western Europe. The Young Turk revolution of 1908 with its bases in Salonika proclaimed a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The Jews did not remain indifferent to the enormous social and political change of the era, and were active most often in the social rather than national sphere. As the city began to take in the broader modern influences of the early 20th century, the movement of workers to organize and engage in social struggles for the improvement of working conditions began to spread. An attempt at union of different nationalities within a single labor movement took place with the formation of the [[Socialist Workers' Federation]] led by [[Avraam Benaroya]], a Jew from Bulgaria, who initially started publication of a quadrilingual ''Journal of the worker'' aired in Greek, Turkish, Bulgarian and other languages. However, the Balkan context was conducive to division, and affected the movement; after the departure of Bulgarian element, the Federation was heavily composed of Jews.

The Zionist movement thus faced competition for Jewish backing from the Socialist Workers' Federation, which was very antizionist. Unable to operate in the working class, Zionism in Salonika turned to the smaller group of the middle classes and intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esther Benbassa]], "Zionism in the Ottoman Empire at the 'dawn of XX'". ''In the twentieth century'', No. 24, October 1989, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek administration ==

=== Salonika, Greek city ===
[[File:Street in Ladidaka neighbourhood of Thessaloniki July 2006.jpg|thumb|200px|Street of [[Ladadika]], one of the main districts of the Jewish population, near the [[Port of Thessaloniki]]]]

In 1912, following the [[First Balkan War]], the Greeks took control of Salonika and eventually integrated the city in their territory. This change of sovereignty was not at first well received by the Jews, who feared that the annexation would lead to difficulties, a concern reinforced by Bulgarian propaganda, and by the [[Serbia]]ns, who wanted Austrian Jews to join their cause.&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"&gt;[[Rena Molho]], ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 68–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jews fought for the internationalization of the city under the protection of the great European powers, but their proposal received little attention, Europe having accepted the [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers|fait accompli]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Mazower, '' Salonica city of ghosts'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek administration nevertheless took some measures to promote the integration of Jews&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"/&gt; such as permitting them to work on Sundays and allowing them to observe [[Shabbat]]. The economy benefited from the annexation, which opened to Salonika the doors of markets in northern Greece and [[Serbia]] (with which Greece was in alliance), and by the influx of [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] troops following the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The Greek government was positive towards the development of Zionism and the establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine, which converged with the Greek desire to dismember the Ottoman Empire. The city received the visit of Zionist leaders [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]] and [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], who saw in Salonika a Jewish model that should inspire their future state.&lt;ref name="Molho68-78"/&gt;

At the same time, some among the local population at the time did not share their government's view. A witness, Jean Leune, correspondent for ''L'Illustration'' during the Balkan wars and then an army officer from the East, says: {{Cquote|Faced with the countless shops and stores run by the Jews, until then the leaders in local commerce, Greek merchants set shop on the sidewalk, making access to the shop's doors impossible. The new police smiled ... and Jews, being boycotted, closed shop one after another.&lt;ref&gt;J. Leune, ''The Lord Ulysses'', Viking Press, 1923, p. 77–78 in Sophie Basch, ''Le Mirage Greek'', Hatier, 1995, p. 333. {{ISBN|978-2-218-06269-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Fire of 1917 and inter-communal tensions ===
[[File:Thessaloniki Fire 1917 Map.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Low-lying districts, where a majority of Jews lived, were seriously affected by the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]]]]

The [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917]] was a disaster for the community. The Jewish community was concentrated in the lower part of town and was thus the one most affected: the fire destroyed the seat of the Grand [[Rabbi]]nate and its archives, as well as 16 of 33 synagogues in the city. 52,000 Jews were left homeless. Opting for a different course from the reconstruction that had taken place after the fire of 1890, the Greek administration decided on a modern urban redevelopment plan by the Frenchman [[Ernest Hebrard]]. Therefore, it expropriated all land from residents, giving them nevertheless a [[right of first refusal]] on new housing reconstructed according to a new plan. It was, however, the Greeks who mostly populated the new neighborhoods, while Jews often chose to resettle the city's new suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;Régis Darques, ''Salonique au XXe siècle, de la cité ottomane à la métropole grecque'' [Salonica in the 20th century, from the Ottoman city to the Greek metropolis], p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first anniversary of the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] was celebrated with a splendor unmatched in Europe, the decline had begun. The influx of tens of thousands of [[Greek refugees]] from [[Asia Minor]], and the departure of [[Dönme]] Jews and Muslims from the region as a result of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)]] and the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923), significantly changed the ethnic composition of the city. The Jews ceased to constitute an absolute majority and, on the eve of the Second World War, they accounted for just 40% of the population.

During the period, a segment of the population began to demonstrate an increasingly less conciliatory policy towards the Jews. The Jewish population reacted by siding with the Greek monarchists during the Greek [[National Schism]] (opposing [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who had the overwhelming support of refugees and the lower income classes). This would set the stage for a 20-year period during which the relationship of the Jews with the Greek state and people would oscillate as Greek politics changed.

In 1922, work was banned on Sunday (forcing Jews to either work on [[Shabbat]] or lose income), posters in foreign languages were prohibited, and the authority of rabbinical courts to rule on commercial cases was taken away.&lt;ref name="diaspora"/&gt; As in countries such as [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungary]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], a significant current of antisemitism grew in [[inner city|inner]] Salonika, but "never reached the level of violence in these two countries".&lt;ref name="Kallis"/&gt; It was very much driven by Greek arrivals from [[Asia Minor]], mostly poor and in direct competition with Jews for housing and work.&lt;ref name="Kallis"/&gt; This current of sentiment was, nevertheless, relayed by the ''[[Makedonia (newspaper)|Makedonia]]'' daily, which was close to Venizelos' Liberal Party, and the [[National Union of Greece]] (''Ethniki Enosis Ellados'', EEE) ultra-nationalist organization&lt;ref name="Kallis"/&gt; accusing the Jewish population of not wanting to blend in with the Greek nation, and viewing the development of [[Communism]] and [[Zionism]] in the community with suspicion. Venizelist Greek governments themselves largely adopted an ambivalent attitude, pursuing a policy of engagement while not distancing themselves unequivocally from the current of antisemitism.&lt;ref name="Kallis"/&gt;

In 1931, an antisemitic riot, led by [[National Union of Greece]], took place in Camp Campbell, where a Jewish neighborhood was completely burned, leaving 500 families homeless and one Jewish resident dead.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ushmm.org/uia-cgi/uia_doc/photos/11087?hr=null legend]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} of the picture as published by the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Under Metaxas ===
[[File:Accion 10 May 1938.jpg|thumb|''Accion'', Jewish newspaper of the city (10 May 1938)]]

The seizure of power by dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936 had a significant bearing on the pattern of Greek–Jewish relations in Thessaloniki. Metaxas' regime was not antisemitic; it perceived the [[Venizelists]] and the [[Communists]] as its political enemies, and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] as its major foreign enemy. This endeared Metaxas to two influential Jewish groups: the upper/middle classes, which felt threatened by organized labor and the socialist movement, and Jewish refugees who had fled Bulgaria and the [[Bitola]] region during the Balkan Wars. Antisemitic organizations and publications were banned&lt;ref name="Kallis"&gt;[[Aristotle Kallis|Aristotle A. Kallis]], ''The Jewish Community of Salonica Under Siege: The Antisemitic Violence of the Summer of 1931'', Oxford University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and support for the regime was sufficiently strong for a Jewish charter of the regime-sponsored [[National Organisation of Youth]] (EON) to be formed. This reinforced the trend of national self-identification as Greeks among the Jews of Salonika, who had been Greek citizens since 1913. Even in the concentration camps, Greek Jews never ceased to affirm their sense of belonging to the Greek nation.&lt;ref name="Zemour"&gt;Erika Perahia Zemour, ''Judaism lost and found'' Salonica, Pardès No. 28, Paris, 2000, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the working-class poor of the Jewish community had joined forces with their Christian counterparts in the labor movement that developed in the 1930s, often the target of suppression during Metaxas' regime. [[Avraam Benaroya]] was a leading figure in the Greek Socialist Movement, not only among Jews, but on a national level. Thus the forces of the period had worked to bridge the gaps between Christians and Jews, while creating new tensions among the different socioeconomic groups within the city and the country as a whole.

=== Emigration ===
Emigration of Jews from the city began when the [[Young Turks]] pushed through the universal [[conscription]] of all Ottoman subjects into the military irrespective of religion, a trend that continued to grow after the annexation of the city by Greece. Damage from the Thessaloniki fire, poor economic conditions, rise in antisemitism among a segment of the population, and the development of Zionism all motivated the departure of part of the city's Jewish population. This group left mainly for [[Western Europe]], [[South America]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The Jewish population consequently decreased from 93,000 people to 53,000 on the eve of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Régis Darques, ''Salonique au XXe siècle, de la cité ottomane à la métropole grecque'' p. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; There were some notable successes among the community's diaspora. [[Isaac Carasso]], reaching [[Barcelona]], founded the [[Danone]] company. [[Mordechai Mano]] became in Israel one of the pioneers in the maritime industry and Israeli economy in general.&lt;ref name=dun&gt;[http://duns100.dundb.co.il/ts.cgi?tsscript=comp_eng&amp;duns=514616382 Mano Maritime Ltd. - Company Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407063018/http://duns100.dundb.co.il/ts.cgi?tsscript=comp_eng&amp;duns=514616382 |date=2012-04-07 }} Dun's 100 ranking: Dun &amp; Bradstreet &lt;/ref&gt;  [[Maurice Abravanel]] went to Switzerland with his family and then to the United States where he became a famous [[Conducting|conductor]].

== Second World War ==

=== Battle of Greece ===
On 28 October 1940, Italian forces invaded Greece following the refusal of the Greek dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]] to accept the ultimatum given by the Italians. In the resulting [[Greco-Italian War]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Greece|German invasion]], many of Thessaloniki's Jews took part. 12,898 men enlisted in the Greek army;&lt;ref name="Kerem"&gt;Yitschak Kerem, ''Le Monde sépharade'', Volume I, p. 924–933&lt;/ref&gt; 4,000 participated in the campaigns in Albania and Macedonia; 513 fought against the Germans and, in total, 613 Jews were killed, including 174 from Salonika. The 50th Brigade of Macedonia was nicknamed "Cohen Battalion", reflecting the preponderance of Jews in its composition.&lt;ref name="Kerem"/&gt; After the defeat of Greece, many Jewish soldiers suffered frostbite while returning home on foot.

=== Occupation ===

Central Macedonia, including Thessaloniki, was occupied by the Germans, who entered the city on 9 April 1941. Antisemitic measures were only gradually introduced. [[Max Merten]], the German civil administrator for the city, continued to repeat that the [[Nuremberg Laws]] would not apply to Salonika.&lt;ref name="Judenrat"&gt;[[Rena Molho]], '' The policy of Germany against the Jews of Greece: the extermination of the Jewish community of Salonika (1941–1944)'', review of the history of the Holocaust published by the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation, Paris, 2006; n ° 185, p. 355–378&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish press was quickly banned, while two pro-Nazi Greek dailies, ''Nea Evropi'' ("New Europe") and ''Apogevmatini'' ("Evening Press"), appeared. Some homes and community buildings were requisitioned by the occupying forces, including the Baron Hirsch Hospital. In late April, signs prohibiting Jews entry to cafés appeared. Jews were forced to turn in their radios.

The Grand Rabbi of Salonika, Zvi Koretz, was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] on 17 May 1941 and sent to a [[Nazi concentration camp]] near [[Vienna]], from where he returned in late January 1942 to resume his position as rabbi.&lt;ref name = "Carasso "&gt;[http://www.akadem.org/sommaire/themes/histoire/1/3/module_907.php?chapitre_courant=3''The historical and cultural context. The coexistence between Jews and Greeks.'' By Jean-conference Carasso]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1941, commissioner [[Alfred Rosenberg]] arrived. He plundered Jewish archives, sending tons of documents to his pet project, the [[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question]] in Frankfurt.

Along with the other Greek urban communities, the Jews suffered a severe famine in the winter of 1941–42. The Nazi regime had not attached any importance to the Greek economy, food production or distribution. It is estimated that in 1941–1942 sixty Jews of the city died every day from hunger.&lt;ref Name="Kerem"/&gt;

For a year, no further antisemitic action was taken. The momentary reprieve gave the Jews a temporary sense of security.

On July 11, 1942, known as the "Black [[Shabbat]]," all the men of the community aged 18 to 45 years were rounded up in [[Eleftherias Square]] (Freedom Square) in the city center. Throughout the afternoon, they were forced to do humiliating physical exercises at gunpoint. Four thousand of them were ordered to construct a road for the Germans, linking Thessaloniki to [[Kateríni]] and [[Larissa]], a region rife with [[malaria]].&lt;ref name = "Kerem" /&gt;

In less than ten weeks, 12% of them died of exhaustion and disease. In the meantime, the Thessalonikan community, with the help of Athens, managed to gather two billion drachmas towards the sum of 3.5 billion drachmas demanded by the Germans to ransom the forced laborers. The Germans agreed to release them for the lesser sum but, in return, demanded that the Greek authorities abandon the Jewish cemetery in Salonika, containing 300,000&lt;ref name="Musée"/&gt; to 500,000&lt;ref name="Cimetière"/&gt; graves. Its size and location, they claimed, had long hampered urban growth.

The Jews transferred land in the periphery on which there were two graves. The municipal authorities, decrying the slow pace of the transfer, took matters into their own hands. Five hundred Greek workers, paid by the municipality, began with the destruction of tombs.&lt;ref name="Cimetière"&gt;{{es icon}} Michael Molho, "El cementerio judío of Salónica" Sefarad, 9:1 (1949) p. 124–128&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery was soon transformed into a vast quarry where Greeks and Germans sought gravestones for use as construction materials.&lt;ref name="Cimetière"/&gt; Today this site is occupied by [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]]&lt;ref name="Musée"&gt;[http://www.jmth.gr/ web / thejews / pages / pages / necrop / necrop.htm Document] Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki&lt;/ref&gt; and other buildings.

It is estimated that from the beginning of the occupation to the end of deportations, 3,000–5,000 Jews managed to escape from Salonika, finding temporary refuge in the Italian zone. A recent study by the Jewish Museum of Greece found that 250 Jews of Thessaloniki took part in national resistance movements such as the Greek People's Liberation Army, the National Liberation Front, and British-loyal units of the Greek Army. &lt;ref&gt; Jewish Museum of Thessaloniki: The Book, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction of the Jews of Salonika ===
{{Main|The Holocaust}}

Salonika's 54,000 Jews were shipped to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s. More than 90% of the total Jewish population of the city were murdered during the war. Only the Polish Jews experienced a greater level of destruction.&lt;ref name="Kerem"/&gt;

=== Deportation ===
[[File:Birkenau gate.JPG|thumb|240px|The entrance of Auschwitz II-Birkenau, a view from inside the camp]]

To carry out this operation, the Nazi authorities dispatched two specialists in the field, [[Alois Brunner]] and [[Dieter Wisliceny]], who arrived on February 6, 1943.&lt;ref name = "Judenrat" /&gt; They immediately applied the [[Nuremberg laws]] in all their rigor, imposing the display of the [[yellow badge]] and drastically restricting the Jews' freedom of movement.&lt;ref name="Judenrat"/&gt; Toward the end of February 1943, they were rounded up in three [[ghetto]]s (Kalamaria, Singrou and Vardar / Agia Paraskevi) and then transferred to a transit camp, called the [[Baron Hirsch ghetto]] or camp, which was adjacent to a train station. There, the death trains were waiting. To accomplish their mission, the SS relied on a Jewish police created for the occasion, led by Vital Hasson, which was the source of numerous abuses against the rest of the Jews.&lt;ref name="Judenrat"/&gt;

The first convoy departed on March 15. Each train carried 1000–4000 Jews across the whole of [[central Europe]], mainly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. A convoy also left for [[Treblinka]], and it is possible that deportation to [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibor]] took place, since Salonican Jews were liberated from that camp. The Jewish population of Salonika was so large that the deportation took several months until it was completed, which occurred on August 7&lt;ref name="Kerem"/&gt; with the deportation of Chief Rabbi Tzvi Koretz and other notables to the [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], under relatively good conditions. In the same convoy were 367 Jews protected by their Spanish nationality, who had a unique destiny: they were transferred from Bergen-Belsen to [[Barcelona]], and then [[French Morocco|Morocco]], with some finally reaching the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].&lt;ref name = "Kerem "/&gt;&lt;ref name =" Gershon "&gt;[http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Spanish-Ladino/History/Refugees_from_ Greece_in_the_WW2.html Refujiados of Gresia i Rodes in Maroko durante la II Gerra Mundiala] by Yitshak Gershon, [[Aki Yerushalayim]], 1995, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the discussion about the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish losses in Thessaloniki have been advanced in contrast to the case of Athens, where a large proportion of Jews managed to escape death. However, this only gives a partial picture as other Jewish communities in Greece, with different characteristics such as [[Ioannina]], [[Corfu]] and [[Rhodes]], also experienced very heavy losses.

An often quoted reason focuses on the attitude of the [[Judenrat]], and of its leader in the period prior to the deportations, the chief rabbi [[Zvi Koretz]], has been heavily criticized. He was accused of having responded passively to the Nazis and downplayed the fears of Jews when their transfer to Poland was ordered. As an Austrian citizen and therefore a native German speaker, he was thought to be well-informed.&lt;ref name="Minna Rozen"&gt;Minna Rozen, "Jews and Greeks Remember Their Past: The Political Career of Tzevi Koretz (193343)", ''Jewish Social Studies'', Volume 12, Number 1, Fall 2005 ( New Series), pp. 111–166&lt;/ref&gt; Koretz has also been accused of having knowingly collaborated with the occupiers.&lt;ref name="Minna Rozen" /&gt; However, several new studies tend to diminish his role in the deportations.&lt;ref name="Minna Rozen" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cohen.gr/new/articles/judaism/2677-2013-03-06-08-41-08|title=Μύθοι και πραγματικότητα για την εξόντωση των Εβραίων της Θεσσαλονίκης .|website=cohen.gr|language=el-gr|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblionet.gr/book/185148/%CE%9B%CE%AC%CE%BC%CF%88%CE%B1,_%CE%9A%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B1/%CE%97_%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%89%CF%83%CE%B7|title=.:BiblioNet : Η διάσωση / Λάμψα, Καρίνα|website=www.biblionet.gr|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor was the solidarity shown by the families who refused to be separated. This desire undermined individual initiatives. Some older Jews also had difficulty remaining in hiding because of their lack of knowledge of the Greek language, which had only become the city's dominant language after annexation by Greece in 1913. Additionally, the large size of the Jewish population rendered impossible the tactic of blending into the Greek Orthodox population, as in Athens.

Again in contrast to Athens, there was also a latent antisemitism among a segment of the Greek population, in particular among the refugees from Asia Minor. When these immigrants arrived en masse in Salonika, they were excluded from the economic system. Consequently, some of these outcasts watched the Jewish population with hostility. The Jewish people were more economically integrated and therefore better off, which the immigrants equated with the former Ottoman power.&lt;ref name="Carasso"/&gt;

A reason that is a lot more plausible is the lack of solidarity from the city's Greek Christian population. Rabbi Molho spoke of only a handful of Greek Christians who saved Jews in Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Memoriam, Αφιέρωμα εις μνήμην των Iσραηλιτών θυμάτων του Ναζισμού εν Ελλάδι|last=Μόλχο|first=Μίκαελ|publisher=Ισραηλιτική Κοινότητα Θεσσαλονίκης|year=1976|isbn=|location=Θεσσαλονίκη|pages=149–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that just 10 Jewish families found shelter in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In Memoriam, Αφιέρωμα εις μνήμην των Iσραηλιτών θυμάτων του Ναζισμού εν Ελλάδι|last=Μόλχο|first=Μίκαελ|publisher=Ισραηλιτική Κοινότητα Θεσσαλονίκης|year=1976|isbn=|location=Θεσσαλονίκη|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude of the local population, which included the Church, the city authorities and the professional associations, has been noted by several historians in the recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Apostolou|first=A.|date=2000-10-01|title="The Exception of Salonika": Bystanders and collaborators in Northern Greece|url=https://academic.oup.com/hgs/article-abstract/14/2/165/662439/The-Exception-of-Salonika-Bystanders-and|journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=165–196|doi=10.1093/hgs/14.2.165|issn=8756-6583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Το Ολοκαύτωμα στα Βαλκάνια|last=Αντωνίου|first=Γιώργος|last2=Δορδανάς|first2=Στράτος|last3=Ζάικος|first3=Νίκος|last4=Μαραντζίδης|first4=Νίκος|publisher=Επίκεντρο|year=2011|isbn=|location=Θεσσαλονίκη|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saltiel|first=Leon|title=Professional Solidarity and the Holocaust: The Case of Thessaloniki|url=https://www.academia.edu/19669006/Professional_Solidarity_and_the_Holocaust_The_Case_of_Thessaloniki|journal=Yearbook of the Center for Research on Antisemitism, Technical University Berlin, 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance was also not very well developed at the time, and few Jews could realistically make the journey to the mountains.

Nevertheless, the [[Yad Vashem]] has identified 265 Greek [[righteous among the nations]], the same proportion as among the French population.&lt;ref name="Carasso" /&gt;

=== In the camps ===
At [[Auschwitz II|Birkenau]], about 37,000 Salonicans were gassed immediately, especially women, children and the elderly.&lt;ref name="Kerem"/&gt; Nearly a quarter of all 400 experiments perpetrated on the Jews were on Greek Jews, especially those from Salonika. These experiments included emasculation and implantation of [[cervical cancer]] in women. Most of the twins died following atrocious crimes.&lt;ref name="Kerem"/&gt; Others from the community last worked in the camps. In the years 1943–1944, they accounted for a significant proportion of the workforce of Birkenau, making up to 11,000 of the labourers. Because of their unfamiliarity with [[Yiddish]], Jews from Greece were sent to clean up the rubble of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] in August 1943 in order to build a [[Warsaw concentration camp]]. Among the 1,000 Salonican Jews employed on the task, a group of twenty managed to escape from the ghetto and join the Polish resistance, the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', which organized the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name = "Kerem" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.fmh.org.ar/revista/16/losjud.htm Testimony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011171527/http://fmh.org.ar/revista/16/losjud.htm |date=2007-10-11 }} a survivor salonicien of the Holocaust on the site Fundacion''Memoria del holocausto''&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Jews from Salonika were also integrated into the [[Sonderkommando]]s. On 7 October 1944, they attacked German forces with other Greek Jews, in an uprising planned in advance, storming the crematoria and killing about twenty guards. A bomb was thrown into the furnace of the crematorium III, destroying the building. Before being massacred by the Germans, insurgents sang a song of the Greek partisan movement and the [[Hymn to Liberty|Greek National Anthem]].&lt;ref&gt;Yitschak Kerem, ''Forgotten heroes: Greek Jewry in the holocaust'', in Mr. Mor (ed.), Crisis and Reaction: The Hero in Jewish History, Omaha, Creighton University Press, 1995, p. 229–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[If this is a man]]'', one of the most famous works of literature of the Holocaust, [[Primo Levi]] describes the group thus: "those Greeks, motionless and silent as the Sphinx, crouched on the ground behind their thick pot of soup".&lt;ref name="Levi"&gt;Primo Levi, ''If this is a man'', Julliard, 2007, pp. 121–122 (Chapter: Because of good and evil)&lt;/ref&gt; Those members of the community still alive during 1944 made a strong impression on the author. He noted: "Despite their low numbers their contribution to the overall appearance of the camp and the international jargon is spoken is of prime importance". He described a strong patriotic sense among them, writing that their ability to survive in the camps was partly explained by the fact that "they are among the cohesive of the national groups, and from this point of view the most advanced".

At the end of the Second World War, a violent [[Greek Civil War|civil war]] broke out in Greece. It lasted until 1949, with forces in Athens supported by the British opposition to the powerful Communist ELAS. Some of the Jews of Thessaloniki who had escaped deportation took part in it, either on the government or on the opposition side.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"&gt;[http://www.orbilat.com/Languages/Spanish-Ladino/History/Retorno_del_Inferno.html Retorno del Inferno] Braha Rivlin, ''[[Aki Yerushalayim]]'', No. 49–50, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who fought in the ELAS many were victims, like other supporters, of the repression that fell on the country after the government had regained control of the situation.&lt;ref name = "Aki Yerushalayim" /&gt;

Among the few survivors of the camps, some chose to return to Greece and others emigrated to Western Europe, America or the Palestine Mandate.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt; They were all faced with great difficulties in surviving, as both Greece and all Europe were in a chaotic state in the immediate aftermath of war. They also suffered discrimination from some Ashkenazi survivors who cast doubt on their Jewishness.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt;

The return to Thessaloniki was a shock. Returnees were often the sole survivors from their families. They returned to find their homes occupied by Christian families who had purchased them from the Germans.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt; Initially, they were housed in synagogues. A Jewish Committee was formed to identify the number of survivors, and obtained a list from the [[Bank of Greece]] of 1,800 houses that had been sold to Christians.&lt;ref name = " Aki Yerushalayim "/&gt; The new owners were reluctant to surrender their new dwellings, saying they had legally purchased the houses and that they too had suffered from war.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt; When the war ended, the communist ELAS, which at the time controlled the city, favored the immediate return of Jewish property to its rightful owners.&lt;ref name="restitution"&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Salonica city of ghosts'', p. 422–425.&lt;/ref&gt; Four months later, when the new British-supported right wing government in Athens came to power in Thessaloniki instead, restitution was cumulatively halted. Not only was the government faced with a major housing crisis due to the influx of refugees caused by war, but a number of individuals who had been enriched during the war were also influential in the new right wing administration, with the government's view favouring strengthening all anticommunist ties by adopting a more conciliatory approach to any former collaborators.&lt;ref name="restitution"/&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]] denounced such policies of the postwar administration, and pleaded for the cause of the ''[[Aliyah]]'' Jews.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt; The [[World Jewish Congress]] also aided the Jews of the city; some of the Jews saved from deportation by Greeks chose to convert to [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Orthodoxy]]. Some isolated survivors of the camps made the same choice.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt; There were also several marriages among the post-war survivors.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt; One survivor testified:
&lt;!---Ladino? We don't really require the original here---
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Torni a un Saloniko destruido. Esperava topar a mi ermano adoptado ma de rumores entendi ke el murio de malaria en Lublin. Ya savia ke mis djenitores fueron kemados en sus primeros dias en el kampo de eksterminasion de Aushwitz. Estava solo. Los otros prizonieros ke estavan kon mi no tenian mas a dinguno. En akeyos dias me ati a una djovena ke avia konosido en Bruxelles. No mos despartimos el uno del otro. Los dos eramos reskapados de los kampos. Despues de kurto tiempo mos kazimos, dos refujiados ke no tenian nada, no avia mizmo un rabino para ke mos de la bindision. El direktor de una de las eskolas djudias sirvio de rabino i mos kazo i ansina empesi en una mueva vida.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;---&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I returned to a Salonika destroyed. I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in [[Lublin]]. I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in [[Brussels]]. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there was not even a rabbi to give us the blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.&lt;ref name="Aki Yerushalayim"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1,783 survivors were listed in the 1951 census.

A monument in Thessaloniki to the tragedy of the deportation was erected in 1997.&lt;ref name = "commemoration"&gt;Mark Mazower, ''Salonica city of ghosts'' p. 437–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] went to the city, where he paid tribute to the Sephardic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.elmundo.es/1998/05/29/ultima/29N0107.html Article] of ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' May 29, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The visit followed one he had undertaken at the synagogue of [[Madrid]] in 1992 to commemorate the expulsion of 1492, at which he condemned the decree of expulsion from Spain.

Following the requests of Professors at the Aristotle University, a memorial to the Jewish cemetery lying beneath the foundations of the institution has been unveiled in 2014.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.jta.org/2014/11/10/news-opinion/world/greek-university-unveils-memorial-on-site-of-destroyed-jewish-cemetery  &lt;/ref&gt;

Today, around 1,300 Jews live in Thessaloniki,&lt;ref&gt;Régis Darques, ''Salonica to XX e, the city Ottoman to the Greek mainland'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; making it the second largest Jewish community in Greece after Athens.

[[Israel]]i singer [[Yehuda Poliker]] recorded a song about the deported Jews of Thessaloniki, called 'Wait for me Thessaloniki'.

The community of Thessaloniki accused Germany to pay the manumission payments back, that the Jews of Greece paid for rescuing their family members, after the Nazis asked for this money. Nevertheless, the Nazis did not let them free. The [[European Court of Justice]] dismissed this petition.

The Jewish community of Thessaloniki demands untiringly from the [[Deutsche Bahn]] (the German railway) which is the successor of the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] to reimburse to heirs of Greek Holocaust victims of Thessaloniki for train fares that they were forced to pay for their deportation from Thessaloniki to Auschwitz and Treblinka between March and August 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faktencheckhellas.org/en/one-way-tickets-thessaloniki-auschwitz/ One way tickets Thessaloniki – Auschwitz], June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zug-der-erinnerung.eu/ Zug der Erinnerung/Thessaloniki Zug der Erinnerung (nongovernmental organisation “Train of Commemoration”)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the Jewish community of Greece makes great efforts to establish a Holocaust Museum in the Thessaloniki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greece.greekreporter.com/2013/12/22/holocaust-museum-to-be-build-in-greece/ Holocaust Museum to be built in Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; A permanent pavilion about the Holocaust of Greek Jews in [[KZ Auschwitz]] shall be installed.
A Delegation and the President of the Jewish communities of Greece met in November 2016 with Greek politicians and asked them for support in their demand to get back the community archives of the Jewish community of Thessaloniki from [[Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kis.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1529:2016-11-30-06-05-51&amp;catid=49:2009-05-11-09-28-23 ΠΟΛΙΤΙΚΕΣ ΣΥΝΑΝΤΗΣΕΙΣ ΓΙΑ ΤΑ ΘΕΜΑΤΑ ΤΟΥ ΕΛΛΗΝΙΚΟΥ ΕΒΡΑΪΣΜΟΥ], Retrieved 05.

== Diaspora ==
Today, there are communities of Salonican Jews found in the United States and Israel that preserve the customs of the Jews of Salonika.

*Israel
[[Hechal Yehuda Synagogue]] was founded by Jews from Salonika in [[Tel Aviv]]. It maintains the customs of Salonikan music and prayer.

*United States
Congregation Etz Ahaim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etzahaim.org Etz Ahaim home page]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] congregation, was founded in 1921 by Jews from Salonika in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]]. It is now located in [[Highland Park, New Jersey]]. The reader chants the [[Aramaic]] prayer ''B'rich Shemei'' in Ladino before taking out the [[Torah]] on [[Shabbat]]; it is known as ''Bendichu su Nombre'' in Ladino. Additionally, at the end of Shabbat services, the entire congregation sings the well-known [[Hebrew]] hymn ''Ein Keloheinu'' as ''Non Como Muestro Dio'' in Ladino.

Actress and singer [[Lea Michele]] was featured in an episode of the show Who Do You Think You Are, where she learned about her Salonican Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishstudies.washington.edu/sephardic-studies/sephardic-studies-professor-tv-series/&lt;/ref&gt; Her family, now living in the [[United States]], is part of the diaspora of Salonican Jews.

~United Kingdom

Prior to World War 1 Jews from Salonika and Istanbul arrived in London. They eventually settled in west London opening a beautiful Synagogue in Holland Park in 1928. The community still uses Ladino the prayers although very few still speak the language. Unfortunately over the years they adopted the customs and music of the indigenous Spanish &amp; Portuguese community but on the High Holidays have largely preserved the tunes and liturgy of their forefathers.

== Culture ==

=== Language ===
{{Main|Ladino language}}
Generally, Jews who emigrated adopted the language of their new country, but this was not true of the Sepharadim of the Ottoman Empire, who arrived en masse, and retained the use of their language. The Jews of Salonika thus are known to have used Spanish, the Judeo-Spanish (''djudezmo''), that is neither more nor less than a dialect of Spanish having evolved independently since the 15th century. They prayed and studied in [[Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]] and used, as do all other Sephardic communities, what [[Haïm Vidal Sephiha]] called the language "layer", [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]], which consisted of a Hebrew translation of texts into a Spanish respecting a Hebrew word order and syntax.&lt;ref name="Sephiha"&gt;[[Haim Vidal Séphiha]], ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 79–95.&lt;/ref&gt; These two languages, djudezmo and Ladino, were written in Hebrew characters as well as Latin characters. In addition to these languages that had evolved in exile, the Jews of Salonika sometimes spoke [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the language of the Ottoman Empire, written in Arabic characters. The [[haskala]] taught by the French Jews has, in turn, encouraged teaching the French language in [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] schools. Italian is also taught to a lesser extent. After the Greeks took Salonika in 1912, [[Modern Greek|Greek]] was taught at school and has been spoken by several generations of Jewish Salonicans. Today it is the language that predominates among Thessalonian Jews.

Modern Salonican ''djudezmo'' now include phrases from various other immigrant groups including Italian. French phrases have also become popular to the point that Prof. Haïm-Vidal Séphiha speaks of "judéo-fragnol."&lt;ref name="Sephiha"/&gt;

Some Jewish family surnames of the past or present include: Allatini, Arouch, [[Carasso family|Carasso]], Cohen, Florentin, Kapon, Levy, Mallah, Modiano, Nahmias, Salem, Saltiel, Sason, while of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] origin are the: Algaba, Benrubi, Beraha, Buenaventura, Cuenca, Curiel, Errera, Molcho, Navarro, Saporta, Saragussi, Ventura etc.

=== Music ===
{{see also|Sephardic music}}
[[File:Thessaloniki Jew Women Dansing Postcard.jpg|thumb|160px|Jewish women dancing postcard]]
The Jews of the city, and especially the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardis]], had a long and notable musical tradition with its roots in the medieval [[Andalusia]]. Nowadays, artists like [[Françoise Atlan]], [[Yasmin Levy]], [[David Saltiel]] and [[Savina Yannatou]] make efforts for its revival.

=== Cuisine ===
The sociologist [[Edgar Morin]] said that the core of every culture is its cuisine, and that this applies especially to the Jews of Salonika, the community from which he descends.&lt;ref name="cuisine"&gt;Méri Badi, ''Salonique 1850–1918, la "ville des Juifs" et le réveil des Balkans'', p. 96–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cuisine of the Jews of the city was a variant of the Judeo-Spanish cuisine, which is itself influenced by the large ensemble of Mediterranean cuisine. It was influenced by the Jewish dietary rules of [[kashrut]], which include prohibitions on the consumption of [[pork]] and mixtures of dairy and meat products, and religious holidays that require the preparation of special dishes. However, its key feature was its Iberian influence. [[Fish]], abundant in this port city, was consumed in large quantities and in all forms: fried, baked ("''al orno''"), marinated or [[braising|braised]] ("''abafado''"), and was often accompanied by complex sauces. Seen as a symbol of fertility, fish was used in a marriage rite called ''dia del peche'' ("day of fish") on the last day of wedding ceremonies, in which the bride stepped over a large dish of fish that was then consumed by the guests.&lt;ref name="cuisine"/&gt; Vegetables accompanied all the dishes, especially onions; garlic was on hand but was not used, since the Ashkenazic synagogues were major consumers of garlic and had been given the nickname "''El kal del ajo''," "the garlic synagogue." [[Strained yogurt|Greek yogurt]], widely consumed in the Balkans and [[Anatolia]], was also highly appreciated, as well as cream. In anticipation of Shabbat, ''[[hamin]]'' was prepared. A Judeo-Spanish variant of the Ashkenazi [[cholent]] and the North African [[dafina]], ''chamin'' was a meat stew with vegetables (wheat, chickpeas, white beans) that were let simmer until the Saturday midday meal. In preparation for [[Passover]], housewives filled locked chests with sweets, figs and dates stuffed with almonds, [[marzipan]] and the popular ''chape blanche'' (white jam), which consisted of sugar water and lemon. Wine was reserved for religious rituals, but Sephardim, like their Greek and Muslim neighbors, were major consumers of [[Raki (alcoholic beverage)|raki]]. They also favored sugary drinks made of prune, cherry and apricot syrup, which they drank at the end of the large festive meal.&lt;ref name="cuisine"/&gt;

In archeology, a '''hut circle''' is a circular or oval depression in the ground with evidence of a low stone wall around it that used to be the foundation of a [[round house (dwelling)|round house]]. The superstructure of such a house would have been made of timber and thatch. They are numerous in parts of upland Britain and most date to around the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy (2008). ''Oxford Concise Dictionary of Archaeology'', 2nd ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford and New York, p. 202. {{ISBN|978-0-19-953404-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut circles are usually around 5 to 25 feet in internal diameter, with the rocks themselves being 2-3 feet wide and around 3 feet high. Hut circles were also almost certainly covered by conical rounded roofs and supported by posts that were internal and sometimes external.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Hemp and C. A. Gresham (1944). Hut-circles in North-west Wales. Antiquity, 18, pp 183-196. doi:10.1017/S0003598X00018627.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Southwest England ==
[[File:Grimspound Bronze age settlement on Dartmoor.jpg|thumb|right|[[Grimspound]] on [[Dartmoor]], a late Bronze Age settlement]]
Hut circles are particularly numerous on [[Dartmoor]] where there are an estimated 5,000, one of the best known sites being [[Grimspound]]. It is exceptionally well preserved owing to its solid stone construction, the numerous hut circles being enclosed by a stone wall. It dates to the [[Late Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/round_house.htm ''The Roundhouses of Dartmoor''] at www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk. Accessed on 3 Sep 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Grimspound circle 1.jpg|thumb|One of Grimspound's hut circles]]
It was first settled about 1300 BC. The 24 hut circles are surrounded by a massive granite perimeter wall, which may have stood at 1.7 metres in places. The roundhouses, with an average diameter of 3.4 metres, were each built of a double ring of granite slabs with a rubble infill &amp;ndash; a technique still used in [[dry-stone wall]]ing. one, Hut 3, has a surviving porchway, with the two jamb stones still upright, although the [[lintel]] has fallen. There is good evidence of human activity:  pottery, scrapers, and [[pot boiler]]s were found in the huts during Victorian excavations. However, little organic artefacts survived in the acidic soil. Ashes were found at a central hearth in each hut.

== Scotland ==
Hut circles also occur in Northern Scotland, but it is unclear if there is a connection between these and the hut circles in England. These hut circles were usually in pairs, and surrounded by groups of [[tumuli]] of sepulchral origin. These hut circles were around 40 feet in diameter and 20-30 yards apart.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, G. (1865). Some further notes upon pre-historic hut-circles. Journal of the Anthropological Society of London, 3, lx-lxv&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Byrom''' or '''John Byrom of Kersal''' or '''John Byrom of Manchester''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (29 February 1692 – 26 September 1763) was an English poet, the inventor of a revolutionary system of [[shorthand]] and later a significant landowner. He is most remembered as the writer of the lyrics of [[Anglican]] hymn ''Christians awake! Salute the happy morn'', which was supposedly a Christmas gift for his daughter.

== Early life ==
Byrom was descended from an old genteel [[Lancashire]] family. Ralph Byrom came to [[Manchester]] from [[Lowton]] in 1485 and became a prosperous wool merchant. His son Adam acquired property in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], [[Darcy Lever]], [[Bolton]] and [[Ardwick]] (though his wealth did not prevent his mentally ill daughter from being accused of witchcraft). Edward Byrom helped to foil a Royalist plot to seize Manchester in 1642.

Byrom was born at what is now [[The Old Wellington Inn]] (part of the Old Shambles), Manchester, in 1692. (The property was then used as an office for market tolls, with accommodation on the upper floors.) The Wellington Inn, now a major tourist attraction, has a plaque in the bar area which commemorates his birth. However, some sources claim that he was born at [[Kersal Cell]] in [[Kersal|Lower Kersal]] in the township of [[Broughton, Salford|Broughton]], near [[City of Salford|Salford]], just outside Manchester. According to Bailey&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Albert Edward (1950). The Gospel in Hymns. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 112–114.&lt;/ref&gt; he was one of the tallest men in the kingdom.

His privileged background enabled him to obtain an excellent education, including [[The King's School, Chester]], and [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School, London]]. He studied at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], becoming a fellow there in 1714. He subsequently travelled abroad and studied medicine at [[Montpellier]] in France.&lt;ref name=acad /&gt;

== Byrom and shorthand ==
[[File:Advert for Byroms Shorthand, Daily Gazetteer (London Edition) 6 May 1741.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper advertisement for Byrom's shorthand system from the [[Daily Gazetteer]], 1741]]
Byrom invented a system of [[shorthand]]&lt;ref name="shorthand"&gt;see:[http://www.wardsbookofdays.com/29february.htm Ward's book of days: February 29th] Retrieved on 7 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and, having perfected this, returned to England in 1716. Some of the inhabitants of Manchester tried to persuade him to set up a medical practice in the town, but he decided that his abilities were insufficient to pursue a medical career and resolved to teach his shorthand system instead. Shortly after coming into his family inheritance in 1740, he patented his ''New Universal Shorthand''. This system of shorthand, officially taught at both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, was used by the clerk of the House of Lords.

[[File:Byrom shorthand consonants.png|500px]]

On 16 June 1742, His Majesty [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] secured to John Byrom, M.A., the sole right of publishing for a certain term of years (21) the art and method of shorthand invented by him.

His system of shorthand was posthumously published as ''The Universal English Shorthand'' which, although superseded in the nineteenth century, marked a significant development in the history of shorthand.&lt;ref name="shorthand" /&gt; It was used by [[John Wesley|John]] (1703–1791) and [[Charles Wesley]] (1707–1788), founders of Methodism, who recorded their self-examinations in coded diaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/byrom.htm |title=John Byrom |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208001632/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/byrom.htm |archivedate= 8 December 2003 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
The ancestral home of the Byrom family is Byrom Hall at Slag Lane in [[Lowton]] (the lane facing the hall is called Byrom Lane). He lived here from time to time, but seems to have largely resided in a town house in Manchester and at [[Kersal Cell]].

Byrom had several children, but his favourite was his daughter Dorothy, known as Dolly. In December 1745, after a romp with Dolly, he promised to write her something for Christmas; it was to be written especially for her and no one else. The delighted Dolly reminded her father of his promise each day as Christmas grew nearer. On Christmas morning, when she ran down to breakfast, she found several presents awaiting her. Among them was an envelope addressed to her in her father's handwriting. It was the first thing she opened and, to her great delight, it proved to be a Christmas carol entitled "Christians awake! Salute the happy morn". The original manuscript, headed with "Christmas Day for Dolly", was first published in Harrop's ''[[Manchester Mercury]]'' in 1746.

== Literary remains ==
Although Byrom is probably best remembered for this Christmas carol, he was regarded by his contemporaries as a poet and a literary man. Most of his poems, the best-known of which is ''My spirit longeth for Thee'', were religious in tone. He is also remembered for his [[epigram]]s and, above all, his coinage of the phrase ''[[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]]'' (in connection with a dispute about the merits of the two composers, Handel and Bononcini).

== A man of mystery ==
Byrom did not lead an ordinary provincial life. He was a member of the [[Royal Society]] while [[Sir Isaac Newton]] was president, moving in some very influential social and intellectual circles in London and elsewhere. Modern research has revealed him to be something of a man of mystery. In the first place there is the question of his political views. It was once thought that he was a closet [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], but it is now suggested that he may have acted as a double agent, the "Queen's Chameleon". His views might be summed up in the verse that he composed, in the form of a toast:

:God bless the King! (I mean our faith's defender!)
:God bless! (No harm in blessing) the Pretender.
:But who Pretender is, and who is King,
:God bless us all! That's quite another thing!

Byrom died in 1763 and is buried in his family's private chapel, which is now known as Jesus Chapel in [[Manchester Cathedral]], Manchester, England. His papers, though preserved for some time after his death, were mysteriously destroyed in the nineteenth century. A [[freemason]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/268975 This Wooden O, at The Economist]&lt;/ref&gt; few surviving items have suggested that he may have belonged to an early quasi-masonic society, known as the "Cabala Club", similar to the [[Spalding Gentlemen's Society|Gentleman's Club of Spalding]], and pursued [[occult]] interests.

His library of books and manuscripts was donated to [[Chetham's Library]] by his descendent [[Eleanora Atherton]] in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chethams.org.uk/byrom.htm |publisher=Chethams Library |title=John Byrom Collection |accessdate=6 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318042826/http://www.chethams.org.uk/byrom.htm |archivedate=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Libya}}
The '''Libyan resistance movement''' was the name given to the Libyan side during the "[[Pacification of Libya]]", which occurred between 1923 and 1932. 

==History==

The [[Italian Empire]] seized the territory that is modern day Libya from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and -according to dictator [[Gaddafi]] and his followers- implemented a [[genocide]] campaign on its occupants in Cyrenaica, killing 20% of its population: the Italians committed many [[war crimes]] during the 'pacification,' including [[chemical warfare]], not taking prisoners of war and instead killing even if they surrendered, and many more horrendous acts. &lt;ref&gt;Gaddafi stated that: women were [[raped]] and [[disembowelled]], libraries were burned, homes and religious institutes were bombed). The Libyans were fighting against the Italians' tanks and [[aerial warfare]] with guns. They were also pushed into [[concentration camps]], an idea that would later be used by Hitler against the Jews, and [[ethical cleansing]] was also done&lt;/ref&gt;. Italian historians -like Tripodi-denied all these accusations as excessive and often "fake". 

In the late 1930s the Libyans in the coastal areas were granted Italian citizenship as part of the fascist efforts to assimilate them and create the [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Imperial Italy]] in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica. This reduced the appeal of the Libyan resistance movement to a few Arab/[[Berbers]] populations of the [[Fezzan]] area only, but this was practically non-existent until the arrival of British troops in the area in 1943.
 
===Cyrenaica resistance (1923–1932)===
{{main|Pacification of Libya}}
The Libyan resistance was initially led by [[Omar Mukhtar]] ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] عمر المختار ''‘Umar Al-Mukhtār'') (1862 – 16 September 1931), who was from the [[wiktionary:tribe|tribe]] of Mnifa, born in a small village called [[Zawiyat Janzur|Janzour]] located in the eastern part of [[Cyrenaica|Barqa]]. 

Later [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]] and his [[Senussi]] tribe in the provinces of [[Cyrenaica]] and [[Tripolitania]] started to become opposed to the Italian colonization after 1929, when Italy changed its political promises of moderate "protectorate" to the Senussi (done in 1911) and – because of [[Benito Mussolini]] – started to take complete colonial control of Libya.

Resistance was totally crushed by General [[Rodolfo Graziani]] in the 1930s and the country was again controlled by the Italians with the help of [[Arabs|Arab]] [[Fascism|fascists]], to the point that many Libyan colonial troops fought on the side of Italy between 1940 and 1943: two divisions of Libyan colonial troops were created in the late 1930s and 30,000 native Libyans fought for Italy during [[World War II]].

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist geography''' is a strand of [[critical geography]] that uses the theories and philosophy of [[Marxism]] to examine the [[Spatial analysis|spatial relations]] of [[human geography]]. In Marxist geography, the relations that geography has traditionally analyzed — natural environment and spatial relations — are reviewed as outcomes of the mode of material production. To understand geographical relations, on this view, the social structure must also be examined. Marxist geography attempts to change the basic structure of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peet |first1=J. Richard |title=An Introduction to Marxist Geography |journal=Journal of Geography |date=1985 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=5–10 |doi=10.1080/00221348508979261|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ312759&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ312759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and methodology==

Marxist geography is [[Political_radicalism|radical]] in nature and its primary criticism of the positivist [[spatial science]] centered on the latter's methodologies, which failed to consider the characteristics of [[capitalism]] and abuse that underlie socio-spatial arrangements. As such, early Marxist geographers were explicitly political in advocating for social change and activism; they sought, through application of geographical analysis of social problems, to alleviate [[poverty]] and exploitation in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David. 1973. "Social Justice and the City"&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist geography makes exegetical claims regarding how the deep-seated structures of capitalism act as a determinant and a constraint to human agency. Most of these ideas were developed in the early 1970s by dissatisfied quantitative geographers; [[David Harvey]] is generally regarded as the primary trail-blazer of the Marxist movement in human geography.

In order to accomplish such philosophical aims, these geographers rely heavily upon Marxist social and economic theory, drawing on [[Marxian economics]] and the methods of [[historical materialism]] to tease out the manner in which the means of [[production control]] human spatial distribution in capitalist structures. [[Karl Marx|Marx]] is also invoked to examine how spatial relationships are affected by [[social class|class]]. The emphasis is on structure and structural mechanisms.

[[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] was one of the founders of scientific archaeology and first applied the categories of style on a large, systematic basis to the [[history of art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Robinson |first=Walter |title=Instant Art History |date=February 1995 |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |isbn=0-449-90698-1 |page=240 |chapter=Introduction |quote=The father of official art history was a German named Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–68).}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was "the prophet and founding hero of modern archaeology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=Boorstin|authorlink=Daniel J.

In Britain, post-war archaeologists such as [[W. F. Grimes]] and [[Martin Biddle]] took the initiative in studying this previously unexamined area and developed the archaeological methods now employed in much cultural resource management and [[rescue archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biddle |first1=Martin |last2=Hudson |first2=Daphne M |title=Future of London's Past|date= 1 April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeology increasingly became a professional activity during the first half of the 20th century. Although the bulk of an excavation's workforce would still consist of volunteers, it would normally be led by a professional. It was now possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and other schools, and by the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates of such programs.

==New technology==
Undoubtedly the major technological development in 20th century archaeology was the introduction of [[radiocarbon dating]], based on a theory first developed by American scientist [[Willard Libby]] in 1949. Despite its many limitations (compared to later methods it is inaccurate; it can only be used on organic matter; it is reliant on a dataset to calibrate it; and it only works with remains from the last 10,000 years), the technique brought about a revolution in archaeological understanding. For the first time, it was possible to put reasonably accurate dates on discoveries such as bones. This in some cases led to a complete reassessment of the significance of past finds. Classic cases included the [[Red Lady of Paviland]]. It was not until 1989 that the Catholic Church allowed the technique to be used on the [[Turin Shroud]], indicating that the linen fibres were of medieval origin.

Other developments, often spin-offs from wartime technology, led to other scientific advances. For field archaeologists, the most significant of these was the use of the [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]]. This encompasses a number of [[remote sensing]] techniques, such as [[aerial photography]] and [[satellite imagery]]. Also used is [[LIDAR|light detection and ranging (LIDAR)]], a technology that measures the height of the ground surface and other features in large areas of landscape with resolution and accuracy that was not previously available. Subsurface remote sensing techniques such as [[magnetometry]] and [[ground-penetrating radar]] enable an advanced picture to be built up of what lies beneath the soil before excavation even commences. The entire Roman town of [[Viroconium Cornoviorum|Viroconium]], modern day [[Wroxeter]], has been surveyed by these methods, though only a small portion has actually been excavated.  The application of physical sciences to archaeology, known as archaeometry or [[archaeological science]], is now a major part of archaeology.

Archaeology has also come to use [[Geographic Information System|geographic information systems]], designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and visualize all types of geospatial data.

The discovery in 1991 in the [[Ötztaler Alpen|Ötztaler Alps]] of the prehistorical mummy dubbed [[Ötzi]] resulted in the techniques of [[genetics]] being brought to bear on archaeological science. With the help of [[DNA Analysis|DNA analysis]], scholars were able to ascertain that Ötzi does not belong to any known human population. In the subsequent years, genetics has helped us reconstruct human migrations that occurred during prehistory.

The [[New Testament]] narrative of the life of [[Jesus]] refers to a number of locations in the [[Holy Land]] and a [[Flight into Egypt]]. In these accounts the principal locations for the [[ministry of Jesus]] were [[Galilee]] and [[Judea]], with activities also taking place in surrounding areas such as [[Perea (Bible)|Perea]] and [[Samaria]].&lt;ref name=Alister16 /&gt;

Other places of interest to scholars include locations such as [[Caesarea Maritima]] where in 1961 the [[Pilate Stone]] was discovered as the only archaeological item that mentions the Roman prefect [[Pontius Pilate]], by whose order Jesus was [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]].&lt;ref name=DHarrington32/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reedp18"&gt;''Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence'' by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 {{ISBN|1563383942}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative of the ministry of Jesus in the gospels is usually separated into sections that have a geographical nature: his Galilean ministry follows his baptism, and continues in Galilee and surrounding areas until the death of [[John the Baptist]].&lt;ref name=Alister16 &gt;''Christianity: an introduction'' by Alister E. McGrath 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0901-7}} pages 16-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Redford117 /&gt; This phase of activities in the Galilee area draws to an end approximately in [[Matthew 17]] and [[Mark 9]].

==Archaeology==

No documents written by Jesus exist,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Christology: A Biblical, Historical, and Systematic Study of Jesus]]'' by [[Gerald O'Collins]] 2009 {{ISBN|0-19-955787-X}} pages 1-3 "As regards the 'things which Jesus did', let me note that he left no letters or other personal documents."—[https://books.google.com/books?id=pcTnZV0QVLYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22personal%20documents%22&amp;f=false page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; and no specific [[archaeology|archaeological]] remnants are directly attributed to him. The 21st century has witnessed an increase in scholarly interest in the integrated use of archaeology as an additional research component in arriving at a better understanding of the historical Jesus by illuminating the socio-economic and political background of his age.&lt;ref name=AmyReed&gt;Jonathan L. Reed, "Archaeological contributions to the study of Jesus and the Gospels" in ''The Historical Jesus in Context'' edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al.

Charlesworth in ''Jesus and archaeology'' edited by James H. Charlesworth 2006 {{ISBN|0-8028-4880-X}} pages 11-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gowler102 /&gt;&lt;ref name=EvansArch&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig A.

[[James Charlesworth]] states that few modern scholars now want to overlook the archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea during the time of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Charlesworth11 /&gt; Jonathan Reed states that chief contribution of archaeology to the study of the historical Jesus is the reconstruction of his social world.&lt;ref name=Reed18 /&gt; An example archaeological item that Reed mentions is the 1961 discovery of the [[Pilate Stone]], which mentions the Roman prefect [[Pontius Pilate]], by whose order Jesus was crucified.&lt;ref name=Reed18 &gt;''Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence'' by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 {{ISBN|1-56338-394-2}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Jesus'' by Daniel J. Harrington 2010 {{ISBN|0-8108-7667-1}} page 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research'' by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 {{ISBN|90-04-11142-5}} page 465&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed also states that archaeological finding related to [[coin]]age can shed light on [[Historical criticism|historical critical analysis]]. As an example, he refers to coins with the ""Divi filius" inscription.&lt;ref name=AmyReed/&gt; Although Roman Emperor [[Augustus]] called himself "Divi filius", and not "Dei filius" ([[Son of God]]), the line between being god and [[Demigod|god-like]] was at times less than clear to the population at large, and the Roman court seems to have been aware of the necessity of keeping the ambiguity.&lt;ref name=Rhee /&gt;&lt;ref name=Huskinson81 &gt;''Experiencing Rome: culture, identity and power in the Roman Empire'' by Janet Huskinson 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-415-21284-7}} page 81&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Tiberius]] who was emperor at the time of Jesus came to be accepted as the son of ''divus Augustus''.&lt;ref name=Rhee &gt;''Early Christian literature'' by Helen Rhee 2005 {{ISBN|0-415-35488-9}} pages 159-161&lt;/ref&gt; Reed discusses this coinage in the context of {{bibleverse|Mark||12:13-17|KJV}} (known as [[Render unto Caesar...]]) in which Jesus asks his disciples to look at a coin: "Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?" and then advises them to "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's." Reed states that "the answer becomes much more subversive when one knows that Roman coinage proclaimed Caesar to be God".&lt;ref name=AmyReed/&gt;

David Gowler states that an interdisciplinary scholarly study of archeology, textual analysis and historical context can shed light on Jesus and his teachings.&lt;ref name=Gowler102 &gt;''What are they saying about the historical Jesus?'' by David B. Gowler 2007 {{ISBN|0-8091-4445-X}} page 102&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the archeological studies at [[Capernaum]]. Despite the frequent references to Capernaum in the New Testament, little is said about it there.&lt;ref name=Reed140 &gt;"Jesus and Capernaum: Archeological and Gospel Stratigraohy" in ''Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence' by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 {{ISBN|1-56338-394-2}} page 139-156&lt;/ref&gt; However, recent archeological evidence show that unlike earlier assumptions, Capernaum was poor and small, without even a forum or [[agora]].&lt;ref name=Gowler102 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Charlesworth127 &gt;''Jesus and archaeology'' edited by James H. Charlesworth 2006 {{ISBN|0-8028-4880-X}} page 127&lt;/ref&gt; This archaeological discovery thus resonates well with the scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee.&lt;ref name=Gowler102 /&gt; Other archeological findings support the wealth of the ruling priests in Judea at the beginning of the first century.&lt;ref name=EvansPost /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who Was Jesus?'' by Paul Copan and Craig A. Evans 2001 {{ISBN|0-664-22462-8}} page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Osman Yusuf Kenadid''' ({{lang-so|Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid}}; {{lang-ar|عثمان يوسف كينايديض}}),  was a [[Somali people|Somali]] poet, writer, teacher and ruler.  He created the [[Osmanya alphabet]] for writing [[Somali language|Somali]].

==Biography==
Kenadid grew up in the town of [[Galkayo]], situated in north-central present-day [[Somalia]]. He served as a leader in the [[Majeerteen]] [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] and was the son of the polity's founder, [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Ali Keenadid|Yusuf Ali Kenadid]].

Also a writer, Kenadid published many works on various subjects related to Somali history and science, including textbooks on the [[Somali language]], [[astronomy]], [[geography]] and Somali philosophy. He borrowed significantly from the vast ancient Somali cultural repository, working towards a renaissance of this rich past.&lt;ref name="Twotsl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasaaradda Warfaafinta iyo Hanuuninta Dadweynaha|title=The Writing of the Somali Language|year=1974|publisher=Ministry of Information and National Guidance|pages=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v-GwAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1920s, in response to a national campaign to settle on a standard [[orthography]] for the [[Somali language]] (which had long lost its ancient script), Kenadid devised a phonetically sophisticated [[alphabet]] called [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]] for representing the sounds of Somali.&lt;ref name="Twotsl"/&gt;

Kenadid's Osmanya was subsequently introduced into the local schools in his Sultanate. When the Italian colonial authorities got wind of this, they promptly imprisoned him in [[Mogadishu]] since they feared that the script was a manifestation of nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kaplan, ''Area handbook for Somalia'', (U.S. Govt. Print. Off.: 1969), p.73&lt;/ref&gt; With Kenadid's arrest, all efforts to develop a standard orthography for the Somali language abruptly came to a halt for the next 25 years.&lt;ref name="INST"&gt;Institute of African/American Relations (U.S.), ''Africa special report: bulletin of the Institute of African/American Relations'', Volumes 8–9, (The Institute: 1963), p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of nationalist sentiment that followed the end of the [[Second World War]] – and especially the birth of the [[Somali Youth League]] political party, of which Kenadid was a founding member – brought about a revival of interest in and use of the Osmanya script.&lt;ref name="INST"/&gt; This renaissance would last until the government of then President of Somalia [[Mohamed Siad Barre]] unilaterally elected in 1972 to make the modified [[Somali alphabet|Latin script]] devised by [[Shire Jama Ahmed]] the nation's official writing system.&lt;ref name=Abdullahi&gt;Mohamed Diriye Abdullahi, ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', (Greenwood Press: 2001), p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}

'''Political warfare''' is the use of political means to compel an opponent to do one's will, based on hostile intent.  The term political describes the calculated interaction between a government and a target audience to include another state's government, military, and/or general population.  Governments use a variety of techniques to coerce certain actions, thereby gaining relative advantage over an opponent.  The techniques include [[propaganda]] and [[psychological operations]] (PSYOP), which service national and military objectives respectively.  Propaganda has many aspects and a hostile and coercive political purpose.  Psychological operations are for strategic and tactical military objectives and may be intended for hostile military and civilian populations.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Paul A., On Political War (Washington: National Defense University Press, 1989), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Political warfare's coercive nature leads to weakening or destroying an opponent's political, social, or societal will, and forcing a course of action favorable to a state's interest.  Political war may be combined with violence, [[economic pressure]], [[subversion]], and [[diplomacy]], but its chief aspect is "the use of words, images and ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation, deployment, and continuation of these coercive methods are a function of statecraft for nations and serve as a potential substitute for more direct military action.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, methods like economic sanctions or embargoes are intended to inflict the necessary economic damage to force political change.  The utilized methods and techniques in political war depend on the state's political vision and composition.  Conduct will differ according to whether the state is totalitarian, authoritative, or democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate goal of political warfare is to alter an opponent's opinions and actions in favour of one state's interests without utilizing military power.  This type of organized persuasion or coercion also has the practical purpose of saving lives through eschewing the use of violence in order to further political goals.  Thus, political warfare also involves "the art of heartening friends and disheartening enemies, of gaining help for one's cause and causing the abandonment of the enemies'".&lt;ref&gt;Codevilla, Angelo and Paul Seabury, War: Ends and Means (Washington, DC: Potomac Books, Inc., 2006), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, political warfare is distinguished by its hostile intent and through potential escalation; but the loss of life is an accepted consequence.

==Tools==

===Peaceful===

Political warfare utilizes all instruments short of war available to a nation to achieve its national objectives.  The best tool of political warfare is "effective policy forcefully explained",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Codevilla and Seabury, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; or more directly, "overt policy forcefully backed".&lt;ref&gt;Angelo M. Codevilla, "Political Warfare: A Set of Means for Achieving Political Ends," in Waller, ed., ''Strategic Influence: Public Diplomacy, Counterpropaganda and Political Warfare'' (IWP Press, 2008), 218.&lt;/ref&gt;  But political warfare is used, as one leading thinker on the topic has explained, "when public relations statements and gentle, [[public diplomacy]]-style persuasion – the policies of '[[soft power]]' – fail to win the needed sentiments and actions"  around the world.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Waller, "Getting Serious About Strategic Influence," ''The Journal of International Security Affairs'' 17 (Fall 2009): 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The major way political warfare is waged is through propaganda.  The essence of these operations can be either overt or covert.  "White" or overt propaganda comes from a known source.  "Gray" propaganda, on the other hand, is the "semiofficial amplification of a government's voice".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  [[Radio Free Europe]] and [[Radio Liberty]] are examples of "gray" propaganda during the Cold War. "Black" propaganda, however, is propaganda which originates from an unknown source.  The key to black propaganda is the fact that it most often "appears to come from a disinterested source when in fact it does not".&lt;ref&gt;Codevilla, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are channels which can be used to transmit propaganda.  Sophisticated use of technology allows to disseminate information to a vast number of people. The most basic channel is the spoken word.  This can include live speeches or radio and television broadcasts.  Overt or covert radio broadcasting can be an especially useful tool.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}  The printed word is also very powerful, including pamphlets, leaflets, books, magazines, political cartoons, and planted newspaper articles (clandestine or otherwise).  Subversion, agents of influence, spies, journalists, and "[[useful idiot]]s" can all be used as powerful tools in political warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Codevilla, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aggressive===
[[Image:EasternBloc BorderChange38-48.svg|thumb|left|Soviet expansion: Formation of the Eastern Bloc]]

Political warfare also includes aggressive activities by one actor to offensively gain relative advantage or control over another. Between nation states, it can end in the seizure of power or in the open assimilation of the victimized state into the political system or power complex of the aggressor. This aggressor-victim relationship has also been seen between rivals within a state and may involve tactics like [[assassination]], paramilitary activity, [[sabotage]], [[coup d'état]], [[insurgency]], [[revolution]], [[guerrilla warfare]], and [[civil war]].

*'''Foreign infiltration or liberation''' occurs when a government is overthrown by foreign military or diplomatic intervention, or through covert means.  The campaign's ultimate purpose is to gain control over another nation's political and social structure. The campaign could be led by the aggressor's national forces or by a political faction favorable to the aggressor within the other state. Paul M. Blackstock describes three stages involved in the extension of control by the aggressor over the victim:&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, Paul W. The strategy of subversion: Manipulating the politics of other nations (Chicago: Quadrangle, 1964),&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Penetration or infiltration:''' the deliberate infiltration of political and social groups within a victim state by the aggressor with the ultimate purpose of extending influence and control. The aggressor conceals its endgame, which goes beyond the normal influential nature of diplomacy and involves espionage.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Blackstock, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Forced disintegration or atomization:''' "is the breakdown of the political and social structure of the victim until the fabric of national morale disintegrates and the state is unable to resist further intervention". The aggressor may exploit the inevitable internal tensions between political, class, ethnic, religious, racial, and other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, p.50.&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept is a similar strategy to 'divide and conquer'.
#'''Subversion and defection:''' Subversion is the "undermining or detachment of the loyalties of significant political and social groups within the victimized state, and their transference to the political or ideological causes of the aggressor".&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt; In lieu of total and direct transference, the aggressor may accept intermediate states that still meets its objectives, such as the favor of politically significant individuals. Furthermore, the formation of a counter-elite, made up of influential individuals and key leaders, within the victim state establishes the legitimacy and permanency of a new regime. Defection is the transference of allegiance of key individuals and leaders to the aggressor's camp. The individual could relocate or stay-in-place in the victim country, continually influencing local issues and events in the aggressor's favor. Defectors also provide insider information to the aggressor.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Coup d'état]]''' is the overthrowing of a government through the infiltration of the political, military, and social groups by a small segment of the state apparatus. The small segment exists within the state and targets the critical political levers of power within a government to neutralize opposition to the coup and post-coup governing force. Several pre-existing factors are necessary for a coup:&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, p. 32-56&lt;/ref&gt; political participation being limited to a small portion of the population, independence from foreign power influence and control, and power and decision-making authority concentrated within a political center and not diffused between regional authorities, businesses, or other groups.
A coup utilizes political resources to gain support within the existing state and neutralize or immobilize those who are capable of rallying against the coup. A successful coup occurs rapidly and after taking over the government, stabilizes the situation by controlling communications and mobility. Furthermore, a new government must gain acceptance from the public and military and administrative structures, by reducing the sense of insecurity. Ultimately, the new government will seek legitimacy in the eyes of its own people as well as seek foreign recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; The coup d'état can be led by national forces or involve foreign influence, similar to foreign liberation or infiltration.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

*'''Paramilitary Operations:''' transitional political warfare ranging from small-scale use of violence with primitive organizational structure (e.g. sabotage) to full-scale conventional war. The transition and escalation includes a series of stages and depends on tactical and strategic objectives. Paramilitary activities include infiltration and subversion as well as small group operations, insurrection, and civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Insurgency]]:'''  an organized, protracted political warfare tool designed to weaken the control and eliminate the legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority.&lt;ref&gt;US Army Counterinsurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 (Department of the Army, December 2006), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; An insurgency is an internal conflict, and the primary struggle is to mobilize local populations for political control and gain popular support towards the insurgents' cause.&lt;ref&gt;US Army, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; Insurgencies include political and military objectives, with the end goal of establishing a legitimate, rival state structure.&lt;ref&gt;Luttwak, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; Insurgencies are unconventional military conflicts which incorporate a variety of methods, ranging from coercive tools like intimidation and assassination, to political tools like propaganda and social services. An insurgency's approaches and objectives could involve perpetual disorder and violence demonstrating the government's inability to provide security for the populace, weakening the government and killing or intimidating any effective opposition against the government, intimidating the population and discouraging its participation in – or support for – political or legal processes, controlling or intimidating police and military forces (which limits their ability to respond to insurgent attacks) or by creating government repression by provoking over-reactions by security or military forces.&lt;ref&gt;US Army, p.18,33.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Soviet political warfare in Afghanistan====
The Soviet Union remains a comprehensive example of an aggressive nation which expanded its empire through covert infiltration and direct military involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Blackstock, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following [[World War II]], the Soviet Union believed European economies would disintegrate, leaving social and economic chaos and allowing for Soviet expansion into new territories. The Soviets quickly deployed organizational weapons such as non-political front groups, sponsored 'spontaneous' mass appeals, and puppet politicians. While many of these countries' political and social structures were in post-war disarray, the Soviet Union's proxy communist parties were well-organized and able to take control of these weak, newly formed Eastern European governments.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.186.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the clandestine operations of the Soviet intelligence services and the occupying forces of the Soviet military further infiltrated the political and social spheres of the new satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in 1979, the Soviet Union was unable to successfully penetrate the Afghan society after supporting a coup which brought a new Marxist government to power. While Soviet units were already in Kabul, Afghanistan at the time of the coup, additional Soviet troops arrived to reinforce the units and seize important provincial cities, bringing the total of Soviet troops inside Afghanistan to 125,000–140,000. The Soviets were unprepared for the Afghan resistance which included classic guerrilla tactics with foreign support. In 1989, Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan, having been unable to infiltrate the Afghan society or immobilize the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Doughty, Robert. Warfare in the Western World, Vol. II. (D.C. Health and Company: 1996) p. 954-961.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In antiquity==

[[Image:Simple Labarum2.svg|thumb|The [[Chi-Rho]] symbol]]

The history of political warfare can be traced to antiquity.  The Chinese general and strategist [[Sun Tzu]] captures its essence in the ancient Chinese military strategy book, ''[[The Art of War]]'': "So to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles is not the highest excellence; the highest excellence is to subdue the enemy's army without fighting at all...The expert in using the military subdues the enemy's forces without going to battle, takes the enemy's walled cities without launching an attack, and crushes the enemy's state without protracted war."&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Caleb, The Book of War:  Sun Tzu The Art of Warfare and Karl Von Clausewitz On War (New York: The Modern Library, 2000), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are abundant examples of political warfare in antiquity.  In [[ancient Greece]], a famous example is that of the [[Trojan Horse]], which used deception for tactical military objectives.  Propaganda was commonly utilized, including Greek rhetoric and theatre which used words and images to influence populations throughout the Hellenic world.  This practice has left a lasting legacy of speech as a mechanism of political power, greater than force in solving disputes and inducing submission.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  During this same period, [[Alexander the Great]] used coinage imprinted with his own image, indirectly forcing conquered nations to accept his legitimacy as national ruler and to unite disparate nations together under his dominion.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome]] utilized similar political warfare as the Greeks including rhetoric, as displayed by Cicero; and art, as seen in coinage, statues, architecture, engineering, and mosaics.  All of these elements were intended to portray Rome's imperial dominance over its subject nations and the superior nature of Roman society.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a religious vision, the emperor [[Constantine I]] in AD 330 bound the Roman state to the universal [[Christian Church]].  In doing so, he linked "religious commitment with imperial ambition" that proved to be quite successful and powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  One long-lasting symbol of this is the [[Chi Ro]], which forms the first two letters of the Greeks' name for [[Christ]].  This symbol was used for over one thousand years by Constantine's successors as a symbol of "imperial majesty and divine authority"&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and still is a powerful symbol within [[Christianity]].

==In the United States==

===Creation of political warfare capacity===
[[Image:US-MarshallPlanAid-Logo.svg|thumb|right|Logo used on aid delivered to European countries during the [[Marshall Plan]].]]

[[American foreign policy]] demonstrates a tendency to move towards political warfare in times of tension and perceived threat, and toward public diplomacy in times of improved relations and peace.  American use of political warfare depends on its central political vision of the world and its subsequent foreign policy objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, the threat of Soviet expansion brought two new aims for American political warfare:
#To restore Western Europe through military, economic, and political support
#To weaken the Soviet hold on Eastern Europe through propaganda&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Harry S. Truman]] established a government political warfare capability in the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. The act created the [[U.S. National Security Council]], which became the infrastructure necessary to apply military power to political purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the United States crafted the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided funding to rebuild, from 1947 to 1951, the European countries devastated by war.  President Truman voiced the United States' national, universalist vision for political warfare against the Soviet Union in an address before Congress on March 12, 1947, thereby establishing the [[Truman Doctrine]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.&lt;br /&gt;
One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.&lt;br /&gt;
The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio; fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms. &lt;br /&gt;
I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way.&lt;br /&gt;
I believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes. &lt;br /&gt;
The seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want. They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife. They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died. We must keep that hope alive.&lt;br /&gt;
The free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms.&lt;br /&gt;
If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world – and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation.&lt;ref&gt;President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress, March 12, 1947, (Avalon Project, [[Yale Law School]]), [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/trudoc.asp Yale.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Containment policy===

The Truman Doctrine was the post-WWII basis for American political warfare operations on which the United States government went further to formulate an active, defensive strategy to contain the Soviet threat.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.192.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 May 1948, [[George F. Kennan]], the father of the [[containment policy]], wrote the Policy Planning Staff Memorandum titled [http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/johnson/65ciafounding3.htm "The Inauguration of Organized Political Warfare"].  This [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) memo established a directorate of political warfare operations, under the control of the NSC, known as the Consultative (or Evaluation) Board of the National Security Council.  This directorate fell under the authority of the Secretary of State, while the Board had complete authority over covert political operations.  It recognized political warfare as one instrument in the United States' grand strategy.  Kennan defined 'political warfare' as "the employment of all means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives.  Such actions are both overt and covert.  They range from such overt actions as political alliances, economic measures (such as ERP – the Marshall Plan), and 'white' propaganda to such covert operations as clandestine support of 'friendly' foreign elements, 'black' psychological warfare and even encouragement of underground resistance in hostile states."&lt;br /&gt;

The memo further defined four projects that were activated by the Board to combat growing Communist influence abroad, including:
*'''Liberation Committees:''' to encourage the formation of a public American organization which will sponsor selected political refugee committees to give support and guidance to national movements gestating in the Soviet World;
*'''Support of indigenous anti-communist elements:''' within threatened countries of the free world, to include covertly using private intermediaries;
*'''Underground activities behind the Iron Curtain'''
*'''Preventive direct action in free countries:''' only in cases of dire necessity.  This covert operation involved: control over anti-sabotage activities in the Venezuelan oil fields, American sabotage of Near Eastern oil installations on the verge of Soviet capture, and designation of key individuals threatened by the Kremlin who should be protected or removed elsewhere.

===Cold War era===
[[Image:RFE logoFC wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]] logo]]
{{Further|Cold War}}
The United States used gray and black propaganda research, broadcasting, and print media operations during the Cold War to achieve its political warfare goals.  These operations were conducted against Eastern European targets from Western Europe by two public-private organizations supported partly by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the NSC, and partly by private corporations.  These organizations were Free Europe, which was launched in 1941 and targeted Eastern Europe, and the American Committee for Liberation (AmComLib) created in 1951 to broadcast information into Soviet Russia.  Both were renamed shortly thereafter and combined as [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many RFE/RL recruits came either from European emigrants families who were strongly anti-Communist or from US government agencies, most notably from CIA.  Officially, "the US government denied any responsibility for the radios and took care to conceal the channels of funding, personnel recruitment, and policy influence.  Obviously, the major support was American, but it was plausibly not official American and it could be excluded from diplomatic intercourse and international legal complication."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;  RFE/RL was considered to be a gray operation until its existence was publicly acknowledged by "activists" in the United States during the late 1960s.  The goal of the radios was to present the truth to suppressed peoples behind the Iron Curtain "to aid in rebuilding a lively and diversified intellectual life in Europe which could...defeat Soviet...incursions on their freedom".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.202.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, [[Voice of America]] (VOA) started broadcasting to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] citizens in 1947 under the pretext of countering "more harmful instances of [[Soviet propaganda]] directed against American leaders and policies" on the part of the internal Soviet Russian-language media.&lt;ref name="whitton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=John B. Whitton |year=1951 |title=Cold War propaganda |journal=[[American Journal of International Law]] |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=151–153 |jstor=2194791}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union responded by initiating electronic [[radio jamming|jamming]] of VOA broadcasts on April 24, 1949.&lt;ref name="whitton"/&gt;

In the fall of 1950 a group of scholars including physicists, historians and psychologists from [[Harvard University]], the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[RAND Corporation]] undertook a research study of [[psychological warfare]] for the [[Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=206|plainurl=yes}}|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Project Troy]] Report to the Secretary of State'', presented to Secretary of State on 1 February 1951, made various proposals for political warfare, including possible methods of minimizing the effects of Soviet jamming on the Voice of America broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1951v01/d326 |title=Memorandum by the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs (Barrett) to the Director of the Policy Planning Staff (Nitze) |date=1951-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be assumed that the Truman administration tried to implement plans established by the Project Troy in the project ''Overload and Delay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=77|plainurl=yes}}|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the latter was to break the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] system by increasing the number of input points in the system and by creating complex and unpredictable situations requiring action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=76|plainurl=yes}}|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An overt, non-governmental form of political warfare during the Cold War emerged after [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan's]] 8 June 1982 speech to the British Parliament.  In his speech, Reagan appealed for a "global crusade for democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ree, "Political Warfare Old and New: The State and Private Groups in the Formation of the National Endowment for Democracy," ''49th Parallel,'' 22 (Autumn 2008): 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, the [[National Endowment for Democracy]] (NED) was created in December 1983.  The NED was a [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) based on four fundamental foundations:
* The National Democratic Institute
* The National Republican Institute to dispense funds and training to politicians and political parties;
* The Center for International Private Enterprise to provide training, funding and networking opportunities for business associations;
* [[AFL-CIO]] to assist foreign trade unions.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Pee, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
The NED "funded programs in support of candidates acceptable to the US in elections in Grenada, Panama, El Salvador, and Guatemala throughout 1984 and 1985 in order to prevent communist victories, and create stable pro-US governments".&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  It was also active in Europe, funding groups to carry promote pro-North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]) propaganda in Britain, as well as a "right wing French student organisation...linked to fascist paramilitaries".  Other notable efforts included anti-Sandinista propaganda and opposition efforts in Nicaragua as well as anti-Communist propaganda and opposition efforts in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland between 1984 and 1990.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; According to a 1991 interview in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' with one of the creators of the NED, [[Allen Weinstein]], "a lot of what we (NED) do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the CIA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inthenameofdemocracy.org/en/node/132|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229015517/http://inthenameofdemocracy.org/en/node/132|title=Innocence Abroad: The New World of Spyless Coups - In the Name of Democracy|archivedate=29 February 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
Throughout the Cold War, the [[Soviet Union]] was committed to political warfare on classic totalitarian lines and continued to utilize propaganda towards internal and external audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[Active measures]]" (Russian: Активные мероприятия) was a Russian term to describe its political warfare activities both at home and abroad in support of Soviet domestic and foreign policy.  Soviet efforts took many forms, ranging from propaganda, forgeries, and general disinformation to assassinations.  The measures aimed to damage the enemy's image, create confusion, mould public opinion, and to exploit existing strains in international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Bittman, Ladislav, ''[[The KGB and Soviet Disinformation|The KGB and Soviet Disinformation: An Insider’s View]]''. (Washington: Pergamaon-Brassey’s, 1985) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet Union dedicated vast resources and attention to these active measures, believing that "mass production of active measures would have a significant cumulative effect over a period of several decades".&lt;ref&gt;Bittman, p.43-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soviet active measures were notorious for targeting intended audience's public attitudes, to include prejudices, beliefs, and suspicions deeply rooted in the local history.  Soviet campaigns fed disinformation that was psychologically consistent with the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Bittman, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of Soviet active measures include:

*'''[[Trust Operation]]''':  was a counterintelligence operation conducted by Soviet intelligence against domestic and foreign adversaries.  The operation, which ran from 1921–1929, set up a fake anti-Bolshevik underground organization, "Monarchist Union of Central Russia", MUCR (Монархическое объединение Центральной России, МОЦР), which claimed to plan a conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government.  The Trust aimed to create the view that communism was over in Russia and the Soviet Union would abandon its revolutionary ways.  Western intelligence services supported the fake anti-Bolshevik dissidents who provided false intelligence reports.  The operation's purpose was to identify real dissidents and anti-Bolsheviks, internally and abroad.  The operation resulted in the arrests and executions of Russian exile leaders and the general demoralization of anti-Soviet efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Edward Jay. ''Deception''. (Simon and Schuster: 1989.), p. 23-27.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The "Rumor" Campaign''': In October 1985, a Soviet weekly ''Literaturnaya Gazeta'' drew attention to a story in an obscure Indian paper, ''The Patriot'', which alleged that the U.S government engineered the AIDS virus during biological warfare research in the U.S., and that it was being spread throughout the world by U.S. servicemen who had been used as guinea pigs for the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Godson, Roy, "'AIDS—Made in the USA': Moscow's Contagious Campaign," Ladislav Bittman, ed., ''The New Image-Makers: Soviet Propaganda &amp; Disinformation Today''. (Washington: Pergamaon-Brassey's,  1988.) Chapter 10, pp.221-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  The story was broadcast by Moscow's Radio Peace and Progress in English and Turkish broadcasts to Asian countries, some of which had important U.S. military bases.  The "Rumor" campaign was highly effective in the 1980s and continues to resurface today throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bittman, p.221&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist strategy and tactics continually focused on revolutionary objectives, "for them the real war is the political warfare waged daily under the guise of peace".&lt;ref&gt;James D. Atkinson, ''The Politics of Struggle:  The Communist Front and Political Warfare'' (Chicago:  Henry Regnery Co,. 1966), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; the purpose of which is to "disorient and disarm the opposition...to induce the desire to surrender in opposing peoples...to corrode the entire moral, political, and economic infrastructure of a nation".&lt;ref&gt;William R. Kintner and Joseph Z. Kornfeder.  ''The New Frontier of War'' (Chicago, Henry Regnery Co., 1966), p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lenin's mastery of "politics and struggle", remained objectives for the Soviet Union and other global communist regimes, such as the [[People's Republic of China]].

===China and Taiwan===
{{Further|Cross-Strait relations}}
[[File:ROC Political Warfare Logo.svg|right|thumb|Logo of political warfare in Taiwan]]

China's political leaders during this century have had to first create a nation before they could proceed to contend with other national actors in the international arena.  Consequently, insofar as both the [[Chinese Communist Party]] and the [[Kuomintang]] subscribed to a political warfare concept during their formative years of struggle, the concept was as much concerned with creating national identity and defeating domestic adversaries as it was with China's ability to compete in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Joseph J., Jr. Political Warfare:  The Chinese Nationalist Model. (PHD Thesis, The American University 1974), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of China]] government in [[Taiwan]] recognized that its Communist adversary astutely employed political warfare to capitalize upon Kuomintang weaknesses over the years since [[Sun Yat-sen]] first mounted his revolution in the 1920s, and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s regime had come to embrace a political warfare philosophy as both a defensive necessity and as the best foundation for consolidating its power in hope of their optimistic goal of "retaking the mainland".  Both the Nationalist and Communist Chinese political warfare doctrines stem from the same historical antecedents at the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] in 1924 under Soviet tutelage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Heinlein, Joseph J., Jr. ''Political Warfare: The Chinese Nationalist Model''. (Ph.D. thesis, The American University 1974), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nationalist Chinese experience with political warfare can be treated in a much more tangible way than merely tracing doctrinal development.  In Taiwan today, the concept is virtually synonymous with the [[Fu Hsing Kang College|General Political Warfare Department]] of the Ministry of National Defense, which has authored political doctrine and is the culmination of a series of organizational manifestations of its application.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

'''Processual archaeology''' (formerly the '''New Archaeology''') is a form of [[archaeological theory]] that had its genesis in 1958 with the work of [[Gordon Willey]] and [[Philip Phillips (archaeologist)|Philip Phillips]], ''Method and Theory in American Archaeology,'' in which the pair stated that "American archaeology is anthropology or it is nothing" (Willey and Phillips, 1958:2), a rephrasing of [[Frederic William Maitland]]'s comment: "My own belief is that by and by anthropology will have the choice between being history and being nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=873&amp;chapter=70328&amp;layout=html |title= The Collected Papers of Frederic William Maitland, vol. 3 (1911) |accessdate=2009-02-08 |last= Fisher |first= H. A. L.|authorlink = H. A. L. Fisher | author2=Maitland, Frederic William |work= |publisher= The Online Library of Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea implied that the goals of [[archaeology]] were, in fact, the goals of [[anthropology]], which were to answer questions about humans and human society. That was a critique of the former period in archaeology, the [[Cultural-history archaeology|Culture-Historical]] phase in which archaeologists thought that any information that artifacts contained about past people and past ways of life was lost once the items became included in the archaeological record. All they felt could be done was to catalogue, describe, and create timelines based on the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, 1989:148&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of this new phase in archaeology claimed that with the rigorous use of the [[scientific method]] it was possible to get past the limits of the archaeological record and learn something about how the people who used the artifacts lived. [[Colin Renfrew]], a proponent of the new processual archaeology, observed in 1987 that it focuses attention on "the underlying historical processes which are at the root of change". Archaeology, he noted "has learnt to speak with greater authority and accuracy about the [[Historical ecology|ecology of past societies]], their technology, their economic basis and their social organization. Now it is beginning to interest itself in the ideology of early communities: their religions, the way they expressed rank, status and group identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Renfrew]], ''Archaeology and Language: the puzzle of Indo-European origins'' 1987:6, and "6. Language, population and social organization: a processual approach" 120ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical frame at the heart of processual archaeology is [[cultural evolutionism]].  Processual archaeologists are, in almost all cases, cultural evolutionists.  It is from this perspective that they believe they can understand past cultural systems through the remains they left behind.  This is because processual archaeologists adhere to [[Leslie White]]'s theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic (outside the body) means of environmental adaptation for humans.&lt;ref&gt;White, 1959:8&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they study cultural adaptation to environmental change rather than the bodily adaptation over generations, which is dealt with by evolutionary biologists. This focus on environmental adaptation is based on the [[cultural ecology]] and multilinear evolution ideas of anthropologists such as [[Julian Steward]].  As exosomatic adaptation, culture is determined by environmental constraints. The result of this is that processual archaeologists propose that cultural change happens within a predictable framework and seek to understand it by the analysis of its components.   Moreover, since that framework is predictable, then science is the key to unlocking how those components interacted with the cultural whole.&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, 1989:289&lt;/ref&gt; What this all means to processual archaeologists is that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary "processes" in cultural development, which will be adaptive relative to the environment and therefore not only understandable, but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood.  Thus one should be able to virtually completely reconstruct these "cultural processes."  Hence came the name "processual archaeology".  Its practitioners were also called "new archaeologists".&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, 1989:295&lt;/ref&gt;

Methodologically, the advocates of the New Archaeology had to come up with ways of analyzing the archaeological remains in a more scientific fashion.  The problem was that no framework for this kind of analysis existed.  There was such a dearth of work in this area that it led Willey and Phillips to state in 1958, "So little work has been done in American archaeology on the explanatory level that it is difficult to find a name for it".&lt;ref&gt;Willey and Phillips, 1958:5&lt;/ref&gt; Different researchers had different approaches to this problem.  [[Lewis Binford]] felt that ethno-historical information was necessary to facilitate an understanding of archaeological context.&lt;ref&gt;Binford 1962:21&lt;/ref&gt; Ethno-historical (history of peoples) research involves living and studying the life of those who would have used the artifacts - or at least a similar culture.  Binford wanted to prove that the [[Mousterian]] assemblage, a group of stone artifacts from France during the [[ice age]], was adapted to its environment, and so Binford spent time with the [[Nunamiut]] of [[Alaska]], a people living in conditions very similar to those of France during the period in question.  Binford had a good deal of success with this approach, and though his specific problem ultimately eluded complete understanding, the ethno-historical work he did is constantly referred to by researchers today and has since been emulated by many.&lt;ref&gt;Watson 1991:267&lt;/ref&gt;

The new methodological approaches of the processual research paradigm include [[logical positivism]] (the idea that all aspects of culture are accessible through the material record), the use of quantitative data, and the [[hypothetico-deductive]] model (scientific method of observation and hypothesis testing).

During the late 1960s and into the 1970s, archaeologist [[Kent Flannery]] began championing the idea that [[Systems theory in archaeology|Systems theory]] could be used in archaeology to attack questions of culture from an unbiased perspective.  Systems theory has proved to be a mixed bag for archaeology as a whole.  It works well when trying to describe ''how'' elements of a culture interact, but appears to work poorly when describing ''why'' they interact the way that they do.  Nevertheless, Systems Theory has become a very important part of processualism, and is perhaps the only way archaeologists can examine other cultures without interference from their own cultural biases.

As an instance, in the field of [[paleolinguistics]], [[Colin Renfrew]], in re-examining [[Proto-Indo-European]] language and making a case for the spread of Indo-European languages through neolithic Europe in connection with the [[Neolithic Revolution|spread of farming]],&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined three basic, primary processes through which a language comes to be spoken in a specific area: initial colonization, replacement and continuous development. From some obvious reasoning he proceeded to some radically new conclusions.

==Further theoretical development==

However, it does seem difficult to sustain the view that the character, scale and rapidity of recent change is of no greater significance than that experienced in other twenty-year spans of archaeological development. We seem rather to have witnessed an interconnected series of dramatic, intersecting and international developments which together may be taken to define new archaeologies within a New Archaeology; whether we choose to use these terms or avoid them is then mainly a personal, political and semantic decision."

}}

In 1973, the processualist [[David L. Clarke|David Clarke]] of [[Cambridge University]] would publish an [[academic paper]] in ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'' claiming that as a discipline, archaeology had moved from its original "noble innocence" through to "self-consciousness" and then onto "critical self-consciousness", a symptom of which was the development of the New Archaeology. As a result, he argued, archaeology had suffered a "loss of innocence" as archaeologists became sceptical of the work of their forebears.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cla73|Clarke 1973]].&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke's paper would later be described as "one of the seminal statements of the New Archaeology, by one of its leading proponents" in Britain, if not elsewhere, by the archaeologists [[Caroline Malone]] and Simon Stoddart.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mal98|Malone and Stoddart 1998]]. p. 676.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processualism's development transformed archaeology, and is sometimes called the "New Archaeology."  With few notable exceptions such as [[Boston University]], universities in America classify archaeology as a sub-discipline of anthropology, while in Europe it is thought to be a subject more like historical studies. It is important to analyze which sciences are close kin because such analysis highlights the questions of what archaeology ought to study and in what ways. Like the other social scientists, the New Archaeologists or processualists wanted to utilize scientific methodology in their work. Archaeology, and in particular archaeology of the historical period, has sometimes been allied more with humanities disciplines such as Classics. The question of where to put archaeology as a discipline, and its concomitant issues of what archaeology ought to study and which methods it ought to use, likely played no small part in the emergence of [[post-processualism]] in Europe.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Legacy==

In his 2010 book on archaeological theory, Mathew Johnson of the [[University of Southampton]] argued that despite the intervening 40 years since its development, the "intellectual questions" first posed by processualism remained "absolutely central" to archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Joh10|Johnson 2010]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Processual archaeologist [[David L. Clarke]] suggested that the New Archaeology would face particular opposition from amateurs, historical archaeologists and practical excavators but argued that such individuals would still benefit from the theory's adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cla73|Clarke 1973]]. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Processualism began to be critiqued soon after it emerged, initiating a theoretical movement that would come to be called [[post-processualism]]. Post-processualist critics consider the main weaknesses of processual archaeology:
*[[environmental determinism]]
*lack of human agency
*view of cultures as [[homeostatic]], with cultural change only resulting from outside stimuli
*failure to take into account factors such as gender, ethnicity, identity, social relations etc.
*supposed objectivity of interpretation

Writing in 1987, the archaeologist [[Christopher Chippindale]] of [[Cambridge University]] spoke on the view of processualism at that time, putting it in the context of the 1960s, when he stated that:

:The sharper students of the current generation reasonably regard the "New Archaeology" in its pristine form as a period piece, as strange an artefact of that remote era as the Paris ''évènements'' or [[Woodstock]]. They have some cause: the then-radical insistence that nothing valuable had been written in archaeology before 1960 matched the [[hippie]] belief that anyone over 30 was too ancient to be intelligent, and the optimism that ''anything'' could be recovered from the archaeological record if only you searched hard enough was the archaeological version of the hope that [[the Pentagon]] could be levitated if only enough people had sufficient faith.&lt;ref&gt;Chippindale, Christopher. 1987. Review of "Processual Archaeology and the Radical Critique". ''Current Anthropology'' Volume 28, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4447">'''Raimondo Guarini''' (1765–1852) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[archaeologist]], [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]], [[poet]], college president, and teacher. He was born on May 12, 1765 in [[Mirabella Eclano]], in the [[province of Avellino]], [[Campania]], [[Italy]], the second of three sons born to upper middle class parents-Angelo and Rosaria Guarini.&lt;ref&gt;Gambino, Nicola. "Raimondo Guarini", pp69-70&lt;/ref&gt;
Raimondo and his younger brother Rafaelle entered the [[Dominican Order]], while the third brother, Dominic Antonio, attended [[medical school]]. Both Raimondo and Rafaelle, after obtaining their educations, were forced to leave the Order when many of the religious houses in Southern Italy were being closed due to government suppression. Raimondo had risen in the Order to the rank of [[Abbot]]. Meanwhile, his older brother, with whom he shared his love of archaeology and epigraphy &lt;ref&gt;Gambino, Nicola. "Raimondo Guarini",pp.101-102&lt;/ref&gt; was becoming a well-known and successful [[medical doctor]] in Naples.

In Naples, Raimondo continued to pursue his studies, obtaining first a teaching position at the local college and later, in 1829, the presidency of the [[Accademia Pontaniana]]. His students were usually the children of the wealthy [[nobility]]. Some of his students and friends included [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand I]], [[Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand II]], and [[Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies|Maria Christina]] of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] royal family and other of their children.
When not teaching, Raimondo found time for his greatest love. This was his archaeological and epigraphical research both at home and in the field. This research was the fuel for his teaching. The discovery of ancient artifacts often in situ, and the analysis of them was the thrill in his life. Raimondo visited so many sites and walked so many places that his fellow townsmen called him "Il Pedatore" ("The Walker") &lt;ref&gt;Francesco Bruno - present owner of the Guarini Villa at #30 Via Guarini, Mirabella Eclano,Italy. "il pedatore-the walker" and an additional local story tells how at only 90 lbs. Raimondo had to load his pockets with stones to keep himself from being blown away by the winds, while going on his expeditions in search of artifacts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guarini wrote portions of the ''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' on [[Campania]] and [[Samnium]]. Raimondo also worked at and on items found at Pompeii, and one of his most important works deals with life in that ancient city. In addition, he was often consulted for his expert opinion in classical matters and worked on the Royal Collections at Naples, such as The Bourbon Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Guarini, Raimondo."Fasti Duumvirali Di Pompei"&lt;/ref&gt;
Guarini corresponded and collaborated with other classical scholars and archaeologists of the time, including [[Germany|German]] archaeologists [[August Emil Braun]] and [[Eduard Gerhard]], and German classical scholar and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Theodor Mommsen]]. The debates with Mommsen were legendary in their time.&lt;ref&gt;Gambino,Nicola "Raimondo Guarini" pp.259-314&lt;/ref&gt;
Guarini was also a pioneer in the study of the [[Oscan language]]. He was a first to create an Oscan/Latin Dictionary. His other works, numbering close to one hundred, range from brief monographs to books. Many of his works can be found today in the libraries of larger colleges and universities (Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Duke, Columbia etc.). By far, the largest collection of his works may be found at the [[Vatican Library]] in [[Rome]].
Guarini played an important role in the popular Classical Movement of the 1800s, centered at Naples in Southern Italy, after the rediscovery of Pompeii. He died on January 8, 1852 at [[Naples]]. A secondary school, Scuola Secondaria Di 1° Grado Statale "R. Guarini" in his hometown of Mirabella Eclano, was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milano.istruzione.lombardia.it/circ2006/allcom_4810_06.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060605215940/http://www.milano.istruzione.lombardia.it/circ2006/allcom_4810_06.doc |archivedate=2006-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daus researches in the field of study "Neue Romania" (New [[Romance studies|Romania]]) for over 40 years, with the focus on the contacts between European and extra-European cultures. He was a visiting professor in [[Mexico City]] for two years, at Colégio de Mexico, and for one year in [[Singapore]], at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, in [[Manila]], at the [[University of the Philippines]], and also in [[Tahiti]], at the Université du Pacifique. Many research trips and lecture tours brought him to [[Europe]], Russia, [[Latin America]], [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]], United States, Canada, [[Asia]], [[Africa]], Australia and [[Oceania]].

He is a member of the ''Research Group New Romania'',  who investigate the «products resulting from the contacts of the [[Romanic]] [[culture]]s that expanded across the seas for [[colonialism]], featuring, together with other [[nation]]s, new [[linguistic]] varieties and [[culture]]s».

==Biography==

===Scholarship===
Ronald Daus studied [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[philology]] and languages  ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], Spanish, French, [[Italian language|Italian]]) in [[Hamburg]], [[Lisbon]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Kiel]]. At the same time, as related area, he studied [[orientalism]] ([[Arabic]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://db.romanistik.de/pers/1889-Ronald_Daus Ronald Daus] - Profile at [http://db.romanistik.de/ Romanistik data base] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418054724/http://db.romanistik.de/ |date=2012-04-18 }} (de)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he won a doctorate with a [[thesis]] entitled ''The epic cycle of the [[cangaceiros]] in popular poetry from northeastern Brazil'' (Der epische Zyklus der Cangaceiros in der Volkspoesie Nordostbrasiliens). In 1970 he habilitated on [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]]. He got the call as [[university professor]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]], aged 27. There he hold lectures and proceeded with his researches until he retired in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/presse/expertendienst/themen/kunst_literatur_medien/sprache/index.html Ronald Daus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113003142/http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/presse/expertendienst/themen/kunst_literatur_medien/sprache/index.html |date=2013-01-13 }} - Profile at the [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
The [[Age of Discovery]] would carry, with [[colonialism]], with black [[slave]]s captured in [[Africa]], with eager Portuguese trade men and navigators, with devastating plagues,  [[medieval]] Portuguese popular poetry [[oral tradition]]s into [[Brazil]]. Men and memories would spread through vast plains into the remotest corners of the conquered lands.  [[Bandit]]s like [[Lampião]] and other celebrated [[cangaceiro]]s would embody such traditions. Daus’s first pioneering essay, ''The epic cycle of the cangaceiros in popular poetry from northeastern Brazil''&lt;ref&gt;''Der epische Zyklus der Cangaceiros in der Volkspoesie Nordostbrasiliens'', Colloquium Berlag, Berlin 1969; ''O ciclo épico dos cangaceiros na poesia popular do nordeste'', Fundação Casa de Rui Barbosa, Rio de Janeiro 1982&lt;/ref&gt; would follow their steps and explain how and why they would become national heroes&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/650595?uid=3738880&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=47698771267237 The oligarchical limitations of social banditry in Brazil the case of the “good” thief António Silvino]&lt;/ref&gt; and fund a new kind of [[epic poetry|epic]] literature. [[Northeastern Brazil]] would be the first place where he found testimonies of mischievous merriments of human history&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Amado as engaged writer (''Jorge Amado als engagierter Schriftsteller'', Dortmund, Universität Münster, Sozialforschungsstelle; 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; and an angry [[Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt;Angry Latin America. Self-portrait of a continent (''Zorniges Lateinamerika. Selbstdarstellung eines Kontinent'', Diederichs Verlag, Berlin 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Daus would demonstrate, on the other hand, how other Portuguese settlements, on the other side of the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penangstory.net.my/mino-content-paperanthony.html The History of Penang Eurasians], article by [[Anthony Sibert]] PJK at [http://www.penangstory.net.my/ The Panang Story]&lt;/ref&gt; faraway in [[Malaysia]], would contribute to the «development and maintenance of particular cultural and linguistic practices» &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IINMY97a4l4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;lpg=PA125&amp;dq=Penang++ronald+daus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hdvvxW8XnK&amp;sig=cVsCqdmp-8WYyss8D6tbYybai9E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lz1lT5bgDIGw0QWuudG8CA&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Politics of Portuguese Euro-Asian Identity]&amp;nbsp;– excerpt from Google books (Modern Dreams, an inquiry into power, cultural production and the city space in contemporary urban [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], by Beng-Lan Goh, p 125 SEAP 2002&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when he was seriously concerned with a trifling problem he dared to confront:  the wrath against colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;The Wrath against Colonialism (''Die Entstehung der Kolonialismus'', Wuppertal 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]]an expansion, [[linguistic]] and [[cultural]] interact of humans living overseas, spread all around the world in small groups or vast populations, generated “Euroamerican” and  “Euroasian” communities. Large extra-European cities gather large concentrations of European migrants, among others. That is why they deserve particular attention for anyone concerned with the role of [[romanic]] influence in the [[New World]], mainly as far as it originated typical [[Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolis]], [[Megacities]] or [[Global cities]] reflecting original models, distorting them in local versions. In some cases, out of norm, forced by the growth of their populations or promoting them, big new cities turn into atypique global cities: [[Tijuana]], [[Cancún]],  [[Dubai]]. Some old global cities, proud of their influence, grow as “mono maniac reports” of themselves: [[Berlin]], [[Paris]], [[Mexico City]], [[Schanghai]]. Expressing new feelings, the wish for pleasure in certain exotique global cities contrasts with the [[affect (psychology)|affect]]ed mise-en-scène of older and symbolic ones, and that has a meaning. Moreover, there are several European large cities in risk of [[third world]] contamination.

In the meantime, Daus conceives a trilogy having as generic title ''New city images&amp;nbsp;– new feelings'' ("Neue Stadtbilder&amp;nbsp;– Neue Gefühle”). In order to better understand European colonialism, he analyses in the first volume the origins of the mega-metropolis in America, Asia, Africa and Oceania, cities constructed stone on stone, evoking as typical [[Luanda]], [[capital city]] of [[Angola]], one of the most expensive cities in the world nowadays, which will project itself as historical synthesis in future. In the second one, he tries a new understanding of the biggest cities and develops the concept of "package-city", referring Berlin as a curious example. In the third volume, he follows the intellectual and artistic progression of the idea of mega-metropolis to East, until Euro-Asia: [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]], [[Bishkek]], [[Almaty]] and [[Astana]], “stations” or land-marks of such progress. As inspiring instances of extreme settling in eastern big cities, he mentions [[Vienne]], [[Istanbul]], [[Teheran]], [[Bombay]], [[Chengdu]], [[Peking]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Cape Town]], [[Manaus]], [[Caracas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.babylon-metropolis.com/  Babylon Metropolis Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

Daus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fu-berlin.de/en/presse/expertendienst/themen/gesellschaft/metropolen/index.html Experts on urban areas] at The [[Free University of Berlin]]&lt;/ref&gt; has been busy, describing and studding such phenomena for over a decade, since he reported the existence of a “European fundament” in large extra-European cities (1995). He reveals dangerous signs of extreme colonialism in regions of the [[Red Sea]] by the end of the 20th century and talks of “beach culture versus city culture” in [[Mediterranean]] metropolis at the early 21st century. New city buildings expressing new feelings, he says, are expressions of permanent chaos.

[[Carpathian Ruthenia]] (later briefly independent as [[Carpatho-Ukraine]]) was economically [[Czechoslovakia]]’s poorest region.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 1914 the region was referred to by one historian{{who?|date=January 2018}} as "little more than a [[Magyars|Magyar]] deer park."{{cn|date=January 2018}} Its people were wretchedly{{POV-statement|date=November 2013}} poor, having for centuries{{POV-statement|date=November 2013}} supplemented the meagre living the mountainous area afforded with seasonal agricultural labor and service in the Hungarian infantry.

Carpathian Ruthenia was a hotbed{{cn|date=January 2018}} of secessionist sentiment throughout the inter-war period. These were manifested by strong cultural and linguistic links with the [[Ukrainians]], in the [[Soviet Union]] and interwar [[Poland]]. There were also calls for Ukrainian autonomy within the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak Republic]], and calls for the formation of a [[Lemko-Rusyn Republic]] on the northern side of the Carpathians, attempted to unite with this faction. 

During [[World War I]], [[Ruthenia]]n leaders had reached an agreement with [[Tomáš Masaryk]] to extend autonomy to Ruthenia within a future Czechoslovak Republic. The agreement received international sanction in the 1919 [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]]. The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] had also stipulated earlier that year that Carpathian Ruthenia be granted full autonomy and promised the territory a diet having legislative power in all matters of local administration. However, the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|constitution of 1920]] limited the provision on autonomy, making reference to the requirements of the unity of the state. All Ruthenian legislation was made subject to approval by the president of the republic, and the governor of Ruthenia was to be nominated by the president. As a result, even the constitutional provision for Ruthenian autonomy was never implemented; the Ruthenian diet was never convened. The issue of autonomy became a major source of discontent. Other grievances included the placement of the western boundary—which left 150,000 Ruthenians in Slovakia—and the large numbers of [[Czechs]] brought to Ruthenia as administrators and educators. Post-World War I Ruthenia was characterized by a proliferation of political parties and a diversity of cultural tendencies. All Czechoslovak political parties were represented, and a number of indigenous parties emerged as well. Of particular significance were the Ukrainophiles, Russophiles, Hungarians, and [[communist]]s.

==Political movements==

Ukrainophile and Russophile tendencies were strengthened by the large influx of émigrés following the war. 

The Ukrainophiles were largely members of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and espoused autonomy within Czechoslovakia. Some favored union with Soviet Ukraine. The Ukrainophiles were represented by the Ruthenian National Christian Party led by [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]. 

The [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophile Ruthenians]] were largely [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and also espoused Ruthenian autonomy. They were organized politically in the Agricultural Federation, led by [[Andrej Brody]], and the fascist-style [[Fencik Party]]. 

Hungarians populated a compact area in southern Ruthenia. They were represented by the Unified Magyar Party, which consistently received ten percent of the vote in Carpathian Ruthenia and was in permanent opposition to the government. 

The communists, strong in the poor province, attempted to appeal to the Ukrainian element by espousing union with Soviet Ukraine. In 1935 the communists polled 25 percent of the Ruthenian vote. The elections of 1935 gave only 37 percent of the Ruthenian vote to political parties supporting the Czechoslovak government. The communists, Unified Magyars, and autonomist groups polled 63 percent.

'''Software evolution''' is the term used in [[software engineering]] (specifically [[software maintenance]]) to refer to the process of developing [[software]] initially, then repeatedly updating it for various reasons. 

==General introduction==
[[Fred Brooks]], in his key book ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Brooks]], ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]''. [[Addison-Wesley]], 1975 &amp; 1995. ISBN
0-201-00650-2 &amp; {{ISBN|0-201-83595-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; states that over 90% of the costs of a typical system arise in the maintenance phase, and that any successful piece of software will inevitably be maintained.

In fact, [[Agile methods]] stem from maintenance-like activities in and around web based technologies, where the bulk of the capability comes from frameworks and standards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Software maintenance address bug fixes and minor enhancements and software evolution focus on [[Adaptation (computer science)|adaptation]] and [[System migration|migration]].

&lt;!-- evolution of evolution models --&gt;
Software technologies will continue to develop. These changes will require new laws and theories to be created and justified. Some models as well would require additional aspects in developing future programs. Innovations and improvements do increase unexpected form of software development. The maintenance issues also would probably change as to adapt to the evolution of the future software. Software processes are themselves evolving, after going through learning and refinements, it is always improve their efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;aeddy; ref: Understanding Open Source Software Evolution Walt Scacchi Institute for Software Research&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==
The need for software evolution comes from the fact that no one is able to predict how user requirements will evolve ''a priori'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first1=K. H. | last1=Bennett | first2=V. T. | last2=Rajlich | first3=R. Mohamad | last3=Mazrul, | title = Legacy System: Coping with success | journal=[[IEEE Software]] | date=1995 | pages=19–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In other words, the existing systems are never complete and continue to evolve.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | author = Trung Hung Vo | title = Software Maintenance| date=  2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they evolve, the complexity of the systems will grow unless there is a better solution available to solve these issues. The main objectives of software evolution are ensuring functional relevance, reliability and flexibility of the system. Software evolution can be fully manual (based on changes by software engineers), partially automated (e.g. using refactoring tools) or fully automated (with autonomous configuration or evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Baudry|first=Benoit|last2=Monperrus|first2=Martin|last3=Mony|first3=Cendrine|last4=Chauvel|first4=Franck|last5=Fleurey|first5=Franck|last6=Clarke|first6=Siobhan|date=February 2014|title=DIVERSIFY: Ecology-inspired software evolution for diversity emergence|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6747203/?reload=true|journal=2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/csmr-wcre.2014.6747203|isbn=9781479937523|citeseerx=10.1.1.646.2786}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Software evolution has been greatly impacted by the Internet:

* the rapid growth of World Wide Web and Internet Resources make it easier for users and engineers to find related information. 

* open source development where anybody could download the source codes and hence modify it has enabled fast and parallel evolution (through forks). 

==Types of software maintenance==

E.B. Swanson initially identified the 
three categories of maintenance: corrective, adaptive, and perfective. Four categories of software were then catalogued by Lientz and Swanson (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Lientz, B.P. and Swanson, E.B., ''Software Maintenance Management, A Study Of The Maintenance Of Computer Application Software In 487 Data Processing Organizations''. Addison-Wesley, Reading MA, 1980. {{ISBN|0-201-04205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These have since been updated and normalized internationally in the [[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006:&lt;ref&gt;[[ISO/IEC]] 14764:2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Corrective maintenance'': Reactive modification of a software product performed after delivery to correct discovered problems;
* ''Adaptive maintenance'': Modification of a software product performed after delivery to keep a software product usable in a changed or changing environment;
* ''Perfective maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to improve performance or maintainability;
* ''Preventive maintenance'': Modification of a software product after delivery to detect and correct latent faults in the software product before they become effective faults.

All of the preceding take place when there is a known requirement for change.

Although these categories were supplemented by many authors like Warren et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

==Stage model==
Current trends  and practices are projected forward using a new model of software evolution called the staged model [1]. Staged model was introduced to replace conventional analysis which is less suitable for modern software development is rapid changing due to its difficulties of hard to contribute in software evolution. There are five distinct stages contribute in simple staged model (Initial development, Evolution, Servicing, Phase-out, and Close-down). 
* According to K.H.Bennett and V.T Rajlich [1], the key contribution is to separate the 'maintenance' phase into an evolution stage followed by a servicing and phase out stages. The first version of software system which is lacking some features will be developed during initial development or also known as alpha stage [2]. However, the architecture has already been possessed during this stage will bring for any future changes or amendments. Most references in this stage will base on scenarios or case study. Knowledge has defined as another important outcome of initial development. Such knowledge including the knowledge of application domain, user requirements, business rules, policies, solutions, algorithm, etc. Knowledge also seems as the important factor for the subsequent phase of evolution.
* Once the previous stage completed successfully (and must be completed successfully before entering next stage), the next stage would be evolution. Users tend to change their requirements as well as they prefer to see some improvements or changes. Due to this factor, the software industry is facing the challenges of rapid changes environment. Hence the goal of evolution is to adapt the application to the ever-changing user requirements and operating environment [1]. During the previous stage, the first version application created might contain a lot of faults, and those faults will be fixed during evolution stage based on more specified and accurate requirements due to the case study or scenarios.
* The software will continuously evolve until it is no longer evolvable and then enter stage of servicing (also known as software maturity). During this stage, only minor changes will be done.
* Next stage which is phase-out, there is no more servicing available for that particular software. However, the software still in production.
* Lastly, close-down. The software use is disconnected or discontinue [2] and the users are directed towards a replacement.[1].

==Lehman's Laws of Software Evolution==
{{Main|Lehman's laws of software evolution}}
Prof. [[Meir M. Lehman]], who worked at [[Imperial College London]] from 1972 to 2002, and his colleagues have identified a set of behaviours in the evolution of proprietary software. These behaviours (or observations) are known as Lehman's Laws, and there are eight of them:

# (1974) "Continuing Change" — an E-type system must be continually adapted or it becomes progressively less satisfactory&lt;ref name="laws1-5"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0164-1212(79)90022-0|last=Lehman|first=M. M.|title=On Understanding Laws, Evolution, and Conservation in the Large-Program Life Cycle|year=1980|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=1|pages=213–221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# (1974) "Increasing Complexity" — as an E-type system evolves, its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1980) "Self Regulation" — E-type system evolution processes are self-regulating with the distribution of product and process measures close to normal&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Organisational Stability ([[invariant work rate]])" - the average effective global activity rate in an evolving E-type system is invariant over the product's lifetime&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1978) "Conservation of Familiarity" — as an E-type system evolves, all associated with it, developers, sales personnel and users, for example, must maintain mastery of its content and behaviour to achieve satisfactory evolution. Excessive growth diminishes that mastery. Hence the average [[incremental growth]] remains invariant as the system evolves.&lt;ref name="laws1-5" /&gt;
# (1991) "Continuing Growth" — the functional content of an E-type system must be continually increased to maintain user satisfaction over its lifetime
# (1996) "Declining Quality" — the quality of an E-type system will appear to be declining unless it is rigorously maintained and adapted to operational environment changes
# (1996) "Feedback System" (first stated 1974, formalised as law 1996) — E-type evolution processes constitute multi-level, multi-loop, multi-agent feedback systems and must be treated as such to achieve significant improvement over any reasonable base&lt;ref&gt;[[Lehman's laws of software evolution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth mentioning that the applicability of all of these laws for all types of software systems has been studied by several researchers. For example, see a presentation by Nanjangud C Narendra&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Software-Evolution-in-Agile-Development | title=Software Evolution in Agile Development | first=Nanjangud | last=Narendra | website=InfoQ | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=19 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he describes a case study of an enterprise Agile project in the light of Lehman’s laws of software evolution. Some empirical observations coming from the study of [[open source software development]] appear to challenge some of the laws {{Vague|date=June 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The laws predict that the need for functional change in a software system is inevitable, and not a consequence of incomplete or incorrect analysis of requirements or bad programming. They state that there are limits to what a software development team can achieve in terms of safely implementing changes and new functionality.

Maturity Models specific to software evolution have been developed to improve processes, and help to ensure continuous rejuvenation of the software as it evolves iteratively{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.

The "global process" that is made by the many stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, their managers) has many feedback loops. The evolution speed is a function of the feedback loop structure and other characteristics of the global system. Process simulation techniques, such as [[system dynamics]] can be useful in understanding and managing such global process.

Software evolution is not likely to be [[Darwinian evolution|Darwinian]], [[Lamarckian evolution|Lamarckian]] or [[Baldwinian evolution|Baldwinian]], but an important phenomenon on its own. Given the increasing dependence on software at all levels of society and economy, the successful evolution of software is becoming increasingly critical. This is an important topic of research that hasn't received much attention.

The evolution of software, because of its rapid path in comparison to other man-made entities, was seen by Lehman as the "fruit fly" of the study of the evolution of artificial systems.

'''Taphonomy''' is the study of how [[organism]]s decay and become [[fossil]]ized. The term ''taphonomy'' (from the Greek ''taphos'', τάφος meaning "burial", and ''nomos'', νόμος meaning "law") was introduced to [[paleontology]] in 1949&lt;ref name="Lyman 1–162"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lyman|first=R.

==Description==
Taphonomic phenomena are grouped into two phases: [[biostratinomy]]; events that occur between death of the organism and the burial, and [[diagenesis]]; events that occur after the burial.&lt;ref name="Lyman 1–162"/&gt; Since Efremov's definition, taphonomy has expanded to include the fossilization of organic and inorganic materials through both cultural and environmental influences.

This is a multidisciplinary concept and is used in slightly different contexts throughout different fields of study. Fields that  employ the concept of taphonomy include: 
* [[Archaeobotany]]
* [[Archaeology]]
* [[Biology]]
* [[Forensic science]]
* [[Geoarchaeology]]
* [[Geology]]
* [[Paleoecology]]
* [[Paleontology]]
* [[Zooarchaeology]]

Dispersal is the separation of pieces of an organism caused by natural events (i.e. floods, scavengers etc.). Accumulation occurs when there is a buildup of organic and/or inorganic materials in one location (scavengers or human behavior). When mineral rich groundwater permeates organic materials and fills the empty spaces, a fossil is formed. The final stage of taphonomy is mechanical alteration; this is processes that physically alter the remains (i.e. freeze-thaw, compaction, transport, burial).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://paleo.cortland.edu/tutorial/Taphonomy&amp;Pres/taphonomy.htm|title=Taphonomy &amp; Preservation|website=paleo.cortland.edu|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paleontology ===
One motivation behind taphonomy is to understand biases present in the [[fossil]] record better. Fossils are ubiquitous in sedimentary rocks, yet [[Paleontology|paleontologist]]s cannot draw the most accurate conclusions about the lives and ecology of the fossilized organisms without knowing about the processes involved in their fossilization. For example, if a fossil assemblage contains more of one type of fossil than another, one can infer either that the organism was present in greater numbers, or that its remains were more resistant to decomposition.

During the late twentieth century, taphonomic data began to be applied to other paleontological subfields such as [[paleobiology]], [[paleoceanography]], [[ichnology]] (the study of [[trace fossil]]s) and [[biostratigraphy]]. By coming to understand the [[oceanographic]] and [[Ethology|ethological]] implications of observed taphonomic patterns, paleontologists have been able to provide new and meaningful interpretations and correlations that would have otherwise remained obscure in the [[fossil record]].

===Astrobiology===

=== Forensic science ===
Forensic taphonomy is a relatively new field that has increased in popularity in the past 15 years. It is a subfield of [[forensic anthropology]] focusing specifically on how taphonomic forces have altered criminal evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passalacqua|first=Nicholas|title=Introduction to Part VI: Forensic taphonomy|url=https://www.academia.edu/1566948/Introduction_to_Part_VI_Forensic_taphonomy|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different branches of forensic taphonomy: [http://www.itsgov.com/forensic-taphonomy.html biotaphonomy] and [http://www.itsgov.com/forensic-taphonomy.html geotaphonomy]. Biotaphonomy looks at how the decomposition and/or destruction of the organism has happened. The main factors that affect this branch are categorized into three groups: environmental factors; external variables, individual factors; factors from the organism itself (i.e. body size, age, etc.), and cultural factors; factors specific to any cultural behaviors that would affect the decomposition (burial practices). Geotaphonomy studies how the burial practices and the burial itself affects the surrounding environment. This includes soil disturbances and tool marks from digging the grave, disruption of plant growth and soil pH from the decomposing body, and the alteration of the land and water drainage from introducing an unnatural mass to the area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Forensic taphonomy|last=admin|first=|date=2011-12-08|work=Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) and forensics information|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This field is extremely important because it helps scientists use the taphonomic profile to help determine what happened to the remains at the time of death ([https://anthropology.si.edu/writteninbone/comic/activity/pdf/Perimortem.pdf perimortem]) and after death ([https://anthropology.si.edu/writteninbone/comic/activity/pdf/Perimortem.pdf postmortem]). This can make a huge difference when considering what can be used as evidence in a criminal investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Front Matter|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdf/10.1201/b15424-1|journal=Manual of Forensic Taphonomy|pages=i–xiv|doi=10.1201/b15424-1|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4398-7841-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental archaeology ===
Archaeologists study taphonomic processes in order to determine how plant and animal (including human) remains accumulate and differentially preserve within archaeological sites. [[Environmental archaeology]] is a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on understanding the past relationships between groups and their environments. The main subfields of environmental archaeology include [[zooarchaeology]], [[paleobotany]], and [[geoarchaeology]]. Taphonomy allows specialists to identify what artifacts or remains encountered before and after initial burial.  [[Zooarchaeology]], a focus within environmental archaeology investigates taphonomic processes on animal remains. The processes most commonly identified within zooarchaeology include thermal alteration (burns), cut marks, worked bone, and gnaw marks.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Fernandez Jalvo, Yolanda and Peter Andrews, “Methods in Taphonomy” in Atlas of Taphonomic Identifications: 1001+ Images of Fossil and Recent Mammal Bone Modification, ed. Eric Delson and Eric J. Sargis Vertebrate Paleobiology and Paleoanthropology Series (New York, NY, American Museum of Natural History, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Thermally altered bone indicate the use of fire and animal processing. Cut marks and worked bone can inform zooarchaeologists on tool use or food processing.&lt;ref&gt;Rainsford C., and O'Connor T. 2016. "Taphonomy and Contextual Zooarchaeology in Urban Deposits at York, UK." Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences 8 (2): 343–351. doi:10.1007/s12520-015-0268-x.&lt;/ref&gt; When there is little to no written record, taphonomy allows environmental archaeologists to better comprehend the ways in which a group interacted with their surrounding environments and inhabitants.

The field of environmental archaeology provides crucial information for attempting to understand the resilience of past societies and the great impacts that environmental shifts can have on a population. Knowledge gained from the past through these studies can be used to inform present and future decisions for human-environment interactions.

==Taphonomic biases in the fossil record==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2011}}
Because of the very select processes that cause preservation, not all organisms have the same chance of being preserved. Any factor that affects the likelihood that an organism is preserved as a fossil is a potential source of bias. It is thus arguably the most important goal of taphonomy to identify the scope of such biases such that they can be quantified to allow correct interpretations of the relative abundances of organisms that make up a fossil biota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| pages = 290| last = Kidwell| first = S. M. |author2=P. J Brenchley |author3=D. Jablonski |author4=D. H. Erwin |author5=J. H. Lipps | title = Evolution of the fossil record: thickness trends in marine skeletal accumulations and their implications| journal = Evolutionary paleobiology: in honor of James W. Valentine| year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most common sources of bias are listed below.

===Physical attributes of the organism itself===
This perhaps represents the biggest source of bias in the fossil record. First and foremost, organisms that [[biomineralization|contain hard parts]] have a far greater chance of being represented in the fossil record than organisms consisting of soft tissue only. As a result, animals with bones or shells are overrepresented in the fossil record, and many plants are only represented by [[pollen]] or [[spore]]s that have hard walls. Soft bodied organisms may form 30% to 100% of the biota, but most fossil assemblages preserve none of this unseen diversity, which may exclude groups such as [[fungi]] and entire animal [[phylum|phyla]] from the fossil record.{{&lt;ref&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=96859831&amp;site=eds-live&amp;scope=site&amp;profile=eds-main&lt;/ref&gt;=June 2013}} Many animals that [[moult]], on the other hand, are overrepresented, as one animal may leave multiple fossils due to its discarded body parts. Among plants, [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] species produce so much more pollen than [[Zoophily|animal-pollinated]] species, that the former are much overrepresented relative to the latter.

===Characteristics of the habitat===
Most fossils form in conditions where material is [[Deposition (geology)|deposit]]ed to the bottom of water bodies. Especially shallow sea coasts produce large amounts of fossils, so organisms living in such conditions have a much higher chance of being preserved as fossils than organisms living in non-depositing conditions. In continental environments, fossilization is especially likely in small lakes that gradually fill in with organic and inorganic material and especially in [[Bog|peat-accumulating wetlands]]. The organisms of such habitats are therefore overrepresented in the fossil record.

===Mixing of fossils from different places===
A [[sedimentology|sedimentary]] deposit may have experienced a mixing of noncontemporaneous remains within single sedimentary units via physical or biological processes; i.e. a deposit could be ripped up and redeposited elsewhere, meaning that a deposit may contain a large amount of fossils from another place (an '''allochthonous''' deposit, as opposed to the usual '''autochthonous'''). Thus, a question that is often asked of fossil deposits is to what extent does the fossil deposit record the true biota that originally lived there? Many fossils are obviously autochthonous, such as rooted fossils like crinoids,{{clarify|reason=all crinoids are "obviously" autochthonous? Meaning they were never moved by geologic processes? THIS IS NOT OBVIOUS, is it even true at all?|date=August 2018}} and many fossils are intrisically obviously allocthonous, such as the presence of photoautotrophic plankton in a benthic deposit that must have sunk to be deposited. A fossil deposit may thus become biased towards exotic species (i.e. species not endemic to that area) when the sedimentology is dominated by gravity driven surges, such as mudslides, or may become biased if there is very little endemic organisms to be preserved. This is a particular problem in [[palynology]].

===Temporal resolution===
Because population turnover rates of individual taxa are much less than net rates of sediment accumulation, the biological remains of successive,  noncontemporaneous populations of organisms may be admixed within a single bed, known as '''time-averaging'''. Because of the slow and episodic nature of the geologic record, two apparently contemporaneous fossils may have actually lived centuries, or even millennia, apart. Moreover, the ''degree'' of time averaging in an assemblage may vary. The degree varies on many factors, such as tissue type, the habitat, the frequency of burial events and [[exhumation]] events, and the depth of [[bioturbation]] within the sedimentary column relative to net sediment accumulation rates. Like biases in spatial fidelity, there is a bias towards organisms that can survive reworking events, such as [[Exoskeleton|shell]]s. An example of a more ideal deposit with respect to time-averaging bias would be a [[volcanic ash]] deposit, which captures an entire biota caught in the wrong place at the wrong time (e.g. the [[Silurian]] [[Herefordshire]] [[lagerstätte]]).

===Gaps in time series===
The geological record is very discontinuous, and deposition is episodic at all scales. At the largest scale, a sedimentological high-stand period may mean that no deposition may occur for millions of years and, in fact, erosion of the deposit may occur. Such a hiatus is called an [[unconformity]]. Conversely, a catastrophic event such as a mudslide may overrepresent a time period. At a shorter scale, scouring processes such as the formation of ripples and dunes and the passing of [[turbidity current]]s may cause layers to be removed. Thus the fossil record is biased towards periods of greatest sedimentation; periods of time that have less sedimentation are consequently less well represented in the fossil record.

A related problem is the slow changes that occur in the depositional environment of an area; a deposit may experience periods of poor preservation due to, for example, a lack of biomineralizing elements. This causes the taphonomic or diagenetic obliteration of fossils, producing gaps and condensation of the record.

===Consistency in preservation over geologic time===

Major shifts in intrinsic and extrinsic properties of organisms, including morphology and behavior in relation to other organisms or shifts in the global environment, can cause secular or long-term cyclic changes in preservation ([[megabias]]).

===Human biases===
Much of the incompleteness of the fossil record is due to the fact that only a small amount of rock is ever exposed at the surface of the Earth, and not even most of that has been explored. Our fossil record relies on the small amount of exploration that has been done on this. Unfortunately, paleontologists as humans can be very biased in their methods of collection; a bias that must be identified. Potential sources of bias include,
*'''Search images''': field experiments have shown that paleontologists working on, say fossil clams are better at collecting clams than anything else, because their search image has been shaped to bias them in favour of clams.
*'''Relative ease of extraction''': fossils that are easy to obtain (such as many phosphatic fossils that are easily extracted ''en masse'' by dissolution in acid) are overabundant in the fossil record.
*'''Taxonomic bias''': fossils with easily discernible morphologies will be easy to distinguish as separate species, and will thus have an inflated abundance.

==Preservation of biopolymers==
{{main|Preservation of biopolymers}}
[[File:ElrathiakingiUtahWheelerCambrian.jpg|thumb|Although [[chitin]] exoskeletons of arthropods such as insects and myriapods (but not [[trilobite]]s, which are mineralized with calcium carbonate, nor crustaceans, which are often mineralized with calcium phosphate) are subject to decomposition, they often maintain shape during [[permineralization]], especially if they are already somewhat mineralized.]]

The taphonomic pathways involved in relatively inert substances such as calcite (and to a lesser extent bone) are relatively obvious, as such body parts are stable and change little through time.  However, the preservation of "soft tissue" is more interesting, as it requires more peculiar conditions. While usually only biomineralised material survives fossilisation, the preservation of soft tissue is not as rare as sometimes thought.&lt;ref name=Briggs1993&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polysaccharides also have low preservation potential, unless they are highly cross-linked;&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt; this interconnection is most common in structural tissues, and renders them resistant to chemical decay.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt;  Such tissues  include wood ([[lignin]]), spores and pollen ([[sporopollenin]]), the cuticles of plants ([[Cutan (polymer)|cutan]]) and animals, the cell walls of algae ([[algaenan]]),&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt; and potentially the polysaccharide layer of some lichens.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} This interconnectedness makes the chemicals less prone to chemical decay, and also means they are a poorer source of energy so less likely to be digested by scavenging organisms.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt;  After being subjected to heat and pressure, these cross-linked organic molecules typically "cook" and become [[kerogen]] or short (&lt;17 C atoms) aliphatic/aromatic carbon molecules.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt; Other factors affect the likelihood of preservation; for instance scleritisation renders the jaws of polychaetes more readily preserved than the chemically equivalent but non-sclerotised body cuticle.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt;

It was thought that only tough, cuticle type soft tissue could be preserved by [[Burgess Shale type preservation]],&lt;ref name=Butterfield1990&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a common misconception that anaerobic conditions are necessary for the preservation of soft tissue; indeed much decay is mediated by sulfate reducing bacteria which can only survive in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt;  Anoxia does, however, reduce the probability that scavengers will disturb the dead organism, and the activity of other organisms is undoubtedly one of the leading causes of soft-tissue destruction.&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt;

Plant cuticle is more prone to preservation if it contains [[Cutan (polymer)|cutan]], rather than [[cutin]].&lt;ref name=Briggs1999/&gt;

Plants and algae produce the most preservable compounds, which are listed according to their preservation potential by Tegellaar (see reference).&lt;ref name=Tegelaar1989&gt;{{citation

==Disintegration==
How complete fossils are was once thought to be a proxy for the energy of the environment, with stormier waters leaving less articulated carcasses. However, the dominant force actually seems to be predation, with scavengers more likely than rough waters to break up a fresh carcass before it is buried.&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Behrensmeyer | first1 = A.

== Significance ==
Taphonomic processes allow researchers of multiple fields to identify the past of natural and cultural objects. From the time of death or burial until excavation, taphonomy can aid in the understanding of past environments.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, R. Lee. Vertebrate taphonomy. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; When studying the past it is important to gain contextual information in order to have a solid understanding of the data. Often these findings can be used to better understand cultural or environmental shifts within the present day.

'''Vahan M. Kurkjian''' ({{lang-hy|Վահան Մ. Քուրքջյան}}; 1863–1961) was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] author, historian, teacher, and community leader.

In&amp;nbsp;1904, in [[Cairo]], he published the Armenian newspaper ''Loussaper'' (''The Morning Star''), in the pages of which he and other intellectuals called for a national union for the Armenian people. The idea eventually materialized in the form of the [[Armenian General Benevolent Union]]. In&amp;nbsp;1907 he emigrated to the United States and studied law at [[Boston University]]. Two years later, also in [[Boston]], he founded the first American chapter of the Armenian General Benevolent Union. From its inception he was inseparably identified with that organization, serving as its executive director until his retirement in&amp;nbsp;1939. Kurkjian was a frequent contributor of articles to Armenian newspapers, and published a number of books and pamphlets, among which the best-remembered is his ''History of Armenia''.

'''Walter Raymond Drake''' (1913–1989) was a British disciple of [[Charles Fort]] and writer. He published nine books on the [[Ancient astronaut hypothesis|ancient astronaut]] theme, the first four years earlier than [[Erich von Däniken]]'s bestseller ''Chariots of the Gods''. 

Drake proposed in his books that ancient civilizations were colonies of [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] who eventually lost their technological secrets and became indistinguishable from humans, and/or that many other ancient civilizations were the result of human contact with aliens.&lt;ref&gt;Simms, L. Moody. (1976). ''From Atlantis to UFO'S''. ''Social Science''. Vol. 51, No. 2. pp. 97-104.&lt;/ref&gt; His claims are considered to be [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Thomas E. (1996). ''Ancient Astronauts''. In ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Edited by [[Gordon Stein]]. Prometheus Books. pp. 25-32. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake spent many years digging through huge archives of material, looking in his case for supposed anomalies that could support his scenarios of space aliens impacting human history. As Drake himself said, "I aspired to collect as many facts as possible from ancient literature to chronicle for the past what Charles Fort has so brilliantly done for the present century." A slightly earlier British author somewhat comparable to Drake was [[Harold T. Wilkins]].

Paperback editions of the first few of Drake's books were available in the US during the 1970s and became modest best-sellers in that format, often being displayed on news-stands next to the works of von Däniken.

'''Sir William Wilson Hunter''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCSI|CIE}} (15 July 1840&amp;nbsp;– 6 February 1900)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Sir William Wilson Hunter, K. C. S. I., C. I. E.|journal=[[The Geographical Journal]]|date=March 1900|volume=15|issue=3|pages=289–290|jstor=1774698}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Scottish historian, statistician, a compiler and a member of the [[Indian Civil Service]].

He is most known for ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'' on which he started working in 1869, and which was eventually published in nine volumes in 1881 and later as a twenty-six volume set after his death.

==Early life and education==
William Wilson Hunter was born on 15 July 1840 in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], to Andrew Galloway Hunter, a Glasgow manufacturer. He was the second son, among his fathers three sons. He started his education in 1854 at the 'Quaker Seminary' at Queenswood, [[Hampshire]], after a year he joined, the [[Glasgow Academy]].

He was educated at [[Glasgow University]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] 1860), [[Paris]] and [[Bonn]], acquiring a knowledge of [[Sanskrit]], [[LL.D.]], before passing first in the final examination for the [[Indian Civil Service]] in 1862.

==Career==
He reached [[Bengal Presidency]] in November 1862 and was appointed assistant magistrate and collector of [[Birbhum]], in the lower provinces of [[Bengal]], where he began collecting local traditions and records, which formed the materials for his publication, entitled ''The Annals of Rural Bengal'', which influenced among others the [[historical romance]] ''[[Durgeshnandini]]'' of [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]].&lt;ref name="ChakravortyGupta2004" /&gt;

He also compiled ''A Comparative Dictionary of the Non-Aryan Languages of India'', a glossary of dialects based mainly upon the collections of [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]], which according to the 1911 ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' "testifies to the industry of the writer but contains much immature philological speculation".&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{cite book |page=945 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |volume=13 |year=1911 |url=https://archive.org/stream/EB1911WMF/VOL13_HARMONY-HURSTMONCEAUX#page/n973/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 [[Richard Southwell Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]], the then [[Governor-General of India|governor-general]], asked Hunter to submit a scheme for a comprehensive statistical survey of India. The work involved the compilation of a number of local gazetteers, in various stages of progress, and their consolidation in a condensed form upon a single and uniform plan. There was unhappiness with the scope and completeness of the earlier surveys conducted by administrators such as [[Francis Buchanan-Hamilton|Buchanan]], and Hunter determined to model his efforts on the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]''. Hunter said that "It was my hope to make a memorial of England's work in India, more lasting, because truer and more complete, than these monuments of Mughal Empire and of French ambition."&lt;ref name=Marriott2003p209&gt;{{cite book |title=The other empire: metropolis, India and progress in the colonial imagination |first=John |last=Marriott |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7190-6018-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z2K0eVWnGmkC |page=209 |accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Mayo's question on 30 May 1871 of whether the Indian Muslims are "bound by their religion to rebel against the Queen" Hunter completed his influential work ''The Indian Musalmans'' in mid-June 1871 and later published it as a book in mid-August of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=v.

In 1872 Hunter published his history of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]]. The [[International Sanitary Conferences|third International Sanitary Conference]] held at [[Constantinople]] in 1866 declared Hindu and Muslim pilgrimages to be 'the most powerful of all the causes which conduce to the development and propagation of Cholera epidemics'.

[[Image:The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1908-1931, Book cover.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]], William Wilson Hunter's most known work, on which he started working in 1869.]]

He embarked on a series of tours throughout the country,&lt;ref name=Marriott2003p209 /&gt; and he supervised the ''A Statistical Account of Bengal'' (20 volumes, 1875-1877)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Statistical Account of Bengal by W. W. Hunter|journal=The North American Review|date=September–October 1878|volume=127|issue=264|pages=339–342|jstor=25100678}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar work for [[Assam]] (2 volumes, 1879).&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{ODNBweb |title=Hunter, Sir William Wilson |id=14237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunter wrote that {{quote|Under this system, the materials for the whole of British India have now been collected, in several Provinces the work of compilation has rapidly advanced, and everywhere it is well in hand. During the same period the first Census of India has been taken, and furnished a vast accession to our knowledge of the people. The materials now amassed form a Statistical Survey of a continent with a population exceeding that of all Europe, Russia excepted."&lt;ref name="Dirks2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas B. Dirks|title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of Modern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G0D1K4Zn_9QC&amp;pg=PA199|year=2003|publisher=Permanent Black|isbn=978-81-7824-072-5|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The statistical accounts, covering the 240 administrative districts,  comprised 128 volumes and these were condensed into the nine volumes of ''[[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]]'', which was published in 1881.&lt;ref name=Marriott2003p209 /&gt; The ''Gazetteer'' was revised in later series, the second edition comprising 14 volumes published between 1885 and 1887, while the third comprised 26 volumes, including an atlas, and was published in 1908 under the editorship of [[Herbert Hope Risley]], [[William Stevenson Meyer]], [[Richard Burn (Indologist)|Richard Burn]] and [[James Sutherland Cotton]].&lt;ref name="Scholberg1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Henry Scholberg]]|title=The District Gazetteers of British India: A Bibliography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BYsZAAAAMAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Zug, Switzerland: Inter Documentation Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1911 ''Britannica'', Hunter "adopted a [[transliteration]] of vernacular place-names, by which means the correct pronunciation is ordinarily indicated; but hardly sufficient allowance was made for old spellings consecrated by history and long usage."&lt;ref name="eb1911" /&gt; Hunter's own article on India was published in 1880 as ''A Brief History of the Indian Peoples'', and has been widely translated and utilized in Indian schools. A revised form was issued in 1895, under the title of ''The Indian Empire: its People, History and Products''.

Hunter later said that {{quote|Nothing is more costly than ignorance. I believe that, in spite of its many defects, this work will provide a memorable episode in the long battle against ignorance; a breakwater against the tide of prejudice and false opinions flowing down upon us from the past, and the foundation for a truer and wider knowledge of India in time to come. Its aim has been not literary graces, nor scientific discovery, nor antiquarian research; but an earnest endeavour to render India better governed, because better understood.&lt;ref name=Marriott2003p209 /&gt;}}

Hunter contributed the articles "Bombay", "Calcutta", "Dacca", "Delhi" and "Mysore" to the 9th edition (1875–89) of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/contributors.html  Important Contributors to the Britannica, 9th and 10th Editions]. 1902encyclopedia.com. Retrieved 20 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 Hunter, as a member of the governor-general's council, presided over the Commission on Indian Education; in 1886 he was elected vice-chancellor of the [[University of Calcutta]].

In 1887 he retired from the service, was created [[Order of the Star of India|KCSI]], and settled at Oaken Holt, near [[Oxford]].

On 13 March 1889 [[Philip Lyttelton Gell]] the then Secretary to the Delegates of the [[Clarendon Press]], wrote to Hunter about {{quote|a project which has been for some time under the consideration of the Delegates, to publish a series giving the salient features of Indian History in the Biographies of successive Generals and Administrators.&lt;ref name="ChakravortyGupta2004" /&gt;}}

Gell arranged the publication of the series by June 1889; with Hunter receiving £75 for each volume, and the author £25. Gell's experience of the earlier unsaleable [[Sacred Books of the East]] and financial constraints forced the ''[[Rulers of India series|Rulers of India]]'' to end at 28 volumes in spite of Hunter's disappointment about the same.&lt;ref name="ChakravortyGupta2004"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Chakravorty|editor1-first=Swapan|editor1-link=Swapan Kumar Chakravorty|editor2-last=Gupta|editor2-first=Abhijit|last=Chatterjee|first=Rimi B.|authorlink=Rimi B.

Hunter himself contributed the volumes on [[James Andrew Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Dalhousie]] (1890)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=H. P.|title=''The Marquess of Dalhousie'' by William Wilson Hunter|journal=Revue Historique|year=1891|volume=47|issue=2|pages=387–393|jstor=40938228}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mayo (1891)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=H.

He had previously written an official ''Life of Lord Mayo'', which was published on 19 November 1875 in two volumes with a second edition appearing in 1876.&lt;ref name="Mittal1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Satish Chandra Mittal|title=India Distorted: A Study of British Historians on India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1_jphIo6hsC&amp;pg=PA199|date=1 January 1996|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-7533-018-4|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a weekly article on Indian affairs for ''[[The Times]]''.

But the great task to which he applied himself on his settlement in England was a history upon a large scale of the ''British Dominion in India'', two volumes of which only had appeared when he died, carrying the reader barely down to 1700. He was much hindered by the confused state of his materials, a portion of which he arranged and published in 1894 as ''Bengal Manuscript Records'', in three volumes.

Hunter dedicated his 1892 work ''Bombay 1885 to 1890: A Study in Indian Administration'' to [[Florence Nightingale]].&lt;ref name="Nightingale2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Florence Nightingale|title=Florence Nightingale on Social Change in India: Collected Works of Florence Nightingale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zaajLobsdS0C&amp;pg=PA841|date=6 December 2007|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press|isbn=978-0-88920-495-9|pages=841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later works include the novel titled ''The Old Missionary'' (1895, described on the title-page as "revised from ''[[The Contemporary Review]]''"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Old Missionary|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/5th-october-1895/19/the-old-missionary|accessdate=2014-12-23|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|date=5 October 1895|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Thackerays in India'' (1897). John F. Riddick describes Hunter's ''The Old Missionary'' as one of the "three significant works" produced by [[Anglo-Indian]] writers on Indian missionaries along with ''The Hosts of the Lord'' (1900) by [[Flora Annie Steel]] and ''Idolatry'' (1909) by [[Alice Perrin]].&lt;ref name="Riddick2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=John F. Riddick|title=The History of British India: A Chronology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Es6x4u_g19UC&amp;pg=PA179|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32280-8|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1898–1899, in consequence of the fatigue incurred in a journey to the Caspian and back, on a visit to the sick-bed of one of his two sons, Hunter was stricken down by a severe attack of [[influenza]], which affected his heart. He died at Oaken Holt on 6 February 1900.

S. C. Mittal believes that Hunter "represented the official mind of the bureaucratic Victorian historians in India", of whom [[James Talboys Wheeler]] and [[Alfred Comyn Lyall]] were other examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=India Distorted: A Study of British Historians on India |volume=2 |first=Satish Chandra |last=Mittal |publisher=M.D. Publications |year=1996 |isbn=9788175330184 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1_jphIo6hsC |page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gustav Woldemar Freiherr von Biedermann''' (5 March 1817, [[Marienberg, Saxony|Marienberg]] – 6 February 1903, [[Dresden]]) was a jurist, literary historian, and [[Goethe]] researcher.

==Life and work==
The son of the jurist and politician Gustav Heinrich Freiherr von Biederman, Woldemar von Biedermann studied [[legal science]] in Leipzig and Heidelberg from 1836 to 1839. After a period as a [[solicitor]], he entered the [[Saxony|Saxon]] civil service in 1845. In 1849 he found employment in the railway industry first as the government commissioner to the Executive board of the [[Chemnitz]]-[[Riesa]] railway company ({{lang-de|Chemnitz-Riseaer Eisenbahngesellschaft}}), as railway director in Chemnitz in 1851, in Leipzig in 1858, and in 1869 as Finance and Deputy Director-General of the Royal Saxon State Railways–a cabinet post. His son, Flodoard von Biedermann, urged him to publish his assemblage of recorded conversations of Goethe. This collected work was published between 1889 and 1896 in 10 volumes.

Other published writings include more than 180 critical and technical contributions to the Goethe literature. He edited several volumes of the Weimar (Sophie) Edition of Goethe's works, an effort for which he received an honorary doctorate from the philosophy department at the University of Leipzig.

Biedermann died in Dresden in 1903 and was buried in the ''Alte Annenfriedhof''.

'''Zeev Sternhell''' ({{lang-he-n|זאב שטרנהל}}, born 10 April 1935) is a [[Poles|Polish]]-born [[Israel]]i historian, political scientist, commentator on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], and writer. He is one of the world's leading experts on [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roger Griffin |title=The Nature of Fascism |publisher=Routledge |year=1993 |isbn=978-0415096614 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sternhell headed the Department of Political Science at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and writes for ''[[Haaretz]]'' newspaper.

==Biography==
Zeev Sternhell was born in [[Przemyśl]], [[Poland]], to an affluent secular Jewish family with [[Zionism|Zionist]] tendencies. His grandfather and father were textile merchants.&lt;ref name=Shavit&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Ari Shavit]] |date=6 March 2008 |title=Amazing grace |url=http://www.haaretz.com/amazing-grace-1.240739 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Soviet Union]] occupied eastern Poland, Soviet troops took over part of his home. His father died of natural causes. A few months after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, the family was sent to the ghetto.&lt;ref name=Shavit /&gt; His mother and older sister, Ada, were killed by the Nazis when he was seven years old. An uncle who had a permit to work outside the ghetto smuggled him to [[Lwów]].&lt;ref name=Traubmann&gt;{{cite news |author=Tamara Traubmann |date=8 February 2008 |title=Haaretz's Ze'ev Sternhell wins Israel Prize in political science |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/haaretz-s-ze-ev-sternhell-wins-israel-prize-in-political-science-1.238934 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uncle found a Polish officer who was willing to help them. Supplied with false [[Master race|Aryan]] papers, Sternhell lived with his aunt, uncle and cousin as a Polish Catholic. After the war, he was baptized, taking the Polish name Zbigniew Orolski.&lt;ref name=Shavit /&gt; He became an [[altar boy]] in the [[Wawel Cathedral|Cathedral of Kraków]]. In 1946, at the age of 11, Sternhell was taken to [[France]] on a [[Red Cross]] children's train, where he lived with an aunt. He learned French and was accepted to a school in [[Avignon]] despite stiff competition.&lt;ref name=Shavit /&gt;

In the winter of 1951, at the age of 16, Sternhell immigrated to [[Israel]] under the auspices of [[Youth Aliyah]], and was sent to [[Magdiel (school)|Magdiel boarding school]].&lt;ref name=Traubmann /&gt; In the 1950s, he served as a [[platoon]] commander in the [[Golani Brigade|Golani infantry brigade]], including the [[Suez Crisis|Sinai War]]. He fought as a reservist in the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Yom Kippur War]] and the [[1982 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref name=Shavit /&gt;

In 1957–1960, he studied history and [[political science]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], graduating with a BA [[Latin honors|cum laude]]. In 1969, he was awarded a Ph.D. from the [[Sciences Po|Institut d'études politiques de Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nias.knaw.nl/fellows/year-group-1997-98/sternhell-z |title=Sternhell, Z. |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his thesis on ''The Social and Political Ideas of [[Maurice Barrès]]''.

Sternhell lives in [[Jerusalem]] with his wife Ziva, an art historian. They have two daughters.

==Academic career==
In 1976, Sternhell became co-editor of ''The Jerusalem Quarterly'', remaining an active contributor until 1990. In 1981, he became a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1989, he was elected to the [[Léon Blum]] Chair of Political Science at the Hebrew University and became a member of the Editorial Board of ''History and Memory''. In 1991, the French government awarded him the title of "Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres" for his outstanding contribution to French culture. In 1996, he was a member of the Editorial Board of the ''[[Journal of Political Ideologies]]''.

In 2008, Sternhell was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for [[Political Science]].&lt;ref name=Traubmann /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) – Recipient's C.V. | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashsah/SeevSternhell/CvZeevSternhell.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) – Judges' Rationale for Grant to Recipient | url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashsah/SeevSternhell/NsZeevSternhell.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the award was contested in court in light of his controversial statements (see "Controversies" below), the court decided not to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=218605&amp;R=R6 |title=Leave the prize winners in peace |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Zeev Sternhell traces the roots of [[fascism]] to [[revolutionary]] [[far-left]] [[France|French]] movements, adding a branch, called the 'revolutionary right', to the three traditional right-wing families cited by [[René Rémond]] – [[legitimists|legitimism]], [[Orléanist|Orleanism]], and [[Bonapartism]]. The main influences, according to Sternhell were:
*''Boulangisme'', a [[Populism|populist]] movement led by [[Georges Boulanger]] who almost succeeded in his attempt at a coup d'état in 1889;
*[[anarcho-syndicalism|Revolutionary syndicalism]], pointing out how some [[Italy|Italian]] anarcho-syndicalists, influenced by [[George Sorel]]'s thought, embraced fascism in its early stages;
*[[Cercle Proudhon]]'s intellectual influence and the synthesis it would have provoked (the activities of [[Georges Valois]] and [[Edouard Berth]]).

His research has sparked criticism, in particular from French scholars who argue that the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] (1940–1944) was of a more traditional [[conservatism|conservative]] persuasion, although belonging to the far-right, than it was [[counter-revolutionary]], counter-revolutionary ideas being a main characteristic of fascism. [[René Rémond]] has questioned Sternhell's attribution of 'boulangisme' to the revolutionary right-wing movements. Some scholars say that Sternhell's thesis may shed important light on intellectual influences of fascism, but fascism in itself was not born of a sole [[ideology]] and its sociological make-up and popularity among the working classes must also be taken into account.

[[Stanley G. Payne]], for example, remarks in ''A History of Fascism'' that "Zeev Sternhell has conclusively demonstrated that nearly all the ideas found in fascism first appeared in France."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Stanley G. Payne]] |title=A History of Fascism |year=1995 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=978-0299148744 |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascism developed as a political movement in Italy, however, from where it exercised a prolonged influence on [[Nazism]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Sternhell's identification of [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]] with fascism has also given rise to debate, in particular his claim that [[Emmanuel Mounier]]'s [[personalism]] movement "shared ideas and political reflexes with Fascism". Sternhell has argued that Mounier's "revolt against individualism and materialism" would have led him to share the ideology of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;See Zeev Sternhell, "Sur le fascisme et sa variante française", in ''[[Le Débat]]'', November 1984, "Emmanuel Mounier et la contestation de la démocratie libérale dans la France des années 30", in ''Revue française de science politique'', December 1984, and also [[John Hellman]]'s book, from which he takes many of his sources, ''Emmanuel Mounier and the New Catholic Left, 1930–1950'', University of Toronto Press, 1981. See also [[Denis de Rougemont]], Mme Mounier et [[Jean-Marie Domenach]] dans ''Le personnalisme d'Emmanuel Mounier hier et demain'', Seuil, Paris, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Sternhell describes himself as [[liberalism|liberal]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Williams, [http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-07-08/news/mn-1354_1_liberal-values NEWS ANALYSIS : Liberalism on Defensive in Once-Receptive Israel], Los Angeles Times, July 8, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Zionism, Sternhell said in an interview with ''Haaretz'':&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not only a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains the right of the Jews to control their fate and their future. I consider the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, it is indeed a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.&lt;ref name=Shavit/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sternhell is a long-time supporter of the [[Israeli peace camp]] and writes critically in the Israeli press about the Israeli occupation and policy toward the [[Palestinians]].
In ''[[The Founding Myths of Israel]]'' (published in Hebrew in 1995), Sternhell says the main moral justification the Zionists gave for the founding of Israel in 1948 was the Jews' historical right to the land. In the epilogue, he writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, from the beginning, a sense of urgency gave the first Zionists the profound conviction that the task of reconquering the country had a solid moral basis. The argument of the Jews' historical right to the land was merely a matter of politics and propaganda. In view of the catastrophic situation of the Jews at the beginning of the century, the use of this argument was justified in every way, and it is all the more legitimate because of the threat of death hanging over the Jews. Historical rights were invoked to serve the need of finding a refuge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sternhell argues that after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, the threat to the Jews had disappeared, which changed the moral basis for retaining conquests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No leader was capable of saying that the conquest of the West Bank lacked the moral basis of the first half of the twentieth century, namely the circumstances of distress on which Israel was founded. A much-persecuted people needed and deserved not only a shelter, but also a state of its own. [...] Whereas the conquests of 1949 were an essential condition for the founding of Israel, the attempt to retain the conquests of 1967 had a strong flavor of imperial expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sternhell sees Jewish settlement on the West Bank as a wish of religious Zionism and part of labour Zionism, that the more moderate part of labour Zionism was unable to withstand because this wish was in line with deep Zionist convictions. He sees settlement on the West Bank as a danger to "Israel's ability to develop as a free and open society", because it puts nationalistic aims over social and liberal aims.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

He says something fundamental changed with the [[Oslo Accords|Oslo agreements]]: "In the history of Zionism the Oslo agreements constitute a turning point, a true revolution. For the first time in its history, the Jewish national movement recognized the equal rights of the Palestinian people to freedom and independence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ends the epilogue with: "The only uncertain factor today is the moral and political price Israeli society will have to pay to overcome the resistance that the hard core of the settlers is bound to show to any just and reasonable solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Z. Sternhell|year=1998|title=The Founding Myths of Israel|isbn=0-691-01694-1|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview, Sternhell claimed indicators of fascism exist in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs of Fascism in Israel Reached New Peak During Gaza Op, Says Renowned Scholar|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.610368|website=Ha'aretz|accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Defamation===
Sternhell was taken to court by [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]], in 1983, after Sternhell published his work ''Ni Droite, ni gauche'' (''Neither Right nor Left''). Jouvenel sued Sternhell on nine counts, and Sternhell was subsequently convicted for defamation. In his book, Sternhell accused Jouvenel of having had Fascist sympathies. Convicted on two counts, Sternhell did not however need to retract his remarks from the book.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wohl. French Fascism, Both Right and Left: Reflections on the Sternhell Controversy. ''The Journal of Modern History'', Vol. 63, No. 1, (1991), pp. 91–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy with settler movement===
Sternhell won the [[Israel Prize]] in political science in February 2008. His political views provoked a stormy reaction amongst supporters of the settlers' movement. Supporters of Sternhell have said he was repeatedly threatened with violence for his views.&lt;ref name="Haaretz back to days"&gt;{{cite news|author=Shahar Ilan|author2=Roni Singer-Heruti|date=25 September 2008|title=Dichter: Prof attack takes us back to days of Rabin assassination|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/dichter-prof-attack-takes-us-back-to-days-of-rabin-assassination-1.254609|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opponents tend to claim that Sternhell's writings support terrorism and promote state violence against Jewish settlers in the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=8 February 2008|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/125186|title=Israel Prize to go to Pro-Terror, Pro-Civil War Prof|author=Gil Ronen|publisher=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Haaretz'' writer Nadav Shragai wrote that Sternhell angered right-wing extremists in Israel because, in their view, some of Sternhell's statements "justified the murder of settlers by terrorists and tried to foment civil war." For instance, in a 2001 Hebrew op-ed piece in the Israeli newspaper ''Haaretz'', Sternhell wrote: "Many in Israel, perhaps even the majority of the voters, do not doubt the legitimacy of the armed resistance in the territories themselves. The Palestinians would be wise to concentrate their struggle against the settlements, avoid harming women and children and strictly refrain from firing on Gilo, Nahal Oz or Sderot; it would also be smart to stop planting bombs to the west of the Green Line. By adopting such an approach, the Palestinians would be sketching the profile of a solution that is the only inevitable one: The amended Green Line will be an international border and territory will be handed over to compensate the Palestinians for land that has already been or will be annexed to Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Zeev Sternhell|date=11 May 2001|script-title=he:מול ממשלה סהרורית|language=he|trans-title=Against the Government Sleepwalker|url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/misc/1.700439|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shragai&gt;{{cite news|author=Nadav Shragai|authorlink=Nadav Shragai|date=26 September 2008|title=Red flag for the right|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/red-flag-for-the-right-1.254658|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly wrote in ''Davar'' in 1988 that "Only those who are prepared to take Ofra with tanks can stop the fascist erosion threatening to drown Israel's democracy."&lt;ref name=Shragai/&gt;

==Attack==
On 25 September 2008, Sternhell was the victim of a [[pipe bomb]] attack at his home, and was injured in the leg and hospitalized.&lt;ref name="says_3rd_paragraph_long-time_supporter_of_Peace_Now"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Israeli peace advocate attacked|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=3 October 2008|author=Rory McCarthy|date=26 September 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/26/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerusalem police, who found fliers offering more than 1 million [[shekel]]s (approximately $300,000) to anyone who kills members of [[Peace Now]] at the scene, suspected that he was attacked by right-wing settler extremists for his views. From his hospital bed, Sternhell said that "the very occurrence of the incident goes to illustrate the fragility of Israeli democracy, and the urgent need to defend it with determination and resolve."{{cn|date=May 2018}}

"On the personal level", he continued, "if the intent was to terrorize, it has to be very clear that I am not easily intimidated; but the perpetrators tried to hurt not only me, but each and every one of my family members who could have opened the door, and for that there is no absolution and no forgiveness."&lt;ref name="Haaretz back to days"/&gt; After his release from the hospital, he said he would continue to voice his opinions. [[French Foreign Minister]] [[Bernard Kouchner]] condemned the attack, saying "The assault on Professor Sternhell is an assault on values of peace and brotherhood that served as an inspiration to Israel's founding fathers."&lt;ref name="glickman"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Glickman|first=Aviad|title=Prof. Sternhell: I'll continue to voice my views|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|accessdate=16 May 2018|date=26 September 2008|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3602507,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the investigation was launched, right wing settler groups made claims that the bombing had been carried out by ''agents provocateurs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=3 October 2008|title=News in Brief|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/news-in-brief-1.254900|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=11 September 2014|quote=The Campaign for Saving the People and the Country claims that the bombing, generally believed to have been carried out by right-wing extremists in response to Sternhell's left-wing political activism, was a provocation aimed at turning public opinion against the settlers to make future evacuations easier. 'The timing and nature of the operation leave no room for doubt it was the work of a provocateur', it wrote. (Ofra Edelman)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, Israel police arrested [[Yaakov Teitel|Jack Teitel]], a Florida-born religious Jew, for the attack on Sternhell. Israel police revealed that Teitel, who apparently acted alone, also admitted to a string of other terrorist attacks and attempted attacks, including murdering a Palestinian taxi driver and a West Bank shepherd in 1997 and an attack on the home of a [[Messianic Judaism|Messianic Jew]] in the city of [[Ariel (city)|Ariel]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2 November 2009|title=Israeli Police Arrest West Bank Settler over Palestinian Killings|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/israeli-police-arrest-west-bank-settler-over-palestinian-killings-1.764683|newspaper=The Irish Times|accessdate=11 September 2014}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Amos Harel|author2=Chaim Levinson|date=2 November 2008|title=U.S.-born Jewish terrorist suspected of series of attacks over past 12 years|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/u-s-born-jewish-terrorist-suspected-of-series-of-attacks-over-past-12-years-1.4973|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Éric Toussaint''' is a historian and political scientist with a PhD from the universities of Paris VIII and Liège. He is spokesperson for the CADTM (Committee for the abolition of illegitimate debt)  - formerly called [[Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt]] - international network, of which he is one of the founding members, and he took part in the process that launched the World Social Forum in 2001.

For more than twenty years his economic analyses and reviews have been widely read in the press and on the Internet. He is the author of numerous books, the most recent being ''Bankocracy'' (2015);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadtm.org/World-Debt-Figures-2015 |title=World Debt Figures 2015 |publisher=CADTM |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-authored with Pierre Gottiniaux, Daniel Munevar and Antonio Sanabria (2015); and ''The Life and Crimes of an Exemplary Man'' (2014).&lt;ref name="cadtm1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadtm.org/The-Life-and-Crimes-of-an |title=The Life and Crimes of an Exemplary Man |publisher=CADTM |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of his books have been published in more than a dozen languages and have become reference works on questions of debt and International Financial Institutions: ''Debt, the IMF, and the World Bank:  Sixty Questions, Sixty Answers'' (2010);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadtm.org/Debt-the-IMF-and-the-World-Bank |title=Debt, the IMF, and the World Bank: Sixty Questions, Sixty Answers |publisher=CADTM |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The World Bank: A Critical Primer'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadtm.org/The-World-Bank-A-critical-Primer |title=The World Bank : A critical Primer |publisher=CADTM |date= |accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taken part in producing two manuals for conducting citizens’ audits.

==Biography  ==
Born in Namur in 1954, Éric Toussaint lived in the mining village of [[Retinne]], near [[Liège]] (Belgium),  where his parents were teachers. [[Retinne]] had a population of 2,500 people of more than thirty different nationalities. At the age of thirteen, already present in the struggles of that time (opposition to the war in Vietnam and racism, and supporting workers’ struggles and the Prague Spring among others), he joined the students’ union branch of the FGTB. In 1968 he took part in launching a pupils’ movement that spread to several schools. It was the start of many struggles. In 1970 Éric joined the IVth International and helped to create the "Workers Revolutionary League" (Ligue révolutionnaire des travailleurs – LRT) in May 1970 and became a member of the Politburo alongside [[Ernest Mandel]]. Since 1980 he has been a member of the 4th International's United Secretariat and International Committee.

== Professional and political work ==
Éric Toussaint held senior positions in the public service union CGSP – teaching branch. Between 1975 and 1994, he actively participated in numerous popular mobilizations (teachers, steelworkers, municipal workers ...). The 1980s were marked by numerous strikes, either to improve public services (including public education), or for structural anti-capitalist reforms, or again to resist the neoliberal offensive. He was particularly active in strikes and workers’ movements in Liège (where he was a teacher) where the population was overwhelmed by the burden of the city's public debt throughout the 1980s. 

The notion of international solidarity has had an ever growing influence in his activities and reflections: solidarity with the strikers in Poland in 1980, the British miners in 1984-1985, support for revolutionary experiences by organizing voluntary work brigades to help the farmers in Nicaragua between 1979 and 1989, solidarity against the repression used to quell the "Tiananmen square demonstration" in 1989, opposition to the blockade imposed on Cuba by the United States government, support for the Palestinian struggle and many other struggles around the world.

In 1990 he contributed to the creation of the Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt (CADTM - Henceforth 'Committee for the abolition of illegitimate debt') and became its president. This committee is now an international network that operates in thirty countries on four continents. In 1999 he participated in the creation of ATTAC Belgium and the World Social Forum in Brazil and its international council in 2001, the European Social Forum in 2002 and the Alter Summit in 2012.

Since 2000 he has been  involved with leftist  governments and popular movements in Latin American and elsewhere on the themes of debt, the [[Bank of the South]] and other alternatives.

In 2003 he advised the new Timor-Leste government on relations with the IMF and the World Bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cadtm.org/Timor-Oriental-la-Banque-mondiale|title=Timor Oriental : la Banque mondiale et le FMI face au nouvel État|date=|publisher=CADTM|accessdate=2017-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 and in 2008 he was invited by the Economic Commission of the [[African Union]] to present propositions on the abolition of illegitimate debts demanded from African countries.
