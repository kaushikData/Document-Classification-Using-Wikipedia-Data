      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2532">The following article presents a summary of the 1906 [[football (soccer)]] season in [[Paraguay]].

==Overview==
Shortly after the foundation of the governing body of football, the '''Liga Paraguaya de Fútbol''' (known today as [[Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol]]) on June 18, the first championship was organized with the participation of the five original founding clubs and Club 14 de Mayo. The first match was played on July 8 between [[Olimpia Asunción|Olimpia]] and [[Club Guaraní|Guaraní]], resulting in a 1-1 tie.

Salvador Melián of Guaraní has the honor of being the first scorer in Paraguayan league history, while Miguel Díaz of Olimpia was the second scorer in the 1-1 tie match.

==[[Primera División de Paraguay|Liga Paraguaya]] results==
[[Club Guaraní|Guaraní]] was the first Paraguayan champion. The tournament was played between six teams in a two round [[Round-robin tournament|all-play-all]] system, being the team with the most points at the end of the two rounds the champion. Guaraní played 10 games, winning 8, drawing 2 and not losing any of them.

* January 29 – [[Timothy Bradley vs. Devon Alexander|Timothy Bradley defeats Devon Alexander]] by a tenth round technical decision. The fight was stopped due to a cut Alexander had received from an accidental [[headbutt]] in the third round, which was made worse by two more headbutts in the eighth round and a final fourth headbutt in the tenth round. Both fighters came in with undefeated records and the fight was initially praised as one of the few good match-ups between two top-ranked [[United States|Americans]] in recent years.

The '''700th Anniversary Stadium''' ({{lang-th|สนามเชียงใหม่ 700 ปี}}) is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Chiang Mai]], [[Chiang Mai Province]], [[Thailand]], built to host the [[1995 Southeast Asian Games]] and to commemorate the 700th Anniversary of Chiang Mai's establishment at the same time. It was also used for the [[1998 Asian Games]]. Football side [[Chiangmai F.C.]] returned to the stadium for the 2009 season having used a municipal stadium elsewhere in the city in recent years.
Architecturally, the stadium is clearly a forebear of the [[80th Birthday Stadium]] in [[Nakhon Ratchasima]]. A continuous single tier, almost a perfect circle, rises up on one side to form a large main stand which provides covered accommodation for 4,500 spectators. Only the main stand has plastic seats and cover. The rest of the tribunes are uncovered concrete steps painted white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bangkokbiznews.com/news/detail/660054/ |title=เชียงใหม่จัดใหญ่ครบ 2 ทศวรรษ สนามกีฬา 700 ปี}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmsat5.com/%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1700%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%B5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19034">There are several '''concerns and controversies''' related to the [[42nd Chess Olympiad]], which took place in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], from 1–14 September 2016. 

== Before the Olympiad ==
=== Anti-cheating measures ===
{{see also|Cheating in chess}}
Mindful particularly of the cheating incident of [[Sébastien Feller]] at the [[39th Chess Olympiad]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2012/FIDE/FIDE_Ethics_Commission_Judgement_in_the_case_French_Team.pdf FIDE Ethics Commission judgement 2/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the general increase of cheating incidents, the World Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) strove to have greatly enhanced security in Baku. Some of these were already introduced at the [[Chess World Cup 2015]] (also in Baku), which included transmission delay of (some) games, random security checks of players, ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installment of electronic checkpoints for players at the entrance of the playing hall (see below).&lt;ref name="anti-cheating"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2016/FIDE_News/Olympiad/Anti_Cheating_measures_and_procedure_for_Baku_42_World_Chess_Olympiad.pdf |title=Anti Cheating Procedures — 42nd Chess Olympiad, Baku, Azerbaijan, 1–14 September 2016 |publisher=FIDE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, [[Israel Gelfer]] (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) said that the issue of anti-cheating became important in the last couple of years, with the development of [[Telecommunication|telecommunication technologies]] (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/9609-interview-with-the-fide-vice-president-israel-gelfer.html Interview with Israel Gelfer] (FIDE)&lt;/ref&gt; The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti-cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30-40 checks ''during the round''; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area.&lt;ref name="anti-cheating" /&gt; Both of these later came into difficulties with their implementation (see below).

=== Visas ===
Due to a small number of embassies, [[Azerbaijan]] can be more difficult to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and [[Azad Rahimov]] noted the country had a positive experience with the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem.&lt;ref name=minutes2012&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2012/Congress/Minutes_of_FIDE_General_Assembly_2012.pdf Minutes 2012 FIDE General Assembly] (Page 49)&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan [[Ilham Aliyev]] signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country’s international airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azertag.az/en/xeber/Simplification_of_visa_procedures_for_foreigners_arriving_for_World_Chess_Olympiad-944094 |title=Simplification of visa procedures for foreigners arriving for World Chess Olympiad |publisher=AzerTAc |date=19 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, it was unclear whether any non-attendees (see below) were absent for specifically this reason.

=== Armenian withdrawal ===
[[File:Levon Aronian 2011.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Levon Aronian missed the Olympiad as Armenia chose not to participate]]
Armenia's participation in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the 83rd FIDE Congress in [[Istanbul]] in 2012 during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in 2016, with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess players would find it quite difficult to play in Baku.&lt;ref name=minutes2012 /&gt;

Historically this is nothing new, as the tense relations between [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] because of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting in the absence of players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the [[World Chess Championship 2012]] was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to [[Kazan]], with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's [[Levon Aronian]] was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.chessbase.com/post/fide-to-move-candidates-matches-topalov-threatens-boycott FIDE to move Candidates matches] (ChessBase, Kommersant)&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 [[World Team Chess Championship]] in [[Tsaghkadzor]], and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the [[2014 European Individual Chess Championship|European Individual Chess Championship 2014]] in Yerevan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-news.ru/en/node/17991 |title=Azerbaijan To Miss World Team Championship in Armenia |publisher=Chess-News |date=29 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eicc2014.am/content/players |title=European Individual Chess Championship 2014 — List of Participants |publisher=EICC 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 [[Chess World Cup]] in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/content.php?section=Sports&amp;title=the-baku-world-cup-starts&amp;id=115399 |title=The Baku World Cup starts |author=Bobby Ang |publisher=[[BusinessWorld]] |date=17 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asbarez.com/139394/armenian-chess-grand-master-to-participate-in-world-cup-in-baku/ |title=Armenian Chess Grand Master To Participate in World Cup in Baku |publisher=[[Asbarez]] |date=2 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, during his visit to Yerevan, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that, after talking to the [[Chess Federation of Armenia|Armenian Chess Federation]] chairman [[Serzh Sargsyan]] (also [[President of Armenia]]), he heard no refusal about their participation. The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation [[Smbat Lputian]] responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.armenianow.com/en/sports/chess/2016/05/25/armenia-chess-ilyumzhinov-baku-olympiad-armenians-participation/3866/ |title=FIDE Chief: Armenians to participate in Baku Chess Olympiad |publisher=[[ArmeniaNow]] |date=25 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/855185/armenian-chess-team-not-to-participate-in-world-chess-olympiad-in-baku.html |title=Armenian chess team not to participate in World Chess Olympiad in Baku |publisher=[[Armenpress]] |date=25 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other federation difficulties===
====Pakistan====
One week before the Olympiad started, the Pakistani Sports Board, dealing with three separate claimants to status of official national federation, refused to issue "No Objection Certificates" (NOCs). A spokesman said, "we have refused to issue NOCs to around 15 men and women chess players and two officials as currently no chess federation is recognised by us. Issuing them NOCs will mean we’ve accepted an illegal body.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://pakobserver.net/psb-springs-into-action-to-stop-departure-of-chess-team-to-azerbaijan |title= PSB Spring into action to stop departure |newspaper= [[Pak Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, a team from Pakistan (with its top players) did attend and finished slightly above average.&lt;ref name="teams-open"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess-results.com/tnr232875.aspx?lan=1&amp;art=0&amp;flag=30&amp;wi=821&amp;zeilen=99999 |title=42nd Olympiad Baku 2016 Open |publisher=Chess-Results }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kenya====
Kenya has had a long running dispute within its federation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2016/FIDE_News/GA_Agenda_2016/Annex_62.pdf 2016 FIDE General Assembly] (Annex 62)&lt;/ref&gt; and due to this and other reasons (see below) the open team ended up not showing up for the event and the women's team began play only in round 5.&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/bad-day-for-number-ones-russia-and-two-world-champs-struggle-8946 Round 4 report] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other non-attendees ===
====Israel====
Israel participated without [[Boris Gelfand]], [[Emil Sutovsky]], and [[Ilya Smirin]] due to a dispute with the Israel Chess Federation management. The hardships were already evident in 2015, when the country failed to send a team at the [[European Team Chess Championship]] due to monetary difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess-news.ru/en/node/20436 Israeli Team Won't Come to Reykjavik Despite All Efforts to Raise Funds] (Chess News)&lt;/ref&gt; Boris Gelfand, who played on board one for Israel at nine consecutive Olympiads (1998-2014), said the management of the Israel Chess Federation have "absolutely forgotten about such things as the prestige of the country". Emil Sutovsky claimed on his [[Facebook]] page that the dispute was about "showing who’s boss rather than money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/read/news/gelfand-on-missing-the-baku-olympiad |title=Gelfand on missing the Baku Olympiad |publisher=[[Chess24.com]] |date=2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria played without [[Ivan Cheparinov]] and [[Kiril Georgiev]], the former due to monetary disputes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CqsjNz7WcAAc1lL.jpg JPEG from Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethics.fide.com/images/stories/Ethics_Decision_case_4_2015.pdf FIDE Ethics case 4/2015] (also mentions national court situation)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.segabg.com/article.php?id=822736 The court decides who is right/wrong in chess] (Bulgarian). The issue was addressed by Bulgarian courts who concluded the ban was improper, but that decision is under appeal. After the FIDE General Assembly (following the Ethics Commission) voted to ban the Bulgarian Chess Federation if no action was taken, the ban was then lifted.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Veselin Topalov]] left midway through the event to attend to his pregnant wife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/SilvioDanailov/status/773434604283977728 Twitter] (Silvio Danailov)&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, the entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they were absent from the 2015 [[European Team Chess Championship]]), as was [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/217627 Armenian team won't participate in Baku-hosted Chess Olympiad ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individuals====
Other than the above, the most prominent individual not participating was [[Vishwanathan Anand]], who has not represented [[India]] since 2006. [[Vassily Ivanchuk]] from [[Ukraine]] was absent for the first time since 1988, choosing to play in a [[draughts]] tournament instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/who-is-and-who-isn-t-playing-the-olympiad-7202 Who is and isn't playing the Olympiad] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

== During the Olympiad ==
=== African nations ===
A number of African nations did not show up in time, for various reasons such as difficulties flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later).&lt;ref name=chesscom-r2&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/carlsen-succeeds-with-new-first-move-in-second-round-olympiad-4273 Round 2 report] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4/&gt;

=== Lack of security measures ===
Despite the aforementioned anti-cheating protocols, some participants felt that this was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of [[FIDE]] President [[Kirsan Ilyumzhinov]].&lt;ref name=chesscom-r2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=colovic&gt;[http://www.alexcolovic.com/2016/09/anti-cheating-in-baku.html Anti-Cheating in Baku] (Alex Colovic)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecforum.org.uk/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=8196&amp;start=45#p188290 English Chess Federation post] (Nick Faulks, Bermuda)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.&lt;ref name=colovic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Eljanov/status/772169876257538049 Twitter] (Pavel Eljanov, Twitter)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/Eljanov/status/772170556720513024 Twitter] (Part 2 of previous)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complaints on anti-cheating measures ===
A significant petition was circulated by [[Jonathan Speelman]] and others regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area (the petition concentrated on toilet visits).&lt;ref name=petition&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chess24.com/en/read/news/olympiad-protest-at-anti-cheating-toilet-rule |title=Olympiad protest at “anti-cheating” toilet rule |publisher=Chess24.com |date=4 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/grandmasters-meet-as-olympiad-heats-up-in-baku-7145 Round 3 report] (Chess.com)&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons given for this protesting against this "noxious" rule included: the FIDE rule that the toilet is part of the playing area; an indication it was "humiliating" for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters (and embarrassing for the arbiters); a note that the Match Arbiter (the indicated person to be notified) was not always available, rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule; an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating, and a request that players not be penalised merely for this; and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left for the bathroom visit.&lt;ref name=petition /&gt; The response by Chief Arbiter [[Faiq Hasanov]] noted only that the third complaint was legitimate, and that "common sense" should apply.&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4 /&gt;

[[File:Nigel Short 2013.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Nigel Short received official warning for refusing to undergo a check during a game]]

During the game of the seventh round between [[Nigel Short]] and [[Li Chao (chess player)|Li Chao]], the former was returning from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti-cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices.&lt;ref name=CNshort&gt;[http://chess-news.ru/node/22012 Nigel Short refused an arbiter] (Chess-News, Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chess.com/news/usa-russia-double-feature-russian-men-escape-with-draw-women-not-as-lucky-8773 Round 8 report] (Chess.com, updating the Short story)&lt;/ref&gt; Short discussed the event extensively after the event, indicating that he did not think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit has in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device).&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/read/news/Nigel+Short+calls+anti-cheating+rule+%E2%80%9Canti-chess%E2%80%9D Nigel Short calls anti-cheating rule "anti-chess"] (Chess24, Interview with Nigel Short)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldAYecXObPA A quick chat with Nigel Short in Baku 2016] (Youtube video, Daniel King)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Short also mentioned the fact he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the [[Solomon Islands]]) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations).&lt;ref name=CNshort /&gt; Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters "ask[ing] him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search" while in time trouble and playing a "do-or-die" position, though these details now seem discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.chessbase.com/post/2016-baku-rd7-the-day-the-giants-fell Round 7 report] (ChessBase, Albert Silver)&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple post-event comments by captains and players continued to report the annoyance of the anti-cheating measures, noting that a better balance between security and enjoyment could be found by FIDE.&lt;ref name=colovic /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chessexpress.blogspot.com.au/2016/09/back-from-baku.html Back from Baku] (Shaun Press)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://chess24.com/en/read/news/korobov-i-decided-to-return-to-this-factory Interview with Anton Korobov] (Chess24)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baadur Jobava]] was prominent on the other side of the issue, opining that the anti-cheating measures would help solve the non-stop screaming about this great "headache" for the 21st century chess player.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/baadur.jobava/posts/10210094420054518 Facebook post] (Baadur Jobava)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japanese player forfeited ===
In the fourth round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was forfeited after he was caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in a change in the match score. Chief Arbiter [[Faiq Hasanov]] said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating ''per se'', Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment.&lt;ref name=chesscom-r4 /&gt; The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the [[Association of Chess Professionals]] Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.&lt;ref name=colovic /&gt;

In [[baseball]], a '''double play''' (denoted as '''DP''' in [[baseball statistics]]) is the act of making two [[out (baseball)|outs]] during the same continuous play. The double play is defined in the Official Rules in the '''Definitions of Terms''', and for the official scorer in Rule 9.11.&lt;ref name=rulebook /&gt; Double plays can occur any time there is at least one [[Base running|baserunner]] and less than two outs.

During the {{mlby|2016}} [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) regular season, the average for double plays completed by each team during the course of a 162-game season was 145&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Major League Baseball Team Statistics and Standings | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2016.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | accessdate=22 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; — nearly one per game by each team.

==Examples==
[[File:Bret-boone seattle-v-cincinnati 06-19-2002.jpg|thumb|right|300px|After stepping on second base, the fielder throws to first to complete a double play]]
The simplest scenario for a double play is a runner on first base with less than two outs. In that context, five example double plays are:
* The '''batter hits a ground ball'''
** to a [[middle infielder]], who throws the ball to the other middle infielder, who steps on second base to force out the runner coming from first (first out), and then throws the ball to the first baseman in time to force out the batter (second out). As both outs are made by force plays, this is referred to as a "force double play".&lt;ref name=rulebook&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/official_rules.jsp | website=Major League Baseball | title=Official Rules | accessdate=13 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most common double play.&lt;br /&gt;The [[neighborhood play]] is a recurring source of controversy: Umpires sometimes call the first out even though the infielder is not touching second base but merely "in the neighborhood".
** to the first baseman, who steps on first base to force out the batter (first out), and with the baserunner trying to advance from first base to second base, throws the ball to the shortstop who puts out the runner (second out). This is referred to as a "reverse force double play",&lt;ref name=rulebook /&gt; although executing the first out removes the condition that forced the runner to take second base. The second out must be made with a tag.
* The '''batter hits the ball in the air'''
** a line drive to the first baseman, who catches it (first out), and then steps on first base before the baserunner can return to first to [[tag up]] (second out).  This is also an example of an unassisted double play.
** a deep fly ball to the right fielder, who catches it (first out), meanwhile the baserunner tags up and attempts to advance, and the outfielder throws the ball to the shortstop who tags the runner before he reaches second base (second out).
* The '''batter strikes out''' (first out).
**If the runner was trying to steal second base, it is a double play (and the runner is [[caught stealing]]) if a fielder (typically, a middle infielder) tags the runner.

Double plays can occur in many ways in addition to these examples, and can involve many combinations of fielders. A double play can include an out resulting from a rare event, such as [[interference (baseball)|interference]] or an [[appeal play]].

===Recordkeeping===
Per standard [[baseball positions]], the examples given above are recorded, respectively, as:
:* 4-6-3 (second baseman to shortstop to first baseman) or 6-4-3 (shortstop to second baseman to first baseman)
:* 3-6 (first baseman to shortstop)
:* 3 (first baseman), unassisted
:* 9-6 (right fielder to shortstop)
:* kc or ks (strike out, called or swinging), 2-6 or 2-4 cs (caught stealing, catcher to shortstop or catcher to second baseman)

Double plays that are initiated by a batter hitting a ground ball are recorded in baseball statistics as '''GIDP''' (grounded into double play). This statistic has been tracked since 1933 in the [[National League]] and since 1939 in the [[American League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/GIDP_leagues.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | title=Yearly League Leaders &amp; Records for Double Plays Grounded Into | accessdate=22 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statistic does not include line-outs into double plays, for which there is no official statistic for a batter.

== Strategy ==
The double play is a coup for the fielding team and debilitating to the batting team. The fielding team can select pitches to induce a double play — such as a [[Sinker (baseball)|sinker]], which is more likely to be hit as a ground ball — and can position fielders to make a ground ball more likely to be turned into a double play. The batting team may take action — such as a [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]] play — to reduce the chance of grounding into a force double play.

==Terminology==
In [[baseball slang]], making a double play is referred to as "turning two" or a "twin killing".  Double plays are also known as "the pitcher's best friend" because they disrupt offense more than any other play, except for the rare [[triple play]].  A force double play made on a ground ball hit to the third baseman, who throws to the second baseman, who then throws to the first baseman, is referred to as an "around the horn" double play. A "strike 'em out, throw 'em out" double play occurs when a base runner is [[caught stealing]] immediately after the batter [[strikeout|strikes out]]. The ability to "make the pivot" on a force double play – receiving a throw from the third base side, then quickly turning and throwing to first base – is a key skill for a second baseman.

==Tinker to Evers to Chance==
The most famous double play trio – although they never set any records – were [[Joe Tinker]], [[Johnny Evers]] and [[Frank Chance]], who played shortstop, second baseman and first baseman, respectively, for the [[Chicago Cubs]] between 1902 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Singer|first1=Tom|title=Power of poem immortalizes Cubs trio|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/3000452|website=MLB.com|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their double play against the [[New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] in a 1910 game inspired Giants fan [[Franklin Pierce Adams]] to write the short poem ''[[Baseball's Sad Lexicon]]'', otherwise known as ''Tinker to Evers to Chance'', which immortalized the trio.&lt;ref name=Hageman&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hageman|first1=William|title=Remembering 'Tinker to Evers to Chance'|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-tinker-cubs-story-story.html|accessdate=14 September 2016|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three players were part of the Cubs team that won the [[National League]] pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910, and the [[World Series]] in 1907 and 1908, turning 491 double plays on the way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schell|first1=Michael J|title=Baseball's All-Time Best Hitters: How Statistics Can Level the Playing Field|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1400850630|page=181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ii8aBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1946.&lt;ref name=Hageman/&gt;

==Odd and notable double plays==
* The New York Yankees recorded a rare 4-1-5 double play against the San Francisco Giants on July 24, 2016, in the top of the 8th inning.  The Giants had [[Mac Williamson]] on first base with one out, when [[Ramiro Peña]] hit a ground ball that got by Yankees' first baseman [[Mark Teixeira]] but was fielded on the edge of the outfield grass by [[Starlin Castro]].  Castro threw to pitcher [[Chad Green (pitcher)|Chad Green]] at first base to retire Peña.  Meanwhile, Williamson had rounded second on his way to third, and a throw from Green to third baseman [[Chase Headley]] resulted in Williamson being tagged out, ending the inning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Bryan | last=Hoch | title=Yankees stun Giants with rare DP combo | url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/191551688/chad-green-yankees-turn-4-1-5-double-play/ | website=MLB.com | date=24 Jul 2016 | accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=San Francisco Giants at New York Yankees Play by Play and Boxscore | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA201607240.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | date=24 Jul 2016 | accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A bizarre 8-6-2 double play occurred in a nationally televised game between the [[New York Yankees]] and [[Chicago White Sox]] on August 2, 1985, in the bottom of the 7th inning. With [[Bobby Meacham]] on second base and [[Dale Berra]] on first base, [[Rickey Henderson]] hit a single to deep left-center.  Berra ran quickly from first to second, while Meachem stopped his run towards third to return to second base to tag up (expecting the ball would be caught).  After the ball was not caught, both runners – now within a few yards of each other – ran to third and then tried to score.  A throw from [[Luis Salazar]] in centerfield to [[Ozzie Guillén]] at shortstop was relayed to catcher [[Carlton Fisk]] in time for him to tag out both Meacham and Berra at the plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fisk gets two outs at home plate | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqupB5DpnU4 | website=YouTube | date=17 Feb 2015 | accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicago White Sox at New York Yankees Play by Play and Boxscore | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA198508020.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | date=2 Aug 1985 | accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* A very similar 9-4-2 double play occurred on October 4, 2006, in Game 1 of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets.  After [[Russell Martin]] hit a single to right field, both [[Jeff Kent]] and [[J.D. Drew]] were tagged out at the plate by catcher [[Paul Lo Duca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2006 NLDS Gm1: Lo Duca tags out two at the plate | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD0mRZ2B37Y | website=YouTube | date=8 Nov 2014 | accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Los Angeles Dodges at New York Mets Play by Play and Boxscore | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYN/NYN200610040.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | date=4 Oct 2006 | accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 9-2-7-2 double play on July 9, 1985, effectively ended the career of [[Toronto Blue Jays]] catcher [[Buck Martinez]].  With [[Phil Bradley]] – a former University of Missouri football player – on second base, [[Gorman Thomas]] hit a single to right field.  As Bradley rounded third, Blue Jays right fielder [[Jesse Barfield]] charged and fielded the ball and threw to Martinez, who had just enough time to catch the ball before absorbing Bradley's full charge.  Despite suffering a broken leg and severely dislocated ankle, Martinez maintained control of the ball and registered the out at home plate.  As Thomas rounded second, Martinez attempted to throw to third base from a seated position, but the ball missed the third baseman and went into left field.  On the error, Thomas rounded third in an attempt to score.  Left fielder [[George Bell (outfielder)|George Bell]] fielded the ball near the left-field foul line and quickly returned the ball with a one-hop throw to Martinez, who tagged out Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Buck Martinez | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBoriyxPTuk | website=YouTube | date=10 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Callum | last=Hughson | title=Epic Games in Blue Jays History: Buck Martinez Completes a Double Play on a Broken Leg | url=http://mopupduty.com/epic-games-in-blue-jays-history-buck-martinez-completes-a-double-play-on-a-broken-leg | website=Mop-Up Duty | date=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=David | last=Schoenfield | title=The greatest play ever made | url=http://www.espn.com/blog/sweetspot/post/_/id/28631/the-greatest-play-ever-made | website=ESPN | date=5 Sep 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On July 30, {{mlby|2014}}, a 1-6-1-5 double play occurred without the ball being put into play in top of the 6th inning a game between the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[San Francisco Giants]]. Giants reliever [[Jean Machi]], having inherited [[Gaby Sanchez]] (as a pinch-runner for [[Ike Davis]]) and [[Travis Snider]] as base-runners and having allowed a sacrifice to [[Jordy Mercer]], issued a one-out [[Base on balls|walk]] to [[Chris Stewart (baseball)|Chris Stewart]] with first base open. However, since the ball is still live on a walk, Machi, noticing that Snider was well off second base, threw the ball to shortstop [[Brandon Crawford]], who chased down and tagged out Snider for the second out of the inning. Crawford then saw Sanchez having vacated third base and trying to score, and so Crawford threw the ball to Machi (by now in the third base line) to chase Sanchez back to third. Machi then threw the ball to [[Pablo Sandoval]], who chased down and tagged out Sanchez for the third out.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/pirates-double-play-walk-giants-base-running-error-pittsburgh-san-francisco-tootblan/mf2ixuwu3x1y15m1o48zsnohf|title=Pirates' baserunning error leads to double play on walk|author=Machir, Troy|work=[[Sporting News]]|date=2014-07-31|accessdate=2018-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Infield shift|Shifts]] away from normal defensive alignment can create scenarios in which unusual double plays can occur.
:* During the April 12, 2008, game between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Boston Red Sox]], in the top of the 7th inning the Boston infield was shifted right for New York left-handed power hitter [[Jason Giambi]], with a baserunner on first. Giambi grounded to second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]], who threw to third baseman [[Kevin Youkilis]], covering second due to the shift. Youkilis tagged second, then threw to first baseman [[Sean Casey (baseball)|Sean Casey]] to complete the rare 4-5-3 double play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New York Yankees at Boston Red Sox Play by Play and Boxscore | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS200804120.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | date=12 Apr 2008| accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The Chicago Cubs turned a 7-2-3 double play against the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 2, 2014.  Tied 3–3 in the bottom of the 13th inning, the Pirates loaded the bases with no outs.  The Cubs then defensively placed left fielder [[Junior Lake]] in the infield, near the third base line.  Batter [[Clint Barmes]] hit a ground ball to Lake, who threw home for one out, and the catcher then threw to first base for the second out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chicago Cubs at Pittsburgh Pirates Play by Play and Boxscore | url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PIT/PIT201404020.shtml | website=Baseball Reference | date=2 Apr 2014| accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CHC@PIT: Lake turns the 7-2-3 double play | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye7tnhabnXE | website=YouTube | date=4 Apr 2014| accessdate=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8469">In [[baseball]], an '''earned run''' is any [[Run (baseball)|run]] that was fully enabled by the offensive team's production in the face of competent play from the defensive team.  Conversely, an '''unearned run''' is a [[Run (baseball)|run]] that would not have been scored without the aid of an [[Error (baseball)|error]] or a [[passed ball]] committed by the defense.  

An unearned run counts just as much as any other run for the purpose of determining the score of the game.  However, it is "unearned" in that it was, in a sense, "given away" by the defensive team. 

Both total runs and earned runs are tabulated as part of a pitcher's [[baseball statistics|statistics]].  However, earned runs are specially denoted because of their use in calculating a pitcher's [[earned run average]] (ERA), the number of earned runs allowed by the pitcher per nine [[innings pitched]] (i.e., averaged over a regulation game).  Thus, in effect, the pitcher is held personally accountable for earned runs, while the responsibility for unearned runs is shared with the rest of the team. 

To determine whether a run is earned, the [[official scorer]] must reconstruct the inning as it would have occurred without errors or passed balls.

==Details==
If no errors and no passed balls occur during the inning, all runs scored are automatically earned (assigned responsible to the pitcher). Also, in some cases, an error can be rendered harmless as the inning progresses. For example, a runner on first base advances to second on a passed ball and the next batter walks. Since the runner would now have been at second anyway, the passed ball no longer has any effect on the earned/unearned calculation. On the other hand, a batter/runner may make his entire circuit around the bases without the aid of an error, yet the run would be counted as unearned if an error prevented the third out from being made before he crossed the plate to score.

An error made by the pitcher in fielding at his position is counted the same as an error by any other player.

A run is counted as unearned when:

* A batter reaches base on an error (including catcher's interference) that would have retired the batter except for the error, and later scores a run in that inning by any means.
* A batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped by a fielder for an error, extending the at bat, and later scores a run in that inning by any means. In this case, the manner in which the batter reached base becomes irrelevant.
* A baserunner remains on base as the result of an error on a fielder's choice play that would put the baserunner out except for the error, and subsequently scores a run in that inning by any means.
* A batter reaches first base on a [[passed ball]] (but not a [[wild pitch]]) and subsequently scores by any means.
* A baserunner scores by any means after the third out would have been made except for an error other than catcher's interference.
* A batter reaches base on a [[fielder's choice]] which removes a baserunner who has reached base safely on an error or has remained on base as the result of an error, reaching first base on a passed ball on a called or swinging third strike, or remained on base on an error on a fielders' choice play that should have retired him, and subsequently scores.
* A batter or runner advances one or more bases on an error or passed ball (but not a [[wild pitch]]) and scores on a play that would otherwise not have provided the opportunity to score.

While the inning is still being played, the second and last scenario can cause a temporary situation where a run has already scored, but its earned/unearned status is not yet certain.  Under the last circumstance, for example, with two outs, a runner on [[third baseman|third base]] scores on a passed ball.  For the time being, the run is unearned since the runner ''should'' still be at third. If the batter [[strikeout|strikes out]] to end the inning, it will stay that way.  If the batter gets a [[base hit]], which would have scored the runner anyway, the run now becomes earned.

Under the second circumstance, if there are runners on base and a batter hits a foul fly ball that is dropped, and then bats in the runners on base through a base hit (including a home run), the runs are unearned for the time being, as the runners should not have advanced. If the results of the remaining at bats in the inning would not have scored the runners, the runs remain unearned. However, if results of subsequent at bats would have scored the runs anyway, the runs would count as earned, unless they only would have scored as a result of a subsequent error or passed ball.

A runner who reaches on [[catcher's interference]] and subsequently scores with two outs scores an unearned run, but baserunners who subsequently score after the runner who has reached on catcher's interference exclusively on clean plays score earned runs; the baserunner  cannot be assumed to have been put out except for the error. (Rule 10.16(4)).

Neither the use of a [[pinch-runner]] to replace a baserunner who represents an unearned run nor the use of a [[pinch-hitter]] to continue the turn at bat of a batter who would be out except for an error transforms a run scored by such a person or his successors on base from an unearned run to an earned run.

===Pitching changes===
When pitchers are changed in the middle of an inning, and one or more errors have already occurred, it is possible to have a run charged as earned against a specific pitcher, but unearned to the team.  The simplest example is when the defensive team records two outs and makes an error on a play that would have been the third out.  A new pitcher comes into the game, and the next batter hits a [[home run]].  The runner who reached on the error comes around to score, and his run is unearned to both the prior pitcher and the team.  However, the run scored by the batter is counted as earned against the relief pitcher, but unearned to the team (since there should have already been three outs).  Had the team not switched pitchers, neither run would be counted as an earned run because that pitcher should have already been out of that inning.

A pitcher who is relieved mid-inning may be charged with earned runs equal to the number of batters who reached base while he was pitching, even if the specific batters he faced do not score.  The batters he put on base may be erased by fielder's choice plays after he has been relieved by another pitcher, but if earned runs are scored in the inning the original pitcher is liable for as many earned runs as the number of batters he put on base. 
Example:
:On April 15, 2017, [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]]'s [[Justin Verlander]] allowed the first two [[Cleveland Indians|Cleveland]] batters in the 5th inning to reach base on base hits; Verlander was then relieved by [[Shane Greene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2017/B04150CLE2017.htm |title=Cleveland Indians 13, Detroit Tigers 6 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=April 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greene walked the next batter to load the bases. The next batter hit a grounder and [[Miguel Cabrera]] threw home to force out the runner on third in a fielder's choice, so the bases remained loaded with one out. Greene struck out the next batter for the second out. [[Carlos Santana (baseball)|Carlos Santana]] then hit a single that scored the runners from second and third (only one of whom was put on base by Verlander), and the runner from first was thrown out at the plate to end the inning.  Since Verlander allowed two batters to reach base he was charged with two earned runs, even though only one of the two specific batters he faced actually scored. 

When a pitching change occurs, the new pitcher is said to "[[List of baseball jargon (I)#inherited runner|inherit]]" any runners that are on base at the time, and if they later score, those runs are charged (earned or unearned) to the prior pitcher.  Most [[box score (baseball)|box scores]] now list inherited runners, and the number that scored, as a statistic for the relief pitcher.

==0–9==
;[[107% rule]]: Often used in [[Formula One]] or other racing series, it is a time which the driver must qualify the car within 107% of the polesitter's time to be allowed to compete. Variations of this may be used to monitor drivers and warn them to make the required threshold of speed or be parked (disqualified). Similarly, the [[IndyCar Series]] uses a 105% rule and [[NASCAR]] has a 115% rule, mainly for performance on track, though INDYCAR and NASCAR often adjust the rule for tracks with very abrasive surfaces (such as [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]]) where lap times can be considerably faster when a car has newer tires.&lt;ref name=Crash-Gordon-FieldFiller-2004&gt;{{cite web|title=NASCAR – Gordon questions 'field filler' role after shunt.|url=http://www.crash.net/nascar/news/88377/1/gordon-questions-field-filler-role-after-shunt.html|website=Crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USA2Day-JGordon-MinimumSpeed-Loudon-2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ryan|first1=Nate|title=Jeff Gordon says NASCAR should rethink minimum speeds|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2014/07/14/jeff-gordon-thinks-nascar-should-raise-minimum-speed-joey-logano-morgan-shepherd/12633809/|website=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Autoweek-Lotus-Indy-2012&gt;{{cite web|title=IndyCar officials rule no extra boost for Lotus on race day at Indianapolis|url=http://autoweek.com/article/indycar/indycar-officials-rule-no-extra-boost-lotus-race-day-indianapolis|website=[[Autoweek|autoweek.com]]|publisher=[[Autoweek]]|accessdate=18 March 2015|date=May 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Aero cover: '''see wheel shroud'''
;[[Jack (device)|Air jacks]]: Compressed air activated lifting cylinders strategically mounted to the frame of and near the wheels of a racing car which project downwards to lift the car off the ground during a [[pit stop]] so to more quickly change wheels/tires or provide mechanics access to the underside of the car for repairs.
;Alphabet soup:  In Midget and Sprint Car racing, and in many short tracks, "alphabet soup" denotes the various preliminary races drivers will race through to advance to the feature.  Such is named for the heat race format from the O Main at the Chili Bowl to the N, M, L, K, J, I, H, G, F, E, D, C, B, and A Main.  A driver who runs through the Alphabet Soup is a driver who advanced from the lowest feature of the day and advanced to the A Main.
;[[Apex (racing)|Apex]]: The part of a corner where the racing line is nearest the inside of the bend.

[[File:DirtTrackRacingLateModels.jpg|thumb|right|Catch fence at an American [[dirt track racing|dirt track]]]]
;Cackle Fest: A.) (Drag Racing) Referring to when 2 Top Fuel or Funny Car cars are sitting at the starting line and one or both cars refuse to stage.  The motor noise at idle sounds like a cackle.  At the discretion of the starter, they can order the drivers to stage or even have them pull out of the lanes and have the next race group come forward.  Or B.) A show and shine for hot rods where the cars are allowed to idle.
;[[Camber angle|Camber]]: A.) The angle at which wheels are set up to tilt in or out, measured in degrees in or out from 90 degrees (i.e. "2.5 degrees negative camber" means each wheel is tilted 2.5 degrees inwards from vertical) "Positive camber" means the top of the tyre is angled outwards from the car; "negative camber" means that the top tilts inwards. Negative camber assists cornering performance as the outside tyres lean into the corner (like a motorcycle) which keeps the lateral forces on the tire lower and causes less flex in the sidewall, although it does also have the effect of increasing tyre wear. Or B.) Banking, the angle at which a corner inclines towards the outside or a straight from its lower side to its higher side. Sometimes specified as positive camber and negative camber, the latter indicating a decline from the inside of a corner.
;{{visible anchor|Catch fence}}: A series of and combination of [[chain-link fencing]], welded grid fencing, and / or cables used to slow or stop out of control cars and prevent debris and tyres from hitting the crowd. It is common on short tracks, street and permanent circuits.

[[File:Tree counting down.JPG|thumb|225px|The "Christmas tree" counting down at [[Saskatchewan International Raceway|SIR]]]]
;Chopping Down the Christmas Tree: See '''Wired to the tree'''.
;Christmas tree: The series of lights in drag racing that signal the approach and start of a race in addition to showing starting violations.
;[[break (work)|Church break]]: A compulsory time-off period in which all motorsport activities must cease for a short period on late Sunday morning to allow [[church service]]s to proceed without disruption from adjacent noise, common to all motorsport venues taking place within a certain proximity of a church, or if local regulations mandate such. At [[Lime Rock Park]], racing on Sunday is specifically prohibited. Some series intentionally do not allow any activity on the circuit until after noon on Sunday. Many series in North America reserve such time off in order to have chapel services inside the circuit, organised by a ministry traveling with the series, and spectators with chapel services organised by local churches.
;Clean air: Air that has not been affected by turbulence from other cars.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt; The opposite of '''dirty air'''.
;[[Clerk of the Course]]: The official responsible for all on-track activities including demonstrations and parades. They oversee the track conditions, supervise the marshals and emergency services, control the deployment of the safety car and decide upon suspending a session. If a race director is appointed the clerk is junior and the race director has ultimate authority; if not they are often the most senior official at a racing event.
;Closing/shutting the door: A driver takes an early defensive [[racing line]] into a corner to block the car behind from overtaking along the preferred line.
;[[Co-driver]]: In [[Rallying|rally racing]], a '''co-driver''' directs the driver through the course by reading [[pacenotes]] which describe the turns and obstacles ahead. Also called a '''navigator''' historically when the reading of maps played a larger part in rallies prior to the widespread adoption of pacenoting. The term is also used in long-distance sports car and touring car racing where more than one driver is sharing the same vehicle.
;Competition caution: A preplanned full course yellow, mandated by the sanctioning body, where drivers bring their vehicles into the pits. Frequently done to change tires because of excessive tire wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/NASCAR_may_throw_competition_caution_to_address_tire_concerns_at_Indy.html|title=NASCAR may throw competition caution to address tire concerns at Indy|last=Gluck|first=Jeff|date=July 27, 2008|publisher=Scene Daily|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Control: Where the series organisers specify that all competitors in the race must use an identical part; as in '''control tyre''' or '''control engine'''.
;[[Automobile engine replacement|Crate motor]]: An engine that is ready-built and sealed by an independent company. Crate motors are sometimes mandated and sometimes optional. They are commonly used in regional touring series down to local tracks in divisions from [[late model]]s on down.

;[[Crossed sticks]]: Two curled up flags held out in form of a cross signal the halfway mark in many American racing series.
;Cushion: In dirt or off-road racing, when dirt is kicked up from the track that lands near the wall after trucks drift through the corners. The dirt builds up after time and can slow a driver down if they slide too deep into it while sliding through the turn.
;Customer car: When a racing team uses a car built for them, either by another team, or by a specialist racing chassis manufacturer. Primarily a Formula One term where the majority of teams build their own cars. The practice has since been banned from F1.

==D==
[[File:IMCA Modifieds doing Delaware Style restart.jpg|thumb|right|Delaware start]]
;Deep braking: Applying the brakes later than normal when entering a turn.
;Deep staging:  (drag racing)  when a dragster pulls so far forward that they leave the pre stage area and turn off the pre stage lights on the Christmas Tree, but not far enough to leave the staged area.  This is legal in drag racing.  This may give the driver a few inch advantage, unless the other driver deep stages too.
;Delaware start: A style of restart where the race leader starts in the first row by himself and the other drivers start two-wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theracersresource.com/racingnewsdetail.php?racing_news_item=8982|title=65th season of the United Racing Company is quickly approaching|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Racers Resource|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Named after a start method for a short track in the state of [[Delaware]] in the United States. The leader can choose which lane he wants for the restart, which can be an advantage, with a clear advantage over second place. Compare that to Lane Choice.
'''Delta Time''' (also Pit-Stop Delta)
: The entire time it generally takes a driver to enter the pit lane, make a full pit stop, and exit the pit area back to the track to resume racing at optimum pace. For example, a Delta Time of 25 seconds means the entire pitting process (entering, stopping and exiting) cost the driver 25 seconds not driving at full race speed even though the car may have been stationary in the pit box for only 5 seconds.
'''Density Altitude''' (often '''DA''')
: (drag racing) which often refers to the quality of air. Technically "quality of air" refers to the pressure drop as altitude above sea level increases. Atmospheric air pressure is lower at a race track higher above sea level. All non-turbocharged internal combustion engines produce less power as air pressure drops, as each intake stroke draws in less air per volume than normally. This may require the engine to be "tuned" to optimize the power, as it may still "think" it's at a lower altitude. Because a supercharged engine pressurizes intake air at a fixed mechanical ratio to the engines RPM's, it suffers a proportionate loss in power, but not as severe as a naturally aspirated engine will. A turbocharged engine is largely unaffected, as the lower density of the intake air is offset by the lower backpressure resisting the exhaust flow through the turbo.
;Dial-in: (drag racing) when bracket racing, drivers must estimate or "dial in" the time in which they expect to run. Therefore, two unmatched cars in weight and power can compete, by a handicap system. If one runs a faster time than dialed in, it is a breakout.
'''Did Not Attend''' (often '''DNA''')
: Denotes a driver who was entered for a race but did not attend the circuit. Sometimes referred to as '''Did Not Arrive''' or simply a "no show."
'''Did Not Finish''' (often '''DNF''')
: A driver who did not finish the race. Some sanctioning bodies do not classify a driver in the final results if he did not finish completed a certain number of laps, for example in Formula One a driver must complete 90% of the completed laps to be classified as a finisher.
'''Did Not Qualify / Did Not Pre-qualify''' (often '''DNQ / DNPQ''')
: A failure to qualify or pre-qualify for a race. Most often because the driver was too slow to make it into a limited number of grid positions, or was slower than the 107% rule. Refer '''107% rule'''.
'''Did Not Start''' (often '''DNS''')
: A driver who did not attempt to compete in a race, even though he may have competed in practice sessions and/or qualifying. Not the same as the DNA already mentioned.
;Digger: [[dragster (car)|dragster]] (as distinct from a bodied car or flopper).&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Don, "R&amp;C Modelrama" in ''Rod &amp; Custom'', 9/00, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Dirty air: The air disrupted by a car when it moves at speed, which can cause aerodynamic difficulties for a car following closely behind. The opposite of '''clean air'''.
'''Disqualify''' (often '''DQ''' or '''DSQ''')
: Where a competitor is removed from the results, usually in penalty for a technical infringement. Sometimes, but not always, interchangeable with '''Excluded'''.
;Dogleg: A gentle turn or kink on a racing circuit, usually associated with road courses, but also present on oval tracks. On road courses, a dogleg may be present on a long straightaway (e.g. [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course|Mid-Ohio]]), curving the straight slightly, but usually not enough to require drivers to slow down much for the turn.  On an oval, a dogleg can be located on the frontstretch (e.g. [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]]) or [[ISM Raceway|ISM Raceway Phoenix]]) creating an oblong shape, adding a challenge, increasing sightlines for fans, and again, usually not requiring drivers to slow down for the extra curve. A [[Oval track racing#Quad-oval|quad-oval]] is also referred to as a "double dogleg."(See Charlotte or [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]])  Some tracks classify the dogleg as a turn (Mid Ohio turn 3) or not (Charlotte).  Also known as a sweeper.
[[File:Team Drift.jpg|thumb|right|A drift competition in progress]]
;Doped (or Dope): (drag racing) commonly used word in the southern states if the car is using nitrous or propane injection on diesels.
;Door-slammer: Drag racing term used to group vehicles, usually sedan bodied, that still have functional doors for driver access to the vehicle, as opposed to '''Funny cars''' which have a single lightwight outer body draped over the racing chassis.
;[[Downforce]]: Increased force holding the car onto the track. This is created by the aerodynamics or aerodynamic aids (F1 wings, etc.) of a vehicle which causes a "reverse lift" effect. That is, creating an area of low pressure (suction) under the car and/or under the wing(s) or other aids fixed to the car, the higher pressure above forcing the tires harder to the ground, effectively increasing the static friction. This allows it to travel faster through a corner, at the cost of having a reduced overall top speed, since drag is proportionate to lift and downforce is caused by lift.
;[[Drafting (aerodynamics)|Drafting]]: A technique where multiple vehicles align in a close group reducing the overall effect of [[drag (physics)|drag]] due to exploiting the lead object's [[slipstream]]. Same as slipstreaming.
;[[Drag Reduction System]]: A mechanically activated element of the rear wing of modern Formula One cars, where in a predetermined position on the circuit a wing element will open, moving from steeply inclined to flat, thus reducing the amount of drag generated by the rear wing, increasing its top speed on a straightaway. The mechanism artificially assists overtaking with additional benefit of overcoming '''Dirty Air''' issues while following cars closely.
;[[Drifting (motorsport)|Drifting]]: Drifting is a form of motorsport in which drivers intentionally provoke constant oversteering slides while preserving vehicle control and a high exit speed. In motor racing, drifting is a cornering technique (also called a four-wheel drift) where a car takes a high-speed corner held at an angle on the track without major steering inputs, balancing natural understeer with power oversteer.
;Drive-through penalty: A penalty applied by race officials while the race is underway. A competitor is directed to drive into the pit lane and travel its length at much reduced speed (pit lanes are mostly speed-limited to protect the pitcrew and marshals) losing significant track position in the process. When the driver is serving his drive through penalty he is not allowed to stop anywhere in the pits.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt; See also '''Stop-go penalty'''.
[[File:DriversMeetingMotocross2009.jpg|thumb|right|Drivers' meeting before a [[motocross]] race]]
;Drivers' meeting: A meeting where drivers and officials meet before a race to discuss the upcoming event. Also referred to as '''Drivers' briefing''' or '''Driver and Crew Chief meeting''', as in some series, the driver and his crew chief must attend.
;DRS: see '''Drag Reduction System'''
;Dry line: On a drying circuit, the racing line that becomes dry first as the cars displace water from it.

==E==
;Early Doors: A popular term used by competitors when referring to the early stages of the series' season.
[[File:Road atlanta esses.JPG|thumb|The esses at [[Road Atlanta]]]]
;Esses: Sequences of alternating turns on a road course, resembling the letter 'S'.
;E.T.: Elapsed Time. A term used in drag racing about the total time the run took, from start, to finish.
;E.T. Slip: (drag racing) Slip of paper turned in by the race timer which denotes elapsed time for both drivers, and who won the race; it may also include reaction time and "60 foot" time. This is an official document, used for timekeeping. Also known as a timeslip.
'''Excluded''' (often '''EXC''' or '''EXCL''')
: Removed from competition before the race has started, generally due to an infringement during practice or qualifying.
;ERS: Energy Recovery System. Part of the [[Hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] engines used in Formula One since 2014, that recover energy from the brakes and heat and stores it in batteries, which is then used to boost power. It combines both a kinetic energy recovery system (KERS), known officially as the Motor Generator Unit – Kinetic (MGU-K), and a system recovering heat from the turbocharger, officially known as the Motor Generator Unit – Heat (MGU-H).

==F==
;[[Factory-backed]]: A racing team/driver that competes with official sanction and financial support from a manufacturer. In Europe, known as a works team.
;Factory team: A more specific version of [[Factory-backed]] referring to racing teams run directly from the factory of the vehicle manufacturer.
;[[Fan car]]: Usually refers specifically to the [[Brabham BT46]] Formula One car, although the concept was actually pioneered by sports car manufacturer [[Chaparral Cars]] on the [[Chaparral 2J]]. The placement of a large fan at the rear of the chassis driven either independently or by the engine with the purpose of creating negative air-pressure underneath the car to create additional [[downforce]] for increased cornering speed.
;[[Fastest lap]]: fastest time in which a lap was completed by a driver during a race. Sometimes rewarded with bonus championship points.
;Field: The competing cars in an event.
;Field-filler: A driver or team usually slower than the majority of the field that only participates if there are open spots.&lt;ref name=Crash-Gordon-FieldFiller-2004 /&gt; See also start and park.
;First or Worse: In drag racing, if both drivers commit a foul, the driver who commits the foul first loses, unless it is two separate fouls, where the loser is the driver who committed the worse foul; (a foul start is worse than a break out, in a bracket class with breakout rules in effect, then a lane violation is worse than foul start, and failure to participate in a post-run inspection is worst). The "worse" part is in case of a double breakout, the driver closer to their index wins.  If one driver commits a foul start, but the opponent crosses a boundary line (wall or center line), the driver who commits the red light wins.  The only double disqualification fouls are deep staging, leaving before the tree is activated, or crossing the boundary line (although an official has the right to declare the driver who crossed the line second was forced;  in a final, only the first to cross the line is disqualified).
;Flag-to-flag coverage: Television or radio coverage that consists of the ''entire'' race start-to-finish rather than highlights, [[Broadcast delay|tape delayed]], "packaged" coverage, or highlights of the first portion of the race before broadcasting the final quarter of the race live. Derives from green '''flag''' (start) '''to''' checkered '''flag''' (finish). Instituted largely in the late 1970s, with the [[1979 Daytona 500]] being the first major 500-mile race with live, flag-to-flag coverage.
;Flat spot: When a wheel locks under braking, the car skids and leaves a flat spot on the section of the tyre that was touching the ground at the time.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt;
;Flopper: (drag racing) [[Funny Car]], short for "fender flopper." Coined by dragster crews in the late 1960s to separate Funny Cars, which had fiberglass bodies with fenders, from dragsters. Erroneously attributed to flip-top bodies of Funny Cars.
;Flying lap: A lap started by a competitor at optimum speed, as opposed to a lap from a standing start, usually in qualifying.
;Flying Start: (See Rolling Start)
;Formation lap: The lap cars make before forming up on the grid for the start.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt;
;[[Formula racing]]: A type of racing, generally open wheeled, where the conditions of technical entry comply with strict rules or formulae.
;Free practice: When drivers or riders learn the circuit and/or teams experiment with race settings for the track.
;Fuel: (drag racing) mix of [[methanol]] and [[nitromethane]] ("pop," nitro); race class using it.
;[[Fuel tank#Racing fuel cell|Fuel cell]]: A fuel tank with a flexible inner liner to minimize the potential for punctures in the event of a collision or other mishap resulting in serious damage to the vehicle. Mandatory in most forms of motorsport.
;Fueler: (drag racing) any car running fuel or in Fuel class (most often, TFD or TF/FC).

[[File:MickeyThompson1971dragster.jpg|thumb|right|[[Funny Car]]]]
;[[Funny Car]]: (drag racing) a vehicle with a single-piece body draped over the chassis which is lifted off or rear-hinged to allow the driver access to the cabin; a race class for such a car

==G==
;Gap: Beating an opponent in a heads up drag race with a visible distance between the between the 2 competitors
;[[wikt:garagistes|Garagiste]]: Also called ''garagistas'', disparaging term given by [[Enzo Ferrari]] to describe the new wave of British racing cars such as [[Cooper Car Company|Cooper]] and [[Team Lotus]] that challenged his team with a smaller budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/99/mar31/horton.html|title=The Return of the Enzo's|author=|date=|website=atlasf1.autosport.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f1-grandprix.com/?page_id=923|title=The British Era|author=|date=24 April 2010|website=f1-grandprix.com|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Gasser (car)|Gasser]]: bodied [[drag racing|drag racer]] running on gasoline (before [[Pro Stock]] was introduced)
;Gentleman driver: in sportscar racing, typically refers to a driver who is not a professional racing driver. These drivers' primary source of income is not related to motorsport. Most sportscar racing categories today use a driver rating system where notable drivers with major accomplishment in single-seater competition and under 50 years of age are platinum, drivers with major wins in domestic motorsport or platinum-level drivers 50-59, gentleman drivers who are experienced are silver, and gentleman drivers with an entry-level (B) international licence, or platinum-level drivers older than 60 ([[Emerson Fittipaldi]] raced in the 2014 6 Hours of São Paulo as a bronze driver because of his age) are declared bronze. Many series require gentleman drivers in lower-level categories (P2 and GTE-AM in WEC, PC and GT3/GTD in IMSA) and only allow one professional driver in a three-driver team in those classes.
;Graining: When small grains of rubber start coming off a tyre.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt; See also '''marbles'''.
;Grand chelem: To qualify on pole, set the fastest lap, win and lead every lap of a Grand Prix.
;Grand marshal: Ceremonial marshaling role at a race meeting. Largely held by celebrities or retired notable drivers with no actual duties or responsibilities beyond the waving of a flag to commence activity or to announce the traditional ''start your engines'' prior to some races.
;[[Gravel trap]]: Off-track [[run-off area]], usually positioned on the outside of corners, filled with gravel intended to slow down and stop cars that have left the track at speed. Generally there are tyre barriers between a gravel trap and the catch fencing, in order to protect the spectators.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt; Sometimes nicknamed "[[kitty litter]]" for its visual resemblance.
;Green track: A paved race course that is clean from rubber buildup, oil/grease, marbles (see below), and debris, typically cleansed by means of a recent rain shower. Depending on the track and/or racing series, a green track may be favorable or unfavorable. Track crews may use jet blowers to remove marbles and debris from the surface, to mimic favorable "green track" conditions. However, a green track may be unfavorable due to reduced traction.
;[[Green-white-checker finish]]: When a full-course caution comes out right before the end of a race, the race is extended beyond its scheduled distance. Depending on sanctioning body, there may be either one or multiple attempts at a restart, between one and five laps, before the race is declared officially over. NASCAR's national series will have a maximum of three attempts if the penultimate lap only under caution, while some short track races have unlimited attempts at a span between one and five consecutive green-flag laps. In [[British Superbike Championship]] motorcycle racing, if a caution is called in the final third of the race, three additional laps will be added on the ensuing restart in a green-white-checker style finish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishsuperbike.com/technical.aspx Error&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724161649/http://www.britishsuperbike.com/technical.aspx |date=2009-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Grenade: wreck an engine (the engine "grenaded") so violently that internal parts of the engine breaking through the block and / or bolt on parts (cylinder heads, oil pans, etc.) to blow off the engine. Distinct from "[[#P|popping the blower]]". A '''hand-grenade engine''' is a usually derogatory engine of tuned to maximise engine power at the cost of low mechanical reliability.
;Grid: The starting formation of a race, generally in rows of two for cars and three or four for bikes. The [[Indianapolis 500]] traditionally has a unique grid of three cars per row.
;Groove: Also called '''The Groove'''. The optimal path around the track for the lowest lap time. In drag racing it is about the center portion of the lane, where the cars can gain traction quicker.
;Groove a tire: see '''Sipe'''
;[[Ground effect in cars|Ground effect]]: A method of creating [[downforce]] by the shape of the car's body, notably by shaping the underside of the car in combination with the car's lateral edges in order to trap and dramatically slow the airflow running underneath the car, effectively turning the entire car into a wing.
;Gurney, [[Gurney flap]]: A small lip placed at the trailing edge of a race car's aerodynamic wing. Despite its relative size, often only millimetres tall, it can double the downforce achieved by the wing, although at the premium of increasing drag, hence the small size. Named for the man commonly attributed to its proliferation, [[Formula One]] driver and constructor, [[Dan Gurney]]. Also known as a '''wickerbill'''.

==H==
[[File:Haarspeldbocht.jpg|thumb|Hairpin turn on the [[Mont Ventoux]] in France]]
;[[Hairpin turn|Hairpin]]: A tight 180 degree corner that twists back on itself.
;Handicap: where cars start a race in the reverse order of qualifying, or perceived race pace, usually with timed gaps between cars starting a race. More common in racing's early days than today, the effect was the produce a race result in which all cars would arrive at the race finish together, regardless of the performance of the race vehicle. Another form of handicapping is success ballast, where more successful cars are assessed a weight penalty for every win, and ''Balance of Power'' in sportscar racing.
;Hanford Device: a spoiler attached across the back of the rear wing to greatly increase drag. The result is a massive increase in the slipstream, which improves wheel-to-wheel competition as well as multiple lead changes per lap.
;[[HANS Device]] (Head and Neck Support device): also known as a head restraint, is a safety item compulsory in many car racing sports. It reduces the likelihood of head and/or neck injuries, such as a basilar skull fracture, in the event of a crash.
;Heads-up Racing: in drag racing, where both drivers leave at the same time and is used in all professional ("pro") classes.
;Heat: A shorter race which decides the participants of the main race and sometimes starting order as well, usually there are more heats in which only a part of the drivers from the entry list take part. Can also mean part of the main race, when it consists of two or more parts.
;[[Holeshot]]: when beginning a race from a standing start:
* (motorcycle, off-road, powerboat racing), the rider who is the first one through the first turn at the start of a race
* (drag racing) getting a substantial starting line advantage due to a quicker [[reaction time]]. The other driver gets "holeshotted" "welded to the line" or "left at the tree." A "holeshot win" is any win in a heads-up class where a slower car beats a faster car because of better reaction time, despite having a slower elapsed time (e.t.).&lt;ref name="IHRA Holeshot"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drag Racing Basics|url=http://media.ihra.com/drag-racing-basics|publisher=[[International Hot Rod Association]] (IHRA)|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Homologation (motorsport)|Homologation]]: Process by which a new vehicle or part of a vehicle is approved by organizers for usage in racing.  It also refers to the majority of the world's road racing sanctioning bodies having a racing class following the FIA's [[Group GT3]] formula.  This was done to allow a car to be raced in multiple series with no changes.
;Hook up: (drag racing) Good traction between tires and track resulting in increased acceleration and reduced slipping or smoking of tires.
;Hot lap: (See Flying Lap.)
;Hung-out-to-dry: Typically used in context to [[Oval track racing#Pack racing|pack racing]]; a car that pulls out of the "draft train" to make a pass, but ends up losing many positions. Numerous cars drafting closely together normally drive faster than one car by itself. The lone car hung out to dry sometimes falls all the way to the end of the draft train.  Also known as freight trained.
;[[Hydrolocking]]: Excessive fuel entering (flooding) one or more cylinders due to abnormal operating conditions.  The fuel can not be compressed, causing damage to the motor.  Most common in drag racing.  May cause the motor to [[#G|grenade]].  May also happen if a motor ingests water through the air intake.

==I==
;IHRA: is and acronym referring to the drag racing sanctioning body [[International Hot Rod Association]].
;[[Impact wrench]]: A tool specifically designed for rapidly winding off and on [[wheel nut]]s, allowing the changing of wheels and tyres to be performed faster during [[pit stop]]s. Also known as an '''impactor''', '''air wrench''', '''air gun''', '''rattle gun''', '''torque gun'''.
;Impound Rule: [[NASCAR|NASCAR's]] version of Parc Fermè, used at certain tracks
;In-lap: Any lap which concludes with a visit to the pits, especially a pre-arranged pit stop, either during a race or during practice or qualifying. Often drivers push hard to drive fast on their in-lap (despite perhaps having worn out tires) in order to gain time during the pit stop sequence. See '''Delta time'''
;Incident officer (often IO or I/O): A [[motorsport marshal]] who is in charge of other marshals on the track, allocating duties to them. Second in rank to observer. In hillclimbing, they are responsible for the radio communication.
;Independent: A competitor (team or driver) taking part with no or very little backing from a manufacturer. They have their own championship within the [[World Touring Car Championship]], where there is a strong manufacturer presence.
;Inspector: See Scrutineer.
;Installation lap: A lap which can take place in practice or qualifying, which is intended simply to gain data and [[telemetry]] for the driver or team, rather than any intention of setting a competitive time.
;Intermediate: A wet weather tyre of lighter grooving than a '''wet weather tyre'''. Sometimes an intermediate is a slick tyre with grooves cut into it. It is used for conditions between dry and wet conditions, most often when the track is wet but it is not actually raining.
;International season:  In Australian [[sprint car racing]], the time generally between December and February.  Because of Australia being in the Southern Hemisphere, some drivers in North America will fly down to Australia during the time and participate in various meetings before the [[World of Outlaws]] season starts in Barberville, Florida in February. The recognised International Season typically runs from Christmas Day (because of the time difference, it usually is Christmas night in the United States where the international drivers are based), until the week before the Barberville meeting.
;Invert: The portion of the field which is started by reverse qualifying speed. With an invert of five, the fifth-fastest qualifier starts first and the fastest qualifier starts fifth. The rest of the field starts by their qualifying speed (sixth fastest starts sixth). The invert is often not announced before qualifying or a [[dice]]/die roll happens after qualifying.&lt;ref name="LasVegasReview07161999"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/1999/Jul-16-Fri-1999/sports/11566823.html|title=Speedway is 'inverting' to multiply fun for fans|last=Wolf|first=Jeff|date=July 16, 1999|publisher=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Joker Lap:  In [[Rallycross]] events each vehicle must run a lap with a detour once during each single race. In events overseen by the FIA, such as the [[FIA World Rallycross Championship]], this lap must be at least two seconds slower, therefore, the alternative route makes the lap longer. In the American [[Global Rallycross]] series the Joker Lap is usually a bit shorter than a lap on the original track. The Joker Lap idea was thought up as a tactical component by Svend Hansen, the late father of 14-times FIA European Rallycross Champion [[Kenneth Hansen (rallycross)|Kenneth Hansen]], to spice up the competition.
;Jump start: In a '''[[standing start]]''', when a vehicle moves from its grid slot before the start of a race is signaled. In a '''[[rolling start]]''', when a car passes before they cross the start-finish line or the restart line. When this is done, a penalty is usually imposed. In drag racing, a jump start is signalled by a red light in the offending driver's lane, and he loses unless a more serious foul (boundary line or failure to report to post-race inspection after a round win) occurs.&lt;ref name=itvannual1 /&gt;

==K==
;Kerb-hopping: To clip, or drive over completely, the concrete kerbs (curbs) on the inside of a corner. While often the fastest method of negotiating chicanes in particular, the practice is usually frowned upon by race officials for the damage it can do to the kerbs, tyres and vehicles. The practice also can drag debris or water from behind the kerb onto the racing line.
;[[KERS]]: Kinetic Energy Recovery System. A device which recovers energy created when brakes are applied and stores it until required to add power in the engine. In 2008 KERS systems started to appear in the [[World Rally Championship]] and [[Formula One]] followed soon after, where its application is limited to a '''push to pass''' system.
;Kit: (drag racing) refers to a turbo kit or a nitrous kit. Using nitrous oxide in the professional categories in drag racing is illegal.
;Kitty litter: Informal term with two possible meanings. It is either a nickname for a '''gravel trap''', or for a material applied to the track surface to clean up a leaking fluid.&lt;ref name="DysonRacing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Racing Terminology|url=http://www.dysonracing.com/series/racingTerms.php|publisher=[[Dyson Racing]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Ladder series: Generally refers to a category or series of lesser importance which in most cases will race at the same race meeting as a senior category. Cars will be generally similar in characteristic to drive but will be smaller, less powerful and/or slower. Competitors will generally be younger emerging drivers who are climbing an apprenticeship 'ladder' towards entry into the senior series.
;Lambda reading: Fuel to air ratio readings, used to determine how much fuel is pushed through the fuel injectors into the cylinders for combustion.
;Lap of honour: A non-competitive lap taken before or after the race by a driver in celebration. Also known as a '''lap of honor''', or, if after the race, a '''victory lap'''.
;Lap record: Fastest race lap recorded at a circuit for a category of race car. The circumstances allowed vary significantly, but practice laps are generally not considered official records. Laps recorded in qualifying may or may not contribute but are sometimes referred together with practice laps as '''Qualifying lap record'''. The '''outright lap record''' is the fastest race lap ever recorded at any particular circuit, regardless of category of vehicle being raced.

;[[Roll cage]]: Network of metal bars that criss-cross the interior of production-based sedan-bodied racing cars. Originally created as a safety device in more recent times it has been used to connect suspension, chassis, engine to substantially increase the torsional rigidity of a race car.
;[[Roll cage|Roll hoop]]: Looped bar protruding above and behind the drivers helmets in open wheel and prototype sports racing cars. The hoop is placed that in the event of a car rolling over in a crash the car lands on the roll hoop rather than the drivers helmet. It also makes a handy hook for cranes for removing stopped cars from dangerous positions on the circuit.
;[[Rolling start]]: A starting method where moving cars start a race after the starter displays a green flag.
;[[Roof flap]]: an aerodynamic piece designed to keep a car on the ground when it is traveling in reverse.

;Slick (clay oval): A phenomenon caused by the drying out of the clay surface on short circuit oval tracks. The clay circuits that do not maintain a minimum percentage of moisture on the track surface will cause the clay to dry out. This problem will cause the rubber of the specialized clay circuit tires to prematurely wear much in the same way asphalt or concrete paved circuits do, giving the track surface a noticeably black shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolles|first=Bob|title=Dirt Car Setup Tips Real-World Tips From Practice To The Main Event|journal=[[Circle Track]]|date=April 1, 2004|url=http://www.circletrack.com/chassistech/ctrp_0404_dirt_car_setup_tips/|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Smoking the tires: Also called '''Lighting the hides''', or '''Blowing the tires off'''. A term used mostly in drag racing when a loss of traction occurs, causing the rear tires to rise, and smoke profusely. This usually happens off the starting line. When this happens during a race, it usually results in a loss, unless the opponent also loses traction as well.
;Spare car, Backup car: A car used by a driver if he has damaged his main car. It may or may not have the same setup as the primary car. Now banned in Formula One for cost-cutting reasons, though teams in many other major racing series have a spare car available at the track. At [[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], it is traditionally called a "T Car" ("T" loosely short for "training")
;Spec: see ''One-make racing''
;[[Special stage (rallying)|Special stage]]: A section of road or track, closed off used for timed runs in rallying. A rally is made up of a number of special stages.
;Spin turn: A semi-doughnut which a driver use to turn themselves to a correct position on a tight space without the need of a reverse gear.
;Splash and dash, Splash and go: A [[pit stop]] which involves refueling the car only, often less than a full tank.[[File:SplitterNASCARKaseyKahneSide.jpg|thumb|right|Splitter (in white) on a NASCAR car]]
;[[Diffuser (automotive)#Splitters|Splitter]]: Also referred to as the front '''Spoiler''', '''Front Air Dam''', or '''[[Diffuser (automotive)|Diffuser]]'''. Aerodynamic device placed on the nose of some [[Touring car racing|touring car]]s and [[Grand tourer|GTs]] to improve airflow around the nose of the car and sometimes create '''downforce''' for the front wheels to aid steering. It is prominent on [[NASCAR]]'s [[Car of Tomorrow]] body style.
;[[Spoiler (automotive)|Spoiler]]: Aerodynamic device attached to the trailing edge of a race car to increase its rear '''downforce'''. The difference between a spoiler and a wing is that wings are generally multi-element with air passing both above and below the aerodynamic surface, whereas a spoiler is flush fitted to the car's bodywork.
;[[Spotter (auto racing)|Spotter]]: a person, positioned high above the circuit, who communicates what going on the track to the driver

;Stint: The period a driver is at the wheel in an event involving more than one driver in the vehicle. Sometimes refers to the period of driving between pit stops.
;Stop-go penalty: A penalty assessed to a driver for an on-track infraction that requires them to enter their pit box (or in some cases a special penalty pit box) and come to a complete stop before resuming. No work is allowed to be done on the car during the penalty, even if it is being served in the driver's own pit box. Doing work on the car would negate the serving of the penalty, and the penalty would have to be re-served the next time around. In some cases, the car is held in the box for a specified number of seconds before being allowed to resume. Sometimes called a '''Stop and go penalty'''. Since the early/mid-1990s, this penalty has seen less use, and is instead typically replaced by the '''Drive-through penalty'''. The drive-through penalty requires a driver to enter and drive through the pit road (below the pit road speed limit), before returning to the track. When pit lane speed limits became standard in motorsport in the early 1990s, the drive-through penalty was deemed sufficient, while stop-go penalties (when coupled with the now slow pit speed limits) were now considered excessive.
;Stripe or Strip: The start/finish line.
;Struck the tires: (drag racing) loss of traction, causing them to smoke.
;Success ballast: A method used to level performance between competitors by adding weight to cars the win races or are successful. Somestimes referred to as '''Lead trophy''' as the usage of lead bars is most popular in applying the additional weight.
;Superpole, or Shootout: A selection procedure in which the ten or 15 fastest qualifiers compete for grid positions in a single-lap effort without other vehicles on the track. While not specifically referenced, most NASCAR races will use this style of qualifying for all cars.
;[[Card (sports)#Undercard|Support race]]: A race(s) that takes place before and/or after the main event race. It may also be held during a qualifying day, and is often used to provide a fuller weekend of activities. It is normally a race from a lower or "ladder" series, is usually shorter in duration, and in some cases might feature some moonlighting drivers from the main event.
;Super rally: When a rally driver retires on any day, except the last, they can continue the next day incurring penalties for the stages they did not drive, including the one they retired on. Currently, in World Rally Championship, a driver will be given the time of the fastest driver of their class, plus a five-minute-penalty for each missed stage.
;[[Special stage (rallying)|Super Special]]: Timed special stage in a rally on a purpose-built track, often in a stadium. Usually two cars will set off at the same time in separate lanes, and at the halfway point of the stage they will swap lanes, usually due to a crossover involving a bridge. A similar format is used in the [[Race of Champions]].
;Swinger: (from [[Sidecar#Sport|Sidecar racing]]) A passenger on a racing motorcycle sidecar who athletically moves from one side of the sidecar to the other, altering a sidecar's weight distribution to assist in cornering speed and in some corners to prevent the sidecar from tipping over.

[[File:MF1 Collision (crop2 Tbone).PNG|thumb|right|T-bone]]
;[[side collision|T-bone]]: A collision in which the front of a car crashes into the side of another car, forming a "T" shape. This is one of the more dangerous types of crash due to the relative vulnerability of side impacts where there is much less deformable structure on the side of a car to protect the driver. Also, to crash into another car in such a fashion; the victim is "T-boned".
;T-car: Alternative term for spare/backup car&lt;ref name="formula1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/interviews/2007/3/5836.html |title=Q&amp;A with Spyker's Christijan Albers|publisher=formula1.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[speed wobble|Tank-slapper]]: When the front wheel of a motorcycle oscillates rapidly, causing the handlebars to slap against the fuel tank. It is increasingly being used to refer to a vehicle that loses traction at the rear, regains traction and loses it again, causing the rear to weave side to side independently of the front of the car. This is more often referred to as '''fish-tailing'''.
;{{nihongo|[[Drifting (motorsport)#Drift competition|Tansō]]|単走|solo run}}: (drifting) Japanese term for individual passes where drivers drive whilst being observed in front of judges in an attempt to vy for the top spot.
;[[Team orders]]: The practice of one driver allowing another from the same team or manufacturer to gain a higher finish at the direction of the team management. Often employed to prevent the risk of an accident resulting in damage to both of a team's cars. The practice was briefly forbidden in [[Formula One]] as a consequence of the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]] controversy. U.S.-based series (NASCAR, IndyCar, etc.) rarely if ever have used team orders, and the practice is widely frowned upon due to sportsmanship issues and fan backlash.

;Ten-tenths: Refers to driving a car to its absolute potential.
;Throttleman: In [[offshore powerboat racing]], the boat's second occupant who work alongside the driver, whose role is to steer the boat. The throttleman's position is to adjust the [[trim tab]] whilst observing water conditions and extract as much speed out of the boat by controlling the hand-throttle during a race whilst it hops over tides after tides to prevent the propellers from spinning wildly whilst the boat is airborne, which causes the engine to overrev, leading to engine damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Joe |last=Skorupa |date=July 1995 |pages=50–53 |title=Warp Speed |magazine=Popular Mechanics |volume=172 |number=7 |issn=0032-4558 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NmYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Time attack]]: A competition which involve cars running around the circuit in lieu of a qualifying lap.
;Timed race: Instead of running a predetermined number of laps, a race runs for a predetermined amount of time (i.e. [[24 Hours of Le Mans]]). This is common in [[endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]], although series such as [[Formula 1]] have a limit on how long a race can be run (Usually two hours), which means that a race may be ended after the time limit expires but before the predetermined number of laps is run.
;Timeslip: (drag racing) E.T. slip.
;Tin-top: Road car-derived vehicles with a roof, mainly in [[touring car racing]].
;Tire shake: A term in drag racing, when the engine is putting out more horsepower than the drive axle can handle, causing the rear tires to shake violently.

==U==
;[[Understeer]] or push: Cornering behaviour where the front wheels do not follow the steered course but instead push out toward the outside of the turn. Known as push in NASCAR and other stock car racing. Opposite of oversteer.
;Undertray: Flat or stepped flat surface on the bottom of ''open wheel'' and sports ''prototype'' racing cars. Theory has varied along with aerodynamic developments and regulations, from the sidepod tunnels of '''ground effect''' to the flat undertrays of the 1980s in various attempts to use aerodynamics to suck the cars closer to the bitumen, minimising the air underneath the car that could slow its progress. Today most such categories feature a stepped undertray with sidepods siting higher in the air than the centre of the car, usually mandated by series organisers in an attempt to limit vehicle performance. Also refers to flat surfaces extending behind '''splitters''' in sedan and GT based racing cars.

;Wastegate: Device attached to [[turbocharger]]s used to limit the additional horsepower they produce. Usually a mechanical device, activated when the pressure within the turbocharger reaches a certain point, opening a valve, thus reducing boost pressure. Used primarily for safety (speed reduction of the racing cars) or cost (reducing stress on both turbo and engine, lengthening the life of the parts prior to failure or rebuild). Not to be confused with a Blow-Off Valve.
;Wear the shiny off:  A term used, mostly within drag racing, when a brand new car either hits the wall, or, in the Pro Stock class, when a new car flips over into its top and continues down the track for a considerable length, peeling the paint, or more common in recent years, [[wrap advertising|vinyl wrap]], off.
;Weight shifting: A technique used to reduce understeer. This involves the driver decelerating through a corner to shift the weight of the car from the back to the front, increasing grip of the front tyres and decreasing understeer.
;Wet (or wet-weather) tyre: A racing tyre with deep grooves designed to displace standing water, allowing the tyre to obtain grip in conditions where dry weather tyres ('''slicks''') would '''aquaplane'''. '''Monsoon wet''' has become a term used for extremely wet conditions.

==Y==
;Yellow chequer: A term derived when the final lap(s) in a race is completed during a '''full course yellow''' while the field is under the control of the ''Safety Car''. In this instance the yellow and chequered flags are waved together and the race is declared finished with the order the same as when the '''full course yellow''' began. Unpopular with spectators because of the anti-climactic nature of the finish, the possibility does make some senior race officials hesitate to use it late in the race, call a red flag to allow for further cleanup of the circuit to ensure a final restart (which is often used anyway for severe debris incidents, especially with carbon fibre), or direct to slow the safety car in order that the hazard may be cleared in time for a competitive race finish. INDYCAR has a Yellow chequer rule, and NASCAR allows it (1) if a race is shortened because of curfew or darkness, (2) if the race is already on its final lap when the yellow must be waved, or (3) if there is a yellow implemented after the leader crosses the "overtime line" (usually located on the backstretch) during a valid [[green-white-checkered]] finish once the race has restarted. In Formula One, when there is a yellow chequer, the safety car will not lead the leader to the finish line, unlike INDYCAR and NASCAR.

==Z==
;Zero car: Used in rallying. Prior to the rally cars running over a ''special stage'' several official vehicles run through the course to check for safety, conditions of the road, to see if spectators or animals may be a hazard or for obstructions. Sometimes there are a triple zero (000) and double zero (00) as well as the zero. Zero cars travel the course immediately ahead of the competitors and are usually rally cars themselves.
;Zero Light: Also known as "'''cutting a zero'''," and a "'''zero R.T'''." Used in drag racing when someone leaves the starting line at the exact moment when the light turns green (.000). Very difficult to achieve, due to the quick flashing of the lights on a Pro tree.

'''Goodall Park''' is a [[baseball]] venue in [[Sanford, Maine]], United States, which is home to the [[Sanford Mainers]] of the [[New England Collegiate Baseball League]].  The park opened in 1915.  It has a seating capacity of 950 spectators.

==History==
[[File:Goodall Park Entrance.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The rear of the park's rebuilt grandstand.]]
The park opened on May 29, 1915.  Its first game was between the [[Sanford Professionals]] and the [[Lewiston Pilgrims]] (of [[Lewiston, Maine]]).  The game was played in front of 1,300 fans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sanfordmainers.com/news/news070603b.htm Sanford Mainers website, URL accessed November 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, the park hosted an exhibition game between the Sanford Professionals and the [[Boston Red Sox]].  The game was [[Babe Ruth]]'s last game in a Red Sox uniform.  Ruth hit a three-run [[home run]] to lead the Red Sox to a come-from-behind 4-3 victory.  Ruth did not play in another game for the Red Sox before being traded to the [[New York Yankees]] by Red Sox owner [[Harry Frazee]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalballparks.com/NECBL/Goodall7.html Goodall Park gallery, URL accessed December 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bostonherald.com/sports/red_sox_mlb/mlb_coverage/2012/07/maine%E2%80%99s_field_dreams&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997 fire and rebuilding===
In 1997, an [[arsonist]] set fire to the park's grandstand and destroyed it.  After debate in Sanford as to whether or not to rebuild the park, the grandstand was rebuilt in 1998 and rededicated on July 16, 1999.  The grandstand was rebuilt at a cost of over [[USD|$]]1 million.

===Seating areas===
Most of the park's 950-spectator capacity comes from the grandstand located directly behind home plate.  The grandstand consists entirely of chairbacked seats.  The park also has a section of metal bleacher seating located down the first base line.

'''J. Samuel White's Ground''' (also known as '''Plessey Ground''') is a sports ground in Park Road, [[Cowes]], [[Isle of Wight]], [[England]].  The ground is owned by the [[Isle of Wight Council]] and is surrounded by residential housing.  A multitude of sports have been played at the ground, including [[cricket]], [[association football|football]] and [[bowls]].&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

==History==
The ground was originally owned by [[J. Samuel White|J. Samuel White &amp; Co. Ltd.]], a ship builders based in Cowes.  The company constructed the ground in 1953, with construction being funded by subscriptions from employees of the company.&lt;ref name="PRO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/ground/56939.html|title=Ground profile: J. Samuel White's Ground|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] first played [[first-class cricket]] there three years later in 1956, when [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] were the visitors in the [[County Championship]],&lt;ref name="FCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/438_f.html|title=First-Class Matches played on J Samuel White's Ground, Cowes|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] scoring the maiden century on the ground in Hampshire's first-innings, followed by [[Laddy Outschoorn]] in Worcestershire's second-innings.  The match ended in a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21985.html|title=Hampshire v Worcestershire, 1956 County Championship|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hampshire played a match there each year until 1962, playing seven first-class matches there.&lt;ref name="FCM"/&gt;  However, J.Samuel White &amp; Co. Ltd. fell on hard times, with the company's Cowes shipyard closing in 1963, bringing to an end Hampshire's use of the ground.&lt;ref name="PRO"/&gt;  The ground was sought after for development, but planning was refused, with the ground falling into disuse.&lt;ref name="PRO"/&gt;
 
The ground was later bought in 1978 by the Isle of Wight Council.  The council sought to offload the ground to a community-based organisation in 1984, with a lease being agreed with the Plessey Club.&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iw-communityclub.co.uk/history.htm|title=History of IWCC|publisher=www.iw-communityclub.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Milne Memorial Sports Ground Co. Ltd was formed to acquire the lease and manage the day-to-day running of the club.  When first acquired, the clubs membership was only open to employees and ex-employees of [[Plessey]]'s and J. Samuel White &amp; Co.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;  Having been disused by until 1984, the cricket ground and football grounds had been used for hay making, the tennis courts and bowling greens were in a state of disrepair, as was the [[cricket pavilion|pavilion]].  The club borrowed £65,000 to extend the pavilion and £10,000 to building a new clubhouse for the bowling greens.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;  Hampshire returned there for a match in 1987 in aid of [[Malcolm Marshall]]'s benefit,&lt;ref name="PRO"/&gt; though the game didn't carry first-class or [[List A cricket|List A]] status.  Today, the cricket ground is used by Cowes Cricket Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cowes.play-cricket.com/home/home.asp|title=Cowes Cricket Club|publisher=www.cowes.play-cricket.com|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the club was able to acquire [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Lottery]] funding to the tune of £330,000 for an indoor bowls facility, though this was only possible by club members lending £100,000 themselves.  The club is today open to membership for all residents of the Isle of Wight.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iw-communityclub.co.uk/|title=Isle of Wight Community Club|publisher=www.iw-communityclub.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jimmy John's Field''' is a [[baseball field]] in [[Utica, Michigan]], home to four teams that play in the [[United Shore Professional Baseball League]] (USPBL), an independent baseball league. It opened on May 30, 2016 where the Utica Unicorns defeated the Birmingham-Bloomfield Beavers, 5-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scoreboard: May 30, 2016|url=http://uspbl.wttbaseball.pointstreak.com/scoreboard.html?leagueid=1861&amp;seasonid=30320&amp;date=05/30/2016|website=United Shore Professional Baseball League|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naming rights were purchased by [[Jimmy John's]], a sandwich restaurant chain.&lt;ref name="digest1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spedden|first1=Zach|title=Ballpark Preview: Jimmy John's Field|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/2016/02/01/ballpark-preview-jimmy-johns-field/|accessdate=22 February 2017|agency=Ballpark Digest|publisher=Independent Baseball News|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ballpark is located in downtown Utica, just outside of [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. Jimmy John's Field is owned by General Sports Entertainment (GSE), however Utica's Downtown Development Authority will own the land it sits on and lease it to them for $1 per year for 30 years.&lt;ref name="digest1" /&gt; The property was the site of a capped brownfield landfill that served as an unlicensed dump for household waste, that sat vacant the last 80 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Christina|title=Names, mascots unveiled for teams at new Utica stadium|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2015/11/23/utica-baseball-team-names/76255308/|accessdate=22 February 2017|publisher=Detroit Free Press|date=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General Sports created the USPBL. The USPBL is the first independent professional baseball league in the metropolitan Detroit area.&lt;ref name="gse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Divisions: United Shore Pro Baseball League|url=http://www.generalsports.com/divisions.php?id=4|website=General Sports|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Construction began in June 2015 and the venue opened on May 30, 2016. The cost of the field was $15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reichard|first1=Kevin|title=New Utica Ballpark a Springboard for League Expansion|url=http://ballparkdigest.com/2016/05/30/new-utica-ballpark-a-springboard-for-league-expansion/|accessdate=22 February 2017|agency=Ballpark Digest|publisher=Independent Baseball News|date=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the park's first season it served all three teams as their home field, averaging 3,200 fans per game with over 200,000 fans total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Folsom|first1=Brandon|title=First year a home run for United Shore Professional Baseball League|url=http://www.freep.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2016/09/08/united-shore-professional-baseball-league/90105108/|accessdate=22 February 2017|publisher=Detroit Free Press|date=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its second season, it will serve as the home field for the Westside Woolly Mammoths as well.

The field served as the home of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] [[Marygrove College#Athletics|Marygrove College Mustangs]] baseball team until athletics were dropped in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JIMMY JOHN'S FIELD|url=http://www.marygrovemustangs.com/jimmy-johns-field|website=MarygroveMustangs.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the park hosted an NCAA game in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=OAKLAND FALLS TO CENTRAL MICHIGAN 8-4 AT JIMMY JOHN'S FIELD|url=http://www.goldengrizzlies.com/sports/m-basebl/recaps/042617aab.html|accessdate=8 May 2017|publisher=[[Oakland Golden Grizzlies]]|date=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venue==
The stadium has a total capacity of 4,500 fans, with 2,000 box seats between first and third base. It features 7 founder's level suites, 5 dugout suites, 12 patio suites, 4 picnic areas, and a grass [[berm]]. The ballpark also features a restaurant and bar on the concourse behind home plate.

In the right field corner there is a [[wiffle ball]] field and a playground.

The field has extremely wide foul territories, and a concert quality speaker system, allowing it to host other sports and events in the future.

Before the USPBL's second season, the stadium added 3 new bars, a concert stage in right field, and many new menu items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Justin|title=USPBL puts finishing touches on park as opening day approaches|url=http://www.wxyz.com/sports/uspbl-puts-finishing-touches-on-park-as-opening-day-approaches|accessdate=9 May 2017|publisher=[[WXYZ-TV]]|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In September 2016, Jimmy John's Field won the CREW Detroit Impact Award in the special impact award category for its transformation of landfill parcels along the [[Clinton River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Adrienne|title=New Humane Society campus, Jimmy John's Field win CREW Impact Awards|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20160922/NEWS/160929895/new-humane-society-campus-jimmy-johns-field-win-crew-impact-awards|accessdate=22 March 2017|publisher=[[Crain's Detroit Business]]|date=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the stadium project won the Engineering Eminent Conceptor Award from the American Council of Engineering Companies of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brenke|first1=Ronald|title=Michigan’s Top Engineering and Surveying Projects Recognized at Annual ACEC/M Excellence Awards Ceremony|url=http://www.acecmi.org/uploads/4/2/3/0/42305689/press_release_acec-michigan_engineering_excellence.pdf|accessdate=22 March 2017|publisher=The American Council of Engineering Companies of Michigan|date=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mobile bleacher''' or '''portable bleacher''' is a type of [[bleacher]] that can be moved to different locations to fulfill a need for temporary or reconfigurable seating. Some units incorporate a built-in hydraulic or electric actuation system for raising and lowering the unit. [[Highway]] towable units are available, as well as units designed to be moved within a single [[Sports venue|venue]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nussli Group]] {{cite web|title=Mobile Bleacher Seating|url=http://www.nussli.com/fileadmin/content/ueber_nussli/Leitung/Verwaltungsrat/20100920_techn_datasheet__Mobile_bleacher_seating_EN_final.pdf|website=[[Nussli Group]]|format=PDF|accessdate=February 7, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Mobile Bleacher.jpg|thumb|Mobile bleacher]]

In multi-purpose [[sport]]s venues, seating arrangements must be adapted to suit different sports' requirements. In indoor [[arena]]s, the activity area may vary from the size of a [[boxing ring]] to a [[football pitch]]. In [[outdoor sport]]s, field sizes may vary between [[American football]] and [[soccer]] requirements, or [[baseball field]]s. Movable seating arrangements have been created to fill this need. Mobile bleachers provide a lower-cost method of providing such seating with minimal site preparation requirements.

In the [[United States]], mobile bleachers are required to meet the same safety standards as fixed, telescopic and temporary bleachers in accordance with [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|CPSC]] Publication 330.&lt;ref name=cpsc1&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for Retrofitting Bleachers|url=http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/330.pdf|publisher=U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|format=PDF|accessdate=February 7, 2011|page=2|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Athletic A.F.C.''' was a [[Association football|football]] club from [[Jurby]] in the [[Isle of Man]]. They competed in the [[Isle of Man Football League]]. They wore a purple and white kit and played their home games at the Jurby School Playing Fields.

Following the 2008–09 season, the club was forced to withdraw from the [[Isle of Man Football League]] due to a lack of playing members, as a result the club has now folded.

==History==
Formed in 1992, they were known as '''Jurby F.C.''' until the end of the 2007–08 season. They struggled each season in Division Two often finishing bottom of the league, and in the 2004–05 season went the entire season without winning one league game. They did get two draws and ended up with a total of two points.&lt;ref name="rsssf05"&gt;

The '''Pegula Ice Arena''' is a 6,014-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]] on the campus of [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]]. The arena opened on October 11, 2013 when the [[Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey]] hosted [[Army Black Knights men's ice hockey|Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Men's Hockey Opens Season, Pegula Ice Arena Friday Night|url=http://news.psu.edu/story/291064/2013/10/11/athletics/mens-hockey-opens-season-pegula-ice-arena-friday-night|publisher=Pennsylvania State University|date=October 11, 2013|accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice arena replaced the 1,350-seat [[Penn State Ice Pavilion]]. The facility is located on the corner of Curtin Road and University Drive near the [[Bryce Jordan Center]].  It was announced on January 21, 2011 that the arena would be named in honor of [[Kim Pegula|Kim]] and [[Terrence Pegula|Terry Pegula]] whose $100 million donation helped fund the arena and the creation of men's and women's varsity [[College ice hockey|ice hockey]] programs.&lt;ref name="chn"&gt;{{cite web |title=Penn State Names New Arena|url=http://www.collegehockeynews.com/news/2011/01/21_penn_state_names_new_arena.php|work=College Hockey News|date=January 21, 2011|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 2010 it was officially announced the men's and women's ice hockey programs would move to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level for the 2012-13 season.

The facility also includes a practice rink, offices, locker rooms and player areas. The facility was 100% privately funded as part of the $100 million gift, the largest in the university's history, to advance the men's and women's ice hockey programs to the NCAA Division I level and provide a suitable facility for that move.&lt;ref name="gift"/&gt;

On November 5, 2010 the Penn State Board of Trustees appointed [[Crawford Architects]] and [[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]] as the architects for the new arena. Crawford Architects has worked on projects in the US and internationally and Bohlin Cywinski Jackson designed the Biobehavioral Health Building, currently under construction on the PSU campus.&lt;ref name="architects"&gt;{{cite web |title=Trustees Appoint Architects for New Ice Arena|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/sports/m-hockey/spec-rel/110510aaa.html|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Department of Athletics|date=November 5, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Removable Bolt''' (or "RB"), in [[climbing]], is a spring loaded metal camming device used to anchor a person or a load to a rock or cement wall temporarily. Removable Bolts negate the need to install permanent protection bolts to the wall, which can be costly and cause cosmetic damage. RBs are designed for use in bolting new sport climbing routes, setting temporary anchors on traditional routes, and on back-country expeditions where abandoning gear or placing permanent gear is not optimal. RBs are particularly popular when placing permanent bolts on steep walls with limited features, where other means of temporary protection, such as hooks, traditional camming devices, or slings, are not an option. By drilling a hole and inserting an RB, the bolter can ascend higher up on the rock before placing the next permanent piece of protection, thereby leaving a reasonable climbing distance between bolts on the finished route. RBs have also been designed and produced for fall prevention and safety in construction and mining operations.

Originally produced in the mid 1990s, removable bolts were at first reported to become permanently lodged in the rock after anchoring a fall. In the early 2000s, several companies redesigned the RB and the equipment has received positive feedback from users. RBs are used almost exclusively in bolting and cleaning new lines, often steep limestone, which is soft enough to be drilled with relative ease, and is particularly difficult to bolt without some load bearing anchor.

Removable bolts have been designed for particular climbing and industrial circumstances. ClimbTech's Kinder Edition Removable Bolt was designed for climber [http://www.joekindkid.com/ Joe Kinder], who required an RB that could be used on particularly dirty and moist rock. The additional surface area of the Kinder Edition RB provides better friction in these circumstances, and allowed Kinder and others to establish sport climbs in remote areas where variable rock quality necessitated careful bolt placement.

The typical RB is a 1/2 inch stopper designed to fit into a mechanically drilled hole. Other sizes have been developed, and further customizations continue to appear.

The '''Rapperswil-Jona Lakers''' are a professional [[ice hockey]] club from [[Rapperswil]], [[Switzerland]] and are members of the [[National League (ice hockey)|National League]].

==History==
[[File:Jason Spezza – Rapperswil-Jona Lakers-HC Davos – 04.12.2012.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jason Spezza]] played for the Lakers during the [[2012–13 NHL season|NHL lockout]] in 2012–13.]]

The Lakers were founded in 1945 and were known as '''SC Rapperswil-Jona''' until 2005, when the club changed its name to '''Rapperswil-Jona Lakers''' and then again changed their name to '''SC Rapperswil-Jona Lakers''' in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swisshockeynews.ch/index.php/switzerland/nlb-new/3990-new-chapter-for-the-lakers-different-name-and-new-logo|title=New chapter for the Lakers - different name and new logo|publisher=swisshockeynew.ch|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=February 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They play their home games at [[St. Galler Kantonalbank Arena]].

NHL veteran [[Doug Gilmour]] skated for the Lakers during the [[1994–95 NHL lockout|NHL lockout-shortened season]] in 1994.

They had survived relegation in every NLA season since last making the playoffs in 2007-08 until 2014-15, when they were swept by the [[SCL Tigers]] in the promotion/relegation round. They returned to the [[Swiss League]] for the 2015–16 season.

In season 2017-18 they've not only won the [[Swiss Cup (ice hockey)]], they also won the [[Swiss League]] Championship against [[EHC Olten]] and the promotion round against [[EHC Kloten]] and returned finally to the [[National League (ice hockey)|National League]] after 3 years in the minor league.

[[File:1992 Winter Olympics Albertville opening ceremony.JPG|thumb|right|Billboard located nearby the site of the Théâtre des Cérémonies, depicting the venue during the opening ceremony of the 1992 Winter Olympic Games.]]
'''Théâtre des Cérémonies''' was a temporary [[stadium]] in [[Albertville]], [[France]].  Built to only host the opening and closing ceremonies for the [[1992 Winter Olympics]], the circular shape stadium was immediately disassembled following the games.  The stadium held 35,000 and was built in 1992 like a [[circus]]. Part of the stadium was shipped to [[Barcelona]] and used during the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].  During its existence, it was the largest such temporary structure ever built. The site is now a park.

In [[association football]], '''work rate''' refers to the extent to which a [[Soccer player|player]] contributes to running and chasing in a [[Game|match]] while not in possession of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oed.com/view/Entry/230216?redirectedFrom=work%20rate|title=Definition for work rate, n.|date=30 March 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work rate is generally indicated by the distance covered by a player during a match. An example of a player with a high work rate is [[Xavi]], a former midfielder for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. During the final of the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]], Xavi ran almost 12&amp;nbsp;km, more than any other player in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thefootballtacticsblog/2011/05/barcelona_provide_a_coachs_dre.html|title=Barcelona provide a coach's dream|date=30 May 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same is true of the final of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], when he covered a distance of 14.98&amp;nbsp;km (including extra time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/27/28/20/64_0711_ned-esp_playersheatmap.pdf|title=2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa Players Heat Map|date=11 July 2010|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[FIFA.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high work rate is valued because players with this characteristic will be able to play a more active role in [[Defense (sports)|defending]] and [[Offense (sports)|attacking]] throughout a match. Conversely, players are sometimes criticized for low work rate; for instance, [[ESPN Soccernet]] correspondent Sam Limbert highlighted a poor work rate as one of the weaker qualities of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] midfielder [[Denílson Pereira Neves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.soccernet.com/arsenal/archives/2011/05/time_to_renew_the_faith_1.php|title=Arsenal: Time to renew the faith|date=29 May 2011|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[ESPN Soccernet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some experts, such as former [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] youth coach Carlos de Lorenzi, warn against the danger of equating high work rate with high talent. De Lorenzi had responsibility for the early development of such players as Brazilian star [[Kaká]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/04/world-cup-2010-best-players|title=World Cup 2010: Seven of the best players going to South Africa|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://riotimesonline.com/brazil-news/front-page/brazils-world-cup-countdown/#|title=Brazil's World Cup countdown|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2011|publisher=The Rio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
