The '''AN/APG-77''' is a multifunction [[low probability of intercept radar]] installed on the [[F-22 Raptor]] fighter aircraft. The radar is built by [[Northrop Grumman]].

It is a [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]], [[active electronically scanned array]] (AESA) radar. Composed of 1956 [[Transceiver|transmit/receive modules]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

More than 100 APG-77 AESA radars have been produced to date by Northrop Grumman, and much of the technology developed for the APG-77 is being used in the [[APG-81]] radar for the [[F-35 Lightning II]].

'''Action-based Learning Questions''' are questions that are based on the approach of [[Action learning]] where one solves real-life problems that involve taking action and reflecting upon the results. There are two types of questions - Closed Questions and Open Questions. Closed questions involve a technique which does not allow the respondents to develop their response, they can just say 'Yes' or 'No' whereas Open questions allow the respondents to expand or explore in their response. Action-based learning questions are beneficial in the education system. 

== Overview ==

One of the keys to effective Action learning is asking the 'right question'. When asked to the right people at the right time, these questions result in obtaining the necessary information. The Action Learning process, which primarily uses a questioning approach, can be more helpful than offering advice because it assumes that each person has the capacity to find their own answers.

Normally, the purpose of asking a question is to obtain information. However, in Action Learning, the purpose is to help someone else to do one or more of the following:
    
*Think more deeply
*Explore new options and [[Point of view (philosophy)|perspectives]]
*Reflect in order to make better choices and decisions

== Types of Questions ==

=== Closed Questions ===
 
Closed questions involve a technique which does not allow the respondents to develop their response. It can do so by limiting respondents with a strict, limited list of answer choices. Answers are mostly [[monosyllabic]] words or short phrases. For example, some closed questions can only be answered by a “Yes” or “No”.

Closed questions should not be interpreted as simple questions. They can be of varying levels of difficulty, and may make the respondent think before answering. Take this phrase for example: "When two quantities are dependent on each other, does an increase in one always leads to an increase in the other?".

''Usage Of Closed Questions:''

* To give facts
* To help keep control of the conversation with the questioner
* To open up a conversation

=== Open Questions ===

Open questions allow the respondent to expand or explore in their response, and do not have a single correct response. This gives the respondent the freedom to discover new ideas, consider different possibilities, and decide on the course of action which is right for them.

Open-ended questions are not always long - they may be short as well as open-ended. Shorter questions often have equal or greater impact than longer ones. When asking shorter questions, it is easier to be perceived as abrupt or even rude. When questioning an Action Learning set, it is important to be aware of one's tone and language. The goal is usually to ask challenging questions, or to challenge the respondent's perspective.

''Usage Of Open Questions:''

* To encourage discussion of opinion and feelings.
* To think and reflect
* To give control of the conversation to the [[respondent]]
* To expand upon a closed question
* To aid in the realization of the depth of a situation
* To help to learn more about an individual

== Benefits in Education ==

* To help students organize their thoughts
*To assist students as they analyze causes and effects
* To provide opportunities for students to use evaluative thinking skills
* To incite students to listen to the ideas of others, synthesize information, and form opinions on the issue at hand
* To aid students' memories
* To direct self [[feedback]] for an individual

In June 2015, Ada Initiative organizers announced the end of AdaCamp and an upcoming open source "AdaCamp Toolkit", a series of planning documents meant to outline how to run an event like AdaCamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Announcing the end of the AdaCamp program|url = https://adainitiative.org/2015/06/announcing-the-end-of-the-adacamp-program/|website = adainitiative.org|accessdate = 2015-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Air conditioning''' (often referred to as '''AC''', '''A/C''', or '''air con''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/air-con|title=air con Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of removing heat and moisture from the interior of an occupied space, to improve the comfort of occupants.  Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments. This process is most commonly used to achieve a more comfortable interior environment, typically for humans and animals; however, air conditioning is also used to cool/dehumidify rooms filled with heat-producing electronic devices, such as [[computer server]]s, [[power amplifier]]s, and even to display and store some delicate products, such as artwork.

Air conditioners often use a fan to distribute the conditioned air to an occupied space such as a building or a [[car]] to improve [[thermal comfort]] and [[indoor air quality]]. Electric refrigerant-based AC units range from small units that can cool a small bedroom, which can be carried by a single adult, to massive units installed on the roof of office towers that can cool an entire building. The [[cooling]] is typically achieved through a [[refrigeration cycle]], but sometimes [[evaporative cooler|evaporation]] or [[free cooling]] is used. Air conditioning systems can also be made based on [[desiccant]]s (chemicals which remove moisture from the air) and subterraneous pipes that can distribute the heated refrigerant to the ground for cooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/E/AE_earth_cooling_tube.html |title=Earth cooling tube |first=David |last=Darling |website=daviddarling.info |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most general sense, air conditioning can refer to any form of technology that modifies the condition of air (heating, (de-)humidification, cooling, cleaning, ventilation, or air movement). In common usage, though, "air conditioning" refers to systems which cool air. In [[construction]], a complete system of heating, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], and air conditioning is referred to as [[HVAC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McDowall |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=Fundamentals of HVAC Systems |publisher=Elsevier |page=3 |isbn=9780080552330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
===Evaporative cooling===
Since prehistoric times, snow and ice were used for cooling. The business of harvesting ice during winter and storing for use in summer became popular towards the late [[17th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Nagengast| first=Bernard| title=A History of Comfort Cooling Using Ice| journal=ASHRAE Journal| date=February 1999| page=49| url=http://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/Public/200362710047_326.pdf| access-date=22 July 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812202321/https://ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/Public/200362710047_326.pdf| archive-date=2013-08-12| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was replaced by mechanical ice-making machines.

The basic concept behind air conditioning is said to have been applied in ancient Egypt, where reeds were hung in windows and were moistened with trickling water. The evaporation of water cooled the air blowing through the window. This process also made the air more humid, which can be beneficial in a dry desert climate. In [[ancient Rome]], water from [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] was circulated through the walls of certain houses to cool them. Other techniques in medieval [[Persia]] involved the use of [[cistern]]s and [[wind tower]]s to cool buildings during the hot season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bahadori MN|title=Passive Cooling Systems in Iranian Architecture| journal=Scientific American| volume=238| issue=2| pages=144–154| date=February 1978| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0278-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2nd-century Chinese mechanical engineer and inventor [[Ding Huan]] of the [[Han Dynasty]] invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for air conditioning, with seven wheels {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} in diameter and manually powered by prisoners of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1991|title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=99, 151, 233 |isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712–762) of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) had the ''Cool Hall'' (''Liang Dian'' {{lang|zh|涼殿}}) built in the imperial palace, which the ''Tang Yulin'' describes as having [[hydraulics|water-powered]] fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279), written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needham|first=Joseph|year=1991|title=Science and Civilisation in China, Volume 4: Physics and Physical Technology, Part 2, Mechanical Engineering|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=134, 151 |isbn=978-0-521-05803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, the Dutch inventor [[Cornelis Drebbel]] demonstrated "Turning Summer into Winter" as an early form of modern air conditioning for [[James I of England]] by adding salt to water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laszlo |first=Pierre |title=Salt: Grain of Life |year=2001 |publisher=Comumbia University Press |url= https://books.google.com/?id=DhhN_FthpYMC&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Cornelius+Drebbel+%22air+conditioning%22 |isbn= 9780231121989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of mechanical cooling===
[[File:Gorriemuseumapalachicola ice mchn1.jpg|thumb|upright|Three-quarters scale model of Gorrie's ice machine at [[John Gorrie State Museum]], Florida]]
Modern air conditioning emerged from advances in [[chemistry]] during the 19th century, and the first large-scale electrical air conditioning was invented and used in 1902 by [[United States|US]] inventor [[Willis Carrier]]. The introduction of residential air conditioning in the 1920s helped enable the great migration to the [[Sun Belt]] in the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1758, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[John Hadley (chemist)|John Hadley]], a chemistry professor at [[Cambridge University]], conducted an experiment to explore the principle of evaporation as a means to rapidly cool an object. Franklin and Hadley confirmed that evaporation of highly volatile liquids (such as alcohol and ether) could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to speed up the [[evaporation]]. They lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|-14|C|0}} while the ambient temperature was {{convert|18|C|0}}. Franklin noted that, soon after they passed the freezing point of water {{convert|0|C|0}}, a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about {{convert|1/4|in|mm|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|-14|C|0}}. Franklin concluded: "From this experiment one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Franklin| first1=Benjamin| title=Letter to John Lining| url=http://www.waughfamily.ca/Montgomery/benfranklin1758.htm|accessdate=6 August 2014| date=June 17, 1758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820, English scientist and inventor [[Michael Faraday]] discovered that compressing and liquefying [[ammonia]] could chill air when the liquefied ammonia was allowed to evaporate. In 1842, [[Florida]] physician [[John Gorrie]] used compressor technology to create ice, which he used to cool air for his patients in his hospital in [[Apalachicola, Florida|Apalachicola]], [[Florida]]. He hoped to eventually use his ice-making machine to regulate the temperature of buildings. He even envisioned centralized air conditioning that could cool entire cities. Though his prototype leaked and performed irregularly, Gorrie was granted a patent in 1851 for his ice-making machine. Though his process improved the artificial production of ice, his hopes for its success vanished soon afterwards when his chief financial backer died and Gorrie did not get the money he needed to develop the machine. According to his biographer, Vivian M. Sherlock, he blamed the "Ice King", [[Frederic Tudor]], for his failure, suspecting that Tudor had launched a [[smear campaign]] against his invention. Dr. Gorrie died impoverished in 1855, and the dream of commonplace air conditioning went away for 50 years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]]'s first mechanical ice-making machine began operation in 1851 on the banks of the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon River]] at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], Australia. His first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1853, and his patent for an ether [[vapor]] compression refrigeration system was granted in 1855. This novel system used a compressor to force the refrigeration gas to pass through a condenser, where it cooled down and liquefied. The liquefied gas then circulated through the refrigeration coils and vaporized again, cooling down the surrounding system. The machine produced {{convert|3,000|kg}} of ice per day.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Though Harrison had commercial success establishing a second ice company back in Sydney in 1860, he later entered the debate over how to compete against the American advantage of ice-refrigerated beef sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. He wrote: "Fresh meat frozen and packed as if for a voyage, so that the refrigerating process may be continued for any required period", and in 1873 prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom. His choice of a cold room system instead of installing a refrigeration system upon the ship itself proved disastrous when the ice was consumed faster than expected.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Electrical air conditioning ===
[[File:Willis Carrier 1915.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Willis Carrier]]]]
In 1902, the first modern electrical air conditioning unit was [[invention|invented]] by [[Willis Carrier]] in [[Buffalo, New York]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} After graduating from [[Cornell University]], Carrier found a job at the [[Buffalo Forge Company]]. There, he began experimenting with air conditioning as a way to solve an application problem for the Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The first air conditioner, designed and built in Buffalo by Carrier, began working on 17 July 1902.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Designed to improve manufacturing [[process control]] in a [[printing]] plant, Carrier's invention controlled not only [[temperature]] but also [[humidity]]. Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of objects with steam and reversed the process. Instead of sending air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thereby the amount of moisture in the air could be controlled, which in turn made the humidity in the room controllable. The controlled temperature and humidity helped maintain consistent paper dimensions and ink alignment. Later, Carrier's technology was applied to increase productivity in the workplace, and [[Carrier Corporation|The Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America]] was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, air conditioning came to be used to improve comfort in homes and [[automobile]]s as well. Residential sales expanded dramatically in the 1950s.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1906, [[Stuart W. Cramer]] of [[Charlotte]] was exploring ways to add moisture to the air in his textile mill. Cramer coined the term "air conditioning", using it in a patent claim he filed that year as an analogue to "water conditioning", then a well-known process for making textiles easier to process. He combined moisture with ventilation to "condition" and change the air in the factories, controlling the humidity so necessary in textile plants. Willis Carrier adopted the term and incorporated it into the name of his company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Apparatus for treating air.|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US808897A/en|date=1904-09-16|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly thereafter, the first private home to have air conditioning was built in Minneapolis in 1914, owned by [[Charles Gilbert Gates|Charles Gates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a7951/a-brief-history-of-air-conditioning-10720229/ |title=A Brief History of Air Conditioning |publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=2015-01-01|date=January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing that air conditioning would one day be a standard feature of private homes, particularly in regions with warmer climate, [[David St. Pierre DuBose]] (1898-1994) designed a network of ductwork and vents for his home ''Meadowmont'', all disguised behind intricate and attractive Georgian-style open moldings.{{when|date=September 2015}} This building is believed to be one of the first private homes in the United States equipped for [[central air conditioning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rizzoconferencecenter.com/PDFs/History-of-Meadowmont.pdf |title=Early University Benefactors |publisher=Rizzoconferencecenter.com |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, [[Robert Sherman (engineer)|Robert Sherman]] of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] invented a portable, in-window air conditioner that cooled, heated, humidified, dehumidified, and filtered the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://navlog.org/patent_1.html |title=Unsung Engineering Heros: Robert Sherman |publisher=Navlog.org |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigerant development ===
{{Main|Refrigerant}}
[[File:Embraco compressor.jpg|thumb|A modern [[R-134a]] hermetic refrigeration [[gas compressor|compressor]]]]
The first air conditioners and [[refrigerator]]s employed toxic or flammable gases, such as [[ammonia]], [[methyl chloride]], or [[propane]], that could result in fatal accidents when they leaked. [[Thomas Midgley, Jr.]] created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, ''[[Freon]]'', in 1928. The name is a [[trademark]] name owned by [[DuPont]] for any [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), [[HCFC|hydrochlorofluorocarbon]] (HCFC), or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number indicating the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building comfort cooling is an HCFC known as [[chlorodifluoromethane]] (R-22).

[[Dichlorodifluoromethane]] (R-12) was the most common blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134A]] due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, so the only source for air-conditioning repair purposes is the cleaned and purified gas recovered from other air conditioner systems. Several non-ozone-depleting refrigerants have been developed as alternatives, including [[R-410A]]. It was first commercially used by Carrier Corp. under the brand name ''Puron''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Modern refrigerants have been developed to be more environmentally safe than many of the early chlorofluorocarbon-based refrigerants used in the early- and mid-twentieth century. These include [[HCFC]]s ([[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], as used in most U.S. homes before 2011) and [[hydrofluorocarbon|HFCs]] ([[R-134a]], used in most cars) have replaced most CFC use. HCFCs, in turn, are supposed to have been in the process of being phased out under the [[Montreal Protocol]] and replaced by HFCs such as [[R-410A]], which lack chlorine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.sylvane.com/blog/air-conditioners-dehumidifiers-r-410-a-refrigerant/|website=Sylvane |title=Air Conditioners &amp; Dehumidifiers|date=July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; HFCs, however, contribute to climate change problems. Moreover, policy and political influence by corporate executives resisted change.&lt;ref&gt;Mate, John "Making a Difference: A Case Study of the Greenpeace Ozone Campaign" RECIEL 10:2 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benedick, Richard Elliot Ozone Diplomacy Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations insisted that no alternatives to HFCs existed. The environmental organization [[Greenpeace]] provided funding to a former East German refrigerator company to research an alternative ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant in 1992. The company developed a hydrocarbon mix of [[isopentane]] and [[isobutane]], but as a condition of the contract with Greenpeace could not patent the technology, which led to its widespread adoption by other firms.&lt;ref name="greenpeace.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Happy birthday, Greenfreeze! |url= http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/happy-birthday-greenfreeze/blog/44473/ |publisher=Greenpeace |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ozone.unep.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozone Secretariat |url= http://ozone.unep.org/Events/4C1_PublicInfo_Awards97.shtml |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150412225008/http://ozone.unep.org/Events/4C1_PublicInfo_Awards97.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 April 2015 |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=8 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spiegel&gt;{{Cite news |title=Öko-Coup aus Ostdeutschland |url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/oeko-revolution-aus-ostdeutschland-wie-foron-den-ersten-fckw-freien-kuehlschrank-der-welt-erfand-a-951064.html|date=September 13, 2013 |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |accessdate=4 September 2015|last1=Gunkel|first1=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activist marketing first in Germany led to companies like Whirlpool, Bosch, and later LG and others to incorporate the technology throughout Europe, then Asia, although the corporate executives resisted in Latin America, so that it arrived in Argentina produced by a domestic firm in 2003, and then finally with giant Bosch's production in Brazil by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilustrados.com/tema/3015/Historia-Greenfreeze.html |title=La Historia del "Greenfreeze" |publisher=Ilustrados.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/brasil/pt/Noticias/discurso-de-frank-guggenheim-n/ |title=Discurso de Frank Guggenheim no lançamento do Greenfreeze &amp;#124; Brasil |publisher=Greenpeace.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from a colder location to a hotter area. As heat would naturally flow in the opposite direction, work is required to achieve this. A [[refrigerator]] is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into its environment. The [[refrigerant]] is used as the medium which absorbs and removes heat from the space to be cooled and subsequently ejects that heat elsewhere.

Circulating refrigerant vapor enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]], where its pressure and temperature are [[Gas compressor#Temperature|increased]]. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be [[Condensation|condensed]] and is routed through a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. Here it is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant removes heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air.  The removal of this heat can be greatly augmented by pouring water over the condenser coils, making it much cooler when it hits the expansion valve.

The condensed, pressurized, and still usually somewhat hot liquid refrigerant is next routed through an [[Thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (often nothing more than a pinhole in the system's copper tubing) where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in [[flash evaporation]] of a part of the liquid refrigerant, greatly lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the [[evaporator coil|evaporator]]. A fan blows the interior warm air (which is to be cooled) across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled and is pumped by an exhaust fan/ blower into the room. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. In order for the process to have any efficiency, the cooling/evaporative portion of the system must be separated by some kind of physical barrier from the heating/condensing portion, and each portion must have its own fan to circulate its own "kind" of air (either the hot air or the cool air).

Modern air conditioning systems are not designed to draw air into the room from the outside, they only recirculate the increasingly cool air on the inside. Because this inside air always has some amount of moisture suspended in it, the cooling portion of the process always causes ambient warm water vapor to condense on the cooling coils and to drip from them down onto a catch tray at the bottom of the unit from which it must then be routed outside, usually through a drain hole. As this moisture has no dissolved minerals in it, it will not cause mineral buildup on the coils. This will happen even if the ambient humidity level is low. If ice begins to form on the evaporative fins, it will reduce circulation efficiency and cause the development of more ice, etc.  A clean and strong circulatory fan can help prevent this, as will raising the target cool temperature of the unit's thermostat to a point that the compressor is allowed to turn off occasionally. A failing [[thermistor]] may also cause this problem. Refrigerators without a [[defrost]] cycle may have this same issue. Dust can also cause the fins to begin blocking air flow with the same undesirable result: ice.

By running an air conditioner's compressor in the opposite direction, the overall effect can be completely reversed and the indoor area will become heated instead of cooled (see [[heat pump]]). The engineering of physical and thermodynamic properties of gas–vapor mixtures is called [[psychrometrics]].

==== Heat pump unit ====
{{Main|Heat pump}}
[[File:External heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|An example of an externally fitted AC unit which uses a heat pump system]]
A heat pump is an air conditioner in which the [[refrigeration cycle]] can be reversed, producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as a "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heat pump is significantly more energy efficient than [[electric resistance heating]]. Some homeowners elect to have a heat pump system installed as a feature of a central air conditioner. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit also switches roles to serve as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).

Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4–13&amp;nbsp;°C (40–55&amp;nbsp;°F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil ''back'' to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. A heat pump system will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.

The icing problem becomes much more severe with lower outdoor temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more conventional form of heating, such as a [[natural gas]] or [[heating oil|oil]] [[furnace]], which is used instead of the heat pump during harsher winter temperatures. In this case, the heat pump is used efficiently during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outdoor temperature is lower.

[[Absorption refrigerator|Absorption heat pumps]] are a kind of air-source heat pump, but they do not depend on electricity to power them. Instead, gas, solar power, or heated water is used as a main power source. An absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water, which gives off heat. Next, the water and ammonia mixture is depressurized to induce boiling, and the ammonia is boiled off, which absorbs heat from the outdoor air.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Some more expensive fixed window air conditioning units have a true heat pump function. However, a window unit may only have an electric resistance heater.

=== Evaporative cooling ===
{{Main|Evaporative cooler}}
[[File:Evaporative cooler, CO, IMG 5681.JPG|thumb|An evaporative cooler]]
In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporative cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large [[sponge (tool)|sponge]] soaked with water. The [[sensible heat]] of the incoming air, as measured by a [[Dry-bulb temperature|dry bulb thermometer]], is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the [[total heat]] (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be quite substantial.

Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working during times of high humidity, when there is not much dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for dwelling occupants. Unlike other types of air conditioners, evaporative coolers rely on the outside air to be channeled through cooler pads that cool the air before it reaches the inside of a house through its air duct system; this cooled outside air must be allowed to push the warmer air within the house out through an exhaust opening such as an open door or window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Greenhouse gardener's companion: growing food and flowers in your greenhouse or sunspace| edition = 2nd| author = Shane Smith| publisher = Fulcrum Publishing| year = 2000| isbn = 978-1-55591-450-9| page = 62| url = https://books.google.com/?id=Onv60-c6iEIC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=evaporative-cooler+exhaust+open+door+window&amp;q=evaporative-cooler%20exhaust%20open%20door%20window }}&lt;/ref&gt; These coolers cost less and are mechanically simple to understand and maintain.

=== Free cooling ===
{{Main|Free cooling}}
Air conditioning can also be provided by a process called [[free cooling]] which uses pumps to circulate a coolant (typically water or a glycol mix) from a cold source, which in turn acts as a [[heat sink]] for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes, equipped with heat exchanger. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thereby declining its effectiveness.

Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are sometimes combined with [[seasonal thermal energy storage]] (STES) so the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Free cooling and hybrid systems are [[mature technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Snijders |first=Aart |date=2008 |url= http://trca.on.ca/dotAsset/16551.pdf |title=ATES Technology Development and Major Applications in Europe |publisher=IFTech International |website=Conservation for the Living Community Workshop (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority |accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humidity control ==
{{noref section|date=December 2016}}
Since humans perspire to provide natural cooling by the [[evaporation]] of [[perspiration]] from the skin, drier air (up to a point) improves the comfort provided. The comfort air conditioner is designed to create a 50% to 60% relative [[humidity]] in the occupied space.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Dehumidification and cooling ===
Refrigeration air conditioning equipment usually reduces the absolute humidity of the air processed by the system. The relatively cold (below the [[dewpoint]]) evaporator coil condenses water vapor from the processed air, much like an ice-cold drink will condense water on the outside of a glass. Therefore, water vapor is removed from the cooled air and the relative humidity in the room is lowered. The water is usually sent to a drain or may simply drip onto the ground outdoors.
The heat is rejected by the condenser which is located outside of room to be cooled.

===Dehumidification program===

Most modern air-conditioning systems feature a dehumidification cycle during which the compressor runs while the fan is slowed as much as possible{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} to reduce the evaporator temperature and therefore condense more water. When the temperature falls below a threshold, both the fan and compressor are shut off to mitigate further temperature drops;{{clarify|date=October 2017}} this prevents moisture on the evaporator from being blown back into the room.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} When the temperature rises again,{{clarify|reason=temperature of what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor restarts and the fan returns to low speed.

Occasionally, to thaw any ice produced, the fan runs with the compressor shut down; this function is less effective when ambient temperatures are low.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Inverter air conditioners use the inside coil temperature sensor to keep the evaporator as cold as possible. When the evaporator is too cold,{{clarify|reason=too cold for what?|date=October 2017}} the compressor is slowed or stopped with the indoor fan running.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Dehumidifier ===
{{main|Dehumidifier}}
[[Image:Maytag dehumidifier1.jpg|thumb|upright|Typical portable dehumidifier]]
A specialized air conditioner that is used only for dehumidifying is called a [[dehumidifier]]. It also uses a [[refrigeration cycle]], but differs from a standard air conditioner in that both the evaporator and the condenser are placed in the same air path. A standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside. However, since all components of the dehumidifier are in the ''same'' room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric [[Watt|power]] consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the room as heat, so the room is actually ''heated'', just as by an [[electric heater]] that draws the same amount of power.

In addition, if water is condensed in the room, the amount of heat previously needed to evaporate that water also is re-released in the room (the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporization]]). The dehumidification process is the inverse of adding water to the room with an [[evaporative cooler]], and instead releases heat. Therefore, an in-room dehumidifier always will warm the room and reduce the relative humidity indirectly, as well as reducing the humidity directly by condensing and removing water.

Inside the unit, the air passes over the evaporator coil first, and is cooled and dehumidified. The now dehumidified, cold air then passes over the condenser coil where it is warmed up again. Then the air is released back into the room. The unit produces warm, dehumidified air and can usually be placed freely in the environment (room) that is to be conditioned.

Dehumidifiers are commonly used in cold, damp climates to prevent [[mold]] growth indoors, especially in basements. They are also used to protect sensitive equipment from the adverse effects of excessive humidity in [[tropical countries]].

== Energy transfer ==
In a thermodynamically [[closed system]], any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the effect that, for each unit of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner removes that energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Jan F. |editor-last=Kreider|title= Handbook of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning |publisher=CRC Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8493-9584-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "efficiency" ([[coefficient of performance]]) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100&amp;nbsp;W [[heating element]] is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioner's power consumption will increase by 50&amp;nbsp;W to compensate for this, thus making the 100&amp;nbsp;W heating element cost a total of 150&amp;nbsp;W of power.

It is typical for air conditioners to operate at "efficiencies" of significantly greater than 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Winnick, J|title=Chemical engineering thermodynamics|year=1996| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-471-05590-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be noted that the input electrical energy is of higher thermodynamic quality (lower [[entropy]]) than the output thermal energy (heat energy).

Air conditioner equipment power in the U.S. is often described in terms of "[[ton of refrigeration|tons of refrigeration]]", with each  approximately equal to the cooling power of one [[short ton]] (2000 pounds or 907 kilograms) of ice melting in a 24-hour period. The value is defined as 12,000 [[BTU]] per hour, or 3517 watts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html|title=NIST Guide to the SI|accessdate=2007-05-18|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070528005956/http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/appenB9.html| archivedate= 28 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential central air systems are usually from 1 to 5 tons (3.5 to 18&amp;nbsp;kW) in capacity.

=== Seasonal energy efficiency ratio ===
{{Main|Seasonal energy efficiency ratio}}
For residential homes, some countries set minimum requirements for energy efficiency. In the United States, the efficiency of air conditioners is often (but not always) rated by the seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER). The higher the SEER rating, the more energy efficient is the air conditioner. The SEER rating is the BTU of cooling output during its normal annual usage divided by the total electric energy input in [[Kilowatt hour|watt hours]] (W·h) during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=S|title=Energy Glossary&amp;nbsp;– S |accessdate=2006-07-02 |work=Energy Glossary |publisher=Energy Information Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''SEER = BTU ÷ (W·h) '''
this can also be rewritten as:
: '''SEER = (BTU / h) ÷ W''', where "W" is the average electrical power in Watts, and (BTU/h) is the rated cooling power.

For example, a 5000 BTU/h air-conditioning unit, with a SEER of 10, would consume 5000/10 = 500 Watts of power on average.

The electrical energy consumed per year can be calculated as the average power multiplied by the annual operating time:

: '''500 W × 1000 h = 500,000 W·h = 500 [[kWh]]'''

Assuming 1000 hours of operation during a typical cooling season (i.e., 8 hours per day for 125 days per year).

Another method that yields the same result, is to calculate the total annual cooling output:

: '''5000 BTU/h × 1000 h = 5,000,000 BTU'''

Then, for a SEER of 10, the annual electrical energy usage would be:

: '''5,000,000 BTU ÷ 10 = 500,000 W·h = 500 kWh'''

SEER is related to the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP) commonly used in [[thermodynamics]] and also to the [[Energy Efficiency Ratio]] (EER). The EER is the efficiency rating for the equipment at a particular pair of external and internal temperatures, while SEER is calculated over a whole range of external temperatures (i.e., the temperature distribution for the geographical location of the SEER test). SEER is unusual in that it is composed of an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] divided by an [[SI unit]]. The COP is a ratio with the same metric units of energy ([[joule]]s) in both the [[Fraction (mathematics)|numerator]] and [[Fraction (mathematics)|denominator]]. They cancel out, leaving a [[dimensionless quantity]]. Formulas for the approximate conversion between SEER and EER or COP are available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071202130510/http://www.pge.com/docs/pdfs/biz/rebates/spc_contracts/2004_manuals_forms/spc_cooling_units.pdf SEER conversion formulas from Pacific Gas and Electric]. Web.archive.org (2007-12-02). Retrieved on 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

: (1) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''SEER = EER ÷ 0.9'''
: (2) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''SEER = COP × 3.792'''
: (3) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; '''EER = COP × 3.413'''

From equation (2) above, a SEER of 13 is equivalent to a COP of 3.43, which means that 3.43 units of heat energy are pumped per unit of work energy.

The United States now requires that residential systems manufactured in 2006 have a minimum SEER rating of 13 (although window-box systems are exempt from this law, so their SEER is still around 10).

== Installation types ==

===Window unit and packaged terminal===
[[File:Window air conditioner working.gif|thumb|How a window air conditioner works]]
[[File:Condicionadordear.jpg|thumb|Air conditioning window unit]]
[[File:Air conditioning unit-en.svg|thumb|Parts of a window unit]]
Window unit air conditioners are installed in an open window. The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.

In 1971, [[General Electric]] introduced a popular portable in-window air conditioner designed for convenience and portability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Staff |first=Writer |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/01/13/bright-ideas/B8Fuvbgy021GG95bydrHgM/story.html |title=Timeline: Bright ideas |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2016-01-13 |accessdate=2017-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Packaged terminal air conditioner|Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC)]] systems are also known as wall-split air conditioning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sylvane.com/packaged-terminal-air-conditioner-buying-guide.html|website=Sylvane |title=PTAC Buying Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to provide heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the air conditioner into a heat pump. While room air conditioning provides maximum flexibility, when used to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.

The first practical semi-portable air conditioning unit was invented by engineers at [[Chrysler Motors]] and offered for sale starting in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines |title=Popular Mechanics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uN4DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA885 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |date=June 1935 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |pages=885– |issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Split systems ===
Split-system air conditioners come in two forms: mini-split and central systems. In both types, the inside-environment (evaporative) [[heat exchanger]] is separated by some distance from the outside-environment (condensing unit) heat exchanger.

==== Mini-split (ductless) system ====
[[File:Splitklimaanlage IMGP9925 unbranded.jpg|thumb|Outside part of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]&lt;!----&gt;[[File:GALANZ II.jpg|thumb|right|Indoor part of a ductless split-type air conditioner]]
A mini-split system typically supplies air conditioned and heated air to a single or a few rooms of a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mitsubishi Contractors Guide |page=16 |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226020149/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/media/382145/m-series_revised_july13.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-zone systems are a common application of ductless systems and allow up to 8 rooms (zones) to be conditioned from a single outdoor unit. Multi-zone systems typically offer a variety of indoor unit styles including wall-mounted, ceiling-mounted, ceiling recessed, and horizontal ducted. Mini-split systems typically produce {{convert|9000|to(-)|36000|Btu|abbr=on}} per hour of cooling. Multi-zone systems provide extended cooling and heating capacity up to 60,000 Btu's.

Advantages of the ductless system include smaller size and flexibility for zoning or heating and cooling individual rooms. The inside wall space required is significantly reduced. Also, the compressor and heat exchanger can be located farther away from the inside space, rather than merely on the other side of the same unit as in a PTAC or window air conditioner. Flexible exterior hoses lead from the outside unit to the interior one(s); these are often enclosed with metal to look like common drainpipes from the roof. In addition, ductless systems offer higher efficiency, reaching above 30 SEER.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |title=Mitsubishi Electric US, Inc. Cooling &amp; Heating &amp;#124; HVAC |publisher=Mitsubishipro.com |date=2010-02-17 |accessdate=2015-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603025417/http://www.mitsubishipro.com/en/professional/products/heat-pump-systems/m--p-single-zone/m-series-heat-pump-systems/msz-fhmuz-fh |archivedate=2015-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary disadvantage of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may cost more than twice as much as window units of similar capacity."&lt;ref name=doe20120809&gt;
{{cite web |title=Ductless Mini-Split Air Conditioners |url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/ductless-mini-split-air-conditioners |publisher=US Department of Energy |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional possible disadvantage is that the cost of installing mini splits can be higher than some systems. However, lower operating costs and [[rebate (marketing)|rebates]] or other financial incentives—offered in some areas—can help offset the initial expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ductless, mini-Split Heat Pumps| url=http://energy.gov/energysaver/ductless-mini-split-heat-pumps | publisher=US Department of Energy|accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central (ducted) air conditioning====
Central ([[Duct (HVAC)|ducted]]) air conditioning offers whole-house or large-commercial-space cooling, and often offers moderate multi-zone temperature control capability by the addition of air-louver-control boxes.

In central air conditioning, the inside heat-exchanger is typically placed inside the central furnace/AC unit of the [[Forced-air|forced air]] [[central heating|heating system]] which is then used in the summer to distribute chilled air throughout a residence or commercial building.

The heat-exchanger cools the air that is being forced through it by the furnace blower. As the warm air comes in contact with this cool surface the water in the air condenses. By pulling the water molecules from the air. According to the psychometric chart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Biomeasurement and Experimental Techniques for Avian Species|url=http://web.uconn.edu/poultry/NE-127/NewFiles/Psychrometric.html |at=Figure 1. Psychrometric Chart |title=Psychrometric Chart Use |publisher=Northeast Regional Poultry Research Project, NE-127 |date= |accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as relative humidity decreases in order to feel cool you will have to lower the temperature even more. A common way to counteract this effect is by installing a whole-home humidifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespruce.com/home-humidifier-types-4072878|title=Should You Get a Portable Humidifier?|author=|date=|website=thespruce.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, installing a high efficient system this need to turn the temperature down wont have such and influence on your energy costs.

==== Multi-split system ====
A multi-split system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning|last=Trott|first=A. R.|last2=Welch|first2=T|publisher=Reed Educational and Professional Publishing Ltd|year=2000|isbn=0 7506 4219 X|location=Great Britain|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a conventional split system, which is divided into two parts ([[evaporator]] and condenser) and allows cooling or heating of several rooms with one external unit. In the outdoor unit of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for connecting several traces and automation with locking valves for regulating the volume of refrigerant supplied to the indoor units located in the room.

''Difference between split system and multi-split system'':

Other common types of air conditioning system are multi-split systems, the difference between separate split system and multi-split system in several indoor units. All of them are connected to the main external unit, but the principle of their operation is similar to a simple split-system.

Its unique feature is the presence of one main external unit that connected to several indoor units. Such systems might be the right solution for maintaining the microclimate in several offices, shops, large living spaces. Just few of outdoor units do not worsen the aesthetic appearance of the building.The main external unit can be connected to several different indoor types: floor, ceiling, cassette, etc.

===== Multi-split system installation considerations =====
Before selecting the installation location of air conditioner, several main factors need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the place of rest or work area. Secondly, there should not be any obstacles on the way of the airflow that might prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit must also be located in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be effectively discharged outside and the productivity of the entire system will drop sharply. It is highly advisable to install the air conditioner units in easily accessible places, for further maintenance during operation.

The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate separately from each other.

The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power should not exceed the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfortable temperature level. However, the calculation of the total power is not simple, since it takes into account not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc.

=== Portable units ===
A portable air conditioner can be easily transported inside a home or office. They are currently available with capacities of about {{convert|5000|-|60000|btu/h|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} and with or without electric-resistance heaters. Portable air conditioners are either evaporative or refrigerative.

The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, meaning they use air to exchange heat, in the same way as a car radiator or typical household air conditioner does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which must be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.

==== Portable split system ====
A portable  system has an indoor unit on wheels connected to an outdoor unit via flexible pipes, similar to a permanently fixed installed unit.

==== Portable hose system ====
Hose systems, which can be ''monoblock'' or ''air-to-air'', are vented to the outside via air [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]]. The ''monoblock'' type collects the water in a bucket or tray and stops when full. The ''air-to-air'' type re-evaporates the water and discharges it through the ducted hose and can run continuously.

A single-hose unit uses air from within the room to cool its condenser, and then vents it outside. This air is replaced by hot air from outside or other rooms (due to the negative pressure inside the room), thus reducing the unit's overall efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experts123.com/q/what-is-the-difference-between-a-single-hose-design-and-a-dual-hose-design.html |title=In the two hose design the exchanged air does not come from the interior of the room or house, but enters through the second hose. |publisher=Experts123.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern units might have a [[coefficient of performance]] of approximately 3 (i.e., 1&amp;nbsp;kW of electricity will produce 3&amp;nbsp;kW of cooling). A dual-hose unit draws air to cool its condenser from outside instead of from inside the room, and thus is more effective than most single-hose units. These units create no negative pressure in the room.

==== Portable evaporative system ====
[[Evaporative cooler]]s, sometimes called "swamp coolers", do not have a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the [[Enthalpy of vaporization|latent heat of vaporisation]], cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by [[Perspiration|sweating]].

Evaporative coolers have the advantage of needing no hoses to vent heat outside the cooled area, making them truly portable. They are also very cheap to install and use less energy than refrigerative air conditioners.

== Uses ==
Air-conditioning engineers broadly divide air conditioning applications into ''comfort'' and ''process'' applications.

=== Comfort applications ===
[[File:ACFujitsu2.jpg|thumb|An array of air conditioners outside a commercial office building]]
Comfort applications aim to provide a [[Building science|building indoor environment]] that remains relatively constant despite changes in external weather conditions or in internal heat loads.

Air conditioning makes [[deep plan]] buildings feasible, for otherwise they would have to be built narrower or with [[light well]]s so that inner spaces received sufficient outdoor air via [[natural ventilation]]. Air conditioning also allows buildings to be taller, since [[Wind gradient|wind speed]] increases significantly with altitude making natural ventilation impractical for very tall buildings.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Comfort applications are quite different for various building types and may be categorized as:
* Commercial buildings, which are built for commerce, including offices, malls, shopping centers, restaurants, etc.
* High-rise residential buildings, such as tall dormitories and apartment blocks
* Industrial spaces where thermal comfort of workers is desired
* Cars, aircraft, boats, which transport passenger or fresh goods
* Institutional buildings, which includes government buildings, hospitals, schools, etc.
* Low-rise residential buildings, including single-family houses, duplexes, and small apartment buildings
* Sports stadiums, such as the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/12/03/qatar.world.cup/ | work=CNN | title=Qatar promises air-conditioned World Cup | date=2010-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/12/101203_qatar_wt_sl.shtml |title=BBC World Service - News - Qatar 2022: How to build comfortable stadiums in a hot climate |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to buildings, air conditioning can be used for many types of transportation, including automobiles, buses and other land vehicles, trains, ships, aircraft, and spacecraft.

==== Domestic usage ====
[[File:AirConditioner3.jpg|thumb|Typical residential central air conditioners in North America]]
Air conditioning is common in the US, with 88% of new [[single-family homes]] constructed in 2011 including air conditioning, ranging from 99% in the [[Southern United States|South]] to 62% in the [[Western United States|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/highlights.html| title=Characteristics of New Housing|authors=US Census Bureau (MCD): Cheryl Cornish, Stephen Cooper, Salima Jenkins| work=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], air conditioning use varies by province. In 2013, 55% of Canadian households reported having an air conditioner, with high use in [[Manitoba]] (80%), [[Ontario]] (78%), [[Saskatchewan]] (67%), and [[Quebec]] (54%) and lower use in [[Prince Edward Island]] (23%), [[British Columbia]] (21%), and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/150310/dq150310a-eng.htm|title = Statistics Canada - Households and the Environment Survey, 2013|date = 2015-03-10|accessdate = 2015-05-11|website = The Daily - Households and the Environment Survey, 2013|publisher = Statistics Canada|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, home air conditioning is generally less common. [[Southern Europe]]an countries such as [[Greece]] have seen a wide proliferation of home air-conditioning units in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=819799&amp;lngDtrID=244| script-title=el:''"Χρυσές" δουλειές για τις εταιρείες κλιματιστικών έφερε το κύμα καύσωνα''| publisher=[[Lambrakis Press]]|location=[[Athens]]| date=2007-07-25| accessdate=2008-06-30| language=Greek}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another southern European country, [[Malta]], it is estimated that around 55% of households have an air conditioner installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nso.gov.mt/docs/HBS2008.pdf| accessdate=2011-07-14| title=STĦARRIĠ DWAR ID-DĦUL U L-INFIQ TAL-FAMILJA 2008 /HOUSEHOLD BUDGETARY SURVEY 2008| work=National Statistics Office, Maltz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In India AC sales have dropped by 40% {{clarify|date=May 2013}}&lt;!-- from when to when? --&gt; due to higher costs and stricter energy efficiency regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/High-prices-see-air-conditioners-sales-plunging-40-this-summer/articleshow/13659722.cms| title=High prices see air-conditioners' sales plunging 40% this summer|publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process applications ===
Process applications aim to provide a suitable environment for a process being carried out, regardless of internal heat and humidity loads and external weather conditions. It is the needs of the process that determine conditions, not human preference. Process applications include these:
* [[Chemistry|Chemical]] and [[Biology|biological]] [[laboratory|laboratories]]
* [[Cleanroom]]s for the production of [[integrated circuit]]s, [[pharmaceuticals]], and the like, in which very high levels of air cleanliness and control of temperature and humidity are required for the success of the process.
* [[Data center environmental control|Environmental control]] of [[data centers]]
* Facilities for breeding [[laboratory animal]]s. Since many animals normally reproduce only in [[Spring (season)|spring]], holding them in rooms in which conditions mirror those of spring all year can cause them to reproduce year-round.
* Food [[cooking]] and [[food processing|processing]] areas
* Hospital [[operating theatre]]s, in which air is filtered to high levels to reduce [[infection]] risk and the humidity controlled to limit patient dehydration. Although temperatures are often in the comfort range, some specialist procedures, such as [[Cardiac surgery|open heart surgery]], require low temperatures (about 18&amp;nbsp;°C, 64&amp;nbsp;°F) and others, such as [[neonatal]], relatively high temperatures (about 28&amp;nbsp;°C, 82&amp;nbsp;°F).
* [[Industrial ecology|Industrial environments]]
* [[Mining]]
* [[Nuclear power]] facilities
* Physical testing facilities
* Plants and farm growing areas
* [[Textile manufacturing]]

In both comfort and process applications, the objective may be to not only control temperature, but also [[humidity]], air quality, and air movement from space to space.

== Health effects ==

In hot weather, air conditioning can prevent [[heat stroke]], [[dehydration]] from excessive sweating and other problems related to [[hyperthermia]]. [[Heat wave]]s are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in developed countries. Air conditioning (including filtration, humidification, cooling and disinfection) can be used to provide a clean, safe, [[hypoallergenic]] atmosphere in hospital operating rooms and other environments where proper atmosphere is critical to patient safety and well-being.  It is sometimes recommended for home use by people with [[allergies]].

Poorly maintained water [[cooling tower]]s can promote the growth and spread of microorganisms,&lt;ref name="Negative Health Effects of Central AC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Negative Health Effects of Central AC|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/160205-negative-health-effects-of-central-air-conditioning/|publisher=livestrong.com|accessdate=21 February 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128044033/http://www.livestrong.com/article/160205-negative-health-effects-of-central-air-conditioning/|archivedate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'', the infectious agent responsible for [[Legionellosis|Legionnaires' disease]], or thermophilic [[actinomycetes]]. As long as the cooling tower is kept clean (usually by means of a chlorine treatment), these health hazards can be avoided or reduced. Excessive air conditioning can have a negative effect on skin, causing it to dry out, and can also cause [[dehydration]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Environmental impacts ==

=== Power consumption and efficiency ===
Innovation in air conditioning technologies continues, with much recent emphasis placed on energy efficiency. Production of the electricity used to operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gases.

Cylinder unloaders are a method of load control used mainly in commercial air conditioning systems. On a semi-[[hermetic seal|hermetic]] (or open) compressor, the heads can be fitted with unloaders which remove a portion of the load from the compressor so that it can run better when full cooling is not needed. Unloaders can be electrical or mechanical.

According to a 2015 government survey, 87% of the homes in the United States use air conditioning and 65% of those homes have central air conditioning. Most of the homes with central air conditioning have [[programmable thermostat]]s, but approximately two-thirds of the homes with central air do not use this feature to make their homes more energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32112 |title=One in eight U.S. homes uses a programmed thermostat with a central air conditioning unit |work=U.S. Energy Information Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |date=2017-07-19 |accessdate=2017-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower-energy alternatives===
Alternatives to continual air conditioning can be used with less energy, lower cost, and with less environmental impact.  These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/07/20/how-live-without-air-conditioning/4DqSdLtDiJ4iAn29lNCjaI/story.html
|title=How to live without air conditioning |date=21 July 2013 |author=Leon Neyfakh |work=[[The Boston Globe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In large commercial buildings, making windows able to be opened by occupants when the air outside is cool enough to be comfortable
* Setting thermostats to around {{convert|82|F}} and allowing workers to wear more climate-appropriate clothing, such as [[polo shirt]]s and [[Bermuda shorts]]. This approach has worked for the [[Cool Biz campaign]] in Japan.
* [[Passive cooling]] techniques, such as:
** [[Natural ventilation]] under and through buildings
** Operating windows to induce a [[stack effect]] breeze
** Letting in cool air at night and closing windows during the day
** Operating shades to reduce solar gain
** Building slightly underground, to take advantage of unpowered conduction and geothermal mass
** Placement of trees, architectural shades, windows (and using window coatings) to reduce [[solar gain]]
** [[Thermal insulation]] placed to prevent heat from entering
** Light-colored building materials reflect away more incoming [[infrared radiation]]
* Using a [[Fan (machine)|fan]] if the air is below body temperature
* [[Swamp cooler]]s in hot but dry weather
* Using a [[geothermal heat pump]] or [[ground-coupled heat exchanger]]
* Using naturally cooler basement rooms more
* Taking a [[siesta]] during the hottest part of the day
* Sleeping outside on a [[porch]] or [[roof]]

===Automobile power consumption===
In an automobile, the A/C system will use around 4 [[horsepower]] (3&amp;nbsp;kW) of the engine's [[power (physics)|power]], thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28960.pdf| title=Impact of Vehicle Air-Conditioning on Fuel Economy| publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory| accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refrigerants ===
The selection of the [[working fluids]] (refrigerants) has a significant impact not only on the performance of the air conditioners but on the environment as well. Most refrigerants used for air conditioning contribute to global warming, and many also [[ozone depletion|deplete the ozone layer]].&lt;ref name=CEPArefrigs&gt;{{cite web|title=Refrigerant Management Program Refrigerants Regulated |url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reftrack/reftrackrefrigerants.htm |publisher=Californial Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=22 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004073937/http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reftrack/reftrackrefrigerants.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CFCs, HCFCs, and HFCs are potent [[greenhouse gases]] when leaked to the atmosphere.

The use of [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] as a refrigerant was once common, including the refrigerants R-11 and R-12 (sold under the brand name ''Freon-12''). Freon refrigerants were commonly used during the 20th century in air conditioners due to their superior stability and safety properties. When they are released accidentally or deliberately, these chlorine-bearing refrigerants eventually reach the [[Earth's atmosphere|upper atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/chemfact/f_freon.txt |format=TXT |title=CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENT: FREON 113 (CAS NO. 76-13-1) : prepared by OFFICE OF POLLUTION PREVENTION AND TOXICS, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY |date=August 1994 |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the refrigerant reaches the [[stratosphere]], [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the [[Sun]] [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytically cleaves]] the chlorine-[[carbon]] [[Chemical bond|bond]], yielding a chlorine [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]. These chlorine radicals [[catalyst|catalyze]] the breakdown of [[ozone]] into [[diatomic]] [[oxygen]], depleting the [[ozone layer]] that shields the Earth's surface from strong UV radiation. Each chlorine radical remains active as a catalyst until it binds with another radical, forming a stable [[molecule]] and quenching the [[chain reaction]].

Prior to 1994, most automotive air conditioning systems used R-12 as a refrigerant. It was replaced with [[R-134a]] refrigerant, which has no [[ozone depletion potential]]. Old R-12 systems can be retrofitted to R-134a by a complete flush and filter/dryer replacement to remove the mineral oil, which is not compatible with R-134a.

[[Chlorodifluoromethane|R22]] (also known as HCFC-22) has a [[global warming potential]] about 1,800 times higher than [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter2.pdf |title=Chapter.2_FINAL.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was phased out for use in new equipment by 2010, and is to be completely discontinued by 2020. Although these gasses can be recycled when air conditioning units are disposed of, uncontrolled dumping and leaking can release gas directly into the atmosphere.

In the UK, the Ozone Regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/protecting-and-enhancing-our-urban-and-natural-environment-to-improve-public-health-and-wellbeing/supporting-pages/controlling-ozone-depleting-substances-and-fluorinated-greenhouse-gases |title=2010 to 2015 government policy: environmental quality |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2015-05-08 |accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; came into force in 2000 and banned the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.

The manufacture and use of CFCs has been banned or severely restricted due to concerns about ozone depletion (see also [[Montreal Protocol]]).&lt;ref name="sciencedaily"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm Sciencedaily.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406223118/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/07/030730080139.htm |date=April 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schlossberg |first=Tatiana |authorlink=Tatiana Schlossberg |date=August 9, 2016 |title=How Bad Is Your Air-Conditioner for the Planet? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/science/air-conditioner-global-warming.html |newspaper=NYT |location= |access-date=August 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In light of these environmental concerns, beginning on November 14, 1994, the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] Environmental Protection Agency has restricted the sale, possession and use of refrigerant to only licensed technicians, per rules under sections 608 and 609 of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/title6/608/608fact.html |title=Complying With The Section 608 Refrigerant Recycling Rule &amp;#124; Ozone Layer Protection - Regulatory Programs &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= 2015-04-21|accessdate=2015-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to conventional refrigerants, other gases, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[R-744]]), have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&amp;txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&amp;sortby=year%20DESC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514012832/http://www.r744.com/knowledge/papers_result_free.php?page_no=0&amp;txt_key_free=air%20conditioning&amp;sortby=year%20DESC |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-14 |title=The current status in Air Conditioning – papers &amp; presentations |publisher=R744.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; R-744 is being adopted as a refrigerant in Europe and Japan. It is an effective refrigerant with a [[global warming potential]] of 1, but it must use higher compression to produce an equivalent cooling effect.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1992, a non-governmental organization, Greenpeace, was spurred by corporate executive policies and requested that a European lab find substitute refrigerants.  This led to two alternatives, one a blend of propane (R290) and isobutane (R600a), and one of pure isobutane.&lt;ref name="ozone.unep.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ecomall.com"/&gt; Industry resisted change in Europe until 1993, and in the U.S. until 2011, despite some supportive steps in 2004 and 2008 (see Refrigerant Development above).&lt;ref name="epa.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/news-and-blogs/campaign-blog/greenfreeze-f-gas-victory-greener-refrigerato/blog/38405/| title=Greenfreeze F-Gas Victory!

'''Albert Charles Bartlett''' was an electrical engineer working for the [[General Electric Company]] in [[Wembley]].  He had some correspondence with [[Wilhelm Cauer]] on the subject of [[electronic filter|filter]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cauer, W. Mathis, and R. Pauli, "Life and Work of Wilhelm Cauer (1900–1945)", ''Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Symposium of Mathematical Theory of Networks and Systems (MTNS2000)'', p8, Perpignan, June, 2000. [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall03/cs323/links/cauer.pdf Retrieved online] 19 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

He published a treatment of geometrically symmetrical 2-port networks in 1927 and is responsible for [[Bartlett's bisection theorem]] which shows that any symmetrical network can be transformed into a symmetrical lattice network.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitold Belevitch|Belevitch, V]], "Summary of the History of Circuit Theory", ''Proceedings of the IRE'', '''vol 50''', p850, May, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also patented the idea of using the method of an active amplifier with "negative resistance" to cancel the inductance of a telephone line.

The '''Bernat Mill''', also known as '''Capron Mill''', and later '''Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company''', was a yarn mill in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States|USA]], that was for the most part destroyed by fire on July 21, 2007.

This mill complex at Uxbridge had been a hub of manufacturing for Bernat, once based in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]]. The town of Uxbridge was the site of Bernat's main manufacturing unit in the later 20th century. This was the third largest yarn mill in the U.S. The Bernat mill and the town of Uxbridge have a role in [[U.S. history]], and the history of the American [[Textile manufacturing]].

"Bernat" is a trademark of an existing company ([http://www.bernat.com Bernat.com]) which manufactures [[yarn]] products.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first manufacture of "[[satinet]]" was at this mill. Uxbridge became famous for its [[Cashmere wool]]. The period of the Capron Mill, and later as the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company was famous for manufacture of clothing and the manufacture of military uniforms for the United States.

==The Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company==
The mill was featured in the August 24, 1953 edition of ''[[Time Magazine]],'' in an article entitled, "The Pride of Uxbridge"&lt;ref name= "time"&gt;{{cite news|title= The Pride of Uxbridge (August 24, 1953) |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,818770,00.html |accessdate= 2007-09-24 | work=Time | date=1953-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the site of the ''Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company'', which was then one of the most successful [[textile mill]]s in [[New England]].&lt;ref name= "time"/&gt; The ''Time Magazine'' article interviewed the CEO of Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company, [[Harold Walter]]. This company had been started by Edward Bachman of New York City, and Harold Walters's father-in-law, Charles Arthur Root, of Uxbridge. This site was the hub of seven plants throughout the U.S., employing 6000 plus workers, and some of its wool synthetic blends dominated the women's fashion industry in the early 1950s.

The first woolen mill in the [[Blackstone Valley]] was built in Uxbridge in 1810 (3rd in US), and by 1953, the Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company was on the verge of a merger with the debt laden American Woolen Company to become the largest US woolen manufacturer. The Town of Uxbridge had become synonymous with [[woolen]] [[manufacturing]], "blended [[fabrics]]", complete [[vertical integration]] of [[textiles]] to [[clothing]], and [[textile industry]] efficiency [[innovations]], when production peaked in the early 1950s.

Research into textiles at Bachman Uxbridge Worsted Company produced a range of blended fabrics, including the "wool-nylon serge" used for army uniforms. The original [[U.S. Air Force]] Uniform produced at the factory was dubbed and patented "Uxbridge Blue" or "Uxbridge 1683", after blue dye color selected at ''Bachman Uxbridge''. This dye was used in the manufacture of uniforms from 1947.&lt;ref name = "uniforms"&gt;{{cite web |title= Getting the Blues, by Tech. Sgt.

"In January 1948 President Truman approved authorization of the proposed new blue Air Force uniform and a week after that Air Force Chief of Staff Hoyt Vandenberg officially circulated word that funding had been approved by the congressional appropriations committee. The new uniform, incorporating a shade of blue fabric (patented as 'Uxbridge Blue' and based on "Uxbridge 1683 Blue, cable shade 84", developed at the former Bachman-Uxbridge Worsted Company) would be available for distribution by September 1950".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authorsden.com/categories/article_top.asp?catid=73&amp;id=52282 Of Uniform Concern: A Casual History of the USAF 'Blue Suit' By Kalikiano Kalei]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
“Shortly thereafter, on March 29, 1954, Time magazine reported; "American Woolen Co. will ask its stockholders to approve a merger with Bachmann Uxbridge Worsted Corp. As a combined operation, troubled American Woolen (1953 sales, $73,494,160; net loss, $9,476,981) and Bachmann Uxbridge (1953 sales, $52,609,000; profit, $272,000) would be by far the biggest woolen manufacturer in the country. Textron, Inc., which wants American Woolen to merge with it, and claims to own almost 4% of American Woolen's stock, plans to fight the merger," see TIME CLOCK - TIME”&lt;ref&gt;[http://aminports3.blogspot.com/2008/01/hall-e-portraits-of-root-family.html Three Portraits of the Root Family, by Ellery Hall]&lt;/ref&gt;

The merger of American Woolen and Bachman Uxbridge was however blocked by [[Textron]], which emerged in the 1960s as a [[Providence, RI]] based conglomerate. This was Bachman Uxbridge’s last bid to be the largest woolen company in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gw-nLbBRh8oC&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;ots=YfkodCSHei&amp;dq=Did%20American%20Woolen%20Merge%20with%20Textron%2C%20or%20Bachman%20Uxbridge%3F&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Rise and Fall of the Conglomerate Kings |publisher=Google Books |author=Robert Sobel |year=1999 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964 the assets of Bachman Uxbridge were sold to Bernat Yarn of [[Jamaica Plain, MA]]

[[American Civil War]] uniforms, [[World War I]] Khaki overcoats, and [[World War II]] [[U.S. Army]] uniforms have all been manufactured in this mill.&lt;ref name = "walking"/&gt; Latch hook yarn kits were developed by ''Bernat'', here circa 1968 and the name of the mill changes to the Bernat Mill, then the third largest U.S. yarn mill.

Early, on the Saturday morning of July 21, 2007, a fire erupted at the historic mill, devastating the complex on Mendon and Depot Street. 600 firefighters from 66 communities battled the blaze, but the complex was nearly totally destroyed. It took three days to extinguish the flames fully. At the time of the fire, the {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}} structure, had ceased operating as a mill and had been converted into space containing 65 small businesses.&lt;ref name= "fire"&gt;{{cite news |title= Fire ravages old Uxbridge mill, by John Guilfoil (July 22, 2007) |publisher= The Boston Globe |url= http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/07/22/fire_ravages_old_uxbridge_mill/ |accessdate= 2007-09-24 | date=2007-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business losses following the fire were estimated in the millions of dollars and between 300-500 people lost their jobs.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Betamovie''' is the brand name for a range of consumer grade [[camcorder]]s developed by [[Sony]] for the [[Betamax]] format. By "camcorder" is understood a single unit comprising a video camera and a video recorder.

Betamovie records analog video on a standard Betamax cassette.

A range of models was manufactured for the [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]] formats. The first model, BMC-100P (PAL) and BMC-110 (NTSC) was released in 1983 making it the first commercial consumer grade camcorder.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalrewind.org/cameras/C_BMC1.htm|title=Total Rewind|website=www.totalrewind.org|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; While only standard beta units were available in PAL, several SuperBeta models were produced for the NTSC format.

Due to constructional limitations, the Betamovie has no playback function. It is only capable of recording. This limitation in combination with the decline of the Betamax format in the late 1980s, caused Sony to abandon the Betamovie - line just a few years after its initial release in favor of its newly developed [[Video8]] format.

==History==
As far back as the 1960s, cameras were available for the reel-to-reel portable VTRs of that time. These cameras were similar in size and weight to the [[Movie camera|cine-cameras]] of the day. They generally used a single [[video camera tube]]. However, these systems  were not in common use by ordinary consumers.

After the introduction of VHS and Betamax formats, in the mid 1970s, [[videocassette recorder]]s (VCR) started gaining mass market traction. Thus, in 1982, 10% of UK households owned a VCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/4446012.stm|title=Thatcher years in graphics|date=2005-11-18|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two-piece camera/VCR systems emerged around 1980. These units included a portable VCR, which the user would carry by a shoulder strap, and a separate camera, which was connected to the VCR by a special cable. These systems were cumbersome and heavy by today's standards. For example, the portable VCR, Sony SL-3000, from 1980 weighed around 9&amp;nbsp;kg. without the battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palsite.com/3000spec.html|title=Betamax PALsite: SL-3000 : Specifications|website=www.palsite.com|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying camera (e.g. HVC-2000P) would weigh around 3&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sps-wagner.de/projekte.html|title=Die Wagners Stephans Projekte|last=Wagner|first=Stephan|website=www.sps-wagner.de|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the complete setup could easily weigh in excess of 13&amp;nbsp;kg.

In order to be more appealing to the typical consumer wanting a practical device for recording home movies, a more compact and preferably one-piece device was needed. The world's first such device, the Betamovie BMC-100/110 was released in 1983 by Sony. Although the term was not in common use at that time, such a device would later become known as a camcorder, a single unit comprising a video camera and a video recorder. BMC-100/110 weighed just 2,5&amp;nbsp;kg. and was a much less cumbersome solution than its predecessors. The whole device could be supported on a user's shoulder. In order to achieve such weight and size reductions, several key components had to be miniaturized. One major requirement for a one-piece camcorder was miniaturizing the recording head drum. Sony's solution to this involved recording a non-standard video signal which would become standard only when played back on full-sized VCRs. A side effect of this was that Betamovie camcorders were record-only. Keeping in mind that instant playback is one of the main advantages of video cameras over [[Movie camera|cine-cameras]], lack of a playback function presented a considerable limitation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1984, JVC presented it own version of a camcorder, the [[JVC GR-C1|GR-C1]], for the [[VHS]] format. Although it too had a miniature head drum, the JVC engineers developed a different solution to drum miniaturization which made it possible to record a standard video signal on the tape. Thereby, the user of a VHS camcorder could review footage on location and copy it to another VCR for editing. Sony was unable to duplicate the functionality of the VHS camcorders. This disadvantage was a primary reason for the early loss of market share by the Betamovie.

Despite this development, Sony held on to the Betamovie for a couple of years more releasing some more advanced models, especially for the NTSC market. However, in 1987, Sony finally abandoned the Betamovie in favor of its newly developed [[Video8]] format.

== Technical overview ==
[[File:Drum and lacing mechanism of BMC-100P.jpg|thumb|Head drum and lacing mechanism of BMC-100P.]]
Betamovie uses the standard-size Betamax cassette, but the recording method is non-standard. The tape is wrapped 300° around a head drum nearly 45&amp;nbsp;mm. in diameter with a single dual-azimuth head to write the video tracks. Compared to the normal Betamax head drum of 75&amp;nbsp;mm, the Betamovie head drum spins at 2500 rpm rather than 1500 rpm. The fields on the tape are written at 120% the normal speed. As the head does not pass the tape at normal speed, the signal has to be electronically "time-compressed", before it is written.

When inserted into a standard Betamax VCR, the tape can be played back. However, the writing system employed in the Betamovie is not reversible. Therefore, playback within the camcorder is not feasible.

The early models have an optical viewfinder, which lets one see exactly what one is recording by looking directly through the lens, via a system of mirrors and prisms - similar to an SLR stills camera.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some of the later models have an electronic viewfinder. They are still record-only devices, though.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.betainfoguide.net/BTMpage.htm|title=The Betamovies Page!|website=www.betainfoguide.net|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the early models use a [[Video camera tube|cathode ray tube]] as their image sensor and the BMC-100/110 has manual focus. Later models use [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] image sensors and feature autofocus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.totalrewind.org/cameras/C_BMC5.htm|title=Total Rewind|website=www.totalrewind.org|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Betamovies for the PAL format record in standard Betamax video mode. Some of the models for the NTSC format can record in the enhanced SuperBeta mode or even the Super Hi-Band Beta mode.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Models==

=== BMC-100 and BMC-110 ===
[[File:Sony_Betamovie_BMC-100P_in_case.jpg|thumb|BMC-100P in carrying case.]]
Released in 1983. The first model and the world's first consumer grade camcorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; BMC-100 is the PAL model and BMC-110 is the NTSC model.

The camera uses a [[Video camera tube|cathode ray tube]] as its image sensor. It features 6X power zoom, manual focus, and an optical viewfinder. It requires 35 [[Lux]] to operate. The BMC-110 only records in BII.

=== BMC-200 and BMC-220 ===
This camera features auto-focus. Apart from this, it is identical to the first model.

=== BMC-500 and BMC-550 ===
[[File:Videocamera_a_batteria,_Betamax,_portatile_-_Museo_scienza_tecnologia_Milano_09695.jpg|thumb|Sony BMC-500.]]
Released in 1985. A substantial redesign. This camera uses a CCD sensor and features time and date settings. BMC-500 is the last PAL Betamovie.

=== GSC-1 ===
Released in 1985. NTSC model. This is an industrial/professional camcorder. It is similar to BMC-660. However, like BMC-1000, it features an [[electronic viewfinder]].

=== BMC-660 ===
Released in 1986. NTSC model. This camera records in SuperBeta mode, BII only.

=== BMC-1000 ===
Released in 1987. NTSC model. An upgraded model. Features an electronic viewfinder and records in SuperBeta BI and Super Hi-Band Beta BI. It is still a record-only unit.

== EDC-55 ED-Beta camcorder ==
EDC-55 became the final and most advanced iteration of camcorders for the Betamax format.

Actually, it does not belong to the Betamovie - lineup and is only mentioned in this article for the purpose of distinguishing it from the true Betamovie camcorders.

It is a semiprofessional/[[prosumer#Professional consumer|prosumer]] device that only records in the ED-Beta format, the final high-definition variant of the Betamax format. This camera produces over 550 lines of resolution, records in Hi-Fi stereo and features insert audio and video editing. Unlike the Betamovie camcorders, it can play back its own recordings. It was only released for the NTSC format.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Accessories==

=== AC Adapter/battery charger (AC-M100, AC-M110, BC-300) ===
[[File:Power_supply_and_battery_charger_for_Betamovie.jpg|thumb|AC Adapter AC-M100E.]]
The AC-M100/110 is a combined AC Adapter and charger for a single NP-11 rechargeable battery. The output voltage to the camera is 9,6 V, 1 [[Ampere|A]]. The battery is charged with 14 V, 1,2 A.

The principal difference between the M100 and M110 appears to be that the M100 can run on 110 - 240 V AC while the M110 can run on 100 - 240 V AC.

The BC-300 can charge three NP-11 batteries simultaneously.

=== Rechargeable battery (NP-11) ===
[[File:Videocamera_a_batteria,_Betamax,_portatile_-_Museo_scienza_tecnologia_Milano_09695_06.jpg|thumb|NP-11 battery.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4529">The '''Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau''' was created in September 1918 by an [[order in council]] as the '''Exhibits and Publicity Bureau''' and was renamed the Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau on April 1, 1923 . The body was under the administration of the federal [[Department of Trade and Commerce (1892-1969)|Department of Trade and Commerce]].

The CGMPB was the first national film production unit in the world and was intended to promote trade and industry. Its first success was the bi-weekly series, ''Living Canada'', which began production in 1919 and was distributed throughout the [[British Empire]] and in numerous foreign countries including the [[United States]].

Its purpose, according to the Minister of Trade and Commerce, was "advertising abroad Canada's scenic attractions, agricultural resources and industrial development" and much of its production was devoted to producing travelogues and industrial films. It also produced early Canadian documentaries such as ''[[Lest We Forget (1935 film)|Lest We Forget]]'' (1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McInnes|first1=Graham|title=One Man's Documentary: A Memoir of the Early Years of the National Film Board|date=2004|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|location=Winnipeg|isbn=0 88755 679 5|page=214|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=aONRGJP0YJ0C&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=lest+we+forget+1935&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=lest%20we%20forget%201935&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; a compilation film (using newsreel footage with staged sequences) recounting Canada's role in the [[First World War]], written, directed and edited by [[Frank Badgley]], the director of the Bureau from 1927 to 1941, and ''The Royal Visit'' (1939),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter|title=Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema 1895-1939|date=1978|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Monteal|isbn=0 7735 0323 4|page=273|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c08BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=embattled+shadows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=embattled%20shadows&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-written and edited by Badgley, which documented the [[1939 royal tour of Canada]] by [[King George VI]] and his consort, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]].

The Bureau's heyday was in the period from 1920 to 1931 when it had the largest and best equipped film studio in Canada and distributed its films throughout Canada and the [[British Empire]] as well as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Argentina, Chile, Japan, China and the United States. At its peak in 1927, the Bureau had more than one thousand prints circulating in the United States alone. The Bureau continued to produce silent films until 1934. As a result, several government departments began producing their own promotional films rather than relying on the CGMPB.

In 1938, responding to a report by Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom [[Vincent Massey]]  recommending an in-depth study of the governments production of promotional films and concerns about American domination of screentime in Canadian theatres, Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] commissioned British documentary film maker [[John Grierson]] to review the situation and make recommendations which became the basis of the ''National Film Act'' (1939) and the creation of the National Film Commission (later the [[National Film Board of Canada]]) which went on to absorb the CGMPB in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Peter|title=Embattled Shadows: A History of Canadian Cinema 1895-1939|date=1978|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Monteal|isbn=0 7735 0323 4|pages=133–137; 165–174|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c08BBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=embattled+shadows&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=embattled%20shadows&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9698">The '''Cartosat''' series of [[artificial satellite|satellites]] are a type of [[earth observation satellite]]s indigenously built by [[India]]. Up till now 8 Cartosat satellites have been launched by [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]]. The Cartosat series is a part of the [[Indian Remote Sensing Satellite|Indian Remote Sensing Programme]]. They were specifically launched for Earth’s resource management and monitoring.

==History==
The first Cartosat satellite was [[Cartosat-1]] which was launched by [[PSLV-C6]], on May 5, 2005 from the then newly built [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad|Second Launch Pad]] at [[Sriharikota]].&lt;ref name="Cartosat-1"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2005-05-05/news/27496736_1_pslv-polar-sun-synchronous-orbit-second-launch-pad |title= PSLV-C6 launched from Sriharikota |accessdate=18 September 2012 |date=5 May 2005 |work=The Economic Times |location=India}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department of Space]] (DOS), Government of India had earlier launched a series of satellites for Earth’s resource management and monitoring. These satellites had been very successful in providing data in various scales ranging from 1:1 Million to 1:12,500 scale.&lt;ref name=NRSC/&gt; Each of the [[Indian Remote Sensing satellite]] missions ensured data continuity while introducing improvements in the spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions. Considering increase demand for large scale and topographic mapping data DOS launched the Cartosat-1 in 2005.

==Cartosat-1==
{{Main|Cartosat-1}}
Cartosat-1 was launched by [[PSLV-C6]] on 5 May 2005 from [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre]]'s [[Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad|SLP]] at [[Sriharikota]].&lt;ref name="Cartosat-1"/&gt; Images from the satellite is available from [[GeoEye]] for worldwide distribution. The satellite covers the entire globe in 1867 orbits on a 126-day cycle.&lt;ref name= NRSC&gt;[http://www.nrsc.gov.in/#app=a097&amp;cd0b-selectedIndex=8 NRSC: Cartosat-1]&lt;/ref&gt; It carries two state-of-the-art [[panchromatic]] (PAN) cameras that take black and white stereoscopic pictures of the earth in the visible region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The two cameras with 2.5 m spatial resolution, acquire two images simultaneously, one forward looking (FORE)at +26 degrees and one aft of the satellite at -5 degrees for near instantaneous stereo data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.racurs.ru/?page=373|title=Racurs :: Resources :: Articles and Presentations :: Cartosat-1 Stereo Orthokit Data Evaluation|website=www.racurs.ru|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The time difference between the acquisitions of the same scene by the two cameras is about 52 seconds.&lt;ref name=NRSC/&gt;

A '''catapult''' is a [[ballistics|ballistic]] device used to launch a [[projectile]] a great distance without the aid of explosive devices—particularly various types of ancient and medieval [[siege engine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The art of the catapult: build Greek ballista, Roman onagers, English trebuchets, and more ancient artillery | last= Gurstelle|first= William|authorlink= William Gurstelle |year= 2004|publisher= Chicago Review Press | location =Chicago|isbn=978-1-55652-526-1 |oclc= 54529037}}&lt;/ref&gt; In use since ancient times, the catapult has proven to be one of the most effective mechanisms during warfare. In modern times the term can apply to devices ranging from a simple hand-held implement (also called a "[[slingshot]]") to a mechanism for [[Aircraft catapult|launching aircraft from a ship]].

The catapult and [[crossbow]] in Greece are closely intertwined. Primitive catapults were essentially "the product of relatively straightforward attempts to increase the range and penetrating power of missiles by strengthening the bow which propelled them".&lt;ref name = "Barton C. Hacker" /&gt; The historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC), described the invention of a mechanical arrow-firing catapult (''katapeltikon'') by a Greek task force in 399&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 14.42.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Duncan Campbell, p.3"&gt;
{{Harvnb

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The weapon was soon after employed against [[Sicilian Wars#The Second Sicilian War (410&amp;nbsp;BC–340&amp;nbsp;BC)|Motya]] (397&amp;nbsp;BC), a key [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] stronghold in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;Diod. Sic. 14.50.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duncan Campbell, p.8"&gt;{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | p = 8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Diodorus is assumed to have drawn his description from the highly rated{{Sfn | Marsden | 1969 | pp = 48f}} history of [[Philistus]], a contemporary of the events then. The introduction of crossbows however, can be dated further back: according to the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] (fl. 1st century AD), who referred to the now lost works of the 3rd-century BC engineer [[Ctesibius]], this weapon was inspired by an earlier foot-held crossbow, called the ''[[gastraphetes]]'', which could store more energy than the Greek bows.

A third Greek author, [[Biton (writer)|Biton]] (fl. 2nd century BC), whose reliability has been positively reevaluated by recent scholarship,&lt;ref name = "Duncan Campbell, p.3" /&gt;{{Sfn | Lewis | 1999}}{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} described two advanced forms of the ''gastraphetes'', which he credits to [[Zopyrus of Tarentum|Zopyros]], an engineer from [[Taranto|southern Italy]]. Zopyrus has been plausibly equated with a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] of that name who seems to have flourished in the late 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoreanism/ | first = Peter | last = Kingsley | title = Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic | publisher = Clarendon | place = Oxford | year = 1995 | pages = 150ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | Lewis established a lower date of no later than the mid-4th century.{{Sfn | Lewis | 1999 | p = 160}}  So did de Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L Sprague | last = de Camp | title = Master Gunner Apollonios | journal = [[Technology and Culture]] | volume = 2 | number = 3 | year = 1961 | pages = 240–4 (241) | doi=10.2307/3101024}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  He probably designed his bow-machines on the occasion of the sieges of [[Cumae]] and [[Milet]] between 421&amp;nbsp;BC and 401&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Biton 65.1–67.4, 61.12–65.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Duncan Campbell, p.5"&gt;{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | p = 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bows of these machines already featured a winched pull back system and could apparently throw two missiles at once.&lt;ref name="Duncan Campbell, p.8" /&gt;

Philo of Byzantium provides probably the most detailed account on the establishment of a theory of belopoietics (''belos'' = "projectile"; ''poietike'' = "(art) of making") circa 200&amp;nbsp;BC. The central principle to this theory was that "all parts of a catapult, including the weight or length of the projectile, were proportional to the size of the torsion springs". This kind of innovation is indicative of the increasing rate at which geometry and physics were being assimilated into military enterprises.&lt;ref name="Serafina Cuomo" /&gt;{{Page needed | date = December 2013}}

From the mid-4th century BC onwards, evidence of the Greek use of arrow-shooting machines becomes more dense and varied: arrow firing machines (''katapaltai'') are briefly mentioned by [[Aeneas Tacticus]] in his treatise on siegecraft written around 350&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Duncan Campbell, p.8"/&gt; An extant inscription from the [[Athens|Athenian]] arsenal, dated between 338 and 326&amp;nbsp;BC, lists a number of stored catapults with shooting bolts of varying size and springs of sinews.&lt;ref name = "Eric William Marsden, p.57"&gt;{{Harvnb | Marsden | 1969 | p = 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The later entry is particularly noteworthy as it constitutes the first clear evidence for the switch to [[torsion (mechanics)|torsion]] catapults which are more powerful than the flexible crossbows and came to dominate Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] artillery design thereafter.&lt;ref name = "Duncan Campbell, p.8ff"&gt;{{Harvnb | Campbell | 2003 | pp = 8ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This move to torsion springs was likely spurred by the engineers of Philip II of Macedonia.&lt;ref name= "Serafina Cuomo"/&gt;{{Page needed | date = December 2013}} Another Athenian inventory from 330 to 329&amp;nbsp;BC includes catapult bolts with heads and flights.&lt;ref name = "Eric William Marsden, p.57" /&gt; As the use of catapults became more commonplace, so did the training required to operate them. Many Greek children were instructed in catapult usage, as evidenced by "a 3rd Century B.C. inscription from the island of Ceos in the Cyclades [regulating] catapult shooting competitions for the young".&lt;ref name="Serafina Cuomo"/&gt; Arrow firing machines in action are reported from [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]'s siege of [[Perinth]] ([[Thrace]]) in 340&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name="Eric William Marsden, p.60"&gt;{{Harvnb | Marsden | 1969 | p = 60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, Greek fortifications began to feature high towers with shuttered windows in the top, which could have been used to house anti-personnel arrow shooters, as in [[Aigosthena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Josiah | last = Ober | title = Early Artillery Towers: Messenia, Boiotia, Attica, Megarid | journal = American Journal of Archaeology | volume = 91 | number = 4 | year = 1987 | pages = 569–604 (569) | doi=10.2307/505291}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Projectiles included both arrows and (later) stones that were sometimes lit on fire. [[Onomarchus]] of Phocis first used catapults on the battlefield against [[Philip II of Macedon]].{{Sfn | Ashley | 1998 | pp = 50, 446}}  Philip's son, [[Alexander the Great]], was the next commander in recorded history to make such use of catapults on the battlefield{{Sfn | Ashley | 1998 | p = 50}} as well as to use them during sieges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Skelton | first1 = Debra | first2 = Pamela | last2 = Dell | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O8TDQG6jiG4C&amp;pg=PA21 | title = Empire of Alexander the Great | place = New York | publisher = Facts on File | year = 2003 | ISBN = 978-0-8160-5564-7 | accessdate = January 31, 2013 | pages = 21, 26, 29 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171223060540/https://books.google.com/books?id=O8TDQG6jiG4C&amp;pg=PA21 | archivedate = December 23, 2017 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans started to use catapults as arms for their wars against [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Macedon, Sparta and Aetolia (3rd and 2nd centuries BC). The Roman machine known as an [[arcuballista]] was similar to a large crossbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Arcuballista | place = [[France|FR]] | url = http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=1&amp;partie=1&amp;numPage=400&amp;filtre=arbal%C3%A8te%20&amp;nomEntree=ARCUBALLISTA | language = French | title = Dictionnaire des antiquités grecques et romaines | trans-title = Dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities | publisher = Univ TLSE II | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081005121645/http://dagr.univ-tlse2.fr/sdx/dagr/feuilleter.xsp?tome=1&amp;partie=1&amp;numPage=400&amp;filtre=arbal%C3%A8te%20&amp;nomEntree=ARCUBALLISTA | archivedate = 2008-10-05 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bachrach | first = Bernard S | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Is2WQyLMKV4C&amp;pg=PA112 | title = Early Carolingian Warfare: Prelude to Empire | place = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 978-0-8122-3533-3 | accessdate = January 31, 2013 | pages = 110–12 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171223060540/https://books.google.com/books?id=Is2WQyLMKV4C&amp;pg=PA112 | archivedate = December 23, 2017 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Payne-Gallwey | first = Ralph | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xCDK0twV82MC&amp;pg=PA43 | title = The Crossbow: Its Military and Sporting History, Construction and Use | place = New York | publisher = Skyhorse | year = 2007 | ISBN = 978-1-60239-010-2 | accessdate = January 31, 2013 | pages = 43–44 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171223060540/https://books.google.com/books?id=xCDK0twV82MC&amp;pg=PA43 | archivedate = December 23, 2017 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the Romans used [[ballista]] catapults on their warships.

[[Ajatshatru]] is recorded in Jaina texts as having used catapults in his campaign against the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavis]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|author=Singh, U.|date=2008|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9788131711200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC|page=272|accessdate=October 5, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703065417/http://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC|archivedate=July 3, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Uzziah]], who reigned in Judah until 750 BC, is documented as having overseen the construction of machines to "shoot great stones" in {{bibleverse-lb|2|Chronicles|26:15|HE}}.

== Medieval catapults ==
[[File:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|Replica of a [[Petraria Arcatinus]]]]

[[File:Catapult 1 Mercato San Severino.jpg|thumb|Catapult 1 Mercato San Severino]]
[[Castle]]s and fortified [[walled cities]] were common during this period and catapults were used as [[siege weapon]]s against them. As well as their use in attempts to breach walls, [[Early thermal weapons|incendiary missiles]], or diseased carcasses or garbage could be catapulted over the walls.

Defensive techniques in the Middle Ages progressed to a point that rendered catapults largely ineffective. The Viking siege of Paris (885–6&amp;nbsp;A.D.) "saw the employment by both sides of virtually every instrument of siege craft known to the classical world, including a variety of catapults", to little effect, resulting in failure.&lt;ref name="Barton C. Hacker"&gt;{{Citation | last = Hacker | first = Barton C | jstor = 3102042 | title = Greek Catapults and Catapult Technology: Science, Technology, and War in Ancient World}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely used catapults throughout the Middle Ages were as follows:&lt;ref name="Middle Ages"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm | title = Middle ages | contribution = Catapults | place = United Kingdom | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100924235615/http://middle-ages.org.uk/catapults.htm | archivedate = 2010-09-24 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Ballista]]: Ballistae were similar to giant crossbows and were designed to work through torsion. The projectiles were large arrows or darts made from wood with an iron tip. These arrows were then shot "along a flat trajectory" at a target. Ballistae were accurate, but lacked firepower compared with that of a mangonel or trebuchet. Because of their immobility, most ballistae were constructed on site following a siege assessment by the commanding military officer.&lt;ref name = "Middle Ages" /&gt;

; [[Springald]]: The springald's design resembles that of the ballista, being a crossbow powered by tension. The springald's frame was more compact, allowing for use inside tighter confines, such as the inside of a castle or tower, but compromising its power.&lt;ref name="Middle Ages" /&gt;

; [[Mangonel]]: This machine was designed to throw heavy projectiles from a "bowl-shaped bucket at the end of its arm". Mangonels were mostly used for “firing various missiles at fortresses, castles, and cities,” with a range of up to 1300 feet. These missiles included anything from stones to excrement to rotting carcasses. Mangonels were relatively simple to construct, and eventually wheels were added to increase mobility.&lt;ref name = "Middle Ages" /&gt;

; [[Onager (siege weapon)|Onager]]: Mangonels are also sometimes referred to as Onagers. Onager catapults initially launched projectiles from a sling, which was later changed to a "bowl-shaped bucket". The word ''Onager'' is derived from the Greek word ''onagros'' for "wild ass", referring to the "kicking motion and force"&lt;ref name = "Middle Ages"/&gt; that were recreated in the Mangonel's design. Historical records regarding onagers are scarce. The most detailed account of Mangonel use is from “Eric Marsden's translation of a text written by Ammianus Marcellius in the 4th Century AD” describing its construction and combat usage.&lt;ref name="catapults.info"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.catapults.info/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020601094938/http://www.catapults.info/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-06-01 |title=Catapults info }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MongolsBesiegingACityInTheMiddleEast13thCentury.jpg|thumb|left|Mongol warriors using trebuchet to besiege a city]]
; [[Trebuchet]]: Trebuchets were probably the most powerful catapult employed in the Middle Ages. The most commonly used ammunition were stones, but "darts and sharp wooden poles" could be substituted if necessary. The most effective kind of ammunition though involved fire, such as "firebrands, and deadly [[Greek Fire]]". Trebuchets came in two different designs: Traction, which were powered by people, or Counterpoise, where the people were replaced with "a weight on the short end".&lt;ref name= "Middle Ages"/&gt;  The most famous historical account of trebuchet use dates back to the siege of [[Stirling Castle]] in 1304, when the army of Edward I constructed a giant trebuchet known as [[Warwolf]], which then proceeded to "level a section of [castle] wall, successfully concluding the siege".&lt;ref name="catapults.info" /&gt;

; [[Trebuchet|Couillard]]: A simplified trebuchet, where the trebuchet's single counterweight is split, swinging on either side of a central support post.

; Leonardo da Vinci's catapult: [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought to improve the efficiency and range of earlier designs. His design incorporated a large wooden [[leaf spring]] as an [[:wikt:accumulator|accumulator]] to power the catapult.{{citation needed |date=February 2011}} Both ends of the bow are connected by a rope, similar to the design of a [[bow and arrow]]. The leaf spring was not used to pull the catapult armature directly, rather the rope was wound around a drum. The catapult armature was attached to this drum which would be turned until enough potential energy was stored in the deformation of the spring. The drum would then be disengaged from the winding mechanism, and the catapult arm would snap around.{{citation needed | date = February 2011}} Though no records exist of this design being built during Leonardo's lifetime, contemporary enthusiasts have reconstructed it.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Modern use ==

=== Military ===
[[File:French grenade catapult.jpg|left|thumb|200px|French troops using a catapult to throw [[hand grenade]]s and other explosives during [[World War I]]]]
The last large scale military use of catapults was during the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]]. During the early stages of the war, catapults were used to throw [[hand grenade]]s across [[no man's land]] into enemy trenches. They were eventually replaced by small [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]].

In the 1840s the invention of [[vulcanized]] [[natural rubber|rubber]] allowed the making of small hand-held catapults, either improvised from Y-shaped sticks or manufactured for sale; both were popular with children and teenagers. These devices were also known as [[slingshots]] in the USA.

Special variants called [[aircraft catapult]]s are used to launch planes from land bases and sea carriers when the takeoff runway is too short for a powered takeoff or simply impractical to extend. Ships also use them to launch torpedoes and deploy bombs against submarines.{{dubious|date=June 2016}} Small catapults, referred to as "traps", are still widely used to launch [[clay target]]s into the air in the sport of [[clay pigeon shooting]].

=== Entertainment ===
In the 1990s and into the early 2000s, a powerful catapult, a trebuchet, was used by thrill-seekers first on private property and in 2001-2002 at Middlemoor Water Park, Somerset, England to experience being catapulted through the air for {{convert|100|ft|m|sp=us}}. The practice has been discontinued due a fatality at the Water Park. There had been an injury when the trebuchet was in use on private property.

Early [[launched roller coaster]]s used a catapult system powered by a diesel engine or a dropped weight to acquire their momentum,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzZHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|title=Coasters 101: An Engineer's Guide to Roller Coaster Design|last=Weisenberger|first=Nick|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781468013559|location=|pages=49–50|oclc=927712635|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223060540/https://books.google.com/books?id=OzZHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49|archivedate=2017-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Shuttle Loop]] installations between 1977-1978. The catapult system for roller coasters has been replaced by [[flywheel]]s and later [[linear motor]]s.

''[[Pumpkin chunking]]'' is another widely popularized use, in which people compete to see who can launch a pumpkin the farthest by mechanical means (although the world record is held by a pneumatic air cannon).

Typical chemicals used for acceleration today are [[calcium nitrate]] (Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[calcium formate]] (Ca(HCOO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sodium nitrate]] (NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

This ''de facto'' caution comes the fact that calcium chloride lowers the alkanity of cement-based concrete, which in turn increases the possibility of rebar corrosion. [[Thiocyanate]] compounds can also corrode reinforcing but are safe at recommended dosage levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Nmai |first1=Charles |last2=Corbo |first2=Jack |date=November 1, 1989 |title=Sodium Thiocyanate and Corrosion of Steel in Concrete and Mortar |magazine=Concrete International |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium compounds [[Alkali–silica reaction|might compromise]] the long term compressive strength&lt;ref name=VOLSET &gt;Volset, D.(2010): The Use of Antifreeze Agents. http://www.mapei.com/public/NO/linedocument/the_use_of_anti-freeze_agents.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; if used with alkali-reactive aggregates.&lt;ref name=KORHONEN /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Novel alternatives include cement based upon [[calcium sulphoaluminate]] (CSA), which sets within 20 minutes, and develops sufficient rapid strength that an airport [[runway]] can be repaired in a six hour window, and be able to withstand aircraft use at the end of that time, as well as in [[tunnel]]s and underground, where water and time limitations require extremely fast strength and setting.&lt;ref&gt;https://tunnelingonline.com/use-calcium-sulfoaluminate-rapid-setting-cement-underground-construction&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Corega'''|コレガ|Korega}} was a Japanese company established in 1996, and now is one brand (dividsion) of [[Allied Telesis|Allied Telesis K.K.]], that offers [[networking hardware]] products.

==Overview==
Originally, in 1996, Corega Inc. was established by [[Allied Telesis|Allied Telesis K.K.]], headquartered in [[Yokohama]], [[Kanagawa]] [[Japan]], for offering networking hardware products for [[consumer market]] and [[small business]]. 
The company (division) is basically [[fabless]], designing the products, ordering them to the manufactures in Japan, [[Taiwan]] and [[China]] etc., as Allied Telesis does.
The company (division) offers [[networking hardware]] products, [[Router (computing)|network router]], [[network switch]] and [[wireless router]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internet.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1006599.html|title=Corega Wireless Router and Other Products|publisher=Impress (Japanese)|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Corega products are sold and installed mostly in [[Japanese domestic market]], but we can find several products at some [[online shopping]], [[Amazon.com]] etc..
The business type and scope is same as Green House, [[Elecom]], and  [[Melco|Buffalo]], these are also the companies mostly for consumer market and small business in Japan.

In 2009, Allied Telesis K.K. acquired Corega Inc, then it started as one brand (division) in Allied Telesis K.K., as Allied Telesis group restructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbbit.jp/article/cont1/16557|title=Allied Telesis Acquisition Corega|publisher=Softbank Business+IT (Japanese)|date=|accessdate=2017-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:13.PeaceCorps.45thSFF.WDC.10July2011 (5926626586) (2).jpg|thumb|A bicycle-powered corn sheller in operation]]
A '''corn sheller''' is a hand-held device or a piece of machinery to shell [[corn]] kernels of the cob for feeding to [[livestock]] or for other uses.

==History==
[[File:Égraineuse à maïs.jpg|thumb|A traditional corn sheller]]
[[File:VIEW OF 'TRIUMPH' CORN SHELLER (C. O. Bartlett and Snow Co., Cleveland), LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT, USED TO REMOVE CORN KENNELS FROM THE COB. Photographer- Louise Taft Cawood, July HAER OHIO,18-VAVI,2-8.tif|thumb|A large corn shelling machine]]
The modern corn sheller is commonly attributed to Lester E. Denison from Middlesex County, Connecticut. Denison was issued a patent on August 12, 1839, for a freestanding, hand-operated machine that removed individual kernels of corn by pulling the cob through a series of metal-toothed cylinders which stripped the kernels off the cob.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornsheller.net/ cornsheller.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, other patents were granted for similar machines, sometimes having improvements over Denison's original design.

==Operation==
The operation of a corn sheller is similar to a [[threshing machine]], but with some differences to deal with larger grain size and other differences of corn compared to [[wheat]] and other crops. Corn shellers can be powered by a hand crank, a tractor, a stationary engine, or by an electric motor. Whole corn cobs are fed in. They are pulled between two toothed wheels, usually made of metal. Each wheel spins the opposite direction of the other. The teeth pull the kernals off the cob until there are no kernels left. The kernels fall out through a screen into a container (such as a bucket) placed underneath the machine. The cob is then ejected out, since it cannot pass through the screen. Some models have a "walker", similar to a threshing machine or combine, to take the cobs out.

The '''Department of Science and Technology''' (DST) is the [[Government of South Africa|South African government]] department responsible for scientific research, including [[space]] programmes. The current Minister is [[Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane]].

Much of the department's work is ultimately carried out through various quasi-independent agencies (although still usually government bodies) including: 
* the [[National Research Foundation of South Africa]], which receives a substantial proportion of the DST budget to carry out various research support tasks, including supporting key national research infrastructure ("National Research Facilities"), scientific research grant administration and a student grant scheme;
* the [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]], which acts as a quasi-privatised research and development agency with a specific focus on research of application to industry;
* the [[Technology Innovation Agency]], which serves to provide funding to turn innovative research into commercial products;
* the [[South African National Space Agency]], which covers space-related research and development initiatives;
* the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)]], which focuses its research on human health and disease.

A '''design change''' is the modification conducted to the [[product (business)|product]]. It can happen at any stage in the [[product development]] process.

The design changes that happen early in the [[design]] process are less expensive when compared to those that take place after it is introduced into full-scale production. The cost of the change increases with its development time. Fundamentally, the design changes can be classified into pre production and post production design changes. The pre-production changes can happen in the [[conceptual design]] stage, [[prototype]] stage, detailing stage, testing stage. The post -production stage change will happen almost immediately the product is introduced into the production. This might be due to several reasons such as [[market response]], [[design fault]]s uncovering, design mistakes, not meeting customer requirements, so on and so forth. One of the tools to minimize this type of design change is [[House of Quality]].

'''Electrochemical gas sensors''' are [[gas detectors]] that measure the concentration of a target [[gas]] by [[Redox|oxidizing]] or reducing the target gas at an [[electrode]] and measuring the resulting current.

==History==
Beginning his research in 1962, Mr. [[Naoyoshi Taguchi]] became the first person in the world to succeed in the development of a semiconductor device which could detect low concentrations of combustible and reducing gases when used with a simple electrical circuit. Devices based on this technology are often called "TGS" (Taguchi Gas Sensors).&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|3695848|Gas Detecting Device}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The sensors contain two or three electrodes, occasionally four, in contact with an [[electrolyte]]. The electrodes are typically fabricated by fixing a high surface area precious metal on to the porous [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] membrane. The working electrode contacts both the electrolyte and the ambient air to be monitored usually via a porous membrane. The electrolyte most commonly used is a [[mineral acid]], but organic electrolytes are also used for some sensors. The electrodes and housing are usually in a plastic housing which contains a gas entry hole for the gas and electrical contacts.

==Theory of operation==
The gas diffuses into the sensor, through the back of the porous membrane to the working electrode where it is oxidized or reduced. This [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] reaction results in an electric current that passes through the external circuit. In addition to measuring, amplifying and performing other signal processing functions, the external circuit maintains the voltage across the sensor between the working and counter electrodes for a two electrode sensor or between the working and reference electrodes for a three electrode cell. At the counter electrode an equal and opposite reaction occurs, such that if the working electrode is an oxidation, then the counter electrode is a reduction.

==Diffusion controlled response==
The magnitude of the current is controlled by how much of the target gas is oxidized at the working electrode. Sensors are usually designed so that the gas supply is limited by [[diffusion]] and thus the output from the sensor is [[linear]]ly proportional to the gas [[concentration]]. This linear output is one of the advantages of electrochemical sensors over other sensor technologies, (e.g. infrared), whose output must be linearized before they can be used. A linear output allows for more precise measurement of low concentrations and much simpler calibration (only baseline and one point are needed).

Diffusion control offers another advantage. Changing the diffusion barrier allows the sensor manufacturer to tailor the sensor to a particular target gas concentration range. In addition, since the diffusion barrier is primarily mechanical, the calibration of electrochemical sensors tends to be more stable over time and so electrochemical sensor based instruments require much less maintenance than some other detection technologies. In principle, the sensitivity can be calculated based on the diffusion properties of the gas path into the sensor, though experimental errors in the measurement of the diffusion properties make the calculation less accurate than calibrating with test gas.&lt;ref&gt;“Amperometric Gas Sensor Response Times,” P.R. Warburton, M.P. Pagano, R. Hoover, M. Logman, and K. Crytzer, Yi.J. Warburton; Anal. Chem., 70 (5), 998 -1006, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cross sensitivity==
For some gases such as [[ethylene oxide]], cross sensitivity can be a problem because ethylene oxide requires a very active working electrode [[Catalysis|catalyst]] and high operating potential for its oxidation. Therefore gases which are more easily oxidized such as [[alcohol]]s and [[carbon monoxide]] will also give a response. Cross sensitivity problems can be eliminated though through the use of a chemical filter, for example filters that allows the target gas to pass through unimpeded, but which reacts with and removes common interferences.

While electrochemical sensors offer many advantages, they are not suitable for every gas. Since the detection mechanism involves the oxidation or reduction of the gas, electrochemical sensors are usually only suitable for gases which are electrochemically active, though it is possible to detect electrochemically inert gases indirectly if the gas interacts with another species in the sensor that then produces a response.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pletcher, J. Evans, P.R. Warburton, T.K. Gibbs, US Patent 5,071,526, Dec. 10, 1991, “Acidic Gas Sensors and Method of Using the Same”&lt;/ref&gt; Sensors for carbon dioxide are an example of this approach and they have been commercially available for several years.

{{Banking |transfer}}

'''Electronic funds transfer''' (EFT) are electronic transfer of money from one [[bank account]] to another, either within a single [[financial institution]] or across multiple institutions, via [[computer]]-based systems, without the direct intervention of bank staff.

According to the United States [[Electronic Fund Transfer Act]] of 1978 it is ''a funds transfer initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer (including on-line banking) or magnetic tape for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit a consumer’s account. &lt;ref name="EFTA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/caletters/2008/0807/08-07_attachment.pdf |title=Electronic Fund Transfer Act |publisher=Federal Reserve Board |year=1978|website=www.federalreserve.gov |access-date=September 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

EFT transactions are known by a number of names across countries and different payment systems.  For example, in the United States, they may be referred to as "electronic [[Cheque|checks]]" or "e-checks". In the United Kingdom, the term "bank transfer" and "bank payment" are used, while in several other European countries "[[giro|giro transfer]]" is the common term.

== Types ==
EFTs include, but are not limited to: &lt;ref name="EFTA"/&gt;
* [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) transfers;
* [[direct deposit]] payment or withdrawals of funds initiated by the payer;
* [[direct debit]] payments for which a business debits the consumer's [[bank account]]s for payment for goods or services; 
* transfers initiated by telephone; 
* transfers resulting from [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card]] transactions, whether or not initiated through an [[payment terminal]].
* [[wire transfer]] via an international banking network such as [[SWIFT]];
* [[electronic bill payment]] in [[online banking]], which may be delivered by EFT or paper check;
* transactions involving [[Stored-value card|stored value]] of [[electronic money]], possibly in a [[private currency]];
* [[instant payment]].

[[Image:Sharav.gif|thumb|250px|Sharav Sluice Energy Tower]]

The '''energy tower''' is a device for producing [[electric power|electrical power]]. The brainchild of Dr. Phillip Carlson,{{Ref|Carlson}} expanded by Professor Dan Zaslavsky and Dr. Rami Guetta from the [[Technion]].{{Ref|ET-brochure}} Energy towers spray water on hot air at the top of the tower, making the cooled air fall through the tower and drive a turbine at the tower's bottom.

== Concept ==

An energy tower (also known as a downdraft energy tower, because the air flows down the tower) is a tall (1,000 meters) and wide (400 meters) hollow cylinder with a water spray system at the top. Pumps lift the water to the top of the tower and then spray the water inside the tower. Evaporation of water cools the hot, dry air hovering at the top. The cooled air, now denser than the outside warmer air, falls through the cylinder, spinning a turbine at the bottom. The turbine drives a generator which produces the electricity.

The greater the temperature difference between the air and water, the greater the energy efficiency. Therefore, downdraft energy towers should work best in a hot dry climate. Energy towers require large quantities of water. Salt water is acceptable, although care must be taken to prevent corrosion, so that [[desalination]] is an example to solve this problem.

The energy that is extracted from the air is ultimately derived from the sun, so this can be considered a form of [[solar power]]. Energy production continues at [[night]], because air retains some of the day's heat after dark. However, power generation by the energy tower is affected by the [[weather]]: it slows down each time the [[Surroundings (thermodynamics)|ambient]] [[humidity]] increases (such as during a [[rain]]storm), or the [[temperature]] falls.

A related approach is the [[solar updraft tower]], which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the heated air up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors. Land acquisition and collector construction costs for updraft towers must be compared to pumping infrastructure costs for downdraft collectors. Operationally, maintaining the collector structures for updraft towers must be compared to pumping costs and pump infrastructure maintenance.

== Cost/efficiency ==

Zaslavsky and other authors estimate that depending on the site and financing costs, energy could be produced in the range of 1-4 cents per kWh, well below alternative energy sources other than hydro. Pumping the water requires about 50% of the turbine's output. Zaslavsky claims that the Energy Tower would achieve up to 70-80% {{Ref|PhysicaPlus}} of the [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot limit]]. If the conversion efficiency turns out to be much lower, it is expected to have an adverse impact on projections made for cost of energy.

Projections made by Altmann{{Ref|Altmann}} and by Czisch{{Ref|Czisch}}{{Ref|Czisch_slides}} about conversion efficiency and about cost of energy (cents/kWh) are based only on model calculations{{Ref|Gutman}}, no data on a working pilot plant have ever been collected.

Actual measurements on the 50&amp;nbsp;kW [[Manzanares, Ciudad Real|Manzanares]] pilot solar updraft tower found a conversion efficiency of 0.53%, although [[Schlaich Bergermann &amp; Partner|SBP]] believe that this could be increased to 1.3% in a large and improved 100&amp;nbsp;MW unit.{{Ref|Mills}} This amounts to about 10% of the theoretical limit for the [[Carnot cycle#The Carnot cycle 2|Carnot cycle]]. It is important to note a significant difference between the up-draft and down-draft proposals. The usage of water as a working-medium dramatically increases the potential for thermal energy capture, and electrical generation, due to its specific heat capacity. While the design may have its problems (see next section) and the stated efficiency claims has yet to be demonstrated, it would be an error to extrapolate performance from one to the other simply because of similarities in the name.

== Potential problems ==

* In salty humid air corrosion rates can be very high. This concerns the tower and the turbines.{{Ref|Zwirn}}
* The technology requires a hot and arid climate. Such locations include the coast of [[West Africa]], [[Western Australia]], northern [[Chile]], [[Namibia]], the [[Red Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Gulf of California]]. Most of these regions are remote and thinly populated, and would require power to be [[HVDC|transported over long distances]] to where it is needed. Alternatively, such plants could provide captive power for nearby industrial uses such as [[desalination plant]]s, [[aluminium production]] via the [[Hall-Héroult process]], or to generate [[hydrogen]] for [[ammonia production]].
* Humidity as a result of plant operation may be an issue for nearby communities. A 400 meter diameter powerplant producing wind velocity of 22 meters per second, must add about 15 grams of water per kilogram of air processed. This is equal to 41 tons of water per second.&lt;ref&gt;Pluvinergy&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of humid air, this is 10 cubic kilometers of very humid air each hour. Thus, a community even 100 kilometers away may be unpleasantly affected.  
* Brine is a problem in proportion to the humidity created, since water's vapor pressure decreases with salinity, it is reasonable to expect at least as much brine as water in humidity. This means that a river of brine flows away from the powerplant at 41 tons (m3s-1) per second, along with a river of saline water flowing in with 82 tons of water per second (m3s-1).

Large industrial consumers often locate near cheap sources of electricity. However, many of these desert regions also lack necessary [[infrastructure]], increasing capital requirements and overall risk.

== Demonstration project ==

In 2014 Maryland-based Solar Wind Energy, Inc. proposed to build a {{convert|685|m}} tower. Wind speeds were expected to reach {{convert|80|kph}}. The company claims that a tower near [[San Luis, Arizona]] would produce up to 1,250 MW on sunny days and a yearly average of 435 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.solarwindenergytower.com/the-tower.html | title=About the Tower | accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company claims to have entitlements for a San Luis site and financing agreement (with JDF Capital Inc.) for up to US$1,585,000.{{ref|Giz1406}}

'''Fiberglass molding''' is a process in which [[fiberglass]] reinforced resin plastics are formed into useful shapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2Mivdh5_JwC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=Fiberglass+molding+is+a+process+in+which+fiberglass+reinforced+resin+plastics+molded.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEhLL2uN3XAhVF7GMKHav4DyUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Fiberglass%20molding%20is%20a%20process%20in%20which%20fiberglass%20reinforced%20resin%20plastics%20molded.&amp;f=false|title=The Fiberglass-Reinforced and Composite Plastics Industry: Guides to Pollution Prevention|last=Company|first=DIANE Publishing|date=March 1991|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781568060811|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process usually involves first making a mold and then using the mold to make the fiberglass component.

==Mold making==

The fiberglass mold process begins with an object known as the plug or buck. This is an exact representation of the object to be made.  The plug can be made from a variety of materials, usually certain types of foam.  

After the plug has been formed, it is sprayed with a mold [[release agent]]. The release agent will allow the mold to be separated from the plug once it is finished. The mold release agent is a special wax, and/or PVA ([[Polyvinyl alcohol]]). Polyvinyl alcohol, however, is said to have negative effects on the final mold's surface finish. 

Once the plug has its release agent applied, [[gelcoat]] is applied with a roller, brush or specially-designed spray gun. The gelcoat is pigmented resin, and gives the mold surface a harder, more durable finish.

Once the release agent and gelcoat are applied, layers of fiberglass and resin are laid-up onto the surface. The fiberglass used will typically be identical to that which will be used in the final product. 

In the laying-up process, a layer of fiberglass mat is applied, and resin is applied over it. A special roller is then used to remove air bubbles. Air bubbles, if left in the curing resin, would significantly reduce the strength of the finished mold. The [[fiberglass spray lay-up process]] is also used to produce molds, and can provide good filling of corners and cavities where a glass mat or weave may prove to be too stiff.

Once the final layers of fiberglass are applied to the mold, the resin is allowed to set up and [[Curing (chemistry)|cure]]. Wedges are then driven between the plug and the mold in order to separate the two. 

Advanced techniques such as [[Resin-transfer molding|resin transfer molding]] are also used.

==Making a component==
The component-making process involves building up a component on the fiberglass mold. The mold is a ''negative'' image of the component to be made, so the fiberglass will be applied inside the mold, rather than around it.

As in the mold-making process, release agent is first applied to the mold. Colored gelcoat is then applied. Layers of fiberglass are then applied, using the same procedure as before. Once completed and cured, the component is separated from the mold using wedges, compressed air or both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16409">A '''field-emission display''' ('''FED''') is a [[flat panel display]] technology that uses large-area [[field electron emission]] sources to provide electrons that strike colored [[phosphor]] to produce a color image. In a general sense, an FED consists of a matrix of [[cathode ray tube]]s, each tube producing a single sub-pixel, grouped in threes to form red-green-blue (RGB) [[pixel]]s. FEDs combine the advantages of CRTs, namely their high contrast levels and very fast response times, with the packaging advantages of [[LCD]] and other flat-panel technologies. They also offer the possibility of requiring less power, about half that of an LCD system.

[[Sony]] was the major proponent of the FED design and put considerable research and development effort into the system during the 2000s. Sony's FED efforts started winding down in 2009, as LCD became the dominant flat-panel technology.&lt;ref&gt;Serkan Toto, [http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/03/31/fed-sony-calls-it-quits-basically-burying-the-technology-as-a-whole/ "FED: Sony calls it quits, basically burying the technology as a whole"], ''CrunchGear'', 31 Mar 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, [[AU Optronics]] announced that it acquired essential FED assets from Sony and intends to continue development of the technology.&lt;ref name=AUO_FET/&gt; {{As of|2016}}, no large-scale commercial FED production has been undertaken.

FEDs are closely related to another developing display technology, the [[surface-conduction electron-emitter display]] (SED), differing primarily in details of the electron-emission system.

==Operation==
FED display operates like a conventional [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) with an [[electron gun]] that uses high voltage (10 kV) to accelerate electrons, which in turn excite the phosphors, but instead of a single electron gun, an FED display contains a grid of individual nanoscopic electron guns.

An FED screen is constructed by laying down a series of metal stripes onto a glass plate to form a series of cathode lines. [[Photolithography]] is used to lay down a series of rows of switching gates at right angles to the cathode lines, forming an addressable grid. At the intersection of each row and column a small patch of emitters is deposited, typically using methods developed from [[inkjet printer]]s. The metal grid is laid on top of the switching gates to complete the gun structure.&lt;ref name=eetimes2007/&gt;

A high voltage-gradient field is created between the emitters and a metal mesh suspended above them, pulling electrons from the tips of the emitters. This is a highly non-linear process, and small changes in voltage will quickly cause the number of emitted electrons to saturate. The grid can be individually addressed, but only the emitters located at the crossing points of the powered cathode, gate lines will have enough power to produce a visible spot, and any power leaks to surrounding elements will not be visible.&lt;ref name=eetimes2007&gt;
Richard Fink, [http://www.eetasia.com/ARTICLES/2007AUG/PDF/EEOL_2007AUG16_OPT_TA.pdf "A closer look at SED, FED technologies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616183341/http://www.eetasia.com/ARTICLES/2007AUG/PDF/EEOL_2007AUG16_OPT_TA.pdf |date=2011-06-16 }}, ''EE Tines-Asia'', August 16–31, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The non-linearity of the process allows avoidance of [[active matrix addressing]] schemes &amp;ndash; once the pixel lights up, it will naturally glow. Non-linearity also means that the brightness of the sub-pixel is [[pulse-width modulation|pulse-width modulated]] to control the number of electrons being produced,&lt;ref name=eetimes2007/&gt; like in [[plasma displays]].

The grid voltage sends the electrons flowing into the open area between the emitters at the back and the screen at the front of the display, where a second accelerating voltage additionally accelerates them towards the screen, giving them enough energy to light the phosphors. Since the electrons from any single emitter are fired toward a single sub-pixel, the scanning electromagnets are not needed.&lt;ref name=eetimes2007/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
Just like any other displays with individually addressable sub-pixels, FED displays can potentially suffer from manufacturing problems that will result in [[dead pixel]]s. However, the emitters are so small that many "guns" can power a sub-pixel, the screen can be examined for dead emitters and pixel brightness corrected by increasing the pulse width to make up for the loss through increased emissions from the other emitters feeding the same pixel.
# The efficiency of the field emitters is based on the extremely small radii of the tips, but this small size renders the cathodes susceptible to damage by ion impact. The ions are produced by the high voltages interacting with residual gas molecules inside the device.
# FED display requires a vacuum to operate, so the display tube has to be sealed and mechanically robust. However, since the distance between the emitters and phosphors is quite small, generally a few millimeters, the screen can be mechanically reinforced by placing spacer strips or posts between the front and back face of the tube.&lt;ref name=eetimes2007/&gt;
# FEDs require high vacuum levels, which are difficult to attain: the vacuum suitable for conventional CRTs and vacuum tubes is not sufficient for long-term FED operation. Intense electron bombardment of the phosphor layer will also release gas during use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharp-world.com/sc/library/lcd_e/s2_6_3e.htm Light emitting principle of an FED system] by [[Sharp Corporation|SHARP]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616161055/http://sharp-world.com/sc/library/lcd_e/s2_6_3e.htm |date=June 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competing technologies==
{{cleanup|section|date=June 2010}}

===Cathode ray tube===
FEDs eliminate much of the electrical complexity of [[cathode ray tube]]s, including the heated filaments in the [[electron gun]] used to generate electrons and the electromagnets in the [[deflection yoke]]s used to steer the beam, and are thus much more power efficient than a CRT of similar size. However, FED displays are technically worse than CRTs, as they are not capable of [[Multisync monitor|multiscanning]].

===LCD===
Flat-panel LCDs use a bright light source and filter out half of the light with a polarizer, and then filter most of the light to produce red, green and blue (RGB) sources for the sub-pixels. That means that, at best, only 1/6 (or less in practice) of the light being generated at the back of the panel reaches the screen. In most cases the LCD itself then filters out additional light in order to change the brightness of the sub-pixels and produce a color gamut. So in spite of using extremely efficient light sources like [[cold-cathode]] [[fluorescent lamp]]s or high-power white [[LED]]s, the overall efficiency of an LCD is not very high. Although the lighting process used in the FED is less efficient, only lit sub-pixels require power, which means that FEDs are more efficient than LCDs. [[Sony]]'s 36" FED prototypes have been shown drawing only 14 W when displaying brightly lit scenes, whereas a conventional LCD screen of similar size would normally draw well over 100 W.

Avoiding the need for a backlighting system and [[thin-film transistor]] active matrix also greatly reduces the complexity of the set as a whole, while also reducing its front-to-back thickness. While an FED has two sheets of glass instead of the one in an LCD, the overall weight is likely to be less than of a similarly sized LCD.&lt;ref name=FED&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; FEDs are also claimed to be cheaper to manufacture, as they have fewer total components and processes involved. However, they are not easy devices to manufacture as a reliable commercial device, and considerable production difficulties have been encountered. This led to a race with two other front-running technologies aiming to replace LCDs in television use, the [[active-matrix OLED]] and [[surface-conduction electron-emitter display]] (SED).

===OLED===
[[Organic light-emitting diode]]s (OLED) cells directly emit light. Therefore, OLEDs require no separate light source and are highly efficient in terms of light output. They offer the same high contrast levels and fast response times that FED offers. OLEDs are a serious competitor to FEDs, but suffer from the same sorts of problems bringing them to mass production.

===SED===
SEDs are very similar to FEDs, the primary difference between the two technologies is that SED uses a single emitter for each column instead of the individual spots of the FED. Whereas an FED uses electrons emitted directly toward the front of the screen, the SED uses electrons that are emitted from the vicinity of a small "gap" in a surface-conducting track laid down parallel to the plane of the panel, and extracted sideways to their original direction of motion. SED uses an emitter array based on [[palladium oxide]] laid down by an [[inkjet]] or [[screen-printing|silk-screen process]].&lt;ref name=SED&gt;

==History==
The first concentrated effort to develop FED systems started in 1991 by Silicon Video Corporation, later Candescent Technologies. Their "ThinCRT" displays used metal emitters, originally built out of tiny [[molybdenum]] cones known as [[Spindt tip]]s. They suffered from erosion due to the high accelerating voltages. Attempts to lower accelerating voltages and find suitable phosphors that would work at lower power levels, as well as address the erosion problem through better materials, were unsuccessful.

Candescent pushed ahead with development in spite of problems, breaking ground on a new production facility in [[Silicon Valley]] in 1998, partnering with [[Sony]]. However the technology was not ready, and the company suspended equipment purchases in early 1999, citing "contamination issues".&lt;ref name=candescent1999&gt;Jerry Ascierto, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EKF/is_2259_45/ai_54249262 "Candescent Delays Plant, Replaces CEO"], ''Electronic News'', 1 March 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The plant was never completed, and after spending $600 million on development they filed for [[Chapter 11]] protection in June 2004, and sold all of their assets to [[Canon (company)|Canon]] that August.&lt;ref name=Candescent&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_June_23/ai_n6086079 "Candescent Technologies Files Chapter 11 and Announces a Sale of Its Assets"], ''Business Wire'', 23 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Another attempt to address the erosion issues was made by Advance Nanotech, a subsidiary of SI Diamond Technology of [[Austin, Texas]]. Advance Nanotech developed a doped diamond dust, whose sharp corners appeared to be an ideal emitter. However the development never panned out and was abandoned in 2003. Advance Nanotech then applied their efforts to the similar SED display, licensing their technology to Canon. When Canon brought in [[Toshiba]] to help developing the display, Advance Nanotech sued, but ultimately lost in their efforts to re-negotiate the contracts based on their claim that Canon transferred the technology to Toshiba.

Recent FED research focuses on [[carbon nanotube]]s (CNTs) as emitters. '''Nano-emissive display''' (NED) is Motorola's term for their carbon-nanotube-based FED technology. A prototype model was demonstrated in May 2005, but Motorola has now halted all FED-related development.

Futaba Corporation has been running a Spindt-type development program since 1990. They have produced prototypes of smaller FED systems for a number of years and demonstrated them at various trade shows, but like the Candescent efforts no large-screen production has been forthcoming. Development continues on a nanotube based version.

Sony, having abandoned their efforts with Candescent, licensed CNT technology from Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc.,&lt;ref name=carboninc&gt;[http://nanotechwire.com/news.asp?nid=4459 "Arrowhead Subsidiary, Unidym, to Merge with Carbon Nanotechnologies"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714153711/http://nanotechwire.com/news.asp?nid=4459 |date=2011-07-14 }}, ''nanotechwire'', 23 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Houston, Texas]], who were the public licensing agent for a number of technologies developed at [[Rice University]]'s Carbon Nanotechnology Laboratory. In 2007 they demonstrated an FED display at a trade show in Japan and claimed they would be introducing production models in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/displays/sony-to-debut-fed-in-2009-insists-on-confusing-consumers-with-yet-another-display-technology-250626.php "Sony to Debut FED In 2009, Insists on Confusing Consumers With Yet Another Display Technology"], ''Gizmodo'', 9 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; They later spun off their FED efforts to Field Emission Technologies Inc., which continued to aim for a 2009 release.&lt;ref&gt;Sumner Lemon, [http://www.macworld.com/article/60360/2007/10/fed.html "Sony spinoff plans high-end FED monitors for 2009"], IDG News Service, 4 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Their plans to start production at a former Pioneer factory in Kagoshima were delayed by financial issues in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher MacManus, [http://www.sonyinsider.com/2008/11/05/sony-delays-acquisition-of-fed-factory/ "Sony Delays Acquisition of FED Factory"], ''Sony Insider'', 5 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2009 Field Emission Technologies Inc. (FET) announced that it was closing down due to the inability to raise capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sony's Field Emission Technologies closing its doors |publisher=Engadget |url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2009/03/26/sonys-field-emission-technologies-closing-its-doors/ |accessdate=2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Taiwanese [[AU Optronics]] Corporation (AUO) announced that it had acquired assets from Sony's FET and FET Japan, including "patents, know-how, inventions, and relevant equipment related to FED technology and materials".&lt;ref name=AUO_FET&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20100121PD207.html|title=Login to DIGITIMES archive &amp; research|first=|last=DIGITIMES|date=|website=www.digitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei]] reported that AUO plans to start mass production of FED panels in the fourth quarter of 2011, however AUO commented that the technology is still in the research stage and there are no plans to begin mass production at this moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20101117PD210.html|title=Login to DIGITIMES archive &amp; research|first=|last=DIGITIMES|date=|website=www.digitimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''G. van der Lee Rope Factory''' ("Touwfabriek G. van der Lee") in [[Oudewater]] was the oldest family business in the Netherlands until it became part of the Hendrik Veder Group in 2013. Royal Tichelaar Makkum is now the country’s oldest family firm. Established around 1545 by Jan Pietersz. van der Lee, G. van der Lee is still one of the oldest companies in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fambizz.nl/nieuwe-top-13-oudste-familiebedrijven/ Nieuwe Top 13 oudste familiebedrijven] FamBizz, 4 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; De [[Koninklijke Tichelaar Makkum]]  .&lt;ref&gt;[http://nos.nl/artikel/492316-oudste-familiebedrijf-verkocht.html Oudste familiebedrijf verkocht] NOS, 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Since its founding in   1545, it has always been located in  Oudewater, and has always been owned and managed by direct descendants of rope maker Jan Pietersz. van der Lee. Jan Pietersz. van der Lee’s birth year, which is believed to be around 1545, serves as the factory’s founding year.

=== 1545-1860 ===

Jan Pietersz. van der Lee belonged to what you could call the upper class of Oudewater. He was the proprietor of most ropewalks of Oudewater as the Oudewater ledger of 1579 shows. Under the heading ‘Other income from ropewalk proprietors’ it reads:  
‘Received from Jan Pietersz., 15 five-cent pieces for ropewalks previously rented from the city’. 
The son of Jan Pietersz. (1580–1625), a rope maker too, was the first one to inherit the property from his father. After Jan Pietersz’s death, the family business was handed down to Heijndrick (1620–1697) and Gijsbert Heijndricksz. van der Lee (1645–1694). According to records dating back to 1694, they owned a ‘coarse-thread ropery and ropery house with right of way and right to spin on Agterstraat in Oudewater’.
Gijsbert Heijndricksz’s three sons Adrianus, Cornelis and Jan took over the company after his death. 
Jan Gijsbertsz’s oldest son was Gijsbert, but it was his brother Adrianus van der Lee (1721–1766) who continued the dynasty. Adrianus’ son Cornelis van der Lee (1753–1826) took charge of the business in 1787 with the purchase of ‘a ropewalk and farmland with shed and garden, located at the Bieze, with the garden wall leading to the Amsterdamse Veer in Oudewater’ from his uncle Gijsbert van der Lee.

=== 1860-1919 ===

From the 16th to the 19th century, the craft of rope making remained pretty much unchanged. There were many steps involved in rope making, and each of these steps was done by hand with the aid of simple tools. In the first half of the 19th century the Dutch shipbuilding industry was booming. Many businesses, including the roperies, benefited from this favourable environment.
In the 1860s, a change occurred with the gradual arrival of the industrial revolution which also affected the Van der Lee family. Although Adrianus van der Lee (1787–1856) called himself a manufacturer, he was in fact a traditional rope maker. It was his son Gijsbert (1819–1903) who pulled the business into the modern world.
In 1880, Gijsbert van der Lee made the brave decision to introduce steam engines into the rope production. He bought an elongated piece of land in the Hekendorp polder just outside Oudewater where the new steam ropery was to be built. 
In 1886, Gijsbert van der Lee, as stated in the permit issued by the Municipality of Hekendorp, commissioned the construction of a stone and iron building ‘with a kettle to melt the tar needed for tarring the ropes manufactured in the steam ropery’. This led to fierce protests from neighbours.
At the turn of the century, a mechanised spinning mill was built next to the steam ropery.
On 28 December 1903, the founder of the modern rope factory, Gijsbert van der Lee, died at the age of 84 at his villa ‘Klein Hekendorp’ opposite the factory on the IJsseldijk.
Gijsbert’s sons Adrianus and Cornelis Gijsbertus followed in their father’s footsteps and turned the ropery into a general partnership named G. van der Lee.

=== 1919-1938 ===

On 1 July 1919, Cornelis Gijsbertus left the company and G. van der Lee was passed on to his brother Adrianus (1854–1920) and his son Gijsbert (1883–1966).
After Adrianus van der Lee’s death on 13 May 1920, a difficult time started for Gijsbert van der Lee. As part owner of the company, he had to share authority with his three brothers Klaas, Jan and Piet, his sister Marretje, his brother-in-law Arie Beijen and his mother Christina Vriesman.
Gijsbert van der Lee bought out his family in 1936, on the condition that Gijsbert’s brother Piet Van der Lee became the director of the Old Ropery in Vlaardingen. During this period, the way business was done started to change and the first lorry was bought to transport the ropes.

=== 1960-2013 ===

In 1960, Wim van der Lee and his manager made old and new rope-making technologies meet. They designed large braiding machines that could manufacture heavy hawsers for the shipping and off-shore industries. The ropes for these hawsers were twisted on the old ropewalk.
The industry was faced with a major challenge in 1965 when the first synthetic yarn hit the markets which had many times the resistance of manila, and, additionally, is impervious. With developments in the synthetic industry taking place at breakneck speed, the family decided to buy into synthetic fibre, which meant closing their own spinning mill.
On 1 July 1984, Wim van der Lee’s daughter and son, Saskia and Gijsbert van der Lee, and their cousin Willem Hendrik Schreijgrond, the oldest son of Christina van der Lee, who is Wim van der Lee’s sister, were appointed as supervisory directors alongside Johan Joseph Breen.
Bernhard de Wit was appointed as director. By importing raw materials the family could now specialise. This change in production led to a new factory being built in 1993. Van der Lee’s product range, which is made using modern scutchers and braiding machines, now largely varies to include all kinds of ropes, yet the old craft still lives on at the G. van der Lee Rope Factory; hawsers for fisheries, water sport and replicas of VOC ships and the ropes are still twisted on the 350-metre long ropewalk.

=== 2013-present ===

The G. Van der Lee Rope Factory became part of the Hendrik Veder Group in 2013.

A '''grindometer''' is a device used to measure the particle size of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]s, typically [[ink]]s such as those used in printing, or paints.  It consists of a steel block with a channel of varying depth machined into it, starting at a convenient depth for the type of suspension to be measured, and becoming shallower until it ends flush with the block's surface.  The depth of the groove is marked off on a [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] scale next to it.  The suspension to be tested is poured into the deep end of the groove, and scraped towards the shallow end with a flat metal scraper.  At the point where the depth of the groove equals the largest particles in the suspension, irregularities (for example pinholes in an ink sample) will become visible.

The advantages of this method are that it uses a small sample and gives a very quick indication of the high end of the particle size distribution, allowing production processes to be followed in real time.

The following standards are relevant on conjunction with the use of grindometers: ASTM D 1210, ASTM D 1316, JIS K 5600-2-5, ISO 1524, EN ISO 1524, BS 3900-C6

[[Image:Indoor Outdoor Thermometer.jpg|thumb|Indoor-outdoor thermometer]]
An '''indoor–outdoor thermometer''' is a [[thermometer]] that simultaneously provides a measurement of the indoor and outdoor temperatures.  The outdoor part of the thermometer requires some kind of remote temperature sensing device.  Conventionally, this was done by extending the bulb of the thermometer to the remote site.  Modern instruments are more likely to use some form of electronic [[transducer]].

==Glass thermometer==
In an indoor–outdoor thermometer based on a conventional liquid-in-glass thermometer, the stem of the outdoor thermometer is connected to the bulb by a long, flexible or semi-rigid [[capillary action|capillary]].  The temperature scale is marked on the stem as usual.  However, the temperature that is actually measured is the temperature at the bulb.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambient corrections are difficult to achieve with this system and are not usually done. So it is not as accurate as a conventional precision thermometer.  Rather, it is typically used for low-cost applications such as private houses.  The main issue with accuracy is that if the bulb and the stem are at different levels, there is a change in reading due to the change in [[pressure head]].  A further problem is that changes in the ambient temperature of the indoor part of the device can cause a change in reading as well as the temperature of the outdoor part of the device.  This effect can be minimised by making the bulb large and the capillary a small diameter.  This ensures that changes in the outside temperature produce large changes in the column of liquid in the stem and will tend to swamp the smaller changes caused by the changes in the indoor temperature.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, pp. 128–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Common working liquids used are [[toluene]] and alcohol.  Both of these have large [[temperature coefficient]]s of expansion and do not freeze or boil in the temperature range of interest.&lt;ref&gt;McGee, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electronic types==
[[Image:Wireless indoor-outdoor thermometer.jpg|thumb|Wireless indoor-outdoor thermometer]]
The sensors can be any of the types used in electronic thermometers.  [[Thermistor]]s are common and semiconductor junctions can also be used.  Indoor-outdoor electronic thermometers are a frequent hobbyist project and are sometimes sold as kits.  Many indoor-outdoor thermometers on sale are wireless devices requiring no physical connection to the sensor placed outside.  In these cases the sensor needs to be battery-powered.&lt;ref&gt;Graf and Whalen, p. 150; Hawkins, p. 90; Lamb, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The primary purpose of the indoor-outdoor thermometer is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading.  They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance.&lt;ref&gt;Minsk, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Building maintenance engineers can use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building.  This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Curl, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.

[[File:Itaa-logo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Logo of the ITAA]]
The '''Information Technology Association of America''' ('''ITAA'''), formerly the '''Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO)''', was a leading [[industry trade group]] for [[information technology]] companies.  The Association's membership contained most of the world's major [[Information and communications technology]] (ICT) firms, accounting for over 90% of ICT goods and services sold in North America.

== History ==

Organizational meetings of what was initially called the Data Actuating Technical Association (DATA) began in 1960.  In 1961, the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations (ADAPSO) was founded, and formally incorporated in 1962.  Its first president was Romuald Slimak, who had worked on the [[UNIVAC I]].  Initially headquartered in Pennsylvania, ADAPSO moved to the Washington, DC area in 1978 to be closer to government policymakers and advocates.
ADAPSO was renamed ITAA in 1991.

In March 2007 ITAA President Phil Bond expressed his desire in merging ITAA with another high tech trade association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itaa.org/newsroom/vpoint.cfm?ID=49 |title=TechAmerica : Where the Future Begins |publisher=Itaa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423081736/http://www.itaa.org/newsroom/vpoint.cfm?ID=49 |archivedate=2009-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 17, 2008, ITAA announced that it had agreed to so-called "merger of equals" with the Government Electronics and Information Technology Association (GEIA), and that the combined association would retain the ITAA name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=212300435 |title=Groups Merge To Form Technology Association Of America |publisher=InformationWeek |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/1107/110707n1.htm|title=Hard times push IT associations to consider merger|first=Gautham|last=Nagesh|date=2007-11-07|work=[[Government Executive]]|accessdate=2011-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itaa.org/newsroom/headline.cfm?ID=2504 |title=TechAmerica : Where the Future Begins |publisher=Itaa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423081120/http://www.itaa.org/newsroom/headline.cfm?ID=2504 |archivedate=2009-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until earlier in the year GEIA had been an affiliate of EIA (a trade association formerly known as the [[Electronic Industries Alliance]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.org |title=Electronic Industries Alliance |publisher=EIA |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301055711/http://www.eia.org/ |archivedate=2010-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  EIA has been very financially successful, unlike ITAA.  GEIA is slated to share in the distribution over $50 million in assets resulting in the breakup of EIA . [The fall of EIA: What happened?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edn.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA6474661&amp;ref=nbsa |title=The fall of EIA: What happened? - 9/4/2007 - Electronic Business |publisher=Edn.com |date=2008-07-20 |accessdate=2010-03-04 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.org/news/pressreleases/2007-07-12.354.phtml |title=News |publisher=EIA |date=2007-07-12 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422191034/http://www.eia.org/news/pressreleases/2007-07-12.354.phtml |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 the ITAA merged with the CyberSecurity Industry Alliance and the Government Electronics Industry Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techamerica.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009 the ITAA merged with the [[AeA]] (formerly the American Electronics Association)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AeA and ITAA to merge|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2008/12/08/daily32.html|accessdate=Feb 3, 2013|newspaper=Washington Business Journal|date=Dec 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techamerica.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; to form [[TechAmerica]].  Hank Steininger was the last ITAA board chair prior to the merger.

== Surveys==
ITAA conducted surveys of CIOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/3703 |title=Annual CIO Survey from Information Technology Association of America |publisher=Govtech.com |date=2001-02-22 |accessdate=2010-03-04}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Real ID ==
ITAA  actively lobbied on behalf of the funding for the [[REAL ID Act|Real ID]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lipowicz |first=Alice |url=http://www.washingtontechnology.com/online/1_1/31487-1.html |title=ITAA to Congress: cut a check for Real ID now |publisher=Washington Technology |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720161231/http://www.washingtontechnology.com/online/1_1/31487-1.html |archivedate=2008-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have asserted that Real ID will turn state driver’s licenses into a national identity card and impose numerous new burdens on taxpayers, citizens, immigrants, and state governments – while doing nothing to protect against terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Jim Harper |url=http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042823.php |title=AOL, Red Hat, and Yahoo Support a U.S. National ID |publisher=Techliberation.com |date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725093647/http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042823.php |archivedate=2008-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, it is stirring intense opposition from many groups across the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realnightmare.org/ |title=Real Nightmare |publisher=Real Nightmare |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics have claimed that ITAA supports the national ID card because its member companies would benefit from financially from implementing the card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arrington |first=Michael |url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/09/28/conflicts-of-interest-why-do-microsoft-aol-yahoo-red-hat-and-others-support-a-national-id/ |title=Conflicts Of Interest: Why Do Microsoft, AOL, Yahoo, Red Hat And Others Support The National ID Card? |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2007-09-28 |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==

ITAA published a series of newsletters, beginning with ''ADAPSO News'' in the early 1960s.  Its last regular newsletter, the ''ITAA E-LETTER'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itaa.org/isec/pubs/ecurrent.cfm/ |title=TechAmerica : Where the Future Begins |publisher=Itaa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered issues of the networked economy, including information and telecommunications public policy, and the businesses of electronic commerce, Internet service and enhanced telecommunications service providers.  The ITAA E-LETTER was distributed free of charge by electronic mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itaa.org/newsroom/register.cfm?EventID=179 |title=TechAmerica : Where the Future Begins |publisher=Itaa.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423081204/http://www.itaa.org/newsroom/register.cfm?EventID=179 |archivedate=2009-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ADAPSO and ITAA publications included ''ADAPSO Agenda'' (''later ITAA Agenda''), ''Computer Services: Official Journal of the Association of Data Processing Service Organizations'', and ''Data''.

'''Kozma Terentyevich Soldatyonkov''' ({{lang-ru|Козьма Терентьевич Солдатёнков}}; 22 October 1818 in [[Moscow]], [[Russian Empire]] – 1 June 1901 in [[Kuntsevo]], Moscow, Russian Empire) was a Russian [[industrialist]], [[mecenate]], [[philanthropist]], [[art collector]] and a renowned [[publisher]].&lt;ref name="dic"&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/moscow/2930/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%91%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2 Солдатёнков, Кузьма Терентьевич] at Moscow.

In 1865 the Soldatyonkov Publishing house was launched. Among its seminal publications were the Complete Works by [[Vissarion Belinsky]] and [[Konstantin Kavelin]], ''Russian Fairytales'' by [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the translations of ''Allgemeine Weltgeschichte'' by [[Georg Weber (historian)|Georg Weber]], ''The American Commonwealth'' by [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' by [[Edward Gibbon]], ''The History of Scandinavian Literature'' by [[:sv:Frederik Winkel Horn|Frederik Horn]] (translated by [[Konstantin Balmont]]), ''[[A Short History of the English People]]'' by [[John Richard Green]] and ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' by [[Theodor Mommsen]], as well as 11 issues of the Economist's Library (edited by Mitrofan Shchepkin) featuring books by [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]], [[James Mill]] and others.&lt;ref name="Boss"&gt;Soloveyeva, A. The Moscow Mecenate. Boss magazine,  2009, No. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

A staunch [[Old Believer]], he supported the Moscow [[Belokrinitskaya Hierarchy]] and financed its leader Bishop Pafnuty (Ovchinnikov)'s visit to [[London]] where he had talks with [[Alexander Hertsen]], [[Nikolai Ogaryov]] and [[Vasily Kelsiyev]].&lt;ref name="dic"/&gt;

Soldatyonkov bequeathed his library (8 thousand books and 15 thousand journals) and art collection (258 paintings, including the best known works by [[Karl Bryullov]], [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov|Alexander Ivanov]], [[Vasily Perov]] and [[Pavel Fedotov]], as well as 17 sculptures) to the [[Rumyantsev Museum]]. After 1924 they were shared between the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Russian Museum]]. Part of Soldatyonkov's capital (2 million [[ruble]]s) went, according to his will, to the construction of the hospital for the poor, later to be known as the Botkin Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://botkina.ru/o-bolnice.htm Больница имени Боткина в Москве] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303012650/http://botkina.ru/o-bolnice.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}.

As the [[32-bit]] [[Intel]] Architecture became the dominant computing platform during the 1980s and 1990s, multiple companies have tried to build [[microprocessor]]s that are compatible with that Intel [[instruction set]] [[Computer architecture|architecture]]. Most of these companies were not successful in the mainstream computing market. So far, only [[AMD]] has had any market presence in the computing market for more than a couple of product generations. Cyrix was successful during the [[Intel 80386|386]] and [[Intel 80486|486]] generations of products, but did not do well after the [[Intel P5|Pentium]] was introduced.

List of former [[IA-32]] compatible [[microprocessor]] vendors:

==Progressed into surviving companies==
* [[Centaur Technology]] – originally subsidiary of [[Integrated Device Technology|IDT]], later acquired by [[VIA Technologies]], still producing compatible low-end devices for VIA
* [[Cyrix]] – acquired by [[National Semiconductor]], later acquired by [[VIA Technologies]], eventually shut down
* [[NexGen]] – bought by AMD to help develop the successful K6 device
* [[National Semiconductor]] – low-end 486 (designed in-house) never widely sold; first acquirer of Cyrix, later keeping only low-end [[IA-32]] devices targeted for consumer [[System-on-a-chip]]s, finally selling them to [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]

==Product discontinued/transformed==
* [[Harris Corporation]] – sold [[radiation hardening|rad-hard]] versions of 8086 and 80286; product line discontinued. Produced 20&amp;nbsp;MHz and 25&amp;nbsp;MHz 80286 cpus (some motherboards were equipped with cache RAM, which was unusual for a 286 class chip).
* [[NEC]] – sold early Intel 16-bit architecture compatibles such as [[NEC V20]] and [[NEC V30]]; product line transitioned to NEC internal architecture.
* [[Siemens]] – sold versions of 8086 and 80286; product line discontinued.

==Left the market or closed==
* [[Chips and Technologies]] – left market after failed 386 compatible chip failed to boot the Windows operating system
* [[IBM]] – Cyrix licensee and developer of Blue Lightning 486 line of processors, eventually left compatible chip market
* [[Rise Technology]] – after five years of working on the slow mP6 chip (released in 1998), the company closed a year later
* [[Texas Instruments]] and [[STMicroelectronics|SGS-Thomson]] – licensees of Cyrix designs, eventually left compatible chip market
* [[Transmeta]] – transitioned to an [[intellectual property]] company in 2005
* [[United Microelectronics Corporation]] and [[Meridian Semiconductor]] – got out of market after slow 486 compatible missed market window

==Incomplete/unsuccessful projects==
* [[Chromatic Research]] – [[mediaprocessor]] with x86 instruction set compatibility never completed
* [[Exponential Technology]] – [[BiCMOS]] compatible microprocessor never completed
* [[IIT Corp]] – 486 compatible project never completed{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
* [[MemoryLogix]] – multi-threaded CPU core and [[System on a chip|SOC]] for PCs never completed
* [[Metaflow Technologies]] – project never completed
* [[Montalvo Systems]] – asymmetric multiprocessor never completed 
* [[ULSI System Technology]] – never completed x86 SOC; company shut down after one of their employees was convicted for stealing [[Intel]] [[floating-point]] x87 design documents

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4525">A '''localized surface plasmon''' (LSP) is the result of the confinement of a [[surface plasmon]] in a [[nanoparticle]] of size comparable to or smaller than the wavelength of light used to excite the [[plasmon]]. The LSP has two important effects:  [[electric fields]] near the particle’s surface are greatly enhanced and the particle’s optical absorption has a maximum at the [[plasmon]] [[resonant frequency]]. The enhancement falls off quickly with distance from the surface and, for [[noble metal]] nanoparticles, the resonance occurs at visible wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rycenga | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Cobley | first2 = Claire M. | last3 = Zeng | first3 = Jie | last4 = Li | first4 = Weiyang | last5 = Moran | first5 = Christine H. | last6 = Zhang | first6 = Qiang | last7 = Qin | first7 = Dong | last8 = Xia | first8 = Younan | year = 2011 | title = Controlling the Synthesis and Assembly of Silver Nanostructures for Plasmonic Applications | url = | journal = Chem.

== Applications ==
The [[plasmon]] [[resonant frequency]] is highly sensitive to the [[refractive index]] of the environment; a change in [[refractive index]] results in a shift in the [[resonant frequency]]. As the resonant frequency is easy to measure, this allows LSP nanoparticles to be used for [[nanoscale]] sensing applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Kathryn M.|author2=Hafner, Jason H. |title=Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Sensors|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2011|volume=Plasmonics|issue=111|pages=3828–3857|doi=10.1021/cr100313v|pmid=21648956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanostructures exhibiting LSP resonances are used to enhance signals in modern [[analytical technique]]s based on [[spectroscopy]]. Other  applications that rely on efficient light to heat generation in the nanoscale are [[heat-assisted magnetic recording]] (HAMR) , [[Photothermal therapy#Gold NanoRods (AuNR)|photothermal cancer therapy]], and thermophotovoltaics. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ElKabbash|first=Mohamed, et. al.|date=2017|title=Tunable Black Gold: Controlling the Near-Field Coupling of Immobilized Au Nanoparticles Embedded in Mesoporous Silica Capsules|journal=Advanced Optical Materials|volume=5|issue=21|pages=1700617|doi=10.1002/adom.201700617}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, high efficiency applications using plasmonics have not been realized due to the high ohmic losses inside metals especially in the optical spectral range (visible and NIR). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Khurgin|first=Jacob|date=2015|title=How to deal with the loss in plasmonics and metamaterials|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nnano.2014.310|journal=Nature Nanotechnology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=2–6|via=|arxiv=1411.6577|bibcode=2015NatNa..10....2K|doi=10.1038/nnano.2014.310|pmid=25559961}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ElKabbash|first=Mohamed, et. al.|date=2017|title=Ultrafast transient optical loss dynamics in exciton–plasmon nano-assemblies|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2017/nr/c7nr01512g|journal=Nanoscale|volume=9|issue=19|pages=6558–6566|via=|doi=10.1039/c7nr01512g|pmid=28470299|hdl=11693/37238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mars trilogy''''' is a series of award-winning [[science fiction]] novels by [[Kim Stanley Robinson]] that chronicles the settlement and [[Terraforming of Mars|terraforming of the planet Mars]] through the intensely personal and detailed viewpoints of a wide variety of characters spanning almost two centuries. Ultimately more [[utopia]]n than [[dystopia]]n, the story focuses on [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], sociological, and scientific advances made on [[Mars]], while [[Earth]] suffers from [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and [[ecological disaster]].

The three novels are ''Red Mars'' (1992), ''Green Mars'' (1993), and ''Blue Mars'' (1996). ''The Martians'' (1999) is a collection of short stories set in the same [[fictional universe]]. The main trilogy won a number of prestigious awards.  ''[[Icehenge]]'' (1984), Robinson's first novel about Mars, is not set in this universe but deals with similar themes and plot elements. The trilogy shares some similarities with Robinson's more recent novel ''[[2312 (novel)|2312]]'' (2012), for instance, the terraforming of Mars and the extreme longevity of the characters in both novels.

''Red Mars'' starts in 2026 with the first colonial voyage to Mars aboard the ''Ares'', the largest interplanetary spacecraft ever built  and home to a crew who are to be the first hundred Martian colonists.  The ship was built from clustered [[Space Shuttle external tank|space shuttle external fuel tanks]] which, instead of reentering Earth's atmosphere, had been boosted into orbit until enough had been amassed to build the ship.  The mission is a joint American–Russian undertaking, and seventy of the First Hundred are drawn from these countries (except, for example, Michel Duval, a French psychologist assigned to observe their behavior). The book details the trip out, construction of the first settlement on Mars (eventually called Underhill) by Russian engineer Nadia Cherneshevsky, as well as establishing colonies on Mars' hollowed out asteroid-moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], the ever-changing relationships between the colonists, debates among the colonists regarding both the [[terraforming]] of the planet and its future relationship to Earth. The two extreme views on terraforming are personified by Saxifrage "Sax" Russell, who believes their very presence on the planet means some level of terraforming has already begun and that it is humanity's obligation to spread life as it is the most scarce thing in the known universe, and Ann Clayborne, who stakes out the position that humankind does not have the right to change entire planets at their will.

Russell's view is initially purely scientific but in time comes to blend with the views of Hiroko Ai, the chief of the Agricultural Team who assembles a new belief system (the "Areophany") devoted to the appreciation and furthering of life ("viriditas"); these views are collectively known as the "Green" position, while Clayborne's naturalist stance comes to be known as "Red."  The actual decision is left to the United Nations Organization Mars Authority (UNOMA), which greenlights terraforming, and a series of actions get underway, including the drilling of "[[mohole]]s" to release subsurface heat; thickening of the atmosphere according to a complicated bio-chemical formula that comes to be known as the "Russell cocktail" after Sax Russell; and the detonation of nuclear explosions deep in the sub-surface permafrost to release water. Additional steps are taken to connect Mars more closely with Earth, including the insertion of an Areosynchronous asteroid "[[4923 Clarke|Clarke]]" to which a [[space elevator]] cable is tethered.

Against the backdrop of this development is another debate, one whose principal instigator is Arkady Bogdanov of the Russian contingent (possibly named in homage to the Russian polymath and science fiction writer [[Alexander Bogdanov]] - it is later revealed in Blue Mars that Alexander Bogdanov is an ancestor of Arkady's.). Bogdanov argues that Mars need not and should not be subject to Earth traditions, limitations, or authority. He is to some extent joined in this position by John Boone, famous as the "First Man on Mars" from a preceding expedition and rival to Frank Chalmers, the technical leader of the American contingent. Their rivalry is further exacerbated by competing romantic interest in Maya Katarina Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent. (In the opening of the book, Chalmers instigates a sequence of events that leads to Boone being assassinated; much of what follows is a retrospective examination of what led to that point.)

[[Earth]] meanwhile increasingly falls under the control of [[transnational corporation]]s (transnats) that come to dominate its governments, particularly smaller nations adopted as "flags of convenience" for extending their influence into Martian affairs. As UNOMA's power erodes, the Mars treaty is renegotiated in a move led by Frank Chalmers; the outcome is impressive but proves short-lived as the transnats find ways around it through loop-holes. Things get worse as the nations of Earth start to clash over limited resources, expanding debt, and population growth as well as restrictions on access to a new longevity treatment developed by Martian science—one that holds the promise of lifespans into the hundreds of years. In 2061, with Boone dead and exploding immigration threatening the fabric of Martian society, Bogdanov launches a revolution against what many now view as occupying transnat troops operating only loosely under an UNOMA rubber-stamp approval. Initially successful, the revolution proves infeasible on the basis of both a greater-than-expected willingness of the Earth troops to use violence and the extreme vulnerability of life on a planet without a habitable atmosphere. A series of exchanges sees the cutting of the space elevator, bombardment of several Martian cities (including the city where Bogdanov is himself organizing the rebellion; he is killed), the destruction of Phobos and its military complex, and the unleashing of a great flood of torrential groundwater freed by nuclear detonations.

By the end, most of the First Hundred are dead, and virtually all who remain have fled to a hidden refuge established years earlier by Ai and her followers. (One exception is Phyllis Boyle, who has allied herself with the transnats; she is on Clarke when the space elevator cable is cut and sent flying out of orbit to a fate unknown by the conclusion of the book.) The revolution dies and life on Mars returns to a sense of stability under heavy transnat control. The clash over resources on Earth breaks out into a full-blown [[world war]] leaving hundreds of millions dead, but cease-fire arrangements are reached when the transnats flee to the safety of the developed nations, which use their huge militaries to restore order, forming [[Police state|police-states]]. But a new generation of humans born on Mars holds the promise of change. In the meantime, the remaining First Hundred —including Russell, Clayborne, Toitovna, and Cherneshevsky— settle into life in Ai's refuge called Zygote, hidden under the [[Planum Australe|Martian south pole]].

''Green Mars'' takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed plants to grow. It picks up the story 50 years after the events of ''Red Mars'' in the dawn of the 22nd century, following the lives of the remaining First Hundred and their children and grandchildren. Hiroko Ai's base under the south pole is attacked by UN Transitional Authority (UNTA) forces, and the survivors are forced to escape into a (less literal) underground organization known as the Demimonde. Among the expanded group are the First Hundred's children, the [[Nisei]], a number of whom live in Hiroko's second secret base, Gamete.

As unrest in the multinational control over Mars's affairs grows, various groups start to form with different aims and methods. Watching these groups evolve from Earth, the CEO of the Praxis Corporation sends a representative, Arthur Randolph, to organize the resistance movements. This culminates into the Dorsa Brevia agreement, in which nearly all the underground factions take part. Preparations are made for a second revolution beginning in the 2120s, from converting moholes to missiles silos or hidden bases, sabotaging orbital mirrors, to propelling Deimos out of Mars' gravity well and out into deep space so it could never be used as a weapons platform as Phobos was.

The book follows the characters across the Martian landscape, which is explained in detail. Russell's character infiltrates the transnat terraforming project, with a carefully crafted fake identity as Stephen Lindholm. The newly evolving Martian biosphere is described at great length and with more profound changes mostly aimed at warming up the surface of Mars to the brink of making it habitable, from continent-sized [[Space mirror (anti-global warming measure)|orbital mirrors]], another space elevator built (using another anchored asteroid that is dubbed "New Clarke"), to melting the northern polar ice cap, and digging moholes deep enough to form [[volcanoes]]. A mainstay of the novel is a detailed analysis of philosophical, political, personal, economic, and geological experiences of the characters. The story weaves back and forth from character to character, providing a picture of Mars as seen by them.

Stephen, alias Sax, eventually becomes romantically involved with Phyllis, who had survived the events of 2061 from the end of the first novel, but she discovers his true identity and has him arrested. Members of the underground launch a daring rescue from the prison facility where Sax suffers torture and interrogation that causes him to have a stroke; Maya kills Phyllis in the process of the rescue.

The book ends on a major event which is a sudden catastrophic rise in Earth's global sea levels not caused primarily by any [[greenhouse effect]] but by the eruption of a chain of [[volcano]]es underneath the ice of West [[Antarctica]], disintegrating the ice sheet and displacing the fragments into the ocean. The resultant flooding causes global chaos on Earth, creating the perfect moment for the  Martian underground to seize control of Martian society from Earth. Following a series of largely bloodless coups, an extremist faction of Reds bombs a dam near Burroughs, the major city where the remaining United Nations forces have concentrated, in order to force the security forces to evacuate. The entire city is flooded and the population of the city has to walk a staggeringly long distance in the open Martian atmosphere (which just barely has the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and gas mixture to support human life) to Lybia Station, in order to resettle in other locations. With this, control of Mars is finally wrested away from Earth with minimal loss of life, leaving the weary survivors hopeful about the prospects of their newfound political autonomy.

''Blue Mars'' takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed atmospheric pressure and temperature to increase so that liquid water can exist on the planet's surface, forming rivers and seas. It follows closely in time from the end of ''Green Mars'' and has a much wider scope than the previous two books, covering an entire century after the second revolution. As Earth is heavily flooded by the sudden melting of the Antarctic ice cap, the once mighty metanats are brought to their knees; as the Praxis Corporation paves a new way of "democratic businesses". Mars becomes the "Head" of the system, giving universal healthcare, free education, and an abundance of food. However, this sparks illegal immigration from Earth, so to ease the population strain on the Blue Planet, Martian scientists and engineers are soon put to the task of creating asteroid cities; where small planetoids of the [[Asteroid belt|Belt]] are hollowed out, given a [[Centrifugal force|spin to produce gravity]], and a mini-sun is created to produce light and heat.

With a vast increase in sciences, technologies, and spacecraft manufacturing, this begins the "Accelerando"; where humankind spreads its civilization throughout the Solar System, and eventually beyond. As Venus, the [[Moons of Jupiter|Jovian moons]], the [[Moons of Saturn|Saturnian moons]], and eventually [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] are colonized and terraformed in some way, Jackie Boone (the granddaughter of John Boone, the first man to walk on Mars from the first book) takes an interstellar vessel (made out of an asteroid) to another star system twenty [[light-year]]s away, where they will start to terraform the planets and moons found there.

The remaining First Hundred are generally regarded as living legends. Reports of Hiroko's survival are numerous, and purported sightings occur all over the colonized solar system, but none are substantiated. Nadia and Art Randolph lead a constitutional congress in which a global system of government is established that leaves most cities and settlements generally autonomous, but subject to a central representative legislature and two systems of courts, one legal and the other environmental. The environmental court is packed with members of the Red faction as a concession (in exchange for their support in the congress, as much of their power was broken when they attempted and failed to violently expel remaining UN forces early on after the second revolution of Green Mars; yet they still retained enough power to stymie constitutional negotiations). Vlad, Marina, and Ursula, the original inventors of the longevity treatments, introduce a new economic system that is a hybrid of capitalism, socialism, and environmental conservationism. During a trip to Earth occurring alongside the congress, Nirgal (one of the original children to be born on Mars to the First Hundred, and something of a Mars-wide celebrity), Maya, and Sax negotiate an agreement that allows Earth to send a number of migrants equal to 10% of Mars' population to Mars every year. Following the adoption of the new constitution, Nadia is elected the first president of Mars and serves competently, although she does not enjoy politics. She and Art work together closely, and eventually fall in love and have a child.

Sax Russell devotes himself to various scientific projects, all the while continuing to recover from the effects of his stroke. Since the second revolution, he feels enormous guilt that his pro-terraforming position became the dominant one at the expense of the goals of Ann's anti-terraforming stance, as Sax and Ann have come to be regarded as the original champions of their respective positions. Sax becomes increasingly preoccupied with seeking forgiveness and approval from Ann, while Ann, depressed and bitter from her many political and personal losses, is suicidal and refuses to accept any more longevity treatments. However, when Sax witnesses Ann collapse into a coma during an attempt to demonstrate to her the beauty of the terraformed world, he arranges for her to be resuscitated and to be treated with the longevity treatment, both against her will.

The longevity treatments themselves begin to show weaknesses once those receiving them reach the two-century mark in age. The treatments reduce most aging processes to a negligible rate,  but are much less effective when it comes to brain function, and in particular memory. Maya in particular suffers extreme lapses in memory, although she remains high functioning most of the time. Further, as people age, they begin to show susceptibility to strange, fatal conditions which have no apparent explanation and are resistant to any treatment. Most common is the event that comes to be known as the "quick decline", where a person of extremely advanced age and in apparently good health suffers a sudden fatal heart arrythmia and dies abruptly. The exact mechanism is never explained. Michel dies of the quick decline, while attending the wake of another First Hundred member. Russell speculates that Michel's quick decline was brought on by the shock of seeing Maya fail to remember Frank Chalmers (who was killed while escaping security forces in the first revolution) upon looking at a treasured photo of him on her refrigerator. As a result of this and Russell's own problems with memory, he organizes a team of scientists to develop medicine that will restore memory. The remaining members of the First Hundred, of which there are only 12, congregate in Underhill, and take the medicine. It works so well that Russell remembers his own birth. He and Ann Clayborne finally recall that they had been in love prior to leaving Earth the very first time, but both had been too socially inept and nervous about their chances for selection for the Mars voyage to reveal this to each other. Their famous argument over terraforming had been a mere continuation of a running conversation they had been having since they still lived on Earth. Through the memory treatment it is also revealed that Phyllis had been lobbying to free Sax from his torturers when she was murdered by Maya. Maya herself declines the treatment. Sax also distinctly recalls Hiroko assisting him in finding his rover in a storm before he nearly froze to death before disappearing once again and is convinced she remains alive, although the question of whether she is actually alive is never resolved.

Eventually, the anti-immigration factions of the Martian government provoke massive illegal immigration from Earth, risking another war; however, under the leadership of Ann and Sax, who have fallen in love again following their reconciliation, along with Maya, the Martian population unites to reconstitute the government to accept more immigration from Earth, diffusing the imminent conflict and ushering in a new golden age of harmony and security on Mars.

== Story elements ==

=== Corporations ===
Trans-national Corporations, nicknamed "transnats", are extremely powerful multinational corporations that first emerge in the mid-21st century.  Robinson tracks the evolution of the transnats into what he terms "metanats" (metanational).  These multinational corporations have grown so large as a result of [[globalization]] that they have sufficient economic power to take over or strongly manipulate national governments, initially only relatively small [[Third World|third-world]] governments, but later, larger developed governments too, effectively running whole countries. In Robinson's [[future history]], the metanational corporations become similar to [[nation-state]]s in some respects, while continually attempting to take over competitors in order to become the sole controller of the [[wikt:interplanetary|interplanetary]] [[Market (economics)|market]]. As the ''Mars'' trilogy draws to a close in the mid-23rd century, the metanational corporations are forced by a global [[Disaster|catastrophe]] to concede more democratic powers to their workforces.

Although there are many transnational and metanational corporations mentioned, two play an active role in the development of the plotline: Praxis, a largely benevolent and relatively democratic firm, and Subarashī, which plays a large role in the maltreatment of the citizens of Mars.

=== Genetic engineering ===
Genetic engineering is first mentioned in ''Red Mars''; it takes off when Sax creates an alga to withstand the harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In ''Green Mars'', GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By ''Blue Mars'', GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in the dimmer light of the outer planets.

=== Other themes ===
The books also speculate on the colonization of other planets and [[moon]]s in the [[Solar System]], and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]], [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]] and [[Venus]]. Toward the end of the last novel, humans are taking sub-light colony ships to other stars, taking advantage of the longevity treatments to survive the trip to their destinations.

A great portion of ''Blue Mars'' is concerned with the effects of extreme longevity on its protagonists, most of whom have lived over two hundred years as a result of repeated [[longevity]] treatments. In particular, Robinson speculates on the [[psychology|psychological]] effects of ultra-longevity including memory loss, personality change, mental instability, and existential boredom.

==Characters==

===The First Hundred===
The initial colonists from the ''Ares'' who established a permanent colony. Many of them later become leaders or exemplary figures in the transformation of Mars or its new society. The "First Hundred" actually consisted of 101, with Coyote being smuggled aboard the Ares by Hiroko.

====John Boone====
An American [[astronaut]], who was the first human to walk on Mars in the year 2020. He returns a public hero and uses his considerable influence to [[lobbying|lobby]] for a second mission, this time one of [[colonization]]. Boone received a large amount of [[radiation]] on his first trip to Mars, more than the recommended dosage according to medical regulations. However, his celebrity status allows him to skirt this. On the second voyage, Boone is one of the "First Hundred" colonists sent to permanently colonize Mars. His accomplishments and natural charm yield him an informal leadership role. In the first chapter of ''Red Mars'', John Boone is assassinated in a plot instigated by Frank Chalmers. The narrative then steps back to the First Hundred's voyage to Mars aboard the spaceship ''Ares''. His ideas continue as a point of reference for the remainder of the trilogy. Boone's character portrayal is complex; in one light, Boone is a stereotypically simple, heroic figure, an everyman hero: his first words on his first trip to Mars are "Well, here we are." He is almost uniformly cheerful and good-natured, and approaches everything he undertakes with hale bonhomie. But later in ''Red Mars'', Robinson switches to Boone's [[Point of view (literature)|point of view]], and it is in this section that it is revealed that late in life, Boone is addicted to omegendorph, a fictional drug that is based on [[endorphin]]s in the [[human brain]]. In addition, it reveals that at least some of his seeming simplicity might simply be an act designed to further his political goals. Overall, Boone is presented as larger-than-life.

====Frank Chalmers====
Head of the American contingent, he is [[machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] in his use of power. However, his cynicism is later shown to be a form of self-defense; Chalmers is at least partly driven by a hidden idealistic side. Early in the voyage to Mars, he becomes sexually involved with Maya Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent of the mission. During the second half of the voyage, Toitovna becomes involved with Boone. Already bitter that Boone became the first to walk on Mars instead of him as they were both candidates for the mission and that he was allowed to join the colonization trip despite his manipulations, Chalmers further despises Boone because of Toitovna's affection. His dislike culminates in his involvement in a plot to assassinate Boone, which ultimately succeeds and allows him to take over handling major affairs on Mars, which ultimately became his undoing as his ruthless governance and aggressive diplomatic work backfire on him during the revolution of 2061. In the final chapters of ''Red Mars'', Chalmers flees with Toitovna and other members of the First Hundred to join the hidden colonists at the polar ice cap but dies along the way when he is caught outside their vehicle during an [[aquifer]] flood in [[Valles Marineris]].

====Maya Toitovna====
An emotional woman who is at the center of a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers, she begins as head of the Russian contingent. The novels hint that she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the Russian space agency to become the leader of the first colonization mission. After the first revolution, she flees with other members of the First Hundred to the hidden colony in the pole. She becomes a school teacher of the children of the hidden colonists but later becomes a powerful political force. After the deaths of Chalmers and Boone, she falls in love with Michel Duval. She suffers heavily from [[bipolar disorder]] and from memory-related psychological disorders with growing age, which often lead her to isolate herself from others and sometimes turn violent. Throughout the novels, Maya takes an active political role, helping to keep the surviving First Hundred together during the failed revolution of 2061 and guiding the successful revolutions that occur decades later, despite her psychological problems.

====Nadezhda "Nadia" Chernyshevski====
A Russian engineer who started out building nuclear reactors in [[Siberia]], during the voyage and initial exploration of Mars, she does her best to avoid the squabbles of the other members of the First Hundred. Instead, she busies herself by building the first permanent habitation of Mars, Underhill, using programmed automated robots. She also helps to construct a new and larger habitat, and research facility in a nearby canyon. In the later books, she becomes a reluctant politician. Chernyshevski is in love with Bogdanov and is devastated when he is killed in an attack by anti-revolutionary forces associated with UNOMA, the transnationals and Phyllis Boyle during the first Martian revolution. In retaliation for Bogdanov's murder, she activates his hidden weapon system, built into [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], which causes the entire moon (a UNOMA/transnational military base) to decelerate in orbit and destructively [[aerobrake]] in Mars' atmosphere, utterly destroying it. In ''Blue Mars'', she falls in love with Art Randolph, with whom she eventually starts a family. After Martian independence, she grudgingly becomes the first president of Mars.

====Arkady Bogdanov====
A mechanical engineer with [[anarchism|anarchist]] leanings, possibly based on the [[Russian people|Russian]] [[Ernst Mach|Machist]], [[Alexander Bogdanov]] (the character's ancestor) and [[Arkady Strugatsky]], he is regarded by many other members of the First Hundred, particularly Boyle, as a troublemaker. He leads the team which establishes an outpost on the moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], and leads an uprising against the transnational corporation towards the end of first novel. Like Boone (with whom he was good friends), his political ideas (later known as Bogdanovism) weigh heavily on characters later in the series. In love with Nadia Chernyshevski, he is killed during the first Martian revolution in 2061.

====Saxifrage "Sax" Russell====
An American [[physicist]], he is a brilliant and creative scientist, and is greatly respected for his intellectual gifts. However, he is socially awkward and often finds it difficult to understand and relate to other people. Russell is a leader of the Green movement, the goal of which is to [[Terraforming|terraform]] Mars. During ''Green Mars'', Sax suffers a stroke while being tortured by government security forces and fellow member of the First Hundred, Phyllis Boyle (although according to later it is revealed she actually opposed Sax's torture). He subsequently suffers from [[Expressive aphasia]] and has to relearn how to speak and becomes less predictable in his actions. Originally apolitical, this event and a growing attachment to Mars itself leads Russell to become the physical architect of the second revolution. After memory issues become apparent in many of the remaining first hundred including Sax he begins work on an ambitious project to gather the remaining first hundred and have them try an experimental treatment he helped to develop. It is after this that Sax realizes his persistent attempts to please Ann are actually because he is also secretly in love with Ann Clayborne, who cannot stand him at first, but after decades on Mars, eventually reconciles. [[Saxifrage]] means "stonebreaker" and is the name for an Alpine plant that grows between stones.

====Ann Clayborne====
An American [[geologist]], Clayborne is one of the first areologists and maintains a stalwart desire to see Mars preserved in the state it holds when humans arrive.  Clayborne early on debates Saxifrage Russell over the proper role of humanity on Mars and though initially apolitical, this stance marks her as the original "Red," while Russell's hands-on terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views.  Clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series, and even her relationship with fellow First Hundred settler Simon (with whom she has a child) is subject to introspective silence in most cases.  Simon's death and the estrangement she finds from their son Peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate "green" drive her to further isolation.  Clayborne's relationship with Russell is shown to be complex, the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as Russell comes to appreciate what has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control.  During the events of ''Blue Mars'', Russell intervenes to save Clayborne's life; later, the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them. Ann undergoes a drastic change towards Blue Mars due to the emergence of something inside of her that she describes as anti-Ann and something else that she can't quite describe.

====Hiroko Ai====
A Japanese expert on [[biology]], agriculture, and ecological systems, it was Ai who smuggled Desmond "Coyote" Hawkins onto the ''Ares'' (the two were friends and lovers as students in London). She is the charismatic leader of the farm team, one of the important work groups and cliques among the First Hundred. She thus becomes the focus of many of the trilogy's central themes. Most importantly, she teaches the importance of maintaining a respectful relation with one's planet. On Mars, this is called the Areophany. In the secret colony Zygote, which Hiroko established, the first generation of children of the First Hundred, the ectogenes, are all the product of artificial insemination outside of any human body. Hiroko uses the ova of the female members of the First Hundred as the female genetic material and uses the sperm of the male members of the First Hundred to fertilize the ova. Although Hiroko is seldom at the center of the narrative, her influence is pervasive. She disappears for the final time in ''Green Mars''. Her ultimate fate is left unresolved. In Japanese, ''ai'' means [[love]].

====Michel Duval====
A French [[psychologist]] pivotally involved in early psychological screening of First Hundred candidates in Antarctica which he describes as being a collection of double bind requirements. Duval is assigned to accompany the Mars mission and is treated as an observer rather than as a member of the team during the early events of ''Red Mars''. His aloof personality enforces this ostracism and also subverts his relationships with others, but in time it becomes clear that Duval is struggling with his own psychological issues perhaps more than anyone else from the expedition.  During the first disappearance of the farm team, he is invited by Hiroko to flee with the farm team and establish Zygote, the first hidden colony.  Duval desperately wants to return to [[Provence]] as he remembers it, and after visiting as a part of the Martian diplomatic mission to Earth, he becomes even more homesick.  Duval falls in love with Maya Toitovna and guides her through particularly challenging psychological episodes throughout most of the series, dying late in ''Blue Mars'' of heart arrhythmia when Maya displays signs of very heavy temporary memory loss.

====Vladimir "Vlad" Taneev====
Nearly sixty when he arrives on Mars, a Russian biological scientist who is the oldest of the First Hundred.  Taneev heads medical treatment and most research projects on Mars, becoming famous as the creator of the gerontological treatment used to regenerate human cellular systems and ushering in a new era of longevity.  He lives in Acheron on the Great Escarpment in the north of Mars before fleeing to the hidden colony after the First Revolution but later returns to his research, falling victim to "quick decline" late in the events of ''Blue Mars''.  For much of his Mars-centric life, Taneev lives in a [[ménage à trois]] with Ursula and Marina, the exact nature of which is never resolved.
{{clear}}

====Phyllis Boyle====
A Christian American biologist with a harsh personality that does not win her many friends among the First Hundred and gains particular enmity from Ann Clayborne. As the Mars situation develops, Boyle sides against most of the First Hundred in favor of the increasingly authoritarian United Nations Office of Mars Affairs (UNOMA) and its successor, the [[corporate]]/quasi-fascist United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTA). Her influence is strongest during the later events of ''Red Mars'', where by the 2061 revolution she has been placed in charge of the asteroid Clarke that serves as the counterweight of the First [[Space Elevator]].  The events of the revolution send Clarke (and Boyle) spinning off into the outer Solar System at the end of ''Red Mars''; ''Green Mars'' finds her back in the equation, but her influence is greatly reduced against the backdrop of a much-expanded UNTA presence.  Boyle engages in a brief sexual relationship with Saxifrage Russell (who despises her) while the latter is living under an assumed identity and is singularly capable of discerning who he really is, turning him over the UNTA.  She is later present at a session in Kasei Vallis where Russell is being tortured, and is killed by Maya Toitovna.  Later, as his memory recovers, Russell reveals that Boyle had been opposed to his torture and was demanding that he be released at the time that Maya's team freed him.

====Desmond "Coyote" Hawkins====
A [[Trinidad]]ian stowaway, he is a friend and supporter of Hiroko, and a fervent [[anarchist communist]]. Present in ''Red Mars'' only as a stowaway who eventually blends effortlessly into the Martian background, he is not even identified as anything more than Coyote until the beginning of ''Green Mars''. He becomes a leading figure in the underground and an unofficial coordinator of a developing [[gift economy]].

===Their descendants ===
Since the trilogy covers over 200 years of human history, later immigrants and the children and grandchildren of the First Hundred eventually become important characters in their own right.

The Martians use the same terminology for different generations as [[Japanese Americans]]. People who immigrated from Earth are called issei, the first generation born on Mars are [[nisei]], and the second-generation Martians are sansei.  Third-generation Martians are called yonsai.

;Kasei: Kasei is the son of Hiroko and John Boone and the father of Jackie Boone. Kasei is the leader of the Kakaze, a radical Red faction. His name is Japanese for the planet Mars. He dies during the second revolution, after an unsuccessful attack on the second space elevator.

;Nirgal: The son of Hiroko and Coyote, he is raised communally by Hiroko and her followers in Zygote. He is a good-natured wanderer who eventually becomes a political leader advocating ties with Earth. He is one of the founders of the Free Mars movement and is famous for his running technique that allows him to run all day for days on end. As Nadia's assistants, he and Art are instrumental in getting the Martian constitution written. Later he is sent on a diplomatic mission to Earth but nearly dies from an infection.  His name is ancient Babylonian for [[Mars]] (the planet and the war-god).

;Jackie Boone: The granddaughter of Hiroko and John Boone (raised with Nirgal), she emerges as a leader of the Free Mars movement, but is seen to change her platform based on whatever keeps her in power (e.g. changing from banning Earth immigration to allowing almost unlimited immigrants). After her daughter Zo's death, she retires in grief and joins a one-way expedition to an [[extrasolar planet]] near [[Aldebaran]].

;Peter Clayborne: Peter Clayborne is the son of Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier, being one of the first children born on Mars. Peter holds a position of older brother to all of the following first generation. Many revolutionary and later political decisions of the Mars First movement are influenced by his opinions and judgment. He works part-time as an engineer and a green politician.

;Zoya "Zo" Boone: Jackie's daughter; she has feline traits (purring) inserted into her genome via the gerontological longevity treatment. In ''Blue Mars'', she travels the solar system running political errands for Jackie, although the two do not get along particularly well. Her character is portrayed as [[hedonistic]] and explicitly [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], making sexual satisfaction a priority and seemingly having little regard for the feelings of others. On the other hand, she apparently has a conscience, risking her life to rescue a man on Mercury and later dying in an attempt to save a distressed flier.

;Nikki: The daughter of Nadia and Art.

===Other characters===
;Arthur "Art" Randolph: A representative of the Praxis corporation sent to contact the Martian underground movement on a quasi-[[diplomacy|diplomatic]] mission in an attempt to create a system of ecological capitalism based on democratic corporations. Like the other metanationals, it takes on intensive economic and political ties with governments, but Praxis aims for partnerships rather than exploitive relationships.

;Zeyk Tuqan ({{lang-ar|زيك طوقان}}) and his wife Nazik ({{lang-ar|نازك}}): They are [[Bedouin]] nomads who originally emigrated from [[Egypt]] and respected figures in the [[Arab]] Martian community. Zeyk is a close friend of Chalmers. His [[eidetic memory]] becomes a minor plot point.

;William Fort: He is the founder of Praxis, one of the huge multinational corporations. He embraces a fusion of Eastern and Western lifestyles.

== Development history ==
In an interview at UCSD, Robinson said that he was looking at a satellite photo of Mars and thought that would be a great place to go backpacking. He said the Mars trilogy grew out of that urge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Potts|first1=Stephen|title=UCSD Guestbook: Kim Stanley Robinson|url=http://www.uctv.tv/shows/UCSD-Guestbook-Kim-Stanley-Robinson-5001|website=UCTV|publisher=University of California Television|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and uses==

===Screen adaptations===
The Mars trilogy rights were at one point held by [[James Cameron]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangehorizons.com/2005/20050815/robinson-int-a.shtml Strange Horizons Articles: Interview: Kim Stanley Robinson, by Lynne Jamneck] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711191614/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2005/20050815/robinson-int-a.shtml |date=2006-07-11 }}—15 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; who planned a five-hour miniseries to be directed by [[Martha Coolidge]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/cameron_mars_speech_825.html Cameron Sending Two Missions to Mars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001214165700/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/cameron_mars_speech_825.html |date=2000-12-14 }}—by Greg Clark—Staff Writer (Imaginova Corp) posted: 08:07 pm ET 25 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; but he passed on the option. Later [[Gale Ann Hurd]] planned a similar mini-series for the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]], which also remained unproduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-sfc.html?2003-06/06/12.30.sfc Sci Fi Wire -- The News Service of the Sci Fi Channel]—1:00pm ET, 06-June-03&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in October 2008, it was reported that AMC and [[Jonathan Hensleigh]] had teamed up and were planning to develop a television mini-series based on ''Red Mars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Brian|title=AMC Lands on Red Mars|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/amc-lands-on-red-mars|publisher=MovieWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 24, 2014, SpikeTV announced it was working with producer Vince Gerardis to develop a TV series adaptation of ''Red Mars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/red-mars-kim-stanley-robinson-spike-tv-vince-gerardis-scripted-series-1201312931/|title=Kim Stanley Robinson’s ‘Red Mars’ Book Adapted as Series at Spike TV - Variety|author=Shelli Weinstein|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 8, 2015, SpikeTV formally greenlit a 10-episode first season of a TV series based on the novels, with [[J. Michael Straczynski]] serving as showrunner and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/red-mars-spike-series-order-1201656112/|title=Spike Orders ‘Mars’ Trilogy Straight to Series with Writer Michael Straczynski - Variety|author=Elizabeth Wagmeister|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2016 ''Deadline'' reported that Straczynski had left his position as showrunner with [[Peter Noah]] replacing him but he too left due to creative differences with Spike. Spike has put the series on hold for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/red-mars-pushed-spike-tv-showrunner-exits-1201726651/|title=Spike TV ‘Red Mars’ Series On Pause After Showrunner Exits|author=Nellie Andreeva|work=Deadline|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Phoenix spacecraft===
The content of ''Green Mars'' and the cover artwork for ''Red Mars'' are included on the Phoenix DVD, carried onboard ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'', a [[NASA]] lander that successfully touched down on Mars in May 2008. The First Interplanetary Library is intended to be a sort of [[time capsule]] for future Mars explorers and colonists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetary.org/about/press/releases/2008/0522_First_Interplanetary_Library_Will_Land.html First Interplanetary Library Will Land on Mars] (from the Web site of the [[Planetary Society]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1586">'''Marsh gas, swamp gas''' and  '''bog gas''' is a mixture of [[methane]], [[hydrogen sulfide ]] and [[carbon dioxide]], produced naturally within some geographical [[marsh]]es, [[swamp]]s, and [[bog]]s.  

The surface of marshes, swamps and bogs is initially [[porous medium|porous]] vegetation that [[Decomposition|rots]] to form a [[Soil crust|crust]] that prevents [[oxygen]] from reaching the organic material  trapped below. That is the condition that allows [[anaerobic digestion]] and [[fermentation]] of any [[plant]] or [[animal]] material which incidentally also produces methane.

In some cases there is sufficient [[heat]], [[fuel]] and [[oxygen]] to allow [[spontaneous combustion]] and underground fires to [[smolder]] for some considerable time as occurred at a natural reserve in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elpais.com/diario/2009/10/12/sociedad/1255298402_850215.html Un insólito incendio subterráneo azota las Tablas de Daimiel]&lt;/ref&gt; Such fires can cause surface [[subsidence]] presenting an unpredictable physical hazard and as well as environmental changes or damage to the local environment and the [[ecosystem]] it supports.

A '''micro data center''' (MDC) is a smaller or [[Modular data center|containerized]] (modular) data center architecture that is designed to solve different sets of problems that take different types of compute workload that does not require to traditional facilities. Whereas the size may vary from rack to container, a micro data center may include fewer than 4 servers in a single 19-inch rack. It may come with built-in security systems, cooling systems, and/or fire protection. Typically there are standalone rack-level systems containing all the components of a 'traditional' data center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/power-cooling/edge-market-will-boost-demand-for-micro-data-centers/95070.fullarticle|title=Edge market will boost demand for micro data centers|website=DatacenterDynamics|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; including in rack cooling, power supply, power backup, security, fire and suppression. They could be rapidly deployed indoors or outdoors or also in rugged terrains.

Mid 2017, introduced by [[DOME project|DOME]], technology was demonstrated that packs 64 high-performance servers, storage, networking, power and cooling integrated in a 2U 19" rack-unit. This packaging, sometimes called 'datacenter-in-a-box' allows deployments in spaces where traditional data centers do not fit, such as factory floors ([[Internet of things|IOT]]) and dense city centers especially for [[Edge computing|edge-computing]] and edge-analytics. 

Their size, versatility and plug &amp; play features make them ideal for use in remote locations, for a branch office, or even for use temporarily at locations that are in high risk zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bigelow|first1=Stephen|title=How to choose a micro data center in rugged location|url=http://searchdatacenter.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-choose-a-micro-data-center-in-rugged-locations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minto Wheel 6 Tanks with more text.svg|thumb|Minto wheel]]
The '''Minto wheel''' is a [[heat engine]] named after [[Wallace L. Minto|Wally Minto]]. The engine consists of a set of sealed chambers arranged in a circle, with each chamber connected to the chamber opposite it. One chamber in each connected pair is filled with a liquid with a low boiling point ([[propane]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &amp;minus;42&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &amp;minus;29.8&amp;nbsp;°C) are listed in the Mother Earth News articles). Ideally, the working fluid also has a high [[vapor pressure]] and density.

==Operation==
As the lower chamber in each pair is heated, the liquid begins to vaporize, forcing the remaining liquid to travel to the upper chamber. This fluid transfer causes a weight imbalance, which causes the wheel to rotate. Minto's pamphlet also suggests obtaining a pressure differential with a dissolved gas instead of a boiling gas. Soda water or propane dissolved in kerosene are suggested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keelynet.com/minto/minto2.htm Minto's pamphlet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The Minto wheel operates on a small temperature gradient, and produces a large amount of torque, but at very low rotational speed.{{cn|date=October 2016}} The speed of rotation is directly proportional to the surface area of the containers used, the volume, and the height of the wheel. The higher the ratio of surface area to volume, the greater the rate of revolution. 
 
== History ==
=== Iske brothers and Israel L. Landis===
In 1881, the Iske brothers got a patent granted for a design similar to the Minto wheel.
The patent suggests lamps as heating sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US243909 US243909 - 1881 patent for the device]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery caption="US Patent US242454, granted to the Iske brothers"&gt;

File:US243909-Figure 1.png|Figure 1
File:US243909-Figure 3.png|Figure 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Later the same year, Israel L. Landis got a patent for a similar engine.
Different to the Minto wheel and the Iske brothers' patent, the engine was oscillating, not revolving.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US250821 US250821]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery caption ="US Patent US250821"&gt;
File:US250821-Figure 1.png|Figure 1
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the following years, the Iske brothers were granted various patents, including some relating to modification and/or improvements on engines similarly to the Minto Wheel and an oscillating engine&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US253868&lt;/ref&gt; similarly to Israel L. Landis design.

File:US271639-1-colored.png
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Drinking bird ===
The oscillating types by the Iske Brothers and Landis are related to the [[drinking bird]] toy.

The drinking bird is dating back to 1910s~1930s.
The drinking bird was patented in the US in 1945&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US2384168&lt;/ref&gt; and 1946&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/patents/US2402463&lt;/ref&gt; by two different inventors.

File:US2402463-0.png|Miles V. Sullivan, 1945
&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Wally Minto's contribution ===
Wally Minto experimented with different working fluids. With the working fluids he used, he got the required temperature difference down, enabling the engine - for example - to run on solar power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keelynet.com/minto/minto2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the working fluid, his improved wheel is also known as "[[Freon]] Power Wheel".&lt;ref name="rex"&gt;http://www.rexresearch.com/minto/minto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Popular Science reported about in its March 1976 issue.&lt;ref name="rex" /&gt;

===Examples===
A working example of a Minto wheel was first published in a series of articles in The ''[[Mother Earth News]]'', Issues #38 March, #39 May and #40 July 1976. Test units constructed by ''Mother Earth News'' (Issue 40, July 1976) and the [[MythBusters (2004 season)|MythBusters]] (Episode 24, December 5, 2004 &amp;ndash; "Ming Dynasty Astronaut") did work to convert temperature difference into torque; however not as well as overenthusiastic boosters claimed.{{citation needed|date = April 2011}}

[[File:Perforations US1940 issues-2c.jpg|right|364px]]

A '''perforation''' is a small hole in a thin material or web. There is usually more than one perforation in an organized fashion, where all of the holes are called a ''perforation''. The process of creating perforations is called '''perforating''', which involves [[puncturing]] the workpiece with a [[tool]].

Perforations are usually used to allow easy separation of two sections of the material, such as allowing [[paper]] to be torn easily along the line. [[Packaging]] with perforations in [[paperboard]] or plastic film is easy for consumers to open.   Other purposes include filtrating fluids, sound deadening, allowing light or fluids to pass through, and to create an aesthetic design.&lt;ref name="todd"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Robert H. | last1 = Todd | first2 = Dell K. | last2 = Allen | first3 = Leo | last3 = Alting | year = 1994 | title = Manufacturing Processes Reference Guide | publisher = Industrial Press Inc. | pages = 103–104 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6x1smAf_PAcC | isbn = 0-8311-3049-0 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various applications include [[plastic film]]s to allow the packages to breathe, medical films, [[micro perforated plate]] and [[sound]] and [[vapor]] barriers.

==Processes==
===Pins and needles===
[[Image:Controlcard-crop.jpg|thumb|left|"Volcanic" perforations made with a needle punch]]
[[Image:Orientatiepaalperforatorpinnetjes Silva 433.JPG|thumb|right|A needle punch used in [[orienteering]]]]

Rotary pinned perforation rollers are precision tools that can be used to perforate a wide variety of materials. The pins or needles can be used cold or heated. Cold perforation tools include needle punches.

There are a handful of manufacturers that specialize in hot and cold needle perforation tooling and equipment. In materials that have [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] this can result in a "volcano" hole that is preferred in many applications.

Pinned rollers can be made from a variety of materials, including [[plastic]], [[steel]], and [[aluminum]].

In more [[brittle]] films, cold perforation can cause slitting rather than creating a round hole, which can jeopardize the material's integrity under pressure.  The solution to this is often heating the pin; i.e. hot pin perforation. Hot perforation melts a hole in the material, causing a reinforced ring around the hole. Hot needle perforation also assists when high density pin patterns are utilized, as the heat aids the perforation of the material.

===Die and punch===
Die and punch sets can be used for thicker materials or materials that require large holes; this process is the most common for [[metalworking]]. The workpiece is [[Shearing (manufacturing)|sheared]] by pressing (either by machine or hand tool) the [[Punch (tool)|punch]] through the workpiece and into the [[die (manufacturing)|die]]. The middle section of the workpiece is scrap; commonly known as the [[chad]] in paper and similar materials. The punch and die are shaped to produce the desired shaped hole. The clearance (the distance between the outside circumference of the punch and the inner circumference of the die) must be properly maintained to ensure a clean cut. [[Burr (metal)|Burr]]s are produced on the side of the workpiece that is against the die.&lt;ref name="todd"/&gt;

Common applications are fruit and vegetable bags, [[hole punch]]ing and [[ticket punch]]ing.

===Laser perforation===
[[Laser cutting]] can place many precise holes in a web. Laser perforations look similar in many respects to hot needle perforations. However, laser systems are expensive. The big advantage of laser perforation is the consistency of the hole size, compared to mechanical perforation. This is very important in [[Modified atmosphere|modified atmosphere packaging]] for fresh produce. The laser perforation is often carried out on [[roll slitting]] machines (slitter rewinder) as the printed material is slit down to the finished roll size.

==Applications==
[[Image:Stamp US 1954 2c Jefferson coil pair.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Perforation holes on a pair of coil stamps]]
[[File:Paper perforator.jpg|thumb|Paper perforator]]
Perforation frequently refers to the practice of creating a long series of holes or slits so that [[paper]] or [[plastic]]s can be torn more easily along a given line: this is used in easy-open [[packaging]].  Since the creation of perforation devices in the 1840s and 1850s, it has seen use in several areas.

[[Postage stamp]]s are one common application of this, where small round holes are cut in lines to [[postage stamp separation|create individual pieces]]. Perforations on stamps are rather large, in the order of a millimeter, in comparison other perforated materials often have smaller holes.

It is common for [[cheque-book]]s, [[notebook]]s and [[legal pad]]s to have perforations making it easier to tear out individual pages or [[leaf (books)|leafs]]. Perforation is used in ways to separate [[loose leaf]] (or even a form of [[graph paper]] from a [[ringed binder]]). A fine perforation next to the rings allows the page to be separated from the book with no [[confetti]].

[[Screwcap]]s on glass or [[plastic bottle]]s are sealed with a ring at the bottom of the cap attached by perforation. Twisting the cap has the effect of rupturing the material between the perforations and indicating that the original seal has been broken.

[[File:FortranCardPROJ039.agr.jpg|thumb|Perforated punch card]]
The edges of [[film stock]] are perforated to allow it to be moved precise distances at a time continuously.  Similarly, [[punched card]]s for use in [[loom]]s and later in [[computer]]s input and output devices in some cases were perforated to ensure correct positioning of the card in the device, and to encode information.

Perforation of steel strips is used in the manufacture of some [[zester]]s and [[rasp]]s.

Historically, perforation patterns other than linear were used to [[perfin|mark stamps]]. A series of patents had been issued in the late 19th Century for perforation machines to be used on rail lines for ticketing. Libraries and private collections used similar perforating stamps to mark ownership of books. End sheets, title pages, and image plates were punched with the namesake of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/lhrt/popularresources/lhrtnewsletters/fall2010|title=LHRT Newsletter|last=admin|date=2010-12-01|work=Library History Round Table (LHRT)|access-date=2017-06-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, similarly elaborate perforation patterns continue to be used in [[Control point (orienteering)|orienteering]].

Bread bags for some bread often have micro-perforations in the plastic, which is supposed to keep the bread fresh by releasing excess moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearbags.com/bags/food/micro-perf|title=Micro-Perforated Bags|work=clearbags.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, bags of concrete use small perforations to allow air to escape while they are being filled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcement.com/product-news/05082015/Weight-of-cement-bags-reduced-by-BSW-Machinery-276/|title=Weight of cement bags reduced by BSW Machinery|work=World Cement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9625">'''Placement''' is an essential step in [[electronic design automation]] - the portion of the physical design flow that assigns exact locations for various circuit components within the chip's core area. An inferior placement assignment will not only affect the [[Integrated circuit|chip]]'s performance but might also make it non-manufacturable by producing excessive wirelength, which is beyond available [[routing (electronic design automation)|routing]] resources. Consequently, a placer must perform the assignment while optimizing a number of objectives to ensure that a circuit meets its performance demands. Together, the placement and routing steps of IC design are known as [[place and route]].

A placer takes a given synthesized circuit [[netlist]] together with a technology library and produces a valid placement layout. The layout is optimized according to the aforementioned objectives and ready for cell resizing and buffering — a step essential for [[static timing analysis|timing]] and [[signal integrity]] satisfaction. [[Clock Distribution Networks|Clock-tree]] synthesis and [[Routing (EDA)|Routing]] follow, completing the physical design process. In many cases, parts of, or the entire, physical design flow are iterated a number of times until [[design closure]] is achieved.

In the case of [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s, or ASICs, the chip's core layout area comprises a number of fixed height rows, with either some or no space between them. Each row consists of a number of sites which can be occupied by the circuit components. A free site is a site that is not occupied by any component. Circuit components are either standard cells, macro blocks, or I/O pads. Standard cells have a fixed height equal to a row's height, but have variable widths. The width of a cell is an integral number of sites. On the other hand, blocks are typically larger than cells and have variable heights that can stretch a multiple number of rows. Some blocks can have preassigned locations — say from a previous floorplanning process — which limit the placer's task to assigning locations for just the cells. In this case, the blocks are typically referred to by fixed blocks. Alternatively, some or all of the blocks may not have preassigned locations. In this case, they have to be placed with the cells in what is commonly referred to as mixed-mode placement.

In addition to ASICs, placement retains its prime importance in gate array structures such as [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs). In FPGAs, placement maps the circuit's subcircuits into programmable FPGA logic blocks in a manner that guarantees the completion of the subsequent stage of routing.

==Objectives and Constraints==
Placement is usually formulated as a problem of '''constrained optimization'''. The constraint is to remove overlaps between all the instances in the netlist. The optimization objective can be of multiple, which typically include: 
*'''Total wirelength''': Minimizing the total wirelength, or the sum of the length of all the wires in the design, is the primary objective of most existing placers. This not only helps minimize chip size, and hence cost, but also minimizes power and delay, which are proportional to the wirelength (This assumes long wires have additional buffering inserted; all modern design flows do this.)
*'''Timing''': The [[Clock signal|clock]] cycle of a chip is determined by the delay of its longest path, usually referred to as the critical path. Given a performance specification, a placer must ensure that no path exists with delay exceeding the maximum specified delay.
*'''Congestion''': While it is necessary to minimize the total wirelength to meet the total routing resources, it is also necessary to meet the routing resources within various local regions of the chip’s core area. A congested region might lead to excessive routing detours, or make it impossible to complete all routes.
*'''Power''': Power minimization typically involves distributing the locations of cell components so as to reduce the overall power consumption, alleviate hot spots, and smooth temperature gradients.
*A secondary objective is placement '''runtime''' minimization.

== Basic techniques ==
Placement is divided into global placement and detailed placement. Global placement introduces dramatic changes by distributing all the instances to appropriate locations in the global scale with minor overlaps allowed. Detailed placement shifts each instance to  nearby legal location with very moderate layout change. Placement and overall design quality is most dependent on the global placement performance.

At early time, placement of integrated circuits is handled by combinatorial approaches. When IC design was of thousand-gate scale, '''simulated annealing'''&lt;ref&gt;S. Kirkpatrick, C. D. G. Jr., and M. P. Vecchi. Optimization by Simulated Annealing. Science, 220(4598):671–680, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; methodologies such as TimberWolf&lt;ref&gt;C. Sechen and A. Sangiovanni-Vincentelli. TimberWolf3.2: A New Standard Cell Placement and Global Routing Package. In DAC, pages 432–439, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; exhibits the best performance. As IC design entered million-scale integration, placement was achieved by '''recursive hyper-graph partitioning'''&lt;ref&gt;George Karypis, Rajat Aggarwal, Vipin Kumar, and Shashi Shekhar. Multilevel Hypergraph Partitioning: Applications in VLSI Domain. In DAC, pp. 526 - 529, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; like Capo.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite conference|title={{doi-inline|10.1109/DAC.2000.855358|Can recursive bisection alone produce routable placements? }}|author1=Caldwell, A.E.|author2=Kahng, A.B.|author3=Markov, I.L.|author4=|booktitle=Proceedings of the 37th Design Automation Conference|date=June 2000|pages=477–482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quadratic placement''' later outperformed combinatorial solutions in both quality and stability. GORDIAN&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1991|title=GORDIAN: VLSI placement by quadratic programming and slicing optimization|journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems]]|volume=10|issue=3|pages=356–365|doi=10.1109/43.67789|author1=Kleinhans, J.M.|author2=Sigl, G.|author3=Johannes, F.M.|author4=Antreich, K.J.|author5=}}&lt;/ref&gt; formulates the wirelength cost as a quadratic function while still spreads cells apart through recursive partitioning. The algorithm in&lt;ref&gt;H. Eisenmann and F. M. Johannes. Generic Global Placement and Floorplanning. In DAC, pages 269–274, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; first models placement density as a linear term into the quadratic cost function, and solves the placement problem by pure quadratic programming.

&lt;/ref&gt;) are following this framework, each with different heuristics on how to determine the linear density force.

'''Nonlinear placement''' presents better performance over other categories of algorithms. The approach in&lt;ref&gt;W. C. Naylor, R. Donelly, and L. Sha. Non-Linear Optimization System and Method for Wire Length and Delay Optimization for an Automatic Electric Circuit Placer. In US Patent 6301693, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; first models wirelength by exponential (nonlinear) functions and density by local piece-wise quadratic functions, in order to achieve better accuracy thus quality improvement. Follow-up academic works mainly include APlace&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Kahng, S. Reda and Q. Wang, "Architecture and Details of a High Quality, Large-Scale Analytical Placer", In ICCAD 2005, pp. 891-898.&lt;/ref&gt; and NTUplace.&lt;ref&gt;T.-C. Chen, Z.-W. Jiang, T.-C. Hsu, H.-C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2770">A '''prescaler''' is an electronic [[Counter (digital)|counting circuit]] used to reduce a high [[frequency]] electrical signal to a lower frequency by [[integer division]]. The prescaler takes the basic timer clock frequency (which may be the CPU clock frequency or may be some higher or lower frequency) and divides it by some value before feeding it to the timer, according to how the prescaler register(s) are configured. The prescaler values that may be configured might be limited to a few fixed values (powers of 2), or they may be any integer value from 1 to 2^P, where P is the number of prescaler bits.

The purpose of the prescaler is to allow the timer to be clocked at the rate a user desires. For shorter (8 and 16-bit) timers, there will often be a tradeoff between resolution (high resolution requires a high clock rate) and range (high clock rates cause the timer to overflow more quickly). For example, one cannot (without some tricks) achieve 1&amp;nbsp;µs resolution and a 1&amp;nbsp;sec maximum period using a 16-bit timer. In this example using 1&amp;nbsp;µs resolution would limit the period to about 65ms maximum. However the prescaler allows tweaking the ratio between resolution and maximum period to achieve a desired effect.

==Example of use==

Prescalers are typically used at very high frequency to extend the upper frequency range of [[frequency counter]]s, [[phase locked loop]] (PLL) synthesizers, and other counting circuits. When used in conjunction with a [[PLL]], a prescaler introduces a normally undesired change in the relationship between the frequency step size and [[phase detector]] comparison frequency. For this reason, it is common to either restrict the integer to a low value, or use a [[dual-modulus prescaler]] in this application. A dual-modulus prescaler is one that has the ability to selectively divide the input frequency by one of two (normally consecutive) [[integer]]s, such as 32 and 33. Common fixed-integer [[microwave]] prescalers are available in modulus 2, 4, 8, 5 and 10, and can operate at frequencies in excess of 10&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, in 2011, the Hittite Microwave Corporation advertised prescalers from 100MHz to 10GHz: {{cite web | url=http://hittite.com/products/index.html/category/34 | title=Prescalers &amp; Counter Dividers | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226213857/http://www.hittite.com/products/index.html/category/259 | archivedate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==

A prescaler is essentially a [[Counter (digital)|counter]]-divider, and thus the names may be used somewhat interchangeably.

'''Professional Organizing''' is an industry that developed in 1984 in Los Angeles, to help individuals and businesses design organizing systems and processes to improve quality of life, personal productivity, and greater efficiency.

There are approximately 3,500 Professional Organizers and Productivity Consultants who are members of the professional association, the [http://www.napo.net/ National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napo.net/|title=National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals (NAPO)|website=www.napo.net|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NAPO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NAPO|url=http://www.napo.net/who|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2002, a number of television programs aired on the subject: ''[[Life Laundry]]'' was followed by others such as, ''[[Clean Sweep]]'', [[Neat (TV series)|''Neat'']], ''[[Mission: Organization]]'', ''[https://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/hoarding-buried-alive/ Hoarding: Buried Alive,]'' ''[http://www.aetv.com/shows/hoarders Hoarders]'', [[imdbtitle:0381740|''Clean House'',]] and [[imdbtitle:0476624|NeatTV]], as well as magazines like [https://www.realsimple.com/ ''Real Simple''.]

== Origins of the Professional Organizing Profession ==
Karen Shortridge, an entrepreneur who, in the early 1980s, began organizing residential spaces for friends and family, was featured in a local Los Angeles newspaper in 1983. The story concluded with an announcement for a meeting for "women who like to organize", taking place later in the week.

Ostensibly, the purpose of a gathering of "women who like to organize" was social in nature; more like a "kaffee klatsch" to talk about children and grandchildren, recipes, husbands, and homemaking.

But two of the women in attendance: Maxine Ordesky and Stephanie Culp, had other ideas, having no interest in discussing wet diapers. Instead, they envisioned a group devoted to business building.

At the time, both women were self-employed entrepreneurs. Maxine began her business, "The Creative Organizer" in the early 1970s. Stephanie Culp began organizing prior to 1983. Her first company, "The Grinning Idiot", an all-purpose errand company [with the tag line, "nothing is too moronic or mundane"] brought her into contact with her first organizing client.

Asking for a change to the meeting format – the room quickly divided. Those who wanted to keep it social, stayed behind in the boardroom at the bank. Maxine, Stephanie, and Ann Gambrell, a retired registered nurse, had been teaching classes on organizing homes and offices for an adult education program, and wrote an organizing column for the ''Daily Breeze'' newspaper in Torrance, California.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dailybreeze.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A few short weeks later – Ann, Maxine, and Stephanie, were joined by Beverly Clower and Jeanne Schorr – for a meeting in Beverly's living room. As the group coalesced structurally and organizationally, and as the women began marketing their services for paid work, it became clear that "to the outside world, organizers were glorified housekeepers or maids." Stephanie Culp made a compelling argument to add the word, "Professional" to the women's work as Organizers  – "a description that seemed outlandish at first, but which eventually overcame the ‘housekeeper’ perception and opened the starting gate to actually attracting clients."&lt;ref&gt;Regina Lark interview with Stephanie Culp, 21 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The women agreed to the new terminology, and the "Association of Professional Organizers" [APO] was formed. APO filed for 501 (c) non-profit status with the intention of "women helping women".&lt;ref&gt;Regina Lark interview with Stephanie Culp 21 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt; They established policies for chapters then personally managed the launch of the first four chapters – Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, and New York City.

With the founding of the New York chapter in 1985, the five women created the National Association of Professional Organizers [NAPO].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.napo.net/?page=about_aboutnapo|title=NAPO – How it all Began|last=|first=|date=|website=National Association of Productivity and Organizing Professionals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, from August to September, the intrepid pioneers formalized the Association by electing officers, formulating dues, and holding elections. As meetings became monthly, the group expanded from living rooms to conference rooms, and a movement began.

Maxine Ordesky, founding President, presided over APO, then NAPO, through the first five years. She recalls, "We met in a small conference room located off a corridor in a local mall in West Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westsidepavilion.com/&lt;/ref&gt; At that first meeting, I stood up in front of 10 women, not realizing, in my wildest dreams, that the organizing profession would grow to thousands of members worldwide."&lt;ref&gt;Regina Lark interview with Maxine Ordesky 23 January 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The first NAPO Conference was held in one of the break-out rooms in Los Angeles at the [http://www.sheratonuniversal.com/ Universal Sheraton Hotel]. "A seemingly impossible idea", as Stephanie Culp reminds us.&lt;ref&gt;Regina Lark interview with Stephanie Culp 22 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Gambrell recalled, "We didn’t have a mailing list but we needed to fill seats. We didn’t want to be embarrassed with a low turnout so we invited our friends and husbands to help fill the room".&lt;ref&gt;Regina Lark interview Ann Gambrell 15 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverly Clower described those early years as important to her own professional development, "All these women had found their special niche, and we were all like sisters in this together. Women need to be heard and here we were: our clients and our colleagues were listening to us because we had something valuable to say".&lt;ref&gt;Regina Lark interview Beverly Clower 5 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.napo.net/?page=join_benefits Golden Circle],  the first [http://www.napo.net/?page=about_ethics&amp;hhSearchTerms= Code of Ethics],  and 501(c)(3) status, just to name a few of the many ideas, programs, and policies that originated with the Founders.

The Founders [as Clower, Culp, Gambrell, Ordesky, and Schorr are fondly referred by NAPO members] started with a notion that women could be in business using skills that many of them already possessed.  They then developed that vision by building on it as a team.  In a time before computers, they did everything by hand. There was no funding available, so they used their own money.

All this happened because five women had the courage and determination to take an idea that they believed in totally; they became unstoppable.

Founder Stephanie Culp is also the author of eight organizing books,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Stephanie-Culp/e/B000APHPNA&lt;/ref&gt; producing relevant content at a time when only two other books were available: Stephanie Winston's ''Getting Organized''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0028MVHGE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&lt;/ref&gt; and Don Aslett's ''Clutter's Last Stand''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Clutters-Last-Stand-Aslett-1995-02-01/dp/B019TLJ4KW/ref=pd_sbs_14_4?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B019TLJ4KW&amp;pd_rd_r=SKKNAB70RYPE07KNNZR4&amp;pd_rd_w=5b9gf&amp;pd_rd_wg=UYtmS&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=SKKNAB70RYPE07KNNZR4&lt;/ref&gt; Maxine Ordesky's ''The Complete Home Organizer'' was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Home-Organizer-Functional-Storage/dp/0802133401/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1516751763&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=maxine+ordesky&lt;/ref&gt;

NAPO University also offers a [http://www.napo.net/page/education_bustrack Business Resources Track] to support Professional Organizers and Productivity Consultants in developing and growing their businesses.

==Principles==
Professional Organizers achieve the goal of creating and maintaining organizational systems by teaching others the basic principals of organization.  Writer [http://www.juliemorgenstern.com/ Julie Morgenstern] suggests communicating these principals by using the acronym "SPACE", interpreted as: S=Sort, P=Purge, A=Assign a Home, C=Containerize and E=Equalize.&lt;ref name="Morgenstern2004"&gt;{{cite book|author= Julie Morgenstern|title= Organizing from the Inside Out, second edition: The Foolproof System For Organizing Your Home, Your Office and Your Life|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TG2II7hRVfkC&amp;pg=PA22|date= 1 September 2004|publisher= Henry Holt and Company|isbn= 978-1-4299-5536-2|pages= 22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last step ("E") consists in monitoring how the new system that has been created is working, adjusting it if needed, and maintaining it.  This principle is applicable to every type of organization.

As one of their main jobs, Professional Organizers help [[customer|clients]] reduce excessive clutter (paper, books, clothing, shoes, office supplies, home decor items, etc.) in the home or in the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Personal Finance: It's time to tame paper tiger |author= Buck, Claudia |url= http://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/03/5159308/its-time-to-tame-paper-tiger.html |newspaper= The Sacramento Bee |date= February 3, 2013 |accessdate= June 3, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130513235632/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/03/5159308/its-time-to-tame-paper-tiger.html |archivedate= 13 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional Organizers endeavor to help individuals and business owners take control of their surroundings, their time, their paper, and their systems for life. Professional Organizers help redirect paradigms into more useful cross-applications that ensure properly co-sustainable futures for their clients' spaces and processes.

Professional Organizers offer a wide variety of services, from designing a functional [[closet]], to organizing a cross-country move.  For homeowners, a Professional Organizer might plan and reorganize the space of a room, improve paper management, or [[coaching|coach]] in [[time-management]], or [[goal-setting]].  In a [[business]] setting, Professional Organizers work closely with their clients to increase [[productivity]] by stream-lining paper-filing, electronic organization, and employee time-management.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Roaring rails''' is a phenomenon of short-wave [[wikt:corrugated|corrugation]] observed in [[railroad track]]s. Despite being a widely observed type of railroad track deformity, the reason it occurs was not known or researched until recently.

==Introduction==
Roaring rails are very short wave corrugations that range from 25 to 75 millimeters in length. It is commonly associated with high speed passenger, transit, and light [[axle load]] railroad operations.

==Causes==
It is generally accepted that a few distinct causes lie behind different wavelengths of railroad corrugation. One study{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} indicates that the specific short-wave railroad deformity is mainly caused by pinned-pinned resonance, in which the rail vibrates as a fixed beam, as if pinned between periodically placed [[Railroad tie|sleepers]]. The dynamic train-track interaction that causes fixed frequency vibrations at high speeds, commonly observed in light load [[Rapid transit|metro]] operations, and the anti-resonance caused by the pinning of the rails on sleepers, causes deformation and the "roaring" corrugation of the rails.

'''SM4All (Smart hoMes for All)''' is an international scientific research project funded by the [[European Community]]. It started on September 1, 2008 and will end on August 31, 2011. The SM4All  project aims at studying and developing an innovative middleware platform for inter-working of smart embedded services in immersive and personcentric environments, through the use of composability and semantic techniques, in order to guarantee dynamicity, dependability and scalability, while  preserving the privacy and security of the platform and its users. This is applied to the challenging scenario of private/home/building in presence of users with different abilities and needs (e.g., young able bodied aged and disabled).&lt;ref name="cartarci"&gt;Catarci, T. et al.

== Technical approaches ==

In the design of the SM4All platform, there will be a specific focus on ontologies for describing service capabilities, to be used for obtaining the dynamic configuration and composition of the services, while preserving the privacy of the users. Within this project an innovative middleware platform for inter-working of smart embedded services by leveraging on [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) technologies will be investigated. In particular, in the SM4All project, P2P, service orientation and context-awareness are merged in novel ways in order to define general reference architecture for embedded middleware targeted to immersive scenarios, among which the [[domotics]] and home-care have been selected as showcases.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/ict/docs/necs/booklet-necs-wsnco_en.pdf CORDIS RTD-PROJECTS/©European Communities (2009): Smart homes for all; an embedded middleware platform for pervasive and immersive environments for-all (SM4All).Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)]&lt;/ref&gt;

P2P systems (P2P) have become a popular technique to design large-scale distributed applications in unmanaged inter-domain settings, such as file sharing or chat systems, thanks to their capabilities to self-organize and evenly split the load among peers.&lt;ref&gt;Baldoni, R. (2009). Dynamic quorums for DHT-based enterprise infrastructures, Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing. Volume 68, Issue 9, September 2008, Pages 1235–1249&lt;/ref&gt; The platform is inherently scalable and able to resist to devices’ churn and failures, while preserving the privacy of its human users as well as the security of the whole environment. The [[embedded systems]] are specialized computers used to control equipment such as the smart homes.&lt;ref name="cartarci"/&gt; To enable interoperation among heterogeneous devices and to provide a service-oriented basis, the project considers XML based protocols such as Web services and Universal Plug and Play (UPnP).&lt;ref name="aiello"&gt;Aiello, M. and S. Dustdar. Are our Homes Ready for Services? A Domotic Infrastructure based on the Web Service Stack (2008) Pervasive and Mobile Computing, 4(4):506-525.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a woman wants to take a bath. She enters this goal into the computer. Something happens then: The temperature in the bathroom will rise.  The water runs in the bathtub with the preferred temperature. The cupboard opens to offer towels. If the woman is disabled, her nurse will be informed by the system.

In SM4All, the focus is on the process-oriented composition of stateful services. The idea is that a triggering condition in the home or a desire of the user can trigger the execution of a complex process. The process is defined in the moment that it needs to be executed. It automatically composes services available on home devices and appliances. The execution of the process thus depends on the context of the home, of its inhabitant and the available services. To achieve this it is necessary to identify the home context, to discover available devices and services and to compose them at execution time. In the SM4All project we consider [[Automated planning and scheduling]] approaches for the composition such as the "Roman Model"&lt;ref&gt;Calvanese, D. et al. (2008): Automatic Service Composition and Synthesis: the Roman Model. Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering. IEEE Computer Society Vol31 No.3. p.18ff&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Barbarian" constraint based approach.&lt;ref name="lazovik"&gt;Lazovik, A., M. Aiello, and M. Papazoglou, Planning and monitoring the execution of web service requests. (2006) Journal on Digital Libraries Springer, 6(3):235-246.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Two techniques adopted in the SM4All project are'''

'''Brain Computer Interface for Virtual-Reality Control'''

An [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) based [[brain-computer interface]] (BCI) was connected with a [[Virtual Reality]] system in order to control a [[smart home]] application. Therefore, special control masks were developed which allowed using the [[P300 (neuroscience)|P300]] component of the EEG as input signal for the BCI system. Control commands for switching TV channels, for opening and closing doors and windows, for navigation and conversation were realized. Experiments with 12 subjects were made to investigate the speed and accuracy that can be achieved if several hundred of commands are used to control the smart home environment. 
The study clearly shows that such a BCI system can be used for smart home control. The Virtual Reality approach is a very cost-effective way for testing the smart home environment together with the BCI system.&lt;ref&gt;Guger, C. et al. (2008) Control of a Smart Home with a Brain-Computer Interface. Proc. 3rd BCI workshop at University of Technology Graz&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Service Composition'''

Sensors and devices collaborate one another as service providing and requesting nodes of a network. A service can be a purely information one (e.g., providing the temperature in a room) or a state changing one (closing all the lights in a room). Atomic services are then amenable to discovery and composition, enabling the home to perform complex tasks. The user can than express a goal, such as that of  possibly according to some optimality measure. For instance the user may want to take a bath. The goal will be translated into a process invoking various services (turning on the heater in the bathroom, the lights, putting an alarm in the living room, checking that there is hot water available, etc.). Notice that the same goal can take different execution forms in different homes or in different conditions (e.g., the alarm in the living room is not available, but the goal of taking a bath is still satisfied).

'''Scale focus''', or '''zone focus''', is a type of focusing system used by many inexpensive [[camera]]s from the 1940s and 1950s. These cameras have an adjustable focus, but lack a focusing aid such as a [[rangefinder]]. It is necessary to determine the distance to the subject and set the focus using a scale printed on the lens. To get properly focused photographs with this type of camera requires accurate estimation of the distance to the subject, or measurement by other means, e.g. a [[tape measure]].

== Technique ==
[[File:Lens aperture side.jpg|thumb|Zone focusing fixes a [[depth of field]], which can be read off of the DOF scale on the focus ring, as shown here – DOF is 1 meter to 2 meters, with aperture f/11 and focal plane at 1.4 meters.]]
Today the term "zone focus" refers to the technique of setting a fixed focal distance (turning off [[autofocus]]), and often a fixed aperture, hence fixing the [[depth of field]], and then taking photographs at that distance; the DOF can be read off of the DOF scale on the [[focus ring]], hence the term "zone". This is frequently used in [[street photography]] to allow rapid and candid "shooting from the hip" (shooting without composing in the viewfinder) and avoiding autofocus lag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markushartel.com/blog/learn-from-markus/zone-focusing Zone Focusing], Markus Hartel, January 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photo.net/street-documentary-photography-forum/007j4H Zone Focus], photo.net, March 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Zone focusing is also useful for pet action photography, where the time delay of focusing may be unworkable.

[[File:US Space Walk 1967 Issue-5c.jpg|thumb|386px|&lt;center&gt; Accomplishments in Space&lt;/center&gt;&lt;center&gt;[[U.S. space exploration history on U.S. stamps#Accomplishments in Space Commemorative Issue of 1967|Commemorative Issue]] of 1967 &lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Apollo 4 Saturn V, s67-50531.jpg|thumb|The [[Saturn V]] launched the Apollo missions to the Moon, and inspired space exploration themes for several U.S. postage stamps.]]
With the advent of [[Unmanned spaceflight|unmanned]] and [[manned space flight]] a new era of [[History of the United States|American history]] had presented itself. Keeping with the tradition of honoring the country's history on U.S. postage stamps, the [[U.S. Post Office]] began honoring the various events with its commemorative postage stamp issues.  The first U.S. Postage issue to depict a U.S. [[space vehicle]] was issued in 1948, the [[Fort Bliss]] issue. The first issue to commemorate a space project by name was the [[Project Echo|ECHO I]] [[communications satellite]] commemorative issue of 1960.  Next was the [[Project Mercury]] issue of 1962. As U.S. [[space exploration]] progressed a variety of other commemorative issues followed, many of which bear accurate depictions of satellites, [[space capsule]]s, [[lunar module]]s, [[space suit]]s, and other items of interest.&lt;ref name="Scotts"&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

Space exploration history is a popular topic, as record numbers of First-Day covers for postage stamps with space themes will attest.  The Project Mercury issue of 1962 had more than three million [[First day of issue|'First Day of Issue']] cancellations, while the average number of First-Day cancels for other [[Commemorative stamp|commemorative]] issues at that time was around half a million. In 1969, the Apollo VIII issue received 900,000 First-Day cancels while others received less than half this amount.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's, USA. - First Day Covers index&lt;/ref&gt; As the advent of U.S. space exploration grew, so did the topic of Space Exploration on stamps.

==Fort Bliss 100th Anniversary Issue of 1948==
[[File:Fort Bliss 1948 Issue-3c.jpg|thumb|upright|&lt;center&gt; [[Fort Bliss]] Issue of 1948 &lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Fort Bliss]] has a long and diverse history and functioned in many capacities over the years.  By February 1946, over 100 [[Operation Paperclip]] scientists had arrived from [[Nazi Germany]] to develop rockets and were attached to the Office of the Chief of Ordnance Corps, Research and Development Service, Suboffice (Rocket), headed by Major James P. Hamill.&lt;ref&gt;McGovern, J (1964). Crossbow and Overcast. New York: W. Morrow. pp. 209–210,233,246.&lt;/ref&gt;

This stamp was issued on the 100th anniversary of Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas, in its honor. Third Assistant Postmaster General Joseph L. Lawler dedicated the stamp in El Paso on November 5, 1948.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;Smithsonian National Postal Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The issue depicts what appears to be a rocket designed after the [[V-2]] in the center, which technically makes it a "space stamp" in the Topographical world of philately.

Based on findings made by [[U.S. Space Exploration History on U.S. Stamps#Robert H. Goddard Issue of 1964|Dr. Robert Goddard]] following World War I, the Germans hit a peak production of V-2's during 1944 and 1945 at Peenemunde.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libertyparkusafd.org/lp/Hale/films%20--%20DVDs/White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range%20and%20Paperclip.htm White Sands Missile Range]&lt;/ref&gt; When they arrived in the United States, at Fort Bliss, they brought with them the knowledge of the V-2, and as such, the U.S. made arrangements with these scientists and employed their knowledge in developing rockets at Fort Bliss in Post War United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/ww2/OperationPaperclip.html Operation Paper Clip, Jewish Virtual library&lt;/ref&gt; It was this effort that led the way to the successful production of the great rockets that carried satellites and [[Astronaut]]s into space.

The stamp's designer, [[Charles R. Chickering]], intended the issue to salute the old as well as the new Fort Bliss and portray some of the highlights of the Fort's hundred-year history.  Chickering, of the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], designed the stamp. C.A. Brooks engraved the vignette, and A.W. Christensen engraved the border, the lettering, and the numerals.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; The quantity issued was 64,561,000.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps:Quantities Issued&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project ECHO I, Issue of 1960==
[[File:Echo I 1960 Issue-4c.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt; [[Project Echo|ECHO I]], Issue of 1960 &lt;/center&gt;]]
Following the failure of the [[Delta rocket]] carrying [[Echo 1]] on May 13, 1960, Echo 1A (commonly referred to as just Echo 1) was successfully put into a 944 to 1,048&amp;nbsp;mi orbit on August 12, 1960, by [[NASA]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;ft. diameter balloon was made of ultra thin (0.0050&amp;nbsp;in) metalized Mylar polyester film and was successfully used to reflect transcontinental and intercontinental telephone, radio, and television signals. The satellite also aided in the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure due to its large area-to-mass ratio.

[[File:Echo-1.jpg|thumb|upright|Echo 1 sits fully inflated at a Navy hangar in Weeksville, North Carolina]]
Because its shiny surface the large balloon-like satellite was also reflective of visible light rays, Echo 1A was visible to the naked eye over most of the Earth. Echo 1 was a passive communications satellite: it functioned as a reflector, not a transmitter. After it was placed in a low Earth orbit (LEO), a signal would be transmitted from Earth to the Echo satellite and then reflected or bounced off its surface, and then returned to Earth.  It was the pioneer of communications satellites. Because it was brighter than most stars, it was seen by more people than any other man-made object in space at that time.  Upon reentry into Earth's atmosphere ECHO 1A burned up on May 24, 1968.&lt;ref&gt;https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/31jul_solarsails/ NASA – A Brief History of Solar Sails&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first 'Space Stamp' with an actual subject of a real space vessel, unlike the generic or symbolic rocket depicted in the [[Fort Bliss]] issue of 1948. The U.S. Post Office issued this 4-cent Echo I "Communications for Peace" commemorative stamp through the Washington, D.C., post office on December 15, 1960. The stamp was produced and issued to honor the world's first communications satellite.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;  Designed by [[Ervine Metzl]], the stamp was printed by the rotary process, electric-eye perforated, and issued in panes of fifty stamps each. Quantities issued totaled more than 120 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==Project Mercury Issue of 1962==
[[File:Project Mercury 1962 Issue-4c.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Project Mercury]] Issue of 1962&lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Project Mercury]] was the first human spaceflight program of the United States. It ran from 1959 through 1963 with the goal of putting a human in orbit around the Earth. The Mercury-Atlas 6 flight on February 20, 1962, was the first [[Mercury-Atlas 6|Mercury]] flight to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mercury/missions/friendship7.html NASA -Project Mercury&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Glenn Mercury (small).jpg|thumb|160px|right|&lt;center&gt;[[John Glenn]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Post Office Department honored this first orbital flight of a United States astronaut on February 20, 1962, when it released the Project Mercury commemorative stamp, placed on sale throughout the country at the exact hour Colonel [[John Glenn]]'s historic flight officially had returned to Earth safely.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/stampstakeflight/gioriinnovation.html Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The stamp features an image of the Mercury ''[[Friendship 7]]'' capsule circling the earth, against a field of stars. The spacecraft is now housed at the [[National Air and Space Museum]], Washington, DC.  Because the event was deemed so popular the number of quantities issued totaled more than 289 million, more than twice the average amount of quantities issued for commemorative postage issues of that time.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

This issue has somewhat of an unusual history.  It was one of the first issues printed on the new Giori Press (named after its inventor, [[Gualtiero Giori]]). It employed a series of specially cut rubber rollers that applied two or three different colored inks on the same printing plate. As the new press was being used to print the Project Mercury stamp before the mission took place and in case the mission failed or was canceled, the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] kept word about the new press and the stamp issue's production a secret. To further assure that the project be kept secret the designer of this issue, Charles R. Chickering, worked from his home and simply claimed that he was away on vacation.  The stamps, waiting at post offices around the U.S., were sealed and marked "Top Secret". Only after Glenn's trip were the postmasters allowed to open the package and see what was inside.{{clear}}

==Robert H. Goddard Issue of 1964==
[[File:Robert H Goddard 1963 Issue-8c.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt; Robert Goddard Issue of 1964 &lt;/center&gt;]]

[[Robert Hutchings Goddard]] (October 5, 1882 – August 10, 1945) is widely recognized as the "father of rocketry," as he pioneered the [[Liquid-propellant rocket|modern propulsion rocket]] based on his knowledge of math, engineering and physics. His accomplishments included creating the first rocket propelled using liquid fuel and developing the first rocket to use internal vanes for guidance.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;  He launched his first rocket in March 1926.&lt;ref&gt;"Goddard". Astronautix.com. http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/goddard.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Goddard continued to achieve many firsts in the field of rocketry with funding from institutions such as the Smithsonian. In 1919, the Smithsonian Institution published Robert Goddard's groundbreaking work, A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives – http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/documents/goddard.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other than from sources like the Smithsonian, Goddard received little public support for his research during his lifetime. He was the first to recognize the scientific potential of liquid fuel rockets in space travel and was instrumental in bringing about the design and construction of those rockets needed to implement those ideas.

Though his work in the field was revolutionary, he was sometimes ridiculed by the public and in the press for his theories concerning spaceflight and therefore became protective of his privacy and his research work. Years after his death, as manned spaceflight finally became a reality, Goddard at long last came to be recognized as the man who pioneered modern rocketry and ultimately [[space exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;NASA Archives – http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 5, 1964, the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp commemorating Robert Goddard. The stamp depicts an image of Goddard next to a rocket launching from the Kennedy Space Center. The Post Office released the stamp issues at a ceremony held in New Mexico. Goddard's wife, Esther Goddard, attended the ceremony. She was given the honor of pressing the button launching two rockets, one of which flew some mile and a half into the air. The two rockets each carried 1,000 [[First day of issue|first day covers]], and after parachuting to the ground were recovered with the first day covers later sold to collectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=4&amp;cmd=2&amp;eid=294&amp;slide=3 Smithsonian National Postal Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Robert J. Jones and printed on the Giori press, the quantities for this issue totaled more than 62 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;{{clear}}

==Accomplishments in Space Commemorative Issue of 1967==
[[File:US Space Walk 1967 Issue-5c.jpg|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Accomplishments in Space&lt;br/&gt;Commemorative Issue of 1967&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Gemini IV]] was a June 1965 manned space flight in [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini|Gemini program]]. It was the second manned Gemini flight, the tenth manned American flight and the 18th spaceflight of all time (includes [[North American X-15|X-15]] flights over {{convert|100|km}}). It was crewed by [[James McDivitt]] and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]].

The highlight of the mission was the first [[space walk]] by an American, during which White remained tethered outside the spacecraft for 22 minutes. Tied to a tether, White fired his oxygen powered "zip gun" and floated out of the capsule. He traveled fifteen feet (five meters) out, and began to experiment with maneuvering. He found it easy, especially the pitch and yaw, although he thought the roll would use too much fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/oral_histories/McDivittJA/mcdivittja.pdf Oral History Transcript / James A. McDivitt / Interviewed by Doug Ward / Elk Lake, Michigan – 29 June 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ed White First American Spacewalker - GPN-2000-001180.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ed White, first American astronaut to perform a spacewalk.]]
Two 5-cent [[se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] stamps comprise one illustration of an astronaut during a space walk, honoring the space accomplishments of the United States.  These issues were first placed on sale on September 29, 1967, at [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;

The offset press and intaglio press were combined to produce this issue in sheets bearing one horizontal plate number. Offset printed the red stripes in the flags on the astronaut's spacesuit and capsule and light blue sky areas, as well as the inscription on the astronaut stamp. The Giori press printed dark blue sky areas, the aqua earth, and black tones on the capsule and astronaut. The inscription on the spaceship stamp was white.

This issue was designed by [[Paul Calle]] of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], who based his design from photos taken on the Gemini IV mission.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Margalit. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/31/arts/design/31calle.html "Paul Calle, Postage Stamp Designer, Is Dead at 82"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 31, 2010. Accessed December 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was printed by the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]]. It was issued in panes of fifty, with an initial printing of 120 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==Apollo VIII Issue of 1969==
[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Earthrise]]'', taken by Anders on 24 December 1968]]
[[File:Apollo VIII 1969 Issue-6c.jpg|thumb|upright|''Earthrise'' used on the Apollo VIII 1969 Issue &lt;/center&gt;]]
Up until the time of the [[Apollo VIII]] mission all manned ventures into space were confined to brief flights into space or to orbiting the Earth. Apollo VIII was the first human spaceflight mission to leave Earth orbit; the first to be captured by and escape from the gravitational field of another celestial body; and the first crew to voyage and then return to planet Earth from another celestial body – Earth's Moon. The three-man crew of mission Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] became the first humans to see the far side of the Moon with their own eyes, as well as the first humans to see planet Earth from beyond low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="NASA - Apollo VIII Mission Objective"&gt;NASA – Apollo VIII Mission Objective http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was accomplished with the first manned launch of a [[Saturn V rocket]]. Apollo VIII was the second manned mission of the Apollo Program.
While orbiting the Moon each man on board read a section from the Biblical creation story (verses 1–10) from the [[Book of Genesis]], and it is this unprecedented historical event that is theme of the Apollo VIII issue's design, the issue being inscribed with the words, ''In the beginning God...'' superimposed on the photograph ''[[Earthrise]]'', taken by Anders. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA - Apollo VIII Mission Objective"/&gt;

This issue was first released in Houston Texas on May 5, 1969.  Basing his design on the Anders' ''Earthrise'' photograph, and from the words they read from Genesis, Leonard E. Buckley designed the Apollo VIII commemorative issue of 1969. The issue was printed on the multi-color Giori Press.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;  Quantities issued totaled more than 187 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==First Man on Moon Commemorative Issue of 1969==
The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon.  Launched on July 16, 1969, the third lunar mission of NASA's Apollo Program was crewed by Commander Neil A. Armstrong, Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin|Edwin E. 'Buzz' Aldrin, Jr]]. On July 20, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon, while Collins orbited in the Command Module.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_11i_Timeline.htm NASA Apollo 11 Timeline].&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo 11 mission reached President John F. Kennedy's goal of putting a man on the Moon's surface by the end of the 1960s.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

On September 9, 1969, the U.S. Post office issued its first [[airmail stamp]] to depict a space exploration theme, the First Man on the Moon issue.  The man depicted in the [[space suit]] is Neil Armstrong taking man's first step on the moon. This issue was designed by Paul Calle. The stamp's original master die was actually flown to the moon, and a letter with the stamp canceled on the way back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afdcs.org/resources/c76-moon-landing.pdf Moon Landing C76 Cachet Catalog]&lt;/ref&gt; The quantities issued were more than 152 million&lt;ref name="Scotts - Airpost"/&gt; making the issue quite common, and quite popular.  Some issues are missing the red color resulting in the stripes of the flag emblem on Armstrong's arm being omitted making that issue quite scarce and expensive.&lt;ref name="Scotts - Airpost"&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps - Air post Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Achievement Decade Issue of 1971==
{{see also|Apollo 15 postage stamp incident}}
This 'Space Achievements' issue depicts the Earth, Sun, Lunar Module, the [[Lunar Rover]] and astronauts. Two 8-cent [[se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] stamps commemorating a decade of space achievements were placed on sale August 2, 1971, at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and Houston, Texas.  First day covers were postmarked at two different post offices (Houston, Texas and Huntsville, Alabama, location of the two tracking stations.&lt;ref&gt;Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps – First Day Covers&lt;/ref&gt;) rather than the usual one because of extraordinary popularity of the space program at the time of issuance.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This issue was designed by [[Robert McCall (artist)|Robert T. McCall]] of Paradise Valley, Arizona.  Upon close examination of this issue one can see that it has an accurate depiction of the Lunar Rover, sitting on the Lunar surface. The [[Lunar landing]] module can also be seen in the background. This issue (pair) came in sheets of 50 (100 individual stamps), with an initial printing of 150 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postal Bulletin (July 1, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skylab Issue of 1974==
[[File:Skylab2 1974 Issue-10c.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Skylab Issue of 1974 &lt;/center&gt;]]
[[Skylab]], a science and engineering laboratory, was the United States' first space station, and the second space station visited by a human crew. It was put into orbit by a Saturn V rocket on 14 May 1973.  It was also the only space station NASA launched alone. The 100-ton space station was in Earth's orbit from 1973 to 1979 and it was visited by crews three times in 1973 and 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Skylab Crewed Missions|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/skylab/missions/skylab_manned.html|website=National Aeronautic and Space Administration|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circling 50 degrees north and south of the equator at an altitude of {{convert|435|km|mi}}, [[Skylab]] had an orbital period of 93 minutes. There were a plethora of UV astronomy experiments done during the Skylab lifetime, as well as detailed X-ray studies of the Sun. The station was active until July 11, 1979, when it fell out of orbit.&lt;ref&gt;NASA-HEASARC Observatories – http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/missions/skylab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10-cent Skylab commemorative stamp first day of release took place at Houston, Texas, on May 14, 1974. This issue commemorates the first anniversary of the launching of Skylab, and depicts the station as it was repaired, complete with "umbrella" and missing the lost solar panel.  The stamp was designed by Robert T. McCall and was issued in sheets of fifty, with an initial printing of 140 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==Pioneer Commemorative Issue of 1975==
[[File:Pioneer Jupiter 1975 Issue-10c.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Pioneer Commemorative Issue of 1975 &lt;/center&gt;]]
In March 1972, scientists at [[NASA]] launched ''[[Pioneer 10]]'' to gather scientific data about the solar system's largest planet, [[Jupiter]], while the vessel was also receiving radio control and guidance signals and other information from Earth.  The Pioneer space craft was expected to last for 21 months in the solar system and deliver accurate information over that period of time. The fastest man made object to enter space from Earth, the spacecraft was to begin collecting data at the [[Asteroid Belt]] and Jupiter and continue to relay information about other areas and phenomena of the solar system.

After ''Pioneer 10'' passed through the asteroid belt, ''[[Pioneer 11]]'', was launched on a similar trajectory.

''Pioneer 10'' became the first spacecraft to get close enough to [[Jupiter]] to send back revelations about the properties and phenomena of the solar system's largest planet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quest.nasa.gov/sso/cool/pioneer10/mission/ NASA – Pioneer 10 Mission Profile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/about/history/pioneer.html NASA – Glenn Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10-cent Pioneer commemorative stamp was issued on February 28, 1975, at Mountain View, California, and paid the domestic first-class rate for letters weighing less than one half ounce. Designed by Robert T. McCall and printed at the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] on the Giori presses, the stamp shares numerous design elements with USA Scott 1557, the ''Mariner 10'' Issue of 1975.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;

==''Mariner 10'' Issue of 1975==
[[File:Mariner 10 1975 Issue-10c.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; ''Mariner 10'' Issue of 1975 &lt;/center&gt;]]
Engineered to explore the orbits of [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], ''[[Mariner 10]]'' launched in November 1973. The mission's two- year plan used the gravitational pull of Venus to reach Mercury. The probe also used solar winds to help with locomotion when fuel ran low. ''Mariner 10'' orbited the planets in the opposite direction of Earth's orbit.

Mariner's first photographed images, which revealed [[Venus]]'s dense cloud cover, reached NASA scientists in February 1974. Data collected by ''Mariner 10'' helped determine Venus's rotation period and use of Earth's magnetic field. Photos of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] revealed its cratered surface and its large scarps and plains. Research also recorded its radical temperature variations between night and day.&lt;ref&gt;Apollo-Soyuz Test Project." NASA. https://history.nasa.gov/30thastp/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10-cent ''Mariner 10'' commemorative stamp was issued on April 4, 1975, at Pasadena, California. It paid the domestic first-class rate for letters weighing less than a half ounce. The stamp shares numerous design elements with USA Scott 1556, and while they have different designers and dates of issue, the two are cataloged together under the heading "U.S. Unmanned Accomplishments in Space."

Designed by Roy Gjertson, the ''Mariner 10'' commemorative postage issue was printed at the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] in multi-color on the Giori presses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1973-085A "Mariner 10." National Space Science Data Center.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Quantities issued totaled more than 158 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==Apollo&amp;ndash;Soyuz Commemorative Issue of 1975==
With the [[Apollo–Soyuz]] mission, two nations collaborated on a space project for the first time. In July 1975, the United States launched the manned Apollo Command module to rendezvous with Russia's manned Soyuz module. A special docking station facilitated interaction among the astronauts. Television stations worldwide broadcast the historic docking and bi-national greeting made by the astronauts. The modules remained docked for two days, during which the teams performed numerous experiments.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The U.S. Postal Service issued this [[se-tenant (philately)|se-tenant]] pair of two 10-cent multicolored stamps on July 15, 1975, at [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida. Inexplicably, the circular program insignia on the left-hand stamp is rotated to the Soviet configuration, showing the red Soyuz section on the left. The [[Soviet Union]] also released stamps of similar design (Russia Scott 4339–4340) at the same time. This denomination paid the domestic first-class rate for letters weighing less than half ounce.

Robert T. McCall designed the 'after link-up' image, and Anatoly Aksamit designed the 'before link-up' image. The [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] produced the stamps on the Andreotti press in sheets of ninety-six stamps, panes of twenty-four. Quantities issued for this pair of postage issues totaled more than 161 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==Viking Mission to Mars, Issue of 1978==
[[File:Viking Mission Mars3 1978 Issue-15c.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; Viking Mission to Mars, 1978 Issue &lt;/center&gt;]]

NASA's [[Viking program]] consisted of a pair of space probes sent to [[Mars]], ''[[Viking I]]'' and ''[[Viking II]]''. Each vehicle was composed of two main parts, an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of [[Mars]] from orbit, and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.&lt;ref&gt;NASA HISTORY – https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon close examination one can discern the engraving of the landing component used to collect soil samples on Mars, the radio dish, landing gear and other equipment rendered by the engraver in this issue. The U.S. Postal Service released this issue at Hampton, Virginia, on July 20, 1978, the second anniversary of the Viking I lander's descent on to the Martian surface.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Missions to Mars." NASA.  – http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/past/viking.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15-cent denomination paid the new domestic rate that had recently increased from 13-cents two months earlier for a first-class letter weighing less than half ounce. It was the second such stamp issued to fulfill that rate.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt; Designed by Robert T. McCall, the issue was printed at the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] on the Giori presses in sheets of 200 stamps which were then cut into panes of fifty stamps for sale at post offices.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

First day of issue ceremony took place July 20, 1978, at Hampton, Va. Quantities issued totaled more than 158 million.&lt;ref name="Scotts-quantity"/&gt;

==Space Achievement Issue==
On May 21, 1981, the Post Office released the Space Achievement commemorative issue, 18-cent stamps, in a block of eight format, one image being shared by four individual stamps, with four more aside them depicting various space exploration imagery. First day of issue occurred at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. The four central stamps depict the [[Space Shuttle]] in its various modes of operation. The central theme of this issue involves the first actual 'in space' flights of the Space Shuttle and also pays tribute to twenty years of U.S. manned space exploration. The other stamps to the left and right sides are honoring the efforts of those who partook in the historical Moon walk, [[Skylab]], and ''[[Pioneer 11]]'' missions. The images were modeled by Clarance Holbert. The stamp design by Robert T. McCall.&lt;ref name="Scotts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

==Space Shuttle Issues==
The U.S. Space Shuttle stamp of 1995 depicts the famous liftoff of the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']], Mission STS-57, which took place on June 21, 1993, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida. This issue was designed by Phil Jordan of Falls Church, Virginia.  As an extra security measure, elliptical perforations were used on sheets of stamps to identify genuine issues from those that might be counterfeited. The postage stamps were manufactured by Ashton-Potter (USA) Ltd. in the offset/intaglio process.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

On June 22, 1995, in Anaheim, California, the [[USPS]] commemorated the [[Space Shuttle Challenger|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'']], STS-7, with the issuance of a 3-dollar postage stamp. Again designed by Phil Jordan, the stamp features the ''Challenger'' Space Shuttle. The name of the Space Shuttle was inscribed in microtype and secretly blended into the design matrix to satisfy concern about matters of security. This was the first time that the Post Office used an actual photograph from a NASA mission, instead of an illustration based on a photograph.  This issue was also printed by Ashton-Potter USA, Ltd., on the offset-intaglio printer.

On November 19, 1998, in New York City, the Post Office issued the Space Shuttle Piggyback $11.75 definitive Express Mail postage stamp.  With all the fanfare surrounding the United States space program, this ceremony was in conjunction with the special First Day of Issue grand event that in New York that year. This issue was also designed by Phil Jordan and was printed by the Banknote Corporation of America.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt;

[[Image:WestShowSdl.jpg|thumb|A western-style show saddle with silver decoration]]
'''Western saddles''' are used for [[western riding]] and are the [[saddle]]s used on working [[horse]]s on [[cattle]] [[ranch]]es throughout the [[United States]], particularly in the west. They are the "[[cowboy]]" saddles familiar to movie viewers, [[rodeo]] fans, and those who have gone on trail rides at [[guest ranch]]es.  This saddle was designed to provide security and comfort to the rider when spending long hours on a horse, traveling over rugged terrain.

The design of the Western saddle derives from the saddles of the Mexican ''[[cowboy|vaquero]]s'' - the early horse trainers and cattle handlers of [[Mexico]] and the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].  It was developed for the purpose of working cattle across vast areas, and came from a combination of the saddles used in the two main styles of [[horseback riding]] then practiced in Spain — ''[[Jinete|la jineta]]'', the [[Moors|Moorish]] style which allowed great freedom of movement to the horse; and ''la estradiota'', later ''la brida'', the [[jousting]] style, which provided great security to the rider and strong control of the horse.  A very functional item was also added: the saddle "horn." This style of saddle allowed vaqueros to control cattle by use of a [[lasso|rope]] around the neck of the animal, tied or dallied (wrapped without a knot) around the horn.

Today, although many Western riders have never roped a cow, the western saddle still features this historical element. (Some variations on the Western saddle design, such as those used in [[bronc riding]], [[endurance riding]] and those made for the rapidly growing [[Europe]]an market, do not have horns.) Another predecessor which may have contributed to the design of the Western saddle was the Spanish tree saddle, which was also influential in the design of the [[McClellan saddle]] of the American military, being used by all branches of the U.S. Army, but being particularly associated with the [[cavalry]].

The Western saddle is designed to be comfortable when ridden in for many hours. Its history and purpose is to be a working tool for a [[cowboy]] who spends all day, every day, on horseback.   For a beginning rider, the western saddle may give the impression of providing a more secure seat.  However, this may be misleading; the horn is not meant to be a handle for the rider to hang onto, and the high cantle and heavy stirrups are not for forcing the rider into a rigid position.  The development of an independent seat and hands is as critical for western riders as for [[English riding|English riders]].

==Construction==
[[Image:WesternSaddleParts.png|300px|thumb|right|Parts of a Western saddle]]

The modern western saddle begins with a "tree" that defines the shape of the bars, the seat, the swells, horn, and cantle.  Traditional trees are made of wood covered with [[rawhide (textile)|rawhide]], coated with varnish or a similar modern synthetic coating.  In some cases, the core of the horn may be of metal.  Modern synthetic materials of various types have also been used instead of wood, but while lighter and less expensive, are generally considered weaker than traditional materials, some, such as [[fiberglass]], dangerously so.  A high-quality tree is at the heart of a good saddle, particularly those used for sports such as [[steer roping]], where the equipment must withstand considerable force.

The tree is usually covered with leather on all visible parts of the saddle.  The seat may have foam rubber or other materials added between the tree and the top layer of leather to provide additional comfort to the rider, and leather or foam padding may be used to slightly alter the contours of the seat.  Sheepskin is placed on the underside of the saddle, covering both the tree and the underside of the skirts.  The [[girth (tack)|cinch]] rings, made of metal, are attached to the tree as described under "Rigging," ''below.''  For decoration, metal [[Wikt|concho]]s, lacing, and small plates, usually silver or a silver-like substitute, are added.

The leather parts of the saddle are often [[Machine tooling|tooled]] into designs that range from simple to complex.  The finest-quality saddles often have hand-carved tooling that itself is considered a work of art.

==Western saddles compared to English saddles==
The Western saddle is different from an  [[English saddle]] in that it has no padding between the tree and the external leather and fleece skirting. The [[weight bearing]] area of the saddle is large and usually covered with sheepskin, but it must be padded with a [[saddle blanket]] in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse.  Western saddles are extensively decorated—the carved leatherwork is often a true work of art—and intricately carved silver conchos and other additions are frequently added to the saddle for show purposes.  More than any other style of saddle, the western saddle can be customized to be a true expression of the rider's taste and style.  A fine quality western saddle, properly maintained, is intended to last for a person's lifetime, or even beyond.

Other differences between the Western and English saddles include:
[[Image:CollegiateEventer.jpg|thumb|left|150px|An English saddle has no horn, no protective fenders and a different padding system on the horse's back]]
* '''[[Stirrups]]:''' Those of the Western saddle cannot detach from the saddle in an emergency, but instead have a wider tread; combined with the rider's high-heeled [[cowboy boot]]s, the design minimizes the risk that the rider's feet will slip through the stirrup during a fall and the rider being dragged.
* '''Cinching (girthing):''' The method of securing the saddle to the horse.  Rather than buckling on as does the English [[Girth (tack)|girth]], the Western girth, known as a ''cinch,'' is anchored with a flat strap of leather or nylon called a ''latigo'' that may be secured with a flat knot, or via holes added so that a buckle can be used, either in place of the knot or in addition to one.
* '''Seat''' and '''Cantle''': These parts of a western saddle are more pronounced than in an English saddle and may provide greater comfort and security to the rider.
*'''Tree''':  The tree of a western saddle is larger and covers more surface area than that of an English saddle.  There is little padding between the tree bars and the underside of a western saddle, whereas much of the weight bearing area on an English saddle is supported by a large amount of internal flocking inside the panels.

While a western saddle is designed to be ridden for many hours at a stretch; for covering distance where time is a factor, such as with [[Endurance riding]], the lighter English saddle dominates.

==Types==
[[File:Tooled roping saddle.jpg|thumb|Full double-rigged [[team roping]] saddle. Note extra wide back cinch]]

There are many types of Western saddle available. Some are general-purpose models while others emphasize either greater freedom for the horse or greater security for the rider, as may be necessary for specialized work in the various Western horse sports such as [[cutting (sport)|cutting]],  [[reining]], [[barrel racing]], [[team roping]], [[equitation]] and [[western pleasure]].  Factors such as width of the swells, height of the cantle, depth of the seat, placement of the stirrups and type of rigging all influence the uses of a given design.  For example, a saddle with wide swells, high cantle and deep seat is suitable for cutting, where a rider must remain in a secure, quiet seat on the horse.  At the other end of the spectrum, a saddle with a "slick fork" - virtually no swells - and a low cantle is suited for [[calf roping]], where a rider must dismount quickly, often while the horse is still in motion, and not be caught up on the saddle.

The most common variations include the following:
*'''Roping saddle:''' Heavy, sturdy saddle  that usually has a thicker horn for securing a [[lasso|rope]], low cantle, and slick fork that allows rider to dismount quickly when needed.
*'''Rodeo bronc riding saddle:''' Hornless, deep seated saddle with wide swells, having small fenders with oxbow style stirrups, originally designed and made by rodeo innovator [[Earl W. Bascom|Earl Bascom]] in 1922.
*'''Cutting saddle:''' Has a deep seat and wide swells allows the rider to sit deep and securely through sharp stops and turns.
*'''Reining saddle:''' Has a deep seat to allow the rider to sit deeply and more freely swinging fenders for more leg movement on the rider's part.
*'''Barrel racing saddle:'''  Lightweight saddle with wide swells and high cantle which allows rider to sit securely but also allows the horse to perform fast sprints and sharp turns.
*'''Endurance saddle:''' Lighter weight than most western saddles, often without a horn, has a tree that spreads the rider's weight out over a large area of the horse's back, thus reducing pounds per square inch.  Often has stirrups hung slightly farther forward, to allow rider to get off the horse's back when traveling at faster speeds. Designed for long rides at faster speeds than a trail saddle.
*'''Trail saddle:''' Designed for maximum comfort of rider as well as a good fit for the horse, features deep, padded seat, designed for long rides at slower speeds.
*'''Show saddle:'''  May be based on roping, cutting, or other trees, but is characterized by additional leather tooling and silver decoration.  Usually features a deep, padded seat that allows the rider to sit quietly and give the appearance of a smooth ride.
*'''"Equitation" saddle:'''  Show saddle with an especially deep seat to help hold a rider in place.

===Design variations===
There are many variations of design and optional equipment elements that were influenced by geographic region, history, use and the body types of horses bred in a given area. Certain stylistic elements seen on some, but not all western saddles include:
[[File:Parade Saddle 04.jpg|thumb|left|Parade saddle with extensive silver plating, tapaderos, and flank trappings]]

*[[Breastcollar]], an additional piece of equipment that runs from the saddle around the chest of the horse, lending both lateral stability and preventing the saddle from sliding back.  Breastcollars are particularly common on trail horses and roping horses and stylized versions are often seen at horse shows. They are generally made out of leather, but may also be made of mohair or synthetic cord similar to a front cinch, or from synthetic materials that resemble leather.
*Back cinch:  A second cinch is often seen on working saddles, particularly full-rigged roping saddles. Made of several thicknesses of leather, it is adjusted just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking.  It prevents the back end of the saddle from rising up in working situations, and when [[team roping]], it also minimizes the saddle fork from digging forward into the horse's withers when a cow is dallied from the saddle horn. The back cinch is generally not required or used on a center-fire or 3/4 rigged saddle.
*Saddle strings, long strips of leather attached to the pommel and back jockey of working saddles, used for tying items to a saddle.
*Horn wrap, primarily seen on roping saddles, extra wraps of leather or other material that thickens the horn and provides support for a dallied lasso.
*[[Tapaderos]], leather covers over the toe that close each stirrup from the front. A tapadero prevents the rider's boot from slipping through and also prevents brush encountered while working cattle on the open range from poking through the stirrup, injuring or impeding the horse or rider.  The tapadero was particularly seen on certain saddles of the [[vaquero]] tradition, but today is primarily a decorative element. Tapaderos are not "show legal" for western-style [[horse show]] competition in most cases, but are often seen on saddles used by [[parade horse]]s.

==Trees==
[[File:Wade Saddle.jpg|thumb|A classic "Wade" saddle, a tree style designed for working ranch horses]]
[[File:Western saddle tree 1.JPG|thumb|The tree for a western saddle.  This one is a manufactured tree of pine covered in fiberglass, an inexpensive design]]
[[File:Western saddle tree 3.JPG|thumb|The underside of a tree for a western saddle.]]
There are several different sizes of trees commonly found in saddles. Trees differ in the width of gullet and bars of the saddle, pitch of the bars (steep to flat, usually between an angle of 86 to 94 degrees with 90 being common), and length of the bars. The tree also influences the shape of the pommel and cantle on the seat on the saddle, though the seat can be altered to fit a rider by adding padding and other materials to a far greater degree than the fit of the saddle tree's bars on a horse.  A wider gullet sits lower on the horse, while a narrow gullet sits higher and is designed to fit horses with higher [[withers]].  The bars form the primary loading surface of the saddle as it site on the horse's back.  A horse with a flat back and widely sprung ribs will require bars with a flatter pitch than a saddle made for a narrow horse, where a steeper pitch to the bars will keep the saddle placed properly.  Most saddles are made with pre-manufactured trees which come in a limited range of sizes.  Custom-made saddles may be able to have further alterations made to a standard tree.

*'''Regular''' - If a manufacturer has a 'regular' barred saddle it usually falls between 5¾" and 6". Often 90 degrees
*'''Semi Quarter Horse''' - This type usually has a gullet width of about 6½ inches and steeper bars than most other trees.  It is the narrowest common tree and, despite its name,  fits many breeds of horse. Often 90 degrees
*'''Quarter Horse''' /'''Full Quarter Horse''' - Terminology varies with manufacturer, but overall design is intended to fit [[stock horse]] breeds such as the [[American Quarter Horse]].  This type usually has a gullet width of about 6¾ inches, but may be up to 7&amp;nbsp;inches. It usually has a flatter pitch than the Semi-Quarter horse tree. Different makers tend to give different gullet dimensions in Quarter Horse and Full Quarter Horse trees. Usually between 90 and 94 degrees
*'''Arabian''' -  Depending on manufacturer, has a 6½" - 6¾" width gullet but a very flat pitch to the tree.  Usually has shorter bars than Full- and Semi- Quarter horse trees. Intended to fit smaller horses with short but wide backs, such as the stock horse-type [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and [[Morgan horse|Morgan]].
*'''Haflinger''' (7½" gullet) are very wide, designed for semi-draft breeds such as the [[Haflinger horse]], which are short-backed, heavy, low-withered horses. Often have a flat pitch (usually greater than 94 degrees) and very little rock.
*'''Draft''' - (8" gullet), are designed for riding [[Draft horse]]s. Usually greater than 94 degrees
*'''Pony''' - narrow gullet, flat pitch to the bars, very short tree, designed for children and smaller ponies such as the [[Shetland pony|Shetland]] and [[Welsh pony]].

==Rigging==
[[Image:RiggingDiagram.jpg|thumb|In-skirt rigging of a western show saddle, showing latigo and buckled cinch. The colored circles indicate the various options for placement of the rigging on a western saddle. The saddle shown has a "full" rigging position, shown by the yellow circle.  The green circle indicates the placement of a 7/8 rigging, blue shows 3/4 rigging, and the red circle shows the historic "center fire" position.]]

'''Saddle rigging''' refers to the arrangement of rings and plate hardware that connects the billets and girthing system that holds the saddle on the horse.  Western saddle rigging can be either single or double. The front rigging consists of metal "cinch rings" on each side of the saddle to which a long, wide strap called a latigo is attached for holding the  front [[girth (tack)|cinch]] that goes around the [[horse anatomy|heart girth]] of the horse, just behind the elbows.  The back cinch is placed around the widest part of the horse's barrel, and is attached to the saddle either by reinforced slots in the leather skirting of the saddle, or, in particularly heavy-duty models, to a second set of rings.

The '''front [[girth (tack)|cinch]]''' is secured to the saddle by means of a latigo on the left, and on the right, by either a latigo or a billet.  Latigos are not removed until worn out or broken.  They run through the ring or buckle of the cinch (also called a cinch ring), and back to the rigging, sometimes multiple times for extra security.  Modern latigos have several holes at the end so that a cinch can be buckled at a set tension, though the cinch may also be secured by a knot called a "latigo knot," which is a type of [[half-hitch]].   The off-side billet is a shorter, doubled piece of leather with holes along its length, somewhat heavier and less flexible than latigo leather.  It runs through the rigging cinch ring and both ends buckle onto the cinch.  Older saddles may use a latigo on the off side, but this is less common.  Once adjusted to the horse, an off-side latigo or billet is seldom disconnected from the cinch, which remains attached to the saddle until it needs to be replaced, unlike the [[girth (tack)|girth]] of an English saddle, which is to be removed on both sides when not in use.  While leather is preferred for latigos, nylon web is sometimes used, particularly on cheaper saddles, though it is prone to slip when knotted and the holes may tear more easily.

When used, a '''back cinch''', made of several thicknesses of leather, is held on by a simple heavy leather billet on each side of the saddle that buckles just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking.  At the belly midline, the front and back cinches are joined by a light belly strap, called a cinch hobble, that prevents the back cinch from moving too far back.

===Rigging placement===
A saddle that has only a [[Girth (tack)|cinch]] in the front is "single rigged". A saddle that has both a front cinch and a back cinch (sometimes called a flank cinch, even though it should never go around the horse's flanks) is "double rigged". The rear rigging is meant to stabilize the saddle. The back cinch is always located just below the cantle and held in place with a cinch hobble to prevent it from slipping back; however, the position of the front rigging varies. The rig positions are named by how far they are from the cantle to the fork.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;[http://www.western-saddle-guide.com/saddle-rigging.html Western Saddle Guide. (2008). Retrieved on October 10, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Placement of the front rigging is a critical component of western saddle design. The closer the rigging is to the center of the saddle, the more the rider will be balanced over the [[horse's center of balance]], allowing freer movement and agility of horse and rider.  On the other hand, the more forward the rigging is set, especially when combined with a back cinch, the more the saddle will set down on the horse, placing the rider a bit behind the horse's center of balance, but creating greater security.

*'''Full rigging''' refers to the most forward position, where the front cinch ring is placed located under the center of the fork or swells of the saddle.  Spanish settlers of North America originally used full rigging, but without a back cinch, this type of rigging was a disadvantage because the saddle would rise in the back while traveling over rough terrain.
*'''Center fire''' is the rigging design placed closest to the center of the saddle.  Historically, it replaced the full rigging. Center fire rigging is located halfway between the cantle and the fork and was always single-rigged. This type is rarely seen on western saddles today, but was used during the 1800s, and notably on the [[McClellan saddle]] of the U.S. Army.&lt;ref name="Guide"/&gt; The Pony Express saddle also had center fire rigging.
*Modern saddles also use two additional positions, called "seven-eighths" (written '''7/8''') and "three-quarter" (written '''3/4''').  3/4 rigging is located three-quarters of the way from the cantle to the fork; thus halfway between center fire and full positions. 7/8 rigging is 7/8 of the way from the cantle to the fork; or halfway between 3/4 and full.[[File:Three way rigging demo.jpg|thumb|One type of three way rigging, (Open three-way design) showing different methods of latigo attachment to achieve the desired position]]
*'''Three-way rigging''' utilizes various designs of multi-position cinch rings to combine the Full, 7/8 and 3/4 positions in one piece of hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saddleonline.com/blogs/content/different-styles-western-saddle-rigging |title=Different Styles of Western Saddle Rigging |publisher=saddleonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Full position is achieved when the latigo is attached to the front ring. 7/8ths position has the latigo attached to both the front and the back ring, and the 3/4 position has the latigo attached at the back ring.
*Flank cinches were added after the [[rodeo]] sports of [[calf roping]] and [[team roping]] became popular. The flank cinch was added in order to keep the saddle from tipping in the back when a [[lasso]] was tied or dallied to the saddle horn. As a result, the 3/4 and 7/8 front rigging positions were also developed.

Custom built saddles may be designed with any of the above rigging styles.   Modern western saddles for riders who need speed and agility, such as [[barrel racing]] saddles, often have a 3/4 rigging, the closest placement to a center-fire rigging seen on modern saddles.  The most popular modern rigging placement is the 7/8 rigging, which allows a rider to have a secure seat but more easily stay centered over a horse's center of balance and is often seen on saddles used for western [[equitation]].  A "full double" rigging is seen most often on saddles used for [[team roping]], where the weight of the steer puts tremendous forward stress on the saddle, requiring rigging set well forward and both a front and back cinch to support the saddle. A few saddles are built with a three-way rigging plate that allows a saddle to be rigged in the full, 7/8 or 3/4 positions.

===Rigging attachment styles===
The front rigging is attached to the saddle in one of three ways: ring, flat plate or in-skirt. Ring rigging is made of rings on heavy leather straps attached directly to the saddle tree. This is the strongest attachment method, but a disadvantage is that it creates bulk under the legs and inhibits the free swing of the stirrups. The second style of attachment is the flat plate. This type has leather layers that are riveted around a metal plate and attached directly to the tree of the saddle. This is also a very strong type of ring attachment that reduces bulk under the leg and does not inhibit the swinging of the stirrups, though it is not as strong as ring rigging.

The third style is the in-skirt, where the rings or plates are attached directly to the saddle's skirt. The advantage of having an in-skirt rigging is that it provides the least amount of bulk under the leg compared to the other styles of attachment.  Two variations exist, the built-in and the built-on.  The "built-in" rigging design makes the attachment of the rings very strong by sandwiching the rings with layers of leather and then sewing and riveting them to the skirt.  This design is strong enough for [[pleasure riding]] but not for roping.  It has the least amount of bulk under the leg and is popular for show saddles.  A "built-on" rigging attaches the plate to the surface of the skirt, a weak placement of low quality.&lt;ref name="Guide"/&gt;

Historic saddles of the 19th century had rigging rings made of forged iron round stock, which would rust if it was exposed to the horse's sweat. The iron oxide would degrade and rot the leather that it came in contact with, which caused the rigging straps that were held by the rings to break. In order to correct this problem, saddle makers covered the metal rings in 4-5 ounces of medium thickness belly leather. This was a common remedy for the problem until approximately 1915, when brass rigging hardware became more common.

===Western sidesaddle rigging===
[[File:Half Arabian Ladies Western Sidesaddle (2668749735).jpg|thumb|A modern western sidesaddle]]

The Goodnight western [[sidesaddle]] that was developed in the 1870s by [[Charles Goodnight]] for his wife was a double rigged design.  Goodnight developed this sidesaddle because there was a need to produce a woman's saddle for daily riding and work on the range. The saddle also had to fit a variety of horses on a day-to-day basis. it required two cinches. The cinches have a connecting strap, called a cinch hobble, to keep the rear girth from slipping back, which would cause the horse to buck. The girthing system still produced a shimmy in the rear, even though the rear cinch was brought up snugly against the horse. The double girthing system was not as secure as the balance strap seen on many modern sidesaddles.&lt;ref name="Flemmer"&gt;[http://www.sidesaddle.com/Goodnight%20%western%20side%20saddles.Article.htm Flemmer, L.
