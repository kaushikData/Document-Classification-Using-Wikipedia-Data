      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4991">'''Alejandro Rossi''' ('''Alessandro Rossi''', September 22, 1932 - June 5, 2009) was born in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] of [[Venezuela]]n mother and Italian father) was an [[Italians|Italian]]-[[Venezuela]]n writer.

Alejandro Rossi wrote [[philosophy|philosophical]] essays, [[short story|short stories]] and the following books: ''[[Lenguaje y significado]]'' (Language and Meaning) (Siglo XXI, 1968, FCE, 1995, 7th edition); ''[[Manual del Distraído]]'' [http://webshells.com/spantrans/rossi.htm Manual of the Absent-minded] (J. Mortiz, 1978, [[Anagrama]], 1980, Monte Avila, 1987, FCE, 1992, 6th edition); ''[[Sueños de Occam]]'' (Occam's Dreams) (UNAM, 1982); ''[[La fábula de Las Regiones]]'' (the Fable of The Regions) (El Equilibrista, 1989), ''Edén: Vida imaginada'' (FCE, 2006). ''[[Ortega y Gasset]]'' in [[collaboration]] (FCE, 1984); he edited [[José Gaos]]' Anthology: ''[[Filosofía de la Filosofía]]'' (Philosophy of Philosophy) (Crítica, 1989). Rossi won the Premio Nacional de Lingüística y Literatura (National Literary and Linguistics Prize) in 1999.

Rossi's writing is marked by a rich language that plays with generic definitions.[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=336779&amp;CategoryId=13003]

== Independent and Collaborative Works ==
Rossi was co-founder and co-director of the Hispanic-American magazine ''Crítica'' ("Critic")''.'' He was also a member of the editing board for the magazine ''Plural'' and acted as the interim director for the magazine ''Vuelta.'' In 1983, Rossi was invited to attend St. Anthony's College in [[University of Oxford]] in [[Great Britain]]. Then in 1989, Rossi edited and wrote the foreword for the anthology [[José Gaos]]: ''Filosofía de la Filosofía'' ("José Gaos: The Philosophy of Philosophy") (Crítica)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ordonez Burgos|first=Jorge|year=2011|title=Filosofía de la filosofía: Selección de textos de Alejandro Rossi|url=http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0188-66492011000200012|journal=Tópicos (México)|volume=41|pages=340–349|via=SciELO}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also collaborated with various foreign others in books like ''Philosophie und Rechtstheorie in Mexiko'' (Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlín, 1989) and ''Philosophical Analysis in Latin America'' (Jorge J. E. Gracia et al., 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Jorge J. E.|year=1984|title=Philosophical Analysis of Latin America|jstor=27743669|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=1|pages=111–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his other well-known works include ''Manual del Distraído'' ("Manual of the Distracted") (1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letraslibres.com/mexico-espana/libros/obras-reunidas-alejandro-rossi|title=Obras reunidas de Alejandro Rossi|last=Domínguez Michael|first=Christopher|date=30 September 2005|website=Letras libres|publisher=Editorial Vuelta|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Fábula de las Regiones'' ("The Legend of the Regions") (1997), and ''Lenguaje y significado'' ("Language and Meaning") (1968). On the same note, in a volume written in collaboration with other authors (FCE, 1984, 1996), Rossi paid homage to one of mainstays of his form of thought, [[José Ortega y Gasset|José Ortega and Gasset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/20090607/cultura-literatura/muere-escritor-alejandro-rossi-200906071744.html|title=Muere el escritor Alejandro Rossi, la navaja de la filosofía en la literatura|last=Demicheli|first=Tulio|date=10 June 2009|website=ABC.es|publisher=Diario ABC, S.L.|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colnal.mx/members/alejandro-rossi|title=Alejandro Rossi|last=|first=|date=|website=El Colegio Nacional|publisher=El Colegio Nacional|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his work for ''Plural'', Rossi also wrote supplemental articles on culture for the newspaper ''[[Excélsior]]'' which, at the time, was headed by the poet [[Octavio Paz]] and under the editorship of [[Julio Scherer García]]. In 1976, the newspaper was subdued by members of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) led by Luis Echeverría Álvarez (1970-1976) -- due to the newspaper's views against his administration—leaving Rossi to follow Paz and his coworkers in founding the literary review ''Vuelta'' of which Rossi served as the interim director for a few months. From there, Rossi became part of the review's editing board until the very last day of publication. ''Vuelta'' later came to receive the [[Princess of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] (Spanish: ''Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Comunicación y Humanidades'') in 1993.

The method consists of the synthesis of an ancestral [[gene]] and expression of the corresponding ancestral [[protein]].&lt;ref name=thornton/&gt; The idea of protein 'resurrection' was suggested in 1963 by Pauling and Zuckerkandl.&lt;ref&gt;Pauling, L. &amp; Zuckerkandl, E.

Unlike conventional evolutionary and biochemical approaches to studying proteins, i.e. the so-called ''horizontal'' comparison of related protein [[Sequence homology|homologues]] from different branch ends of the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]; ASR probes the statistically inferred ancestral proteins within the nodes of the tree – in a ''vertical'' manner (see diagram, right). This approach gives access to protein properties that may have transiently arisen over evolutionary time and has recently been used as a way to infer the potential [[Evolutionary pressure|selection pressures]] that resulted in the present day sequences seen today. ASR has been used to probe the causative mutation that resulted in a protein's [[neofunctionalization]] after duplication by first determining that said mutation was located between ancestors '5' and '4' on the diagram (illustratively) using functional assays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Douglas P.|last2=Whitney|first2=Dustin S.|last3=Hanson-Smith|first3=Victor|last4=Woznica|first4=Arielle|last5=Campodonico-Burnett|first5=William|last6=Volkman|first6=Brian F.|last7=King|first7=Nicole|last8=Thornton|first8=Joseph W.|last9=Prehoda|first9=Kenneth E.|date=2016-01-07|title=Evolution of an ancient protein function involved in organized multicellularity in animals|journal=eLife|volume=5|pages=e10147|doi=10.7554/eLife.10147|issn=2050-084X|pmc=4718807|pmid=26740169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of protein [[biophysics]], ASR has also been used to study the development of a protein's thermodynamic and kinetic landscapes over evolutionary time as well as protein folding pathways by combining many modern day analytical techniques such as [[Protein mass spectrometry|HX/MS]].&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; These sort of insights are typically inferred from several ancestors reconstructed along a phylogeny – referring to the previous analogy, by studying nodes ''higher and higher'' (further and further back in evolutionary time) within the tree of life.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harms|first=Michael J.|last2=Thornton|first2=Joseph W.|date=2013-08-01|title=Evolutionary biochemistry: revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v14/n8/full/nrg3540.html|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=559–571|doi=10.1038/nrg3540|issn=1471-0056|pmc=4418793|pmid=23864121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ASR studies are conducted ''in vitro'', and have revealed ancestral protein properties that seem to be evolutionarily desirable traits – such as increased thermostability, catalytic activity and catalytic promiscuity. These data have been accredited to artifacts of the ASR algorithms, as well as indicative illustrations of ancient Earth's environment – often, ASR research must be complemented with extensive controls (usually alternate ASR experiments) to mitigate algorithmic error. It should also be noted that not all studied ASR proteins exhibit this so-called 'ancestral superiority'.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Shion A.|last2=Hart|first2=Kathryn M.|last3=Harms|first3=Michael J.|last4=Marqusee|first4=Susan|date=2016-11-15|title=Evolutionary trend toward kinetic stability in the folding trajectory of RNases H|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=113|issue=46|pages=13045–13050|doi=10.1073/pnas.1611781113|issn=1091-6490|pmc=5135364|pmid=27799545}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nascent field of '[[Biochemistry|evolutionary biochemistry]]' has been bolstered by the recent increase in ASR studies using the ancestors as ways to probe organismal fitness within certain cellular contexts – effectively testing ancestral proteins ''in vivo''.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; Due to inherent limitations in these sorts of studies – primarily being the lack of suitably ancient genomes to fit these ancestors in to, the small repertoire of well categorised laboratory model systems, and the inability to mimic ancient cellular environments; very few ASR studies ''in vivo'' have been conducted. Despite the above mentioned obstacles, preliminary insights into this avenue of research from a 2015 paper, have revealed that observed 'ancestral superiority' ''in vitro'' were not recapitulated ''in vivo'' of a given protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Joanne K.|last2=Prentice|first2=Erica J.|last3=Groussin|first3=Mathieu|last4=Arcus|first4=Vickery L.|date=2015-10-01|title=Reconstructed Ancestral Enzymes Impose a Fitness Cost upon Modern Bacteria Despite Exhibiting Favourable Biochemical Properties|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Reconstructed+Ancestral+Enzymes+Impose+a+Fitness+Cost+upon+Modern+Bacteria+Despite+Exhibiting+Favourable+Biochemical+Properties|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|volume=81|issue=3-4|pages=110–120|doi=10.1007/s00239-015-9697-5|issn=1432-1432|pmid=26349578}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR presents one of a few mechanisms to study biochemistry of the [[Precambrian]] era of life (&gt;541[[Millions of years ago|Ma]]) and is hence often used in '[[paleogenetics]]'; indeed Zuckerandl and Pauling originally intended ASR to be the starting point of a field they termed 'Paleobiochemistry'.

==Methodology==

Several related homologues of the protein of interest are selected and aligned in a [[multiple sequence alignment]] (MSA), a '[[phylogenetic tree]]' is constructed with statistically inferred sequences at the nodes of the branches. It is these sequences that are the so-called 'ancestors' – the process of synthesising the corresponding DNA, transforming it into a cell and producing a protein is the so-called 'reconstruction'. Ancestral sequences are typically calculated by [[maximum likelihood]], however [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] methods are also implemented. Because the ancestors are inferred from a phylogeny, the topology and composition of the phylogeny plays a major role in the output ASR sequences. Given that there is much discourse and debate over how to construct phylogenies – for example whether or not thermophilic bacteria are basal or derivative in bacterial evolution – many ASR papers construct several phylogenies with differing topologies and hence differing ASR sequences. These sequences are then compared and often several (~10) are expressed and studied per phylogenetic node. It should be noted that ASR does not claim to recreate the actual sequence of the ancient protein/DNA, but rather a sequence that is likely to be similar to the one that was indeed at the node. This is not considered a shortcoming of ASR as it fits into the '[[Neutral network (evolution)|neutral network]]' model of protein evolution, whereby at evolutionary junctions (nodes) a population of genotypically different but phenotypically similar protein sequences existed in the extant organismal population. Hence, it is possible that ASR would generate one of the sequences of a node's neutral network and while it may not represent the genotype of the last common ancestor of the modern day sequences, it does likely represent the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; This is supported by the modern day observation that many mutations in a protein's non-catalytic/functional site cause minor changes in biophysical properties. Hence, ASR allows one to probe the biophysical properties of past proteins and is indicative of ancient genetics.

Maximum likelihood (ML) methods work by generating a sequence where the residue at each position is predicted to be the most likely to occupy said position by the method of inference used – typically this is a [[Position weight matrix|scoring matrix]] (similar to those used in [[BLAST]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s or MSAs) calculated from extant sequences. Alternate methods include [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|maximum parsimony]] (MP) that construct a sequence based on a model of sequence evolution – usually the idea that the minimum number of nucleotidal sequence changes represents the most efficient route for evolution to take and by [[Occam's razor]] is the most likely. MP is often considered the least reliable method for reconstruction as it arguably oversimplifies evolution to a degree that is not applicable on the billion year scale. Another method involves the consideration of residue uncertainty – so-called Bayesian methods – this form of ASR is sometimes used to compliment ML methods but typically produces more ambiguous sequences. In ASR, the term 'ambiguity' refers to residue positions where no clear substitution can be predicted – often in these cases, several ASR sequences are produced, encompassing most of the ambiguities and compared to one-another. ML ASR often needs complimenting experiments to indicate that the derived sequences are more than just consensuses of the input sequences. This is particularly necessary in the observation of 'Ancestral Superiority'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Lucas C.|last2=Lim|first2=Shion A.|last3=Marqusee|first3=Susan|last4=Harms|first4=Michael J.|date=2016-06-01|title=The thermostability and specificity of ancient proteins|journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology|volume=38|pages=37–43|doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2016.05.015|issn=1879-033X|pmc=5010474|pmid=27288744}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the trend of increasing thermostability, one explanation is that ML ASR creates a consensus sequence of several different, parallel mechanisms evolved to confer minor protein thermostability throughout the phylogeny – leading to an additive effect resulting in 'superior' ancestral thermostability.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Risso|first=Valeria A.|last2=Gavira|first2=Jose A.|last3=Sanchez-Ruiz|first3=Jose M.|date=2014-06-01|title=Thermostable and promiscuous Precambrian proteins|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1462-2920.12319/abstract|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1485–1489|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12319|issn=1462-2920}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of consensus sequences and parallel ASR via non-ML methods are often required to disband this theory per experiment. One other concern raised by ML methods is that the scoring matrices are derived from modern sequences and particular amino acid frequencies seen today may not be the same as in Precambrian biology, resulting in skewed sequence inference. Several studies have attempted to construct ancient scoring matrices via various methodologies and have compared the resultant sequences and their protein's biophysical properties. While these modified sequences result in somewhat different ASR sequences, the observed biophysical properties did not seem to vary outside from experimental error.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaucher|first=Eric A.|last2=Govindarajan|first2=Sridhar|last3=Ganesh|first3=Omjoy K.|date=2008-02-07|title=Palaeotemperature trend for Precambrian life inferred from resurrected proteins|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v451/n7179/abs/nature06510.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=451|issue=7179|pages=704–707|doi=10.1038/nature06510|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the 'holistic' nature of ASR and the intense complexity that arises when one considers all the possible sources of experimental error – the experimental community considers the ultimate measurement of ASR reliability to be the comparison of several alternate ASR reconstructions of the same node and the identification of similar biophysical properties. While this method does not offer a robust statistical, mathematical measure of reliability it does build off of the fundamental idea used in ASR that individual amino acid substitutions do not cause significant biophysical property changes in a protein – a tenant that must be held true in order to be able to overcome the effect of inference ambiguity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/ancestral-sequence-reconstruction-9780199299188?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction|date=2007-07-26|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199299188|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates used for ASR are often selected based on the particular property of interest being studied – e.g. thermostability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By selecting sequences from either end of a property's range (e.g., psychrophilic proteins and thermophilic proteins) but ''within'' a protein family, ASR can be used to probe the specific sequence changes that conferred the observed biophysical effect – such as stabilising interactions. Consider in the diagram, if sequence 'A' encoded a protein that was optimally functional at neutral pHs and 'D' in acidic conditions, sequence changes between '5' and '2' may illustrate the precise biophysical explanation for this difference. It should be noted that as ASR experiments can extract ancestors that are likely billions of years old, there are often tens if not hundreds of sequence changes between ancestors themselves and ancestors and extant sequences – because of this, such sequence-function evolutionary studies can take a lot of work and rational direction.&lt;ref name="thornton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thornton | first1 = J.W. | year = 2004 | title = Resurrecting ancient genes: experimental analysis of extinct molecules | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 366–375 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1324 | pmid=15143319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v5/n5/fig_tab/nrg1324_F1.html#figure-title Figure 1] from reference {{Cite journal|last=Harms|first=Michael J.|last2=Thornton|first2=Joseph W.|date=2013-08-01|title=Evolutionary biochemistry: revealing the historical and physical causes of protein properties|url=|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=en|volume=14|issue=8|pages=559–571|doi=10.1038/nrg3540|issn=|pmc=4418793|pmid=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrected proteins==
There are many examples of ancestral proteins that have been computationally reconstructed, expressed in living cell lines, and – in many cases – purified and biochemically studied.

It should be noted that the 'age' of a reconstructed sequence is determined using a [[molecular clock]] model, and often several are employed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battistuzzi|first=Fabia U|last2=Feijao|first2=Andreia|last3=Hedges|first3=S Blair|date=2004-11-09|title=A genomic timescale of prokaryote evolution: insights into the origin of methanogenesis, phototrophy, and the colonization of land|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=4|pages=44|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-44|issn=1471-2148|pmc=533871|pmid=15535883}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dating technique is often calibrated using geological time-points (such as ancient ocean constituents or [[Banded iron formation|BIF]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) and while these clocks offer the only method of inferring a very ancient protein's age, they have sweeping error margins and are diffuclt to defend against contrary data. To this end, ASR 'age' should really be only used as an indicative feature and is often surpassed altogether for a measurement of the number of substitutions between the ancestral and the modern sequences (the fundiment on which the clock is calculated).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That being said, the use of a clock allows one to compare observed biophysical data of an ASR protein to the geological or ecological environment at the time. For example, ASR studies on bacterial [[EF-Tu]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (proteins involved in [[Translation (biology)|translation]], that are likely rarely subject to [[Horizontal gene transfer|HGT]] and typically exhibit [[Protein melting temperature|Tms]] ~2C greater than [[Environmental growth temperature|Tenv]]) indicate a hotter Precambrian earth which fits very closely with geological data on ancient earth ocean temperatures based on [[Oxygen-18]] isotopic levels.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; ASR studies of yeast Adhs reveal that the emergence of [[Subfunctionalization|subfunctionalized]] Adhs for ethanol metabolism (not just waste excretion) arose at a time similar to the dawn of fleshy fruit in the [[Cambrian]] era and that before this emergence, Adh served to excrete ethanol as a byproduct of excess [[Pyruvic acid|pyruvate]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of a clock also perhaps indicates that the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]] occurred before the earliest molecular fossils indicate (&gt;4.1Ga), but given the debatable reliability of molecular clocks, such observations should be taken with caution.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Elizabeth A.|last2=Boehnke|first2=Patrick|last3=Harrison|first3=T.

==Significance==

These experiments address various important questions in evolutionary biology: does [[evolution]] proceed in small steps or in large leaps; is evolution reversible; how does [[Evolution of biological complexity|complexity]] evolve? It has been shown that slight [[mutations]] in the amino acid sequence of hormone receptors determine an important change in their preferences for hormones. These changes mean huge steps in the evolution of the [[endocrine system]]. Thus very small changes at the molecular level may have enormous consequences. The Thornton lab has also been able to show that evolution is irreversible studying the [[glucocorticoid receptor]]. This receptor was changed by seven mutations in a cortisol receptor, but reversing these mutations didn't give the original receptor back. Indicating that [[epistasis]] plays a major role in protein evolution – an observation that in combination with the observations of several examples of parallel evolution, support the neutral network model mentioned above.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Other earlier [[neutral mutation]]s acted as a [[Ratchet (device)|ratchet]] and made the changes to the receptor irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bridgham | first1 = JT | last2 = Ortlund | first2 = EA | last3 = Thornton | first3 = JW | year = 2009 | title = An epistatic ratchet constrains the direction of glucocorticoid receptor evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = | pages = 515–519 | doi = 10.1038/nature08249 | pmid=19779450}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different experiments on receptors show that, during their evolution, proteins are greatly differentiated and this explains how complexity may evolve. A closer look at the different ancestral hormone receptors and the various [[hormone]]s shows that at the level of interaction between single amino acid residues and chemical groups of the hormones arise by very small but specific changes. Knowledge about these changes may for example lead to the synthesis of hormonal equivalents capable of mimicking or inhibiting the action of a hormone, which might open possibilities for new therapies.

Given that ASR has revealed a tendency towards ancient thermostability and enzymatic promiscuity, ASR poses as a valuable tool for [[Protein engineering|protein engineers]] who often desire these traits (producing effects sometimes greater than current, rationally lead tools).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; ASR also promises to 'resurrect' phenotipically similar 'ancient organisms' which in turn would allow evolutionary biochemists to probe the story of life. Proponents of ASR such as Benner state that through these and other experiments, the end of the current century will see a level of understanding in biology analogous to the one that arose in classical chemistry in the last century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Chantal Maillard''' (born 1951) is a contemporary Spanish poet and philosopher.

With a long repertoire behind her, she has received various literary prizes for her poetry. She was awarded the Premio Nacional de Poesía in Spain in 2004 for her work ''Matar a Platón'' and the Premio de la Crítica for Spanish Poetry in 2007, as well as the Premio Andalucía de la Crítica for her work ''Hilos''. Her prose is particularly characterized for merging and transgressing literary genres. Her essays mainly concern philosophy and sometimes focus on [[María Zambrano]].

After receiving her doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Málaga, she spent long periods traveling and living in India, specializing in Philosophy and Religions from India at the Banaras Hindu University. Until 2000, she was a professor of Aesthetics and Art Theory at the University of Málaga, where was instrumental in the creation of the Department of Comparative Philosophy and Aesthetics.

Since 1998, she has written articles on philosophy, aesthetics and Eastern Thought for several publications such as ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' and ''[[El País]]''. She has translated and edited the work of [[Henri Michaux]], and is also known for her efforts to promote philosophy from India in many of her works.

Chantal Maillard has also worked on stage and adapted her works to various interdisciplinary projects, in collaboration with visual and stage artists, musicians and filmmakers from Spain and around the world.

The practice of '''charity''' means the voluntary giving of help to those in need, as a [[humanitarian]] act.

== Etymology ==
The word ''charity'' originated in late [[Old English]] to mean a "[[Christian]] love of one's fellows,"&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=293 |date=2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up until at least the beginning of the [[20th century]], this meaning remained synonymous with ''charity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of current English |date=1912 |pages=137–138 |url=https://archive.org/stream/conciseoxforddic00fowlrich#page/136/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Charity, or Christian Love. A sermon, etc |date=1837 |last=Crisp |first=Thomas Steffe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7fOBKf1YPEC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Christian love : or charity an essential element of true Christian character |date=1850 |last=Wise |first=Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Wise (author) |url=https://archive.org/details/christianloveorc00wise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Charity and Its Fruits: Or, Christian Love as Manifested in the Heart and Life |date=1852 |orig-year=1738 |last=Edwards |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Edwards (theologian) |url=https://archive.org/details/christianloveorc00wise}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from this original meaning, ''charity'' is etymologically linked to Christianity, with the word originally entering into the [[English language]] through the [[Old French]] word "''charité''", which was derived from the [[Latin]] "''caritas''", a word commonly used in the [[Vulgate]] [[New Testament]] to translate the Greek word ''[[agape]]'' ({{linktext|ἀγάπη}}), a distinct form of "''[[Love (religious views)#Christian|love]]''"&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/charity |date=2018 |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |title=Charity origin and meaning |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the article: [[Charity (virtue)]]).

Over time, the meaning of ''charity'' has shifted from one of "Christian love" to that of "providing for those in need; generosity and giving,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of Charity |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/charity |publisher=Merriam-Webster |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt; a transition which began with the Old French word ''charité''.&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; Thus, while the older [[Douay-Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]] and [[King James Version|King James]] versions of the [[Bible]] translate instances of "''agape''" (such as those that appear in [[1 Corinthians 13]]) as "''charity''", modern English versions of the Bible typically translate "''agape''" as  "''love.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm |title=1 Corinthians 13:1 |access-date=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charitable giving is the act of giving money, goods or time to the unfortunate, either directly or by means of a [[charitable trust]] or other worthy cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marquis|first=Christopher|last2=Tilcsik|first2=András|date=2016-10-01|title=Institutional Equivalence: How Industry and Community Peers Influence Corporate Philanthropy|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|journal=Organization Science|volume=27|issue=5|pages=1325–1341|doi=10.1287/orsc.2016.1083|issn=1047-7039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charitable giving as a religious act or duty is referred to as almsgiving or alms. The name stems from the most obvious expression of the [[virtue]] of charity; giving the recipients of it the means they need to survive. The impoverished, particularly those widowed or orphaned, and the ailing or injured, are generally regarded as the proper recipients of charity. The people who cannot support themselves and lack outside means of support sometimes become "[[Begging|beggars]]", directly soliciting aid from strangers encountered in public.

Some groups regard charity as being distributed towards other members from within their particular group. Although giving to those nearly connected to oneself is sometimes called charity—as in the saying "Charity begins at home"—normally charity denotes giving to those not related, with [[filial piety]] and like terms for supporting one's family and friends.  Indeed, treating those related to the giver as if they were strangers in need of charity has led to the figure of speech "as cold as charity"—providing for one's relatives as if they were strangers, without affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunn|first=Alison|title=As 'cold as charity'?:* poverty, equity and the charitable trust|journal=Legal Studies|volume=20|issue=2|pages=222–240|doi=10.1111/j.1748-121X.2000.tb00141.x|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most forms of charity are concerned with providing basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, healthcare and shelter, but other actions may be performed as charity:  visiting the imprisoned or the homebound, ransoming captives, educating orphans, even social movements. Donations to causes that benefit the unfortunate indirectly, such as donations to fund cancer research, are also charity.

With regards to religious aspects, the recipient of charity may offer to pray for the benefactor. In medieval Europe, it was customary to feast the poor at the funeral in return for their prayers for the deceased.  Institutions may commemorate benefactors by displaying their names, up to naming buildings or even the institution itself after the benefactors.  If the recipient makes material return of more than a token value, the transaction is normally not called charity.

In the past{{which|date=March 2016}} century, many [[charitable organization]]s have created a "charitable model" in which donators give to conglomerates give to recipients. Examples of this include the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation|Make a Wish Foundation]] (John Cena holds the title for most wishes granted by a single individual, with over 450 wishes) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. Today some charities have modernized, and allow people to donate online, through websites such as [[JustGiving]]. Originally charity entailed the benefactor directly giving the goods to the receiver.  This practice was continued by some individuals, for example, "[[CNN Heroes|CNN Hero]]" [[Sal Dimiceli]], and service organizations, such as the [[Jaycees]]. With the rise of more [[social peer-to-peer processes]], many charities are moving away from the charitable model and starting to adopt this more direct donator to recipient approach. Examples of this include [[Global Giving]] (direct funding of community development projects in developing countries), [[DonorsChoose]] (for US-based projects), [http://purecharity.org/ PureCharity], [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva]] (funding loans administered by microfinance organizations in developing countries) and [[Zidisha]] (funding individual microfinance borrowers directly).

Institutions evolved to carry out the labor of assisting the poor, and these institutions, called [[Charitable organization|charities]], provide the bulk of charitable giving today, in terms of monetary value.  These include [[orphanage]]s, [[food bank]]s, [[religious institute]]s dedicated to care of the poor, [[hospital]]s, organizations that visit the homebound and imprisoned, and many others.  Such institutions allow those whose time or inclination does not lend themselves to directly care for the poor to enable others to do so, both by providing money for the work and supporting them while they do the work.  Institutions can also attempt to more effectively sort out the actually needy from those who fraudulently claim charity.  Early Christians particularly recommended the care of the unfortunate to the charge of the local bishop.

There have been examinations of who gives more to charity.  One study conducted in the United States found that as a percentage of income, charitable giving increased as income decreased.  The poorest fifth of Americans, for example, gave away 4.3% of their income, while the wealthiest fifth gave away 2.1%.  In absolute terms, this was an average of $453 on an average income of $10,531, compared to $3,326 on an income of $158,388.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009253657_charity23.html "America's poor are its most generous donors"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527080829/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009253657_charity23.html |date=May 27, 2009 }}, by Frank Greve, McClatchy Newspapers as appears in the ''Seattle Times'', published May 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
Critics of charitable giving contend that simply transferring gifts or money to disadvantaged people has negative long-term effects.  The online microlending organization [[Zidisha]] published a blog post which contended that providing handouts can actually cause harm by incentivizing lack of progress out of poverty, and by creating a dependence mentality among recipients.  According to Zidisha, microfinance lending is a better alternative than donations, because it incentivizes successful investment of the funds and creates a can-do mentality on the part of recipients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julia-kurnia/about-to-send-a-donation_b_4623503.html|title = About to send a donation? Think twice. |date = January 18, 2014|publisher = Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A philosophical critique of charity can be found in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man]]'', where he calls it "a ridiculously inadequate mode of partial restitution . . . usually accompanied by some impertinent attempt on the part of the sentimentalist to tyrannise over [the poor's] private lives", as well as a remedy that prolongs the "disease" of poverty, rather than curing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Oscar Wilde |title=The Soul of Man under Socialism |year=1891 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilde's thoughts are cited with approval by [[Slavoj Žižek]], and the Slovenian thinker adds his description of the effect of charity on the charitable:

{{quote|
When, confronted with the starving child, we are told: "For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can save her life!", the true message is: "For the price of a couple of cappuccinos, you can continue in your ignorant and pleasurable life, not only not feeling any guilt, but even feeling good for having participated in the struggle against suffering!"
|{{cite book |author=Slavoj Žižek |title=[[Living in the End Times]] |publisher=Verso |year=2010 |page=117}}}}

[[Friedrich Engels]], in his [[The Condition of the Working Class in England|1845 treatise]] on the condition of the working class in [[England]], points out that charitable giving, whether by governments or individuals, is often seen by the givers as a means to conceal suffering that is unpleasant to see. Engels quotes from a letter to the editor of an English newspaper who complains that

::streets are haunted by swarms of beggars, who try to awaken the pity of the passers-by in a most shameless and annoying manner, by exposing their tattered clothing, sickly aspect, and disgusting wounds and deformities. I should think that when one not only pays the poor-rate, but also contributes largely to the charitable institutions, one had done enough to earn a right to be spared such disagreeable and impertinent molestations.

The English bourgeoisie, Engels concludes,

::is charitable out of self-interest; it gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business matter, makes a bargain with the poor, saying: "If I spend this much upon benevolent institutions, I thereby purchase the right not to be troubled any further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your dusky holes and not to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery. You shall despair as before, but you shall despair unseen, this I require, this I purchase with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infirmary!" It is infamous, this charity of a Christian bourgeois!&lt;ref&gt;''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845), Penguin edition (1987), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] published a report in 2012 called "Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why", which criticised the phenomenon of governments funding charities which then lobby the government for changes which the government wanted all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iea.org.uk/publications/research/sock-puppets-how-the-government-lobbies-itself-and-why/|title=Sock Puppets: How the government lobbies itself and why|author=|date=|website=Institute of Economic Affairs|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Charity in Christianity ==
In medieval Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, Latin [[Christendom]] underwent a charitable revolution.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Brodman, ''Charity and Religion in Medieval Europe'' (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rich patrons founded many leprosaria and hospitals for the sick and poor. New [[confraternities]] and religious orders emerged with the primary mission of engaging in intensive charitable work. Historians debate the causes. Some argue that this movement was spurred by economic and material forces, as well as a burgeoning urban culture. Other scholars argue that developments in spirituality and devotional culture were central. For still other scholars, medieval charity was primarily a way to elevate one's social status and affirm existing hierarchies of power.&lt;ref&gt;Adam J. Davis, "The Social and Religious Meanings of Charity in Medieval Europe" ''History Compass'' (2014) 12#12 pp 935–950&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tzedakah in Judaism ==
[[File:Jewish cemetery Otwock Karczew Anielin IMGP6721.jpg|thumb|Sandstone vestige of a Jewish gravestone depicting a [[Tzedakah]] box (pushke). [[Jewish cemetery]] in [[Otwock]] (Karczew-Anielin), Poland.]]
In [[Judaism]], ''[[tzedakah]]''—a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] term literally meaning righteousness but commonly used to signify ''charity''&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin; "To Be A Jew". Basic Books, New York; 1972, pp. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;—refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just.&lt;ref name="chabad"&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1079/jewish/The-Myth-of-Charity.htm; Tzedakah vs The Myth of Charity]; by [[Yanki Tauber]]; Retrieved 03-11-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is commanded by the [[Torah]] and not voluntary, the practice is not technically an act of charity; such a concept is virtually nonexistent in Jewish tradition. Jews give tzedakah, which can take the form of money, time and resources to the needy, out of "righteousness" and "justice" rather than benevolence, generosity, or charitableness.&lt;ref name="chabad" /&gt; The [[Torah]] requires that 10 percent of a Jew's income be allotted to righteous deeds or causes, regardless if the receiving party is rich or poor.

== Zakat and Sadaqa in Islam ==
In [[Islam]] there are two methods of charity.

One called [[Zakat]], the other is called [[Sadaqah|Sadaqa]].

Zakat is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam|five pillars]] upon which the Muslim religion is based, where 2.5% of one's saving is compulsory to be given as Zakat per Islamic calendar year, provided that the saving is beyond the threshold limit, called [[Nisab]], usually determined by the religious authority.

Sadaqa is voluntary charity or contribution. Sadaqa can be given using money, personal items, time or other resources. There is no minimum or maximum requirement for Sadaqa. Even smiling to other people is considered a Sadaqa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fortyessentialhadith.wordpress.com/2011/05/09/hadith-31-your-smile-to-your-brother-is-sadaqa/|title=Hadith 31: Your Smile to Your Brother is a Sadaqah|date=2011-05-09|website=Forty Essential Hadith|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dāna in Indian religions ==
The practice of charity is called ''[[Dāna]]'' or ''Daana'' in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It is the virtue of generosity or giving.&lt;ref&gt;William Owen Cole (1991), Moral Issues in Six Religions, Heinemann, {{ISBN|978-0-435-30299-3}}, pages 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=krma365&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 365–366.&lt;/ref&gt; Dāna has been defined in traditional texts, state Krishnan and Manoj,&lt;ref name=kandm3&gt;Krishnan &amp; Manoj (2008), Giving as a theme in the Indian psychology of values, in Handbook of Indian Psychology (Editors: Rao et al.), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-8175966024}}, pages 361–382; [http://drsirswal.webs.com/documents/Indian%20Psychology%20of%20values.pdf summary of the article]&lt;/ref&gt; as “any action of relinquishing the ownership of what one considered or identified as one's own, and investing the same in a recipient without expecting anything in return”. [[Karna]], [[Mahabali]] and [[Harishchandra]] are heroes also known for giving charity.

The earliest known discussion of charity as a virtuous practice, in Indian texts, is in [[Rigveda]].&lt;ref name=rthg&gt;[[s:The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 117|The Rig Veda]], Mandala 10, Hymn 117, [[Ralph T. H. Griffith]] (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rhdana&gt;R Hindery, Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Vol 2, Number 1, page 105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to other ancient texts of Hinduism, dāna can take the form of feeding or giving to an individual in distress or need.&lt;ref name=ganguli311&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/310/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LIX] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, pages 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also take the form of philanthropic public projects that empower and help many.&lt;ref name=ganguli&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri08royp#page/306/mode/2up Anushasana Parva, Section LVIII] The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Published by P.C. Roy (1893).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjay Agarwal (2010), Daan and Other Giving Traditions in India,{{asin|B00E0R033S}}, pages 54–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kota Neelima (2012), Tirupati, Random House, {{ISBN|978-8184001983}}, pages 50–52; Prabhavati C. Reddy (2014), Hindu Pilgrimage: Shifting Patterns of Worldview of Srisailam in South India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-415-65997-0}}, page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dāna leads to one of the [[paramita|perfections]] (''pāramitā''). This can be characterized by unattached and unconditional generosity, giving and letting go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tsong-kha-pa |authorlink=Je Tsongkhapa |editor=Joshua Cutler |editor2=Guy Newland |others= |title= The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment, Volume II |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2002|publisher= Snow Lion |location= Canada |language= |isbn= 1-55939-168-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}: 236, 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records, such as those by the Persian historian Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī who visited India in early 11th century, suggest ''dāna'' has been an ancient and medieval era practice among Indian religions.&lt;ref name=birunihind&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 2), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000157.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter LXVII, On Alms and how a man must spend what he earns], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), pages 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Heim (2004), Theories of the Gift in Medieval South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60513-7}}, pages 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8813">'''Christian realism''' is a [[political theology]] in the [[Christian]] tradition. It is built on three biblical presumptions: the sinfulness of man, the freedom of man, and the validity and seriousness of the [[Great Commandment]].{{sfn|Tsonchev|2015|pp=1–2}} The key political concepts of Christian realism are [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] and political responsibility. This political-theological perspective is most closely associated with the work of the 20th-century American [[theologian]] and [[public intellectual]] [[Reinhold Niebuhr]]{{sfnm |1a1=Hyde-Price |1y=2008 |1p=19 |2a1=Rasmussen |2y=1988 |2p=198}}. Niebuhr argued that the [[Kingdom of God]] cannot be realized on earth because of the innately corrupt tendencies of society. Due to the injustices that arise among men, a person is therefore forced to compromise the ideal of Kingdom of Heaven on earth.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Niebuhr argued that human perfectibility was an illusion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/theology-reinhold-niebuhr-0|title="The Theology of Reinhold Niebuhr" {{!}} The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|website=kinginstitute.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighting the sinfulness of humanity at a time when the world was confronted by the horrors of the [[Second World War]], the [[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]] [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes, and the [[Holocaust]].{{sfn|Woodbridge|James|2013}} Christian realism was in part a reaction to the 20th century [[Social Gospel]] movement that was favorable to the revolutionary [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]]. Numerous American political figures have been influenced by Christian realism, among them [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/opinion/15brooks.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Obama’s Christian Realism|last=Brooks|first=David|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brianparkhillrarebooks.com/scarce-first-edition-of-niebuhrs-moral-man-and-immoral-society/ |title=Scarce First Edition of Niebuhr's Moral Man and Immoral Society |publisher=Brian Parkhill Rare Books |date=6 October 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021221524/http://www.brianparkhillrarebooks.com/scarce-first-edition-of-niebuhrs-moral-man-and-immoral-society/ |archive-date=21 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Political influence==
Christian realism exerted a strong influence on American foreign and domestic policy in the [[Cold War]] era. Many members of the neoconservative movement have claimed allegiance to Niebuhr's philosophy, however, some critics argued that [[neoconservatism]] neglected Niebuhr's strong commitment to social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steinfels |first=Peter |author-link=Peter Steinfels |date=25 May 2007 |title=Two Social Ethicists and the National Landscape |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/us/26beliefs.html |url-access=limited |newspaper=The New York Times |page=B6 |access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives on Christian realism==
[[Gary Dorrien]] wrote:
{{quote|Christian realism inspired no hymns and built no lasting institutions. It was not even a movement, but rather, a reaction to the Social Gospel centered on one person, Reinhold Niebuhr. The Social Gospel, by contrast, was a half-century movement and an enduring perspective that paved the way for modern ecumenism, social Christianity, the Civil Rights Movement, and the field of social ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Dorrien |first=Gary |author-link=Gary Dorrien |year=2009 |title=Society as the Subject of Redemption: The Relevance of the Social Gospel |url=http://www.tikkun.org/article.php/nov_dec_09_dorrien |magazine=Tikkun |volume=24 |issue=6 |issn=0887-9982 |accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''New York Times'' obituary for Niebuhr, written by [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]], read,
{{quote|[Niebuhr's] emphasis on sin startled my generation, brought up on optimistic convictions of human innocence and perfectibility. But nothing had prepared us for Hitler and Stalin, the Holocaust, concentration camps and gulags. Human nature was evidently as capable of depravity as of virtue&amp;nbsp;...

Traditionally, the idea of the frailty of man led to the demand for obedience to ordained authority. But Niebuhr rejected that ancient conservative argument. Ordained authority, he showed, is all the more subject to the temptations of self-interest, self-deception and self-righteousness. Power must be balanced by power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlesinger |first=Arthur, Jr. |author-link=Arthur M.

==Christian realism in the 21st century==
In the post-9/11 era, a number of scholars have been questioning the overly secular character of [[political realism]], especially in the light of post-modern critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Joustra |first=Robert |date=13 March 2009 |title=Recovering Christian Realism in 'Terrifying Times' |url=http://www.cardus.ca/comment/article/901 |magazine=Comment |location=Hamilton, Ontario |publisher=Cardus |access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Jones of the University of Cambridge has suggested that international law and normative theory presuppose Christian ethics in the [[international relations theory]]. Despite the Christian realist underpinnings of scholars, originally associated with the [[English school of international relations theory|English school]], the revival of the interest towards religion in International Relations is a relatively recent phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rowe |first=Paul S. |year=2010 |title=Review of ''God and Global Order'' by Jonathan Chaplin |url=http://www.cardus.ca/policy/article/2279/ |magazine=Policy in Public |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=67–76 |location=Hamilton, Ontario |publisher=Cardus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223220205/https://www.cardus.ca/policy/article/2279/ |archive-date=23 December 2017 |access-date=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8886">In the United States, a '''citizen grand jury''' is a non-actionable, non-governmental organization that assumes a responsibility upon itself to accuse an individual or groups of individuals of having committed [[Cause of action|actionable crime]]s, in a similar aim as that of official [[grand jury|grand juries]]. Such organizations have been organized by those who espouse [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] regarding certain events or the individuals who are accused by the citizen grand jury, and most citizen grand jury applications to official judiciary systems at the federal, state, or local and municipal level tend to be thrown out for lack of [[Evidence (law)|evidence]].

Modern citizen grand juries were organized in the 2000s to [[9/11 conspiracy theories|accuse government officials of complicity]] in the [[September 11 attacks]], and others were organized in the late 2000s and early 2010s regarding the accuracy of President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|"natural birth" as a U.S. citizen]].

==9/11 citizen grand juries==
[[File:Wtc7onfire.jpg|thumb|225px|World Trade Center Building 7 on fire before its collapse on 9/11]]
The earliest so-called 9/11 citizen grand jury, the 23-member "Los Angeles Citizens' Grand Jury on the Crimes of 9/11/01," was organized in 2004 by activist Lynne Pentz.  By October of that year it had launched an "indictment" accusing [[George W. Bush]] and other administration officials of complicity and foreknowledge of the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americanfreepress.net/html/citizen_grand_jury.html|title = Citizen Grand Jury Indicts Feds Over Sept. 11 Attacks|author = Christopher Bollyn|date = October 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those offering testimony at the event were [[Webster Tarpley]], Barbara Honegger, Don Paul, [[Jim Hoffman]] and Christopher Bollyn. Similar citizen grand juries were organized in [[San Diego]] later in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://stj911.org/paul/SDCGJ_HistoricResults.html|title = Historic Result From San Diego Citizens' Grand Jury On The Crimes Of September 11, 2001 In New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obama citizenship citizen grand juries==
Some campaigners, led by Georgia activist Carl Swensson, have sought to, "finally expose the conspiracy behind President Obama's birth certificate," by forming what they term "citizen grand juries" to indict Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The "citizen grand juries" are based on the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]'s premise that "no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury."{{according to whom|date=September 2012}}

Although the activists managed to hand out copies of "indictments" to Congressional staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the courts have not regarded the "citizen grand juries" favorably. In June 2009, a group of 172 campaigners declared themselves to be a "Super American Grand Jury" and voted to charge Obama with treason and accused him of not being a U.S. citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Chief Judge [[Royce C. Lamberth]] of the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] dismissed the "indictment" on July 2, 2009 and declared "[T]here is no authority under the Rules of Procedure or in the statutes of the United States for this court to accept [a presentment]... The individuals who have made this presentment were not convened by this court to sit as a grand jury nor have they been selected at random from a fair cross section of this district. Any self-styled indictment or presentment issued by such a group has no force under the Constitution or laws of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2009mc0346-2 Misc.

In 2013, a citizen grand jury formed by [[Larry Klayman]] "convicted" Obama of fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewire.com/politics/2013/12/just-because-youre-paranoid-doesnt-mean-they-arent-after-you/356295/|title=Just Because You're Paranoid Doesn't Mean They Aren't After You|first=Philip|last=Bump|date=December 18, 2013|work=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==White supremacist citizen grand juries==

In 2011 there was an influx of [[white supremacists]] to Montana's [[Flathead Valley]] region. Karl Gharst, a white supremacist active in the Flathead area, publicly announced plans to form a citizen grand jury in [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]] to indict the Montana Human Rights Network, a local anti-racism organization. Gharst, previously active in the [[Aryan Nations]] and currently founder of a group called Kalispell Pioneer Little Europe, claimed that the MHRN was a "Jewish Defamation Organization" and part of a "Jewish terrorist network".&lt;ref name="gharst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://missoulian.com/news/local/article_bc0b32d0-f792-11e0-9bbc-001cc4c03286.html|title=

==[[Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]]==
Members of [[Ammon Bundy]]'s group calling themselves "[[Citizens for Constitutional Freedom]]" attempted to create citizen grand juries and threatened indictments against a number of officials, both federal and local, for "multiple constitutional crimes." The tactics included bringing in self-proclaimed "judges" who did not have legal authority under the court system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morlin|first1=Bill|title=Antigovernment Extremists in Oregon Now Plan Their Own Justice System|url=https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/01/13/antigovernment-extremists-oregon-now-plan-their-own-justice-system|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Betsy|title=Self-appointed 'judge' arrives in Burns to ask local residents to charge government officials with crimes|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/01/self-appointed_judge_arrives_i.html|accessdate=15 May 2016|agency=The Oregonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garcia|first1=Arturo|title=Colorado man appoints himself ‘judge’ for Bundy militants’ bogus court against local officials|url=http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/colorado-man-appoints-himself-judge-for-bundy-militants-bogus-court-against-local-officials/|accessdate=15 May 2016|agency=The Raw Story}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the self-proclaimed 'judges' threatened newsmedia with "the crime of felony" for attempting to report on the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foden-Vencil|first1=Kristian|title=Armed Occupiers Convene Common Law Grand Jury Against Local Officials|url=http://www.opb.org/news/series/burns-oregon-standoff-bundy-militia-news-updates/oregon-occupiers-common-law-grand-jury/|accessdate=15 May 2016|agency=Oregon Public Broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Doping in sport sidebar|expanded=History}}
In competitive sports, '''doping''' is the use of banned [[ergogenic aid|athletic performance-enhancing drugs]] by athletic competitors.  The term ''doping'' is widely used by organizations that regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is considered unethical, and therefore prohibited, by most international sports organizations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]]. Furthermore, athletes (or athletic programs) taking explicit measures to evade detection exacerbates the ethical violation with overt [[deception]] and [[cheating]].

Historically speaking, the origins of doping in sports go back to the very creation of sport itself. From ancient usage of substances in [[chariot racing]] to more recent controversies in [[baseball]] and [[cycling]], popular views among athletes have varied widely from country to country over the years. The general trend among authorities and sporting organizations over the past several decades has been to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The reasons for the ban are mainly the health risks of performance-enhancing drugs, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the exemplary effect of drug-free sport for the public. Anti-doping authorities state that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the "spirit of sport".
{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
The use of drugs in sports goes back centuries, about all the way back to the very invention of the concept of sports.&lt;ref name=against/&gt; In ancient times, when the fittest of a nation were selected as athletes or combatants, they were fed diets and given treatments considered beneficial to help increase muscle. For instance, Scandinavian mythology says [[Berserkers]] could drink a mixture called "butotens", to greatly increase their physical power at the risk of insanity.  One theory is that the mixture was prepared from the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, though this has been disputed.

The [[Ancient Olympic Games|ancient Olympics in Greece]] have been alleged to have had forms of doping. In [[ancient Rome]], where [[chariot racing]] had become a huge part of their culture, athletes drank [[Herbs|herbal infusions]] to strengthen them before chariot races.&lt;ref name=against&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bjsm.2010.078725.23 |title=Competing against doping |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |volume=44 |pages=i8 |year=2010 |last1=Kumar |first1=R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, a participant in an endurance [[Pedestrianism|walking race]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Abraham Wood, said in 1807 that he had used [[laudanum]] (which contains [[opiates]]) to keep him awake for 24&amp;nbsp;hours while competing against Robert Barclay Allardyce.&lt;ref name=DeMon/&gt; By April 1877, walking races had stretched to 500 miles and the following year, also at the Agricultural Hall in [[Islington]], London, to 520 miles. The ''Illustrated London News'' chided:

:It may be an advantage to know that a man can travel 520 miles in 138 hours, and manage to live through a week with an infinitesimal amount of rest, though we fail to perceive that anyone could possibly be placed in a position where his ability in this respect would be of any use to him [and] what is to be gained by a constant repetition of the fact.&lt;ref&gt;Grajewski, Tadeusw: The Building That Would Not Go Away, Royal Agriciultural Hall, UK, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

The event proved popular, however, with 20,000 spectators attending each day.&lt;ref name=TIR&gt;Woodland, Les: This Island Race, Mousehold Press, UK, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Encouraged, the promoters developed the idea and soon held similar races for cyclists.

:"...and much more likely to endure their miseries publicly; a tired walker, after all, merely sits down – a tired cyclist falls off and possibly brings others crashing down as well. That's much more fun".&lt;ref name=TIR/&gt;

The fascination with six-day bicycle races spread across the Atlantic and the same appeal brought in the crowds in America as well. And the more spectators paid at the gate, the higher the prizes could be and the greater was the incentive of riders to stay awake—or be kept awake—to ride the greatest distance. Their exhaustion was countered by [[soigneurs]] (the French word for "carers"), helpers akin to seconds in [[boxing]]. Among the treatments they supplied was [[nitroglycerine]], a drug used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and which was credited with improving riders' breathing.&lt;ref&gt;Novich, Max M., ''Abbotempo'', UK, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion [[Major Taylor]] refused to continue the New York race, saying: "I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand."&lt;ref&gt;Bearings, US, 24 December 1896, cited Ritchie, Andrew, ''Major Taylor'', Bicycle Books, US, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Public reaction turned against such trials, whether individual races or in teams of two. One report said:

:An athletic contest in which the participants 'go queer' in their heads, and strain their powers until their faces become hideous with the tortures that rack them, is not sport, it is brutality. It appears from the reports of this singular performance that some of the bicycle riders have actually become temporarily insane during the contest... Days and weeks of recuperation will be needed to put the racers in condition, and it is likely that some of them will never recover from the strain.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, US, 1897, cited McCullagh, James, ''American Bicycle Racing, Rodale Press, U.S., 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The father of [[anabolic steroid]]s in the United States was [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]] (1917–1983), a physician for the U.S. weightlifting team in the mid-20th century. In 1954, on his tour to Vienna with his team for the world championship, Ziegler learned from his Russian colleague that the Soviet weightlifting team's success was due to their use of [[testosterone]] as a performance-enhancing drug. Deciding that U.S. athletes needed chemical assistance to remain competitive, Ziegler worked with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company to develop an oral anabolic steroid. This resulted in the creation of [[methandrostenolone]], which appeared on the market in 1960. During the Olympics that year, the Danish cyclist [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed and died while competing in the 100-kilometer (62-mile) race. An autopsy later revealed the presence of [[amphetamine]]s and a drug called [[nicotinyl tartrate]] in his system.

The American specialist in doping, Max M. Novich, wrote: "Trainers of the old school who supplied treatments which had cocaine as their base declared with assurance that a rider tired by a six-day race would get his second breath after absorbing these mixtures."&lt;ref&gt;Novich, ibid. Cited De Mondenard, Dr Jean-Pierre: ''Dopage, l'imposture des performances, Chiron, France, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; John Hoberman, a professor at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas, said six-day races were "de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion."&lt;ref&gt;Hoberman, John; Dopers on Wheels: The Tour's sorry history, www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19462071/ retrieved December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
Over 30% of athletes participating in 2011 World Championships admitted having used banned substances during their careers. According to a study commissioned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA), actually 44% of them had used them. Nevertheless, only 0.5% of those tested were caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Doping in Two Elite Athletics Competitions Assessed by Randomized-Response Surveys|journal=Sports Medicine|year=2017|pages=1–9|author=Ulrich, R. et al.|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0765-4|pmid = 28849386|volume=48|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbcsport&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/41084175|title=Doping: More than 30% of athletes at 2011 Worlds admit to doping|date=29 August 2017|publisher=BBC Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole Russian track and field team was banned from the 2016 Olympic Games, because the Russian State had sponsored their doping program.&lt;ref name=bbcsport/&gt;

===Goldman's dilemma===
{{main|Goldman's dilemma}}
Goldman's dilemma, or the Goldman dilemma, is a question that was posed to elite [[sportsperson|athletes]] by [[physician]], [[osteopathy|osteopath]] and [[publicist]] Bob Goldman, asking whether they would take a drug that would guarantee them success in sport, but cause them to die after five years. In his research, as in previous research by Mirkin, approximately half the athletes responded that they would take the drug,&lt;ref name=Goldman1992&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Robert|title=Death in the locker room: drugs &amp; sports|year=1992|publisher=Elite Sports Medicine Publications|isbn=9780963145109|page=24|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Klatz}}&lt;/ref&gt; but modern research by James Connor and co-workers has yielded much lower numbers, with athletes having levels of acceptance of the dilemma that were similar to the general population of Australia.&lt;ref name=Connor2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connor|first=James|first2=Jules |last2=Woolf |first3=Jason |last3=Mazanov|title=Would they dope?

== By substance ==

=== Steroids ===
Over the last 20 years the appearance of steroids in sports has been seen as an [[epidemic]]. Research and limited tests have been conducted only to find short-term, reversible effects on athletes that are both physical and mental. These side effects would be alleviated if athletes were allowed the use of controlled substances under proper medical supervision. These side-effects include Intramuscular abscesses and other microbial bacteria that can cause infections, from counterfeited products the user decides to purchase on the black market, high blood pressure and cholesterol, as well as infertility, and dermatological conditions like severe acne. Mental effects include increased aggression and depression, and in rare cases suicide has been seen as well. Most studies on the effects of steroids have shown to be improper and lacking credible tests as well as performing studies in a skewed fashion to predetermine the world's view on the use of steroids in sports. Long-term effects have not been able to be pinpointed just yet due to the recency of testing these substances but would start show up as early steroid users reach the age of 50 and older.

====Strychnine at the Olympics====
[[File:Marathon Hicks1904.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hicks and supporters at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].]]
These "de facto experiments investigating the physiology of stress as well as the substances that might alleviate exhaustion" were not unknown outside cycling.

[[Thomas Hicks (athlete)|Thomas Hicks]], an American born in England on 7 January 1875, won the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] [[marathon (sports)|marathon]] in 1904. He crossed the line behind a fellow American [[Fred Lorz]], who had been transported for 11 miles of the course by his trainer, leading to his disqualification. However, Hicks's trainer Charles Lucas, pulled out a [[syringe]] and came to his aid as his runner began to struggle.

:I therefore decided to inject him with a milligram of sulphate of [[strychnine]] and to make him drink a large glass brimming with brandy. He set off again as best he could [but] he needed another injection four miles from the end to give him a semblance of speed and to get him to the finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parienté|first1=R|last2=Lagorce|first2=G|title=La Fabuleuse Histoire des Jeux Olympiques|publisher=ODIL|location=France|year=1973|isbn=978-2-8307-0583-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of strychnine, at the time, was thought necessary to survive demanding races, according to sports historians Alain Lunzenfichter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lunzenfichter|first=Alain|title=C'est pas du Jeu!|work=L'Équipe|location=France|date=10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and historian of sports doping, Dr Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, who said:

:It has to be appreciated that at the time the menace of doping for the health of athletes or of the purity of competition had yet to enter the morals because, after this marathon, the official race report said: The marathon has shown from a medical point of view how drugs can be very useful to athletes in long-distance races.&lt;ref name=DeMon/&gt;

Hicks was, in the phrase of the time, "between life and death" but recovered, collected his gold medal a few days later, and lived until 1952. Nonetheless, he never again took part in athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodland|first=Les|title=Dope, the use of drugs in Sport|publisher=David and Charles|location=UK|year=1980|isbn=978-0-7153-7894-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimulants===
Stimulants are drugs that usually act on the central nervous system to modulate mental function and behavior, increasing an individual's sense of excitement and decreasing the sensation of fatigue.  In the World Anti-Doping Agency list of prohibited substances, stimulants are the second largest class after the anabolic steroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deventer|first1=K|last2=Roels|first2=K|last3=Delbeke|first3=FT|last4=Van Eenoo|first4=P|title=Prevalence of legal and illegal stimulating agents in sports|journal=Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry|date=August 2011|volume=401|issue=2|pages=421–32|pmid=21479548|doi=10.1007/s00216-011-4863-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of well known stimulants include [[caffeine]], [[cocaine]], [[amphetamine]], [[modafinil]], and [[ephedrine]]. Caffeine, although a stimulant, has not been banned by the International Olympic Committee or the World Anti Doping Agency since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usada.org/wp-content/uploads/wada-2016-prohibited-list-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benzedrine]] is a trade name for amphetamine. The Council of Europe says it first appeared in sport at the Berlin Olympics in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;''Doping of athletes, a European survey'', Council of Europe, France, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced in 1887 and the derivative, Benzedrine, was isolated in the U.S. in 1934 by [[Gordon Alles]]. Its perceived effects gave it the street name "speed". British troops used 72&amp;nbsp;million amphetamine tablets in the Second World War&lt;ref name=DeMon/&gt;  and the RAF got through so many that "Methedrine won the Battle of Britain" according to one report.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, D.N.W.; ''Air Force, UK, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was that amphetamine leads to a lack of judgement and a willingness to take risks, which in sport could lead to better performances but in fighters and bombers led to more crash landings than the RAF could tolerate. The drug was withdrawn but large stocks remained on the black market. Amphetamine was also used legally as an aid to slimming and also as a [[thymoleptic]] before being phased out by the appearance of newer agents in the 1950s.

[[Everton F.C.|Everton]], one of the top clubs in the English [[association football|football]] league, were champions of the 1962–63 season. And it was done, according to a national newspaper investigation, with the help of Benzedrine. Word spread after Everton's win that the drug had been involved. The newspaper investigated, cited where the reporter believed it had come from, and quoted the goalkeeper, Albert Dunlop, as saying:

:I cannot remember how they first came to be offered to us. But they were distributed in the dressing rooms. We didn't have to take them but most of the players did. The tablets were mostly white but once or twice they were yellow. They were used through the 1961–62 season and the championship season which followed it. Drug-taking had previously been virtually unnamed in the club. But once it had started we could have as many tablets as we liked. On match days they were handed out to most players as a matter of course. Soon some of the players could not do without the drugs.&lt;ref name=Gabbert&gt;Gabbert, Michael: How we uncovered the Everton drug scandal, ''The People'', UK, 13 September 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

The club agreed that drugs had been used but that they "could not possibly have had any harmful effect." Dunlop, however, said he had become an addict.&lt;ref name=Gabbert/&gt;

In November 1942, the Italian cyclist [[Fausto Coppi]] took "seven packets of amphetamine" to beat the world hour record on the track.&lt;ref&gt;Brera, G. ''Le Géant et la Lime'' (French title), Ed. Campagnolo, Italy, 1995, cited De Mondenard&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, the Danish rider [[Knud Enemark Jensen]] collapsed during the 100&amp;nbsp;km team time trial at the Olympic Games in Rome and died later in hospital. The autopsy showed he had taken amphetamine and another drug, [[Nicotinyl alcohol|Ronicol]], which dilates the blood vessels. The chairman of the Dutch cycling federation, Piet van Dijk, said of Rome that "dope – whole cartloads – [were] used in such royal quantities."&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, Pieter: ''Doping bestaat en doen we eraan'', Het Vrije Volk, Holland, 13 December 1961&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s British cycling professional Jock Andrews would joke: "You need never go off-course chasing the peloton in a big race – just follow the trail of empty syringes and dope wrappers."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by fellow professional Tony Hewson in Journal, Fellowship of Cycling Old Timers, 158/72&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch cycling team manager Kees Pellenaars told of a rider in his care:

:I took him along to a training camp in Spain. The boy changed then into a sort of lion. He raced around as though he was powered by rockets. I went to talk to him. He was really happy he was riding well and he told me to look out for him. I asked if he wasn't perhaps "using something" and he jumped straight up, climbed on a chair and from deep inside a cupboard he pulled out a plastic bag full of pills. I felt my heart skip a beat. I had never seen so many fireworks together. With a [[soigneur]] we counted the pills: there were 5,000 of them, excluding hormone preparations and sleeping pills. I took them away, to his own relief. I let him keep the hormones and the sleeping pills. Later he seemed to have taken too many at once and he slept for a couple of days on end. We couldn't wake him up. We took him to hospital and they pumped out his stomach. They tied him to his bed to prevent anything going wrong again. But one way or another he had some stimulant and fancied taking a walk. A nurse came across him in the corridor, walking along with the bed strapped to his back.&lt;ref&gt;Huyskens, P: ''Daar was 't, een biografie van Kees Pellenaars'', Netherlands,1973&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently [[modafinil]] is being used throughout the sporting world, with many high-profile cases attracting press coverage as prominent United States athletes have failed tests for this substance. Some athletes who were found to have used modafinil protested as the drug was not on the prohibited list at the time of their offence, however, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA) maintains it is a substance related to those already banned, so the decisions stand. [[Modafinil]] was added to the list of prohibited substances on 3 August 2004, ten days before the start of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

One approach of athletes to get around regulations on stimulants is to use new designer stimulants, which have not previously been officially prohibited, but have similar chemical structures or biological effects.  Designer stimulants that attracted media attention in 2010 included mephendrone, ephendrome, and fluoroamphetamines; which have chemical structures and effects similar to ephedrine and amphetamine.

===Anabolic steroids===
{{Main|Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|Anabolic steroid}}
Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) were first isolated, identified and [[chemical synthesis|synthesized]] in the 1930s, and are now used therapeutically in [[medicine]] to induce [[bone]] growth, stimulate [[appetite]], induce male [[puberty]], and treat chronic [[wasting]] conditions, such as [[cancer]] and [[AIDS]]. Anabolic steroids also increase muscle mass and physical strength, and are therefore used in [[sports]] and [[bodybuilding]] to enhance strength or physique. Known side effects include harmful changes in [[cholesterol]] levels (increased [[Low density lipoprotein]] and decreased [[High density lipoprotein]]), [[Acne vulgaris|acne]], [[high blood pressure]], and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]]. Some of these effects can be mitigated by taking supplemental drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanayama G, Hudson JI, Pope HG |title=Long-term psychiatric and medical consequences of anabolic-androgenic steroid abuse: A looming public health concern? |journal=Drug and Alcohol Dependence |volume=98 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–12 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18599224 |doi=10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2008.05.004 |url= |pmc=2646607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AAS use in sports began in October 1954 when [[John Bosley Ziegler|John Ziegler]], a doctor who treated American athletes, went to [[Vienna]] with the American weightlifting team. There he met a Russian physician who, over "a few drinks", repeatedly asked "What are you giving your boys?"  When Ziegler returned the question, the Russian said that his own athletes were being given testosterone. Returning to America, Ziegler tried low doses of testosterone on himself, on the American trainer Bob Hoffman and on two lifters, Jim Park and Yaz Kuzahara. All gained more weight and strength than any training programme would produce but there were side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;Laure, P.: Les répresentations du dopage; approche psycho-sociologique, Thèse STAPS, Nancy, France, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler sought a drug without after-effects and hit on an anabolic steroid, [[methandrostenolone]], (Dianabol, DBOL), made in the US in 1958 by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yesalis CE, Anderson WA, Buckley WE, Wright JE |title=Incidence of the nonmedical use of anabolic-androgenic steroids |journal=NIDA Research Monograph |volume=102 |issue= |pages=97–112 |year=1990 |pmid=2079979 |doi= |url=http://www.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/102.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fair JD |title=Isometrics or Steroids?

The results were so impressive that lifters began taking more, and steroids spread to other sports. Paul Lowe, a former running back with the San Diego Chargers American football team, told a California legislative committee on drug abuse in 1970: "We had to take them [steroids] at lunchtime. He [an official] would put them on a little saucer and prescribed them for us to take them and if not he would suggest there might be a fine."

Olympic statistics show the weight of shot putters increased 14 percent between 1956 and 1972, whereas steeplechasers weight increased 7.6 per cent. The gold medalist pentathlete [[Mary Peters (athlete)|Mary Peters]] said: "A medical research team in the United States attempted to set up extensive research into the effects of steroids on weightlifters and throwers, only to discover that there were so few who weren't taking them that they couldn't establish any worthwhile comparisons."&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Mary: Mary P, Arrow Books, UK, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, [[Jay Silvester]], a former four-time Olympian and 1972 silver medalist in the discus, who was then with the physical education department of Brigham Young University in the U.S., questioned competitors at that year's Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = USATF – Hall of Fame|url = http://www.usatf.org/HallOfFame/TF/showBio.asp?HOFIDs=154|website = www.usatf.org|accessdate = 17 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of steroid use he found ranged from 10&amp;nbsp;mg a day to 100&amp;nbsp;mg.

The use of anabolic steroids is now banned by all major sporting bodies, including the [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]], [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]], [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]], [[International Olympic Committee]], [[FIFA]], [[UEFA]], all major [[professional golf tours]], the [[National Hockey League]], [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[European Athletic Association]], [[WWE]], the [[National Football League|NFL]] and the [[Union Cycliste Internationale|UCI]]. However, drug testing can be wildly inconsistent and, in some instances, has gone unenforced.

A number of studies measuring anabolic steroid use in high school athletes found that out of all 12th grade students, 6.6 percent of them had used anabolic steroids at some point in their high school careers or were approached and counseled to use them.  Of those students who acknowledged doping with anabolic–androgenic steroids, well over half participated in school-sponsored athletics, including football, wrestling, track and field, and baseball.  A second study showed 6.3 percent of high school student Football players admitted to current or former AAS use. At the collegiate level, surveys show that AAS use among athletes range from 5 percent to 20 percent and continues to rise. The study found that skin changes were an early marker of steroid use in young athletes, and underscored the important role that dermatologists could play in the early detection and intervention in these athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cutaneous Manifestations of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroid Use in Athletes|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|pages=1044–1048|volume=48|issue=10|year=2009|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2009.04139.x|author=Walker Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 Seoul Olympics===
A famous case of AAS use in a competition was Canadian [[Ben Johnson (athlete)|Ben Johnson]]'s victory in the 100&amp;nbsp;m at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[1988 Summer Olympics]]&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently failed the drug test when [[stanozolol]] was found in his urine. He later admitted to using the steroid as well as [[Dianabol]], testosterone, [[Furazabol]], and [[human growth hormone]] amongst other things. Johnson was stripped of his gold medal as well as his world-record performance. [[Carl Lewis]] was then promoted one place to take the Olympic gold title. Lewis had also run under the current world record time and was therefore recognized as the new record holder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Carl Lewis {{!}} biography – American athlete|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Lewis|accessdate = 16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, however, Wade Exum, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to ''Sports Illustrated'' which revealed that some 100 American athletes who failed drug tests and should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics were nevertheless cleared to compete; among those athletes was Carl Lewis.

Lewis broke his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had failed tests for banned substances, but claiming he was just one of "hundreds" of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans, concealed by the USOC. Lewis has now acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the Seoul games.&lt;ref name="guardian_2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/24/athletics.duncanmackay|title=Lewis: 'Who cares I failed drug test?'|last=Mackay|first=Duncan|date=24 April 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 April 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former athletes and officials came out against the USOC cover-up. "For so many years I lived it. I knew this was going on, but there's absolutely nothing you can do as an athlete. You have to believe governing bodies are doing what they are supposed to do.

===East Germany===
{{Main|Doping in East Germany}}
In 1977, one of East Germany's best sprinters, [[Doping in East Germany#Renate Neufeld|Renate Neufeld]], fled to the West with the Bulgarian she later married. A year later she said that she had been told to take drugs supplied by coaches while training to represent East Germany in the 1980 Olympic Games.

:At 17, I joined the East Berlin Sports Institute. My speciality was the 80m [[hurdles]]. We swore that we would never speak to anyone about our training methods, including our parents. The training was very hard. We were all watched. We signed a register each time we left for dormitory and we had to say where we were going and what time we would return. One day, my trainer, Günter Clam, advised me to take pills to improve my performance: I was running 200m in 24 seconds. My trainer told me the pills were vitamins, but I soon had cramp in my legs, my voice became gruff and sometimes I couldn't talk any more. Then I started to grow a moustache and my periods stopped. I then refused to take these pills. One morning in October 1977, the secret police took me at 7am and questioned me about my refusal to take pills prescribed by the trainer. I then decided to flee, with my fiancé.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sport Information Dienst, W Germany, December 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costelle D, Berlioux M, ''Histoires des Jeux Olympiques'', Larousse, France, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

She brought with her to the West grey tablets and green powder she said had been given to her, to members of her club, and to other athletes. The West German doping analyst Manfred Donike reportedly identified them as anabolic steroids. She said she stayed quiet for a year for the sake of her family. But when her father then lost his job and her sister was expelled from her handball club, she decided to tell her story.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z0802-015, Ilona Slupianek.jpg|thumb|[[Ilona Slupianek]] in 1981.]]

East Germany closed itself to the sporting world in May 1965.&lt;ref name=DeMon/&gt; In 1977, the [[Shot put|shot-putter]] Ilona Slupianek, who weighed 93&amp;nbsp;kg, failed a test for anabolic steroids at the European Cup meeting in [[Helsinki]] and thereafter athletes were tested before they left the country. At the same time, the Kreischa testing laboratory near [[Dresden]] passed into government control, which was reputed to make around 12,000 tests a year on East German athletes but without any being penalised.&lt;ref name=DeMon/&gt;

The [[International Association of Athletics Federations|International Amateur Athletics Federation]] suspended Slupianek for 12 months, a penalty that ended two days before the European championships in [[Prague]]. In the reverse of what the IAAF hoped, sending her home to East Germany meant she was free to train unchecked with anabolic steroids, if she wanted to, and then compete for another gold medal, which she won.

After that, almost nothing emerged from the East German sports schools and laboratories. A rare exception was the visit by the sports writer and former athlete, Doug Gilbert of the ''Edmonton Sun'', who said:

:Dr (Heinz) Wuschech knows more about anabolic steroids than any doctor I have ever met, and yet he cannot discuss them openly any more than Geoff Capes or Mac Wilkins can openly discuss them in the current climate of amateur sports regulation. What I did learn in East Germany was that they feel there is little danger from anabolica, as they call it, when the athletes are kept on strictly monitored programmes. Although the extremely dangerous side-effects are admitted, they are statistically no more likely to occur than side-effects from the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]]. If, that is, programmes are constantly medically monitored as to dosage.&lt;ref&gt;Cited Woodland, Les: Dope, the use of drugs in sport, David and Charles, UK, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reports came from the occasional athlete who fled to the West. There were 15 between 1976 and 1979. One, the ski-jumper [[Hans-Georg Aschenbach]], said: "Long-distance skiers start having injections to their knees from the age 14 because of their intensive training."&lt;ref name=DeMon/&gt; He said: "For every Olympic champion, there at least 350 invalids. There are gymnasts among the girls who have to wear corsets from the age of 18 because their spine and their ligaments have become so worn... There are young people so worn out by the intensive training that they come out of it mentally blank [''lessivés'' – washed out], which is even more painful than a deformed spine."&lt;ref&gt;''Le Figaro'', France, 19 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

After German reunification, on 26 August 1993 the records were opened and the evidence was there that the [[Stasi]], the state secret police, supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in 1990. Doping existed in other countries, says the expert Jean-Pierre de Mondenard, both communist and capitalist, but the difference with East Germany was that it was a state policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,786574,00.html |title=Sports Doping Statistics Reach Plateau in Germany |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=26 February 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Sports Club Dynamo|Sportvereinigung Dynamo]]'' (English:''Dynamo Sports Club'')&lt;ref&gt;Pain And Injury in Sport: Social And Ethical Analysis, Section III, Chapter 7, Page 111, by Sigmund Loland, Berit Skirstad, Ivan Waddington, Published by Routledge in 2006, ASIN: B000OI0HZG&lt;/ref&gt; was especially singled out as a center for doping in the former East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/dopingopfer/kommentar_ordner/09_2002/dynamo_liste_web.htm |title=Dynamo Liste (in German) |publisher=doping_opfer@yahoo.com |date=September 2002 |accessdate=10 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040420072135/http://members.lycos.co.uk/dopingopfer/kommentar_ordner/09_2002/dynamo_liste_web.htm |archivedate=20 April 2004 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many former club officials and some athletes found themselves charged after the dissolution of the country. A special page on the internet was created by doping victims trying to gain justice and compensation, listing people involved in doping in the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/dopingopfer/taeter/taeter_alle.htm |title=Dynamo Liste: Die Täter (in German) |website=doping_opfer@yahoo.com |date=September 2002 |accessdate=11 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124081918/http://members.lycos.co.uk/dopingopfer/taeter/taeter_alle.htm |archivedate=24 January 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

State-endorsed doping began with the Cold War when every eastern bloc gold was an ideological victory. From 1974, Manfred Ewald, the head of the GDR's sports federation, imposed blanket doping.

===Soviet Union===
{{see also|Doping at the Olympic Games#1980 Moscow}}
According to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were "rescued with [these] tremendous efforts".&lt;ref name=DG2011&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 978-0292739574 |page= 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said "There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists' Games."&lt;ref name= DG2011 /&gt;

A member of the IOC Medical Commission, Manfred Donike, privately ran additional tests with a new technique for identifying abnormal levels of testosterone by measuring its ratio to [[epitestosterone]] in [[urine]]. Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.&lt;ref name="D.

Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the [[Doping in Russia|Russian doping program]] prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Association football==
There have been few incidents of doping in football, mainly due to [[FIFA]]'s belief that education and prevention with constant in and out-of-competition controls play a key role in making high-profile competitions free of performance-enhancing drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Fifa's Approach to Doping in Football|date=July 2006|pmc=2657497 | pmid=16799099|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.027383|volume=40 Suppl 1|journal=Br J Sports Med|pages=i3–i12|vauthors=Dvorak J, Graf-Baumann T, D'Hooghe M, Kirkendall D, Taennler H, Saugy M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FIFA administration work alongside team physicians to fight for dope free competitions, having them sign a joint declaration that states they agree with having routine blood testing to check for blood doping before any [[FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = FIFA's approach to doping in football|last = Dvorak|first = J.|date = July 2006|journal = British Journal of Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1136/bjsm.2006.027383|pmid = 16799099|last2 = Graf-Bauman|first2 = T.|last3 = D'Hooghe|first4 = D.|first3 = M.|last4 = Kirkendall|last5 = Taennler|first5 = H.|last6 = Saugy|first6 = M.|pmc=2657497|volume=40 Suppl 1|pages=i3–i12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) ==
In December 2013, the UFC began a campaign to drug test their entire roster randomly all year-round. Random testing, however, became problematic for the promotion as it began to affect revenue, as fighters who had tested positive would need to be taken out of fights, which adversely affected fight cards, and therefore pay-per-view sales. If the UFC were not able to find a replacement fighter fights would have to be cancelled. According to Steven Marrocco of [[MMAjunkie.com]], about 31% of UFC fighters subjected to random testing since the program first started have failed due to using performance-enhancing drugs. That is approximately five failed tests for every sixteen  random screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2355620-ufc-must-take-drastic-stand-on-peds-in-mixed-martial-arts|title=UFC Must Take Drastic Stand on PEDs in Mixed Martial Arts|last=Botter|first=Jeremy|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=3 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From July 2015,  the UFC has advocated to all commissions that every fighter be tested in competition for every card. [[Lorenzo Fertitta|Lorenzo Feritta]], who at the time was one of the presidents of the UFC, said, "We want 100 percent of the fighters tested the night they compete". Also, in addition to the drug testing protocols in place for competitors on fight night, the UFC conducts additional testing for main event fighters or any fighters that are due to compete in championship matches. This includes enhanced, random 'out of competition' testing for performance-enhancing drugs, with both urine and blood samples being taken. The UFC also announced that all potential UFC signees would be subject to mandatory pre-contract screening for performance-enhancing drugs prior to being offered a contract with the promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foxsports.com/ufc/story/ufc-unveils-new-drug-testing-protocols-and-standards-for-fighters-021815|title=UFC unveils new drug-testing protocols and standards for fighters|date=18 February 2015|work=FOX Sports|access-date=3 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endurance sports==
The use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport has become an increasing problem across a wide range of sports.&lt;ref name="Rosen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosen|first=Daniel|title=Dope: A History of Performance Enhancement in Sports from the Nineteenth Century to Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is defined as any substance or drug that, when taken, gives an athlete an unfair advantage relative to a "clean" athlete.&lt;ref name="Rosen"/&gt; The banning of these drugs promotes a level playing field and equality among athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Wayne|title=Doping in Elite Sport: The Politics of Drugs in the Olympic Mvnt: The Politics of Drugs in the Olympic Movement|year=2000|publisher=Human Kinetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of 'the suit' in swimming, which gives athletes an advantage in the way of hydrodynamics, has been banned from international competition due to the unfair advantage it delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-body-swimsuit-now-banned-professional-swimmers/story?id=9437780#.T1DSDIdbc-A|title=Full Body Swimsuit Now Banned for Professional Swimmers|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs taken by athletes differ widely based on the performance needs of the sport.

[[Erythropoietin]] (EPO) is largely taken by endurance athletes who seek a higher level of red blood cells, which leads to more oxygenated blood, and a higher [[VO2 max]]. An athlete's VO2 max is highly correlated with success within endurance sports such as swimming, long-distance running, cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] has recently become prevalent amongst endurance athletes due to its potentcy and low degree of detectability when compared to other methods of doping such as [[blood transfusion]]. While EPO is believed to have been widely used by athletes in the 1990s, there was not a way to directly test for the drug until 2002 as there was no specific screening process to test athletes . Athletes at the Olympic Games are tested for EPO through blood and urine tests. Stringent guidelines and regulations can lessen the danger of doping that has existed within some endurance sports.

====''The Convicts of the Road''====
In 1924 the journalist [[Albert Londres]] followed the Tour de France for the French newspaper ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]''. At [[Coutances]] he heard that the previous year's winner, [[Henri Pélissier]], his brother [[Francis Pélissier|Francis]] and a third rider, Maurice Ville, had resigned from the competition after an argument with the organiser [[Henri Desgrange]]. Pélissier explained the problem—whether or not he had the right to take off a jersey—and went on to talk of drugs, reported in Londres' race diary, in which he invented the phrase ''Les Forçats de la Route'' (''The Convicts of the Road''):

:"You have no idea what the Tour de France is," Henri said. "It's a [[Calvary]]. Worse than that, because the road to the Cross has only 14 stations and ours has 15. We suffer from the start to the end. You want to know how we keep going? Here..." He pulled a [[phial]] from his bag. "That's cocaine, for our eyes. This is [[chloroform]], for our gums."

:"This," Ville said, emptying his shoulder bag "is liniment to put warmth back into our knees."

:"And pills. Do you want to see pills? Have a look, here are the pills." Each pulled out three boxes.

:"The truth is," Francis said, "that we keep going on dynamite."

Henri spoke of being as white as shrouds once the dirt of the day had been washed off, then of their bodies being drained by [[diarrhea]], before continuing:

:"At night, in our rooms, we can't sleep. We twitch and dance and jig about as though we were doing [[Sydenham's chorea|St Vitus's Dance]]..."

:"There's less flesh on our bodies than on a skeleton," Francis said.&lt;ref&gt;Londres, Albert: Les frères Pélissier et leur camarade Ville abandonnent, ''Le Petit Parisien'', 27 June 2014, France&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis Pélissier said much later: "Londres was a famous reporter but he didn't know about cycling. We kidded him a bit with our cocaine and our pills. Even so, the Tour de France in 1924 was no picnic."&lt;ref name=DeMon&gt;{{cite book |author= Jean-Pierre de Mondenard |title=Dopage : L'imposture des performances |publisher=Chiron |location=Wilmette, Ill |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-2-7027-0639-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodland, Les: ''Yellow Jersey Guide to the Tour de France'', Yellow Jersey, London, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930, when the race changed to national teams that were to be paid for by the organisers, that the rule book distributed to riders by the organiser, [[Henri Desgrange]], reminded them that drugs were not among items with which they would be provided.&lt;ref&gt;Maso, Benji:Zweet van de Goden, Holland&lt;/ref&gt; The use of [[Pot Belge]] by road cyclists in continental Europe exemplifies a cross-over between recreational and performance-enhancing abuse of drugs by sportsman.

====Festina affair====
{{main|Festina affair|Doping at the 1998 Tour de France}}
In 1998, the entire [[Festina]] team were excluded from the [[Tour de France]] following the discovery of a team car containing large amounts of various performance-enhancing drugs. The team director later admitted that some of the cyclists were routinely given banned substances. Six other teams pulled out in protest including [[Netherlands|Dutch]] team [[TVM (cycling team)|TVM]] who left the tour still being questioned by the [[police]]. The Festina scandal overshadowed cyclist [[Marco Pantani]]'s tour win, but he himself later failed a test. The infamous "[[Pot Belge|pot belge]]" or "Belgian mix" has a decades-long history in pro cycling, among both riders and support staff. [[David Millar]], the 2003 World-Time Trial Champion, admitted using [[erythropoietin|EPO]], and was stripped of his title and suspended for two years. [[Roberto Heras]] was stripped of his victory in the 2005 [[Vuelta a España]] and suspended for two years after testing positive for EPO.

In countries where the use of these drugs is controlled, there is often a [[Illegal drug trade|black market trade]] of smuggled or counterfeit drugs. The quality of these drugs may be poor and can cause health risks. In countries where anabolic steroids are strictly regulated, some have called for a regulatory relief. Steroids are available over-the-counter in some countries such as [[Thailand]] and [[Mexico]].

==Reaction from sports organizations==
Many sports organizations have banned the use of performance-enhancing drugs and have very strict rules and penalties for people who are caught using them. The International Amateur Athletic Federation, now the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], were the first international governing body of [[sport]] to take the situation seriously. In 1928 they banned participants from doping, but with little in the way of testing available they had to rely on the word of the [[sportsperson|athlete]] that they were clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IAAF: A Piece of Anti-Doping History:  IAAF Handbook 1927–1928 {{!}} iaaf.org|url = http://www.iaaf.org/news/news/a-piece-of-anti-doping-history-iaaf-handbook|website = iaaf.org|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was not until 1966 that [[FIFA]] and [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] ([[cycling]]) joined the IAAF in the fight against drugs, followed by the [[International Olympic Committee]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Tribune – Magazine section – Saturday Extra|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20061209/saturday/main2.htm|website = www.tribuneindia.com|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progression in [[pharmacology]] has always outstripped the ability of sports federations to implement rigorous testing procedures but since the creation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in 1999, it has become more effective to catch athletes who use drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What we do|url = https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do|website = World Anti-Doping Agency|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first tests for athletes were at the 1966 European Championships and two years later the IOC implemented their first drug tests at both the [[1968 Summer Olympics|Summer]] and [[1968 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Steroids and Doping in Sports: A Reference Handbook: A Reference Handbook|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tAtIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA295 |publisher = ABC-CLIO|date = 26 November 2013|isbn = 9781610693141|first = David E. Newton|last = Ph.D}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anabolic steroid]]s became prevalent during the 1970s and after a method of detection was found they were added to the IOC's prohibited substances list in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Performance Enhancing Drugs Have Been or Are Banned Olympics? - Drug Use in Sports - ProCon.org|url = http://sportsanddrugs.procon.org/view.answers.php?questionID=001238|website = sportsanddrugs.procon.org|accessdate = 15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, different sporting bodies have evolved differently in the struggle against doping. Some, such as athletics and cycling, are becoming increasingly vigilant against doping. However, there has been criticism that sports such as football (soccer) and baseball are doing nothing about the issue, and letting athletes implicated in doping away unpunished.

Some commentators maintain that, as outright prevention of doping is an impossibility, all doping should be legalised. However, most disagree with this, pointing out the claimed harmful long-term effects of many doping agents. Opponents claim that with doping legal, all competitive athletes would be compelled to use drugs, and the net effect would be a level playing field but with widespread health consequences. A common rebuttal to this argument asserts that anti-doping efforts have been largely ineffective due to both testing limitations and lack of enforcement, and so sanctioned steroid use would not be markedly different from the situation already in existence.

Another point of view is that doping could be legalized to some extent using a drug [[whitelist]] and medical counseling, such that medical [[safety]] is ensured, with all usage published. Under such a system, it is likely that athletes would attempt to cheat by exceeding official limits to try to gain an advantage; this could be considered conjecture as drug amounts do not always correlate linearly with performance gains.

== The Influence of Popular Culture ==

=== Social pressures ===
Social pressure is one of the factors that leads to doping in sport.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hutchinson, Brendan, Stephen Moston, and Terry Engelberg.  “Social validation: a motivational theory of doping in an online bodybuilding community.” ''Sport in Society'', vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 260-282, DOI: 10.1080/17430437.2015.1096245&lt;/ref&gt;The media and society work together to construct a view of what masculinity and femininity should look like. Adolescent athletes are constantly influenced by what they see on the media, and some go to extreme measures to achieve the ideal image since society channels Judith Butler’s definition of gender as a performative act.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Thualagant Nicole. “The conceptualization of fitness doping and its limitations.” ''Sport in Society'', vol.15, no. 3, pp. 409-419, DOI: 10.1080/17430437.2012.653209   &lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of social pressures were given in a study done on an online bodybuilding community where bodybuilders doped because they felt like it was a rite of passage to be accepted into the community, and to feel validated.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Both men and women are being materialized in the context of doping in sport; in an interview involving 140 men, it was concluded that “bodily practices are essential for masculine identity," and it was determined that the media highly publicizes female athletes who were strong, and thin. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This leads to the issue of the consumption of performance enhancement drugs to achieve muscular or thin figures, and the assumption that the opponents are also taking performance enhancing drugs, deeming it as an acceptable behavior to conform to.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Ntoumanis, Nikos, et al. “Personal and Psychosocial Predictors of Doping Use in Physical Activity Settings: A Meta-Analysis.” ''Sports Medicine.'', vol. 44, no. 11, Adis International, Nov. 2014, pp. 1603–24, doi:10.1007/s40279-014-0240-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Morente-Sánchez, Jaime, and Mikel Zabala. "Doping in sport: a review of elite athletes’ attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge." ''Sports Medicine'' 43.6 (2013): 395-411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Petro´czi A, Mazanov J, Nepusz T, et al. Comfort in big numbers: does over-estimation of doping prevalence in others indicate selfinvolvement? J Occup Med Toxicol. 2008;5:3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, society's embracement of the “winning is everything” spirit leads many athletes to participate in doping, hoping that they will not be caught. &lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Ehrnborg, Christer, and Rosén, Thord. “The Psychology Behind Doping in Sport.” ''Growth Hormone &amp; IGF Research : Official Journal of the Growth Hormone Research Society and the International IGF Research Society.'', vol. 19, no. 4, Churchill Livingstone, pp. 285–87, doi:10.1016/j.ghir.2009.04.003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical pressures ===
Elite athletes have financial competitive motivations that cause them to dope and these motivations differ from that of recreational athletes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The common theme among these motivations is the pressure to physically perform. In a study of 101 individuals, 86% responded that their use of performance enhancement drugs were influenced by the potential athletic success, 74%  by the economic aspect, and 30% by self-confidence and social recognition related reasons.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Striegel H, Vollkommer G, Dickhuth HH. Combating drug use in competitive sports: an analysis from the athletes’ perspective. J Sports Med Phys Fitness. 2002;42(3):354–9&lt;/ref&gt; In another study of 40 people, it was concluded that athletes used performance enhancement drugs for for healing purposes so that they were an able competitor for the economic rewards involved with elite sports.&lt;ref&gt;Bloodworth AJ, McNamee M. Clean Olympians? Doping and anti-doping: the views of talented young British athletes. Int J Drug Policy. 2010;21(4):276–82.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physical pressures often overlap with social pressures to have a certain body build. This is the case with muscle dysmorphia, where an athlete wants a more muscular physique for functionality and self- image purposes. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The most popular motive for for athletes to take supplements is to prevent any nutrient deficiencies and to strengthen the immune system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;These factors all focus on improving the body for performance.

=== Psychological Motivations ===
Psychology is another factor to take into consideration in doping in sport. It becomes a behavioral issue when the athlete acknowledges the health risks associated with doping, yet participates in it anyways.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Quirk, Frances H. “Health psychology and drugs in sport.” ''Sport in Society,'' vol. 12, no. 3, pp 375-393, DOI:10.1080/17430430802673726&lt;/ref&gt; This has to do with the psychological thinking that the drug will make one feel invincible.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The individuals are very egotistic in their way of thinking and their motivation is dependent on the performance enhancement drug since they believe that it delivers the results.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; On a study on health psychology, Quirk points out three different psychological aspects that lead one to dope: social cognition, stress and strain, and addiction.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The social and physically pressures can alter an athlete’s way of thinking, leading them to believe that they must take performance enhancement drugs since everyone else is doing it, known as “the doping dilemma.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

*In February 2011, the [[United States Olympic Committee]] and the [[Ad Council]] launched an anti-steroid campaign called [http://facebook.com/playasteriskfree Play Asterisk Free] aimed at teens.  The campaign first launched in 2008 under the name "Don't Be An Asterisk!".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adcouncil.org/newsDetail.aspx?id=241 Adcouncil.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929214131/http://www.adcouncil.org/newsDetail.aspx?id=241 |date=29 September 2011 }}, ''Ad Council'', 8 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*In October 2012, the [[USADA]] released evidence to corroborate their doping claim against cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]]. According to USADA CEO Travis T. Tygart, the evidence against Armstrong includes, "...scientific data and laboratory test results that further prove the use, possession and distribution of performance enhancing drugs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/10/10/162640916/doping-agency-says-11-teammates-testified-against-lance-armstrong]''NPR'', 10 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 1 November 1989, [[US Senator]] [[Joseph Biden]] introduced S. 1829, The Steroid Trafficking Act of 1989. The purpose of the act was simple: It would "amend the Controlled Substances Act to further restrict the use of steroids. By designating anabolic steroids as a Schedule II controlled substance, the bill would crack down on illegal steroid use". (Senate Judiciary Committee, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;282).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Steroid Trafficking Act of 1990 |url = https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/101/s1829|website = |accessdate = 15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Test methods==
Under established doping control protocols, the participant{{clarify|date=May 2016}} will be asked to provide a urine sample, which will be divided into two, each portion to be preserved within sealed containers bearing the same unique identifying number and designation respectively as A- and B-samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"It should be stressed that anti-doping is one of the few types of controls in society in which a confirmation procedure is used in order to protect individuals, and the very rare cases in which the analysis of the B-sample did not match the results of the A-sample have shown the usefulness of such procedure."&lt;ref&gt;

=== Blood test ===
''see also:'' [[blood doping]]

The blood test detects illegal performance enhancement drugs through the measurement of indicators that change with the use of recombinant human erythropoietin&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Green, Gary A. “Doping Control for the Team Physician: A Review of Drug Testing Procedures in Sport.” ''The American Journal of Sports Medicine'', vol. 34, no. 10, Oct. 2006, pp. 1690–1698, doi:10.1177/0363546506293022.&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Hematocrit
# Reticulocytes
# Level of Iron

=== Gas chromatography-combustion-IRMS ===
The gas chromatography-combustion-IRMS is a way to detect any variations in the isotopic composition of an organic compound from the standard. This test is used to detect whether or not synthetic testosterone was consumed, leading to an  increased abnormal testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) level. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Assumptions:&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

# 98.9% of the carbon atoms in nature are 12C
# 1.1% being 13C

The lower the 13C/12C ratio, the more likely that synthetic testosterone was used.&lt;ref&gt;Shehzad Basaria; Androgen Abuse in Athletes: Detection and Consequences, ''The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism'', Volume 95, Issue 4, 1 April 2010, Pages 1533–1543, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-1579&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Athlete Biological Passport ===
The athlete biological passport is a program that tracks the location an athlete to combat doping in sports.&lt;ref&gt;Sottas, Pierre-Edouard, et al. "The athlete biological passport." ''Clinical chemistry'' 57.7 (2011): 969-976.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the athlete can be monitored and drug tested wherever they are and this data can be compared to the history of their doping test results. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Willick, Stuart E, et al. “The Anti-Doping Movement.” ''PM &amp; R : the Journal of Injury,'' ''Function, and Rehabilitation'', vol. 8, no. 3 Suppl, Mar. 2016, pp. S125–32, doi:10.1016/j.pmrj.2015.12.001.&lt;/ref&gt; There is an ongoing discussion about how this measure can be seen as a violation of an individual's privacy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Re-testing of samples===
According to Article 6.5 in the [[World Anti-Doping Code]] samples may be re-tested later. Samples from high-profile events, such as the [[Olympic Games]], are now re-tested up to eight years later to take advantage of new techniques for detecting banned substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/WADA_Anti-Doping_CODE_2009_EN.pdf |title=Ressources |publisher= |accessdate=9 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611203342/http://www.wada-ama.org/Documents/World_Anti-Doping_Program/WADP-The-Code/WADA_Anti-Doping_CODE_2009_EN.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cheating the tests===
Athletes seeking to avoid testing positive use various methods. The most common methods include:
*Urine replacement, which involves replacing dirty urine with clean urine from someone who is not taking banned substances. Urine replacement can be done by [[Urinary catheterization|catheterization]] or with a [[prosthetic penis]] such as [[Whizzinator|The Original Whizzinator]].
*Diuretics, used to cleanse the system before having to provide a sample.
*Blood transfusions, which increase the blood's oxygen carrying capacity, in turn increasing endurance without the presence of drugs that could trigger a positive test result.

===Validity===
Donald Berry, writing in the journal ''Nature'', has called attention to potential problems with the validity of ways in which many of the standardised tests are performed;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Berry, D.A. |title=The science of doping |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |pages=692–3 |date=7 August 2008 |pmid=18685682 |doi=10.1038/454692a |url=}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[''subscription required'']&lt;/sup&gt; in his article, as described in an accompanying editorial, Berry{{quote| argues that anti-doping authorities have not adequately defined and publicized how they arrived at the criteria used to determine whether or not a test result is positive [which are] ...calibrated in part by testing a small number of volunteers taking the substance in question. [Berry argues] ...that individual labs need to verify these detection limits in larger groups that include known dopers and non-dopers under blinded conditions that mimic what happens during competition.&lt;ref name=NatureEditorial08&gt;{{cite journal |author= Nature editors |title=A level playing field? |journal=Nature |volume=454 |issue=7205 |page=667 |date=7 August 2008 |pmid=18685647 |doi=10.1038/454667a |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v454/n7205/full/454667a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The editorial closes, saying "Nature believes that accepting 'legal limits' of specific metabolites without such rigorous verification goes against the foundational standards of modern science, and results in an arbitrary test for which the rate of false positives and false negatives can never be known."&lt;ref name=NatureEditorial08/&gt;

==Defense==
G. Pascal Zachary argues in a ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' essay that legalizing performance-enhancing substances, as well as genetic enhancements once they became available, would satisfy society's need for [[übermensch]]en and reverse the decline in public interest in sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2004/04/steroids-for-everyone/|title=Steroids for Everyone!|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports scholar Verner Moller argues that society is hypocritical when it holds athletes to moral standards, but do not conform to those morals themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/latest_news/2013/?a=28410|title=http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/latest_news/2013/?a=28410|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304034820/http://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/latest_news/2013/?a=28410|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox Sports writer Jen Floyd Engel stated in an article, "We live in a pharmacological society. We live in a society of short cuts, of fake this and enhanced that, and somehow we keep trying to sell the line that sports has become this evil empire of cheating. The reality is athletes are merely doing what so many of us do and celebrate and watch every single day of our lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/melky-cabrera-lance-armstrong-barry-bonds-end-the-fake-steroid-outrage-082912|title=Engel: Enough with the fake steroid outrage|first=Jen Floyd|last=Engel|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Ellis Cashmore argues that what is considered doping is too arbitrary: [[Blood doping|transfusing blood cells]] is not allowed, but other methods of boosting blood cell count, such as [[hypobaric chamber]]s, are allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/424/olympics.shtml|title=The Olympics Meets the War on Drugs|last=Cashmore|first=Ellis|date=24 February 2006|website=StoptheDrugWar.org|publisher=The Drug Reform Coordination Network|access-date=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have advanced similar arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Rory|title=Lowering Restrictions on Performance Enhancing Drugs in Elite Sports|journal=Inquiries Journal|date=2017|volume=9|issue=3|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/1590/lowering-restrictions-on-performance-enhancing-drugs-in-elite-sports|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal==
Anti-doping policies instituted by individual sporting governing bodies may conflict with local laws. A notable case includes the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s inability to suspend players found with banned substances, after it was ruled by a [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota|federal court]] that local labor laws superseded the NFL's anti-doping regime. The challenge was supported by the [[National Football League Players Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4543169|title=Congress to review blocked doping suspensions|date=8 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/sports/football/04starcaps.html?_r=1&amp;hpw | work=The New York Times | title=N.F.L. Seeks Congressional Help on Drug Policy | first=Ken | last=Belson | date=4 November 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes caught doping may be subject to penalties from their local, as well from the individual sporting, governing body. The legal status of anabolic steroids varies from country to country. Fighters found using performance-enhancing drugs in mixed martial arts competitions (e.g. the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]]) could face civil and/or criminal charges once Bill S-209 passes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://topmmanews.com/2013/03/09/legal-ramifications-for-using-peds-in-canadian-mma/ | work=TopMMANews.com | title=Legal Ramifications for Using PEDs in MMA? | first=Erik| last=Magraken| date=9 March 2013 | accessdate=9 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under certain circumstances, when athletes need to take a prohibited substance to treat a medical condition, a therapeutic use exemption may be granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wada-ama.org/en/what-we-do/science-medical/therapeutic-use-exemptions | title = Therapeutic Use Exemptions | publisher = [[World Anti-Doping Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Eigen-ji'''|永源寺||}} is one of 14 autonomous branches of the [[Rinzai]] school of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]], founded in 1361 by the lord of [[Ōmi province]]—Sasaki Ujiyori. The temple is in modern-day [[Higashiōmi, Shiga|Higashiōmi]], [[Shiga prefecture]] of [[Japan]].

==History==
Eigen-ji's first abbot was the famous [[poet]] and [[Rōshi|roshi]] [[Jakushitsu Genko]]. It was a popular destination for members of the 'Five Mountain Schools of Zen' during the [[Onin War]] of the 15th century. After a series of fires that burned the place down during the late 15th and first half of the 16th century, a newly installed abbot named [[Isshi Bunshu]] restored the temple. He is commonly referred to as its second founder.

==Present day==
Today it is the head temple of the Eigen-ji branch of Rinzai Zen and governs more than 120 temples and one [[monastery]].&lt;ref name="dumoulin"&gt;Dumoulin, 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Head Temples&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25606">The "'''eternal return'''" is an idea for interpreting religious behavior proposed by the historian [[Mircea Eliade]]; it is a belief expressed through behavior (sometimes implicitly, but often explicitly) that one is able to become contemporary with or return to the "[[Mythology|mythical]] age"—the time when the events described in one's myths occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger, "Foreword to the 2004 Edition", Eliade, ''Shamanism'', p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt; It should be distinguished from the philosophical concept of ''[[eternal return]]''.

==Sacred and profane==
According to Eliade,
{{Quote | all the definitions given up till now of the religious phenomenon have one thing in common: Each has its own way of showing that the [[sacred]] and the [[Religion|religious life]] are the opposite of the [[Sacrilege|profane]] and [[Secularity|secular life]].&lt;ref&gt;''Patterns in Comparative Religion'', p.&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This concept had already been extensively formulated by the [[France|French]] [[sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;[[Durkheim]], ''The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life'', (1912, English translation by Joseph Swain: 1915) The Free Press, 1965. {{ISBN|0-02-908010-X}}, new translation by Karen E. Fields 1995, {{ISBN|0-02-907937-3}} (p.&amp;nbsp;47)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis-inline|date=January 2012}}  Scholars such as [[Jack Goody]] gave evidence that it may not be universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | place = [[Australia|AU]] | url= http://epress.anu.edu.au/nts/mobile_devices/ch06s03.html |title= The sacred-profane distinction is not universal |accessdate = 2007-07-10 | publisher = ANU | quote = neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane – Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work= J rank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sharp distinction between [[the sacred and the profane]] is Eliade's trademark theory. According to Eliade, traditional man distinguishes two levels of existence: (1) the Sacred, and (2) the profane world. (Here "the Sacred" can be God, gods, mythical ancestors, or any other beings who established the world's structure.) To traditional man, things "acquire their reality, their identity, only to the extent of their participation in a transcendent reality".&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmos and History'', p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Something in our world is only "real" to the extent that it conforms to the Sacred or the patterns established by the Sacred.

Hence, there is profane space, and there is sacred space. Sacred space is space where the Sacred manifests itself; unlike profane space, sacred space has a sense of direction:
{{Quote | In the homogeneous and infinite expanse, in which no point of reference is possible and hence no orientation is established, the [[hierophany]] [appearance of the Sacred] reveals an absolute fixed point, a center.&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 21"&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Where the Sacred intersects our world, it appears in the form of ideal models (e.g., the actions and commandments of gods or mythical heroes). All things become truly "real" by imitating these models. Eliade claims: "For archaic man, reality is a function of the imitation of a celestial [[archetype]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Comos and History'', p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; As evidence for this view, in ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', he cites a belief of the [[Iran]]ian [[Zurvanism|Zurvanites]]. The Zurvanites believed that each thing on Earth corresponds to a sacred, celestial counterpart: for the physical sky, there is a sacred sky; for the physical Earth, there is a sacred Earth; actions are virtuous by conforming to a sacred pattern.&lt;ref name="Myth of the Eternal Return p. 6"&gt;''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; These are some other examples Eliade gives:
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to [[Religions of the Ancient Near East|Mesopotamian beliefs]], the [[Tigris]] has its model in the star [[Ishtar|Anunit]] and the [[Euphrates]] in the star of [[Pisces (constellation)|the Swallow]]. A [[Sumer]]ian text tells of the "place of the creation of the gods," where "the [divinity of] the flocks and grains" is to be found. For the [[Ural–Altaic]] peoples the mountains, in the same way, have an ideal archetype in the sky. In [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], places and [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] were named after the celestial "fields": first the celestial fields were known, then they were identified in terrestrial geography.&lt;ref name="Myth of the Eternal Return p. 6"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Further, there is profane time, and there is sacred time. According to Eliade, myths describe a time that is fundamentally different from historical time (what modern man would consider "normal" time). "In short," says Eliade, "myths describe ... breakthroughs of the sacred (or the 'supernatural') into the World".&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical age is the time when the Sacred entered our world, giving it form and meaning: "The manifestation of the sacred ontologically founds the world".&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 21"/&gt; Thus, the mythical age is sacred time, the only time that has value for traditional man.

==Origin as power==
According to Eliade, in the archaic worldview, the power of a thing resides in its origin, so that "knowing the origin of an object, an animal, a plant, and so on is equivalent to acquiring a magical power over them".&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt; The way a thing was created establishes that thing's nature, the pattern to which it should conform. By gaining control over the origin of a thing, one also gains control over the thing itself.

Eliade concluded that, if origin and power are to be the same, "it is the first manifestation of a thing that is significant and valid".&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt; The Sacred first manifested itself in the events of the mythical age; hence, traditional man sees the mythical age as the foundation of value.

==Sacred time==
Eliade's theory implies that as the power of a thing lies in its origin, the entire world's power lies in the [[cosmogony]]. If the Sacred established all valid patterns in the beginning, during the time recorded in myth, then the mythical age is sacred time—the only time that contains any value. Man's life only has value to the extent that it conforms to the patterns of the mythical age.

The [[Dreamtime|religion]] of the [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginals]] is supposed to contain many examples of the veneration paid to the mythical age. Just before the dawn of the first day, the [[Bagadjimbiri]] brothers emerged from the Earth in the form of [[dingo]]s, and then turned into human giants whose heads touched the sky. Before the Bagadjimbiri came, nothing had existed. But when the sun rose, and the brothers began naming things, the "plants and animals began really to exist".&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 191"&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;191&lt;/ref&gt; The brothers met a group of people and organized them into a civilized society. The people of this tribe—the Karadjeri of [[Australia]]—still imitate the two brothers in many ways:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the Bagadjimbiri stopped to urinate [...] That is the reason why the Australian Karadjeri stop and take up a special position in order to urinate. [...] The brothers stopped and ate a certain grain raw; but they immediately burst into laughter, because they knew that one ought not eat it so [...] and since then men imitate them whenever they have this grain cooked. The Bagadjimbiri threw a primal (a kind of large baton) at an animal and killed it—and this is how men have done it ever since. A great many myths describe the manner in which the brothers Bagadjimbiri founded all the customs of the Karadjeri, and even their behavior.&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 191"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mythical age was the time when the Sacred appeared and established reality. For traditional man, Eliade argues, (1) only the first appearance of something has value; (2) only the Sacred has value; and, therefore, (3) only the first appearance of the Sacred has value. Because the Sacred first appeared in the mythical age, only the mythical age has value. According to Eliade's hypothesis, "primitive man was interested only in the beginnings ... to him it mattered little what had happened to himself, or to others like him, in more or less distant times".&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 44"&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;44&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, traditional societies express a "nostalgia for the origins",&lt;ref name="Myths pg. 44"/&gt; a yearning to return to the mythical age. To traditional man, life only has value in sacred time.

==Myths, rituals, and their purpose==
Eliade also explained how traditional man could find value for his own life (in a vision of where all events occurring after the mythical age cannot have value or reality); he indicated that, if the Sacred's essence lies only in its first appearance, then any later appearance must actually be the first appearance. Thus, an imitation of a mythical event is actually the mythical event itself, happening again—[[myth and ritual|myths and rituals]] carry one back to the mythical age:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In imitating the exemplary acts of a god or of a mythic [[hero]], or simply by recounting their adventures, the man of an archaic society detaches himself from profane time and magically re-enters the Great Time, the sacred time."&lt;ref&gt;''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Myth and ritual are vehicles of "eternal return" to the mythical age. Traditional man's myth- and ritual-filled life constantly unites him with sacred time, giving his existence value. As an example of this phenomenon, Eliade cites church services, by which churchgoers "return" to the sacred time of Scripture:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Just as a church constitutes a break in plane in the profane space of a modern city, [so] the service celebrated inside [the church] marks a break in profane temporal duration. It is no longer today's historical time that is present—the time that is experienced, for example, in the adjacent streets—but the time in which the historical existence of Jesus Christ occurred, the time sanctified by his preaching, by his passion, death, and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Cyclic time==
Eliade attributes the well-known "cyclic" view of time in ancient thought to the eternal return. In many religions, a ritual cycle correlates certain parts of the year with mythical events, making each year a repetition of the mythical age. For instance, Australian Aboriginal peoples annually reenact the events of the "Dreamtime":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The animals and plants created ''[[List of Latin phrases (F–O)#I|in illo tempore]]'' by the Supernatural Beings are ritually re-created. In [[Kimberley region of Western Australia|Kimberley]] the rock paintings, which are believed to have been painted by the Ancestors, are repainted in order to reactivate their creative force, as it was first manifested in the mythical times, at the beginning of the World."&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Every New Year, the people of [[Mesopotamia]] reenacted the ''[[Enuma Elish]]'', a creation myth, in which the god [[Marduk]] slays [[Tiamat]], the primordial monster, and creates the world from her body. They correlated the birth of the year with the mythical birth of the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;48&lt;/ref&gt;

By periodically bringing man back to the mythical age, these liturgical cycles turn time itself into a circle. Those who perform an annual ritual return to the same point in time every 365 days: "With each periodical [ritual] festival, the participants find the same sacred time—the same that had been manifested in the festival of the previous year or in the festival of a century earlier."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;69&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eliade, some traditional societies express their cyclic experience of time by equating the world with the year:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In a number of North American Indian languages the term world (= Cosmos) is also used in the sense of year. The Yokuts says 'the world has passed,' meaning 'a year has gone by.' For the Yuki, the year is expressed by the words for earth or world. [...] The cosmos is conceived [of] as a living unity that is born, develops, and dies on the last day of the year, to be reborn on New Year's Day. [...] At every New Year, time begins ''ab initio''."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The New Year ritual reenacts the mythical beginning of the cosmos. Therefore, by the logic of the eternal return, each New Year ''is'' the beginning of the cosmos. Thus, time flows in a closed circle, always returning to the sacred time celebrated during the New Year: the cosmos's entire duration is limited to one year, which repeats itself indefinitely.

These ritual cycles do more than give humans a sense of value. Because traditional man identifies reality with the Sacred, he believes that the world can endure only if it remains in sacred time. He periodically revives sacred time through myths and rituals in order to keep the universe in existence. In many cultures, this belief appears to be consciously held and clearly stated. From the perspective of these societies, the world
&lt;blockquote&gt;"must be periodically renewed or it may perish. The idea that the [[Cosmos]] is threatened with ruin if not annually re-created provides the inspiration for the chief festival of the [[California]] [[Karuk|Karok]], [[Hupa]], and [[Yurok tribe|Yurok]] tribes. In the respective languages the ceremony is called 'repair' or 'fixing' of the world, and, in English, 'New Year'. Its purpose is to re-establish or strengthen the Earth for the following year or two years."&lt;ref&gt;''Myth and Reality'', pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human creativity==
To some, the theory of the eternal return may suggest a view of traditional societies as stagnant and unimaginative, afraid to try anything new. However, Eliade argues that the eternal return does not lead to "a total cultural immobility".&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 140"&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;140&lt;/ref&gt; If it did, traditional societies would never have changed or evolved, and "ethnology knows of no single people that has not changed in the course of time".&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 140"/&gt; The mere fact that traditional societies have colonized new lands and invented new technologies proves that the eternal return hasn't suppressed their sense of initiative.&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 141"&gt;''Myth and Reality'', p.&amp;nbsp;141&lt;/ref&gt;

Far from suppressing creativity, Eliade argues, the eternal return promotes it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There is no reason to hesitate before setting out on a sea voyage, because the mythical Hero has already made [such a voyage] in the fabulous Time. All that is needed is to follow his example. Similarly, there is no reason to fear settling an unknown, wild territory, because one knows what to do. One has merely to repeat the cosmogonic ritual, whereupon the unknown territory (= 'Chaos') is transformed into 'Cosmos'."&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 141"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Eliade, traditional man has endless creative possibilities because "the possibilities for applying the mythical model are endless".&lt;ref name="Myth and Reality, p. 141"/&gt;

=="Terror of History"==
According to Eliade, this yearning to remain in the mythical age causes a "terror of history". Traditional man desires to escape the linear march of events, empty of any inherent value or sacrality. In Chapter 4 of ''The Myth of the Eternal Return'' (entitled "The Terror of History") and in the appendix to ''Myths, Dreams and Mysteries'', Eliade suggests that the abandonment of mythical thought and the full acceptance of linear, historical time, with its "terror", is one of the reasons for [[Modernity|modern man]]'s [[Anxiety|anxieties]]. Traditional societies escape this anxiety to an extent, as they refuse to completely acknowledge historical time. Eliade describes the difference between ancient and modern man's reactions to history, as well as modern man's impotence before the terror of history, as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In our day, when historical pressure no longer allows any escape, how can man tolerate the catastrophes and horrors of history—from collective deportations and massacres to atomic bombings—if beyond them he can glimpse no sign, no transhistorical meaning; if they are only the blind play of economic, social, or political forces, or, even worse, only the result of the 'liberties' that a minority takes and exercises directly on the stage of universal history?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We know how, in the past, humanity has been able to endure the sufferings we have enumerated: they were regarded as a punishment inflicted by God, the syndrome of the decline of the 'age,' and so on. And it was possible to accept them precisely because they had a metahistorical meaning [...] Every war rehearsed the struggle between good and evil, every fresh social injustice was identified with the sufferings of the Saviour (or, for example, in the pre-Christian world, with the passion of a divine messenger or vegetation god), each new massacre repeated the glorious end of the martyrs. [...] By virtue of this view, tens of millions of men were able, for century after century, to endure great historical pressures without despairing, without committing suicide or falling into that spiritual aridity that always brings with it a relativistic or nihilistic view of history"&lt;ref&gt;''The Myth of the Eternal Return'', pp.&amp;nbsp;151–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Terror of the eternal return==
In general, according to Eliade, traditional man sees the eternal return as something positive, even necessary. However, in some religions, such as [[Buddhism]] and certain forms of [[Hinduism]], the traditional cyclic view of time becomes a source of terror:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "In certain highly evolved societies, the intellectual [[élite]]s progressively detach themselves from the patterns of traditional religion. The periodical resanctification of cosmic time then proves useless and without meaning. [...] But ''repetition emptied of its religious content necessarily leads to a pessimistic vision of existence''. When it is no longer a vehicle for reintegrating a primordial situation [...] that is, ''when it is desacralized'', cyclic time becomes terrifying; it is seen as a circle forever turning on itself, repeating itself to infinity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When the world becomes desacralized, the traditional cyclic view of time is too firmly entrenched to simply vanish. It survives, but in a profane form (such as the myth of [[reincarnation]]). Time is no longer static, as for the Karadjeri, for whom almost every action imitates a mythical model, keeping the world constantly in the mythical age. Nor is time cyclical but sacred, as for the ancient Mesopotamians, whose ritual calendar periodically returned the world to the mythical age. Rather, for some [[Dharmic religions]], "time was homologized to the cosmic illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'')".&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 109"&gt;''The Sacred and the Profane'', p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of traditional humanity, linear history is profane, and sacredness lies in cyclic time. But, in Buddhism, [[Jainism]], and some forms of Hinduism, even cyclic time has become profane. The Sacred cannot be found in the mythical age; it exists outside all ages. Thus, human fulfilment does not lie in returning to a sacred time, but in escaping from time altogether, in "a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] of the cosmos."&lt;ref name="Profane pg. 109"/&gt; In these religions, the "eternal return" is less like the eternal return in most traditional societies (for whom time has an objective beginning, to which one should return) and more like the philosophical concept of eternal return—an endless cosmic cycle, with no beginning and, thus, no inherently sacred time.

==Scholarly criticism==
Although immensely influential in religious studies, the ideas behind Eliade's hypothesis of the eternal return are less well accepted in anthropology and sociology. According to the classicist G. S. Kirk, this is because Eliade overextends the application of his ideas: for example, Eliade claims that the modern myth of the "noble savage" results from the religious tendency to idealize the primordial, mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth, footnote, p. 255"&gt;Kirk, ''Myth'', footnote, p.&amp;nbsp;255&lt;/ref&gt; Kirk claims that Eliade's relative unpopularity among anthropologists and sociologists also results from Eliade's assumption—essential for belief in the eternal return as Eliade formulates it—that primitive and archaic cultures had concepts such as "being" and "real", although they lacked words for them.&lt;ref name="Kirk, Myth, footnote, p. 255"/&gt;

Kirk thinks Eliade's theory of eternal return applies to some cultures. Specifically, he agrees that Australian Aborigines used myths and rituals "to bring the Dreamtime" (the Australian mythical age) "into the present with potent and fruitful results".&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 64"&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;64&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kirk argues, Eliade takes this Australian phenomenon and applies it to other cultures uncritically. In short, Kirk sees Eliade's theory of eternal return as a universalization of the Australian Dreamtime concept.&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 64"/&gt;

As two counterexamples to the eternal return, Kirk cites Native American mythology and Greek mythology. The eternal return is nostalgic: by retelling and reenacting mythical events, Australian Aborigines aim to evoke and relive the Dreamtime. However, Kirk believes that Native American myths "are not evocative or nostalgic in tone, but tend to be detailed and severely practical".&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 64"/&gt; In many Native American mythologies, animals once acted like humans, during the mythical age; but they don't any longer: the division between animals and men is now a firm one, and according to Kirk, "that in itself reduces the effectiveness of myth-telling as a reconstitution" of the mythical age.&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 65"&gt;Kirk, ''The Nature of Greek Myths'', p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt; As for Greek myths, many of them fall outside any sacred age of origins: this challenges Eliade's claim that almost all myths are about origins, and that people retell and reenact myths to return to the time of origins.&lt;ref name="Kirk, p. 65"/&gt; (Note that the classicist Kirk uses a much broader definition of "myth" than many professional folklorists. According to the classical definition used by folklorists, many Greek stories conventionally called "myths" are not myths, precisely ''because'' they fall outside a sacred age of origins.&lt;ref&gt;Dundes, p.&amp;nbsp;45&lt;/ref&gt;)

Even Wendy Doniger, a religious-studies scholar and Eliade's successor at the University of Chicago, claims (in the Introduction to Eliade's own ''Shamanism'') that the eternal return does not apply to all myths and rituals, although it may apply to many of them.&lt;ref&gt;''Shamanism'', p.&amp;nbsp;xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in popular culture==
In [[T. A. Barron]]'s ''[[The Lost Years of Merlin]]'' (the "Sacred Time" chapter), Merlin's mother says that "stories"—specifically, myths—are "real enough to help [her] live. And work. And find the meaning hidden in every dream, every leaf, every drop of dew."&lt;ref name="Barron, pg. 36"&gt;Barron, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;/ref&gt; She states that "they dwell in sacred time, which flows in a circle. Not historical time, which runs in a line."&lt;ref name="Barron, pg. 36"/&gt;

[[Jean Cocteau]]'s screenplay for ''[[L'Éternel retour]]'' portrays the timeless nature of the myth of [[Tristan and Isolde]].

The Heavy Metal band Therion released "Eternal Return" on their 2000 album "Deggail." The song is thematically in line with Eliade's concept of the eternal return and would seem to be inspired by it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3019">The '''European Society for Analytic Philosophy''' ('''ESAP''')  is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] organization founded by [[Kevin Mulligan]], [[Barry Smith (ontologist)|Barry Smith]], [[Peter Simons (academic)|Peter Simons]], Pierre Jacob, Marco Santambrogio, [[Andreas Kemmerling]] and [[Pascal Engel]] in 1991.

==History==
The founders of ESAP felt that after the long interruption due to World War II and the North American exile of many European philosophers, analytic philosophy was finally flourishing again in Europe. But even though more and more people were doing analytic philosophy in Continental Europe, they were often not even aware of each other’s existence. Both in their writings and in their personal interactions, European analytic philosophers were looking rather exclusively towards North America and Britain. But now, it seemed the time was ripe for bringing together analytic philosophers from all over Europe in one society furthering inter-European contacts, connections, and collaboration. Thus, ESAP was born. Today, analytic philosophy on the whole is flourishing more than ever in Europe. European analytic philosophers are also far more connected to one another and have far more of a voice to be reckoned with in the international publishing landscape. Especially in times of growing economic and political pressures on higher education and research, ESAP sees its mission in furthering and facilitating these connections, collaborations, and the conditions for research in analytic philosophy across Europe.

ESAP’s first president was [[Francois Recanati]]. He organized the first European Congress for Analytic Philosophy (ECAP) in 1993 in Aix-en-Provence. The ECAP has become the big get-together for analytic philosophers at any level of their careers in Europe. Organizing it every third year is one of the main tasks of the ESAP presidents. ESAP can by now look back on a long list of illustrious presidents who have devoted much time and labor to organizing a long list of vibrant events in many of the great cities of Europe: [[Peter Simons (academic)|Peter Simons]] organized ECAP2 in Leeds (1996), Nenad Miscevic ECAP3 in Maribor (1999), [[Wlodek Rabinowicz]] ECAP4 in Lund (2002), João Branquino ECAP5 in Lisbon (2005), [[Jan Wolenski]] ECAP6 in Cracow (2008), Michele di Francesco ECAP7 in Milan (2011), Mircea Dumitru ECAP8 in Bucharest (2013). In 2017, ECAP9 will be held at [[LMU Munich]], organized by ESAP’s current president, [[Stephan Hartmann]]. During the presidency of Peter Simons, the journal [[Dialectica]] became the official journal of ESAP. As early as in 1997, the first website of ESAP was set up by Božidar Kante. It was renewed by [[Carlo Penco]] in 1999 and maintained by him till 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7828">In [[biology]], memory is present if the state of a biological system depends on its history in addition to present conditions. If this memory is recorded in the genetic material and stably inherited through cell division ([[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]]), it is genetic memory.

==Somatic memory==

''Somatic memory'' is limited to the organism and not passed on to subsequent generations. However, its mechanism may involve mitotically stable genetic memory. The term applies for cellular memory, animals' memory, and plants' memory, as described in the following paragraphs.

===Cellular memory===

All cells in multicellular organisms are derived from a [[pluripotent]] [[zygote]] and contain the same genetic material (with a few exceptions). However, they are capable of recording a history of their development within the organism leading to their specialized functions and limitations. Cells often employ [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] processes that affect DNA-protein interactions to record this ''cellular memory'' in the form of [[mitosis|mitotically]] stable changes of the genetic material without a change in the [[DNA]] sequence itself. This is typically achieved via changes of the [[chromatin]] structure.&lt;ref name="pmid17416595"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hirose S |title=Crucial roles for chromatin dynamics in cellular memory |journal=J. Biochem. |volume=141 |issue=5 |pages=615–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17416595 |doi=10.1093/jb/mvm092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are [[methylation]] patterns of the DNA molecule itself and proteins involved in packaging DNA, such as [[histone]]s (also referred to as "histone code").&lt;ref name="pmid11782440"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bird A |title=DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory |journal=[[Genes &amp; Development]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |year=2002 |pmid=11782440 |doi=10.1101/gad.947102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12419240"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Turner BM |title=Cellular memory and the histone code |journal=Cell |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=285–91 |year=2002 |pmid=12419240 |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(02)01080-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In animals===

A case of somatic genetic memory is the ''immunological memory'' of the [[adaptive immune response]] in [[vertebrate]]s. The immune system is capable of learning to recognize pathogens and keeping a memory of this learning process, which is the basis of the success of [[vaccination]]s. [[Antibody]] genes in B and T [[lymphocyte]]s are assembled from separate gene segments, giving each lymphocyte a unique antibody coding sequence leading to the vast diversity of antibodies in the immune system. If stimulated by an [[antigen]] (e.g. following vaccination or an [[infection]] with a [[pathogen]]), these antibodies are further fine-tuned via [[hypermutation]]. [[Memory B cell]]s capable of producing these antibodies form the basis for acquired immunological memory.&lt;ref name="pmid15130504"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Crotty S, Ahmed R |title=Immunological memory in humans |journal=Semin. Immunol. |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=197–203 |year=2004 |pmid=15130504 |doi=10.1016/j.smim.2004.02.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual therefore carries a unique genetic memory of its immune system's close encounters with pathogens. As a somatic memory, this is not passed on to the next generation.

===In plants===

Plants that undergo [[vernalization]] (promotion of flowering by a prolonged exposure to cold temperatures) record a ''genetic memory of winter'' to gain the competence to flower. The process involves epigenetically recording the length of cold exposure through [[chromatin remodeling]] which leads to mitotically stable changes in gene expression (the "winter code").&lt;ref name="pmid16980591"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sung S, Amasino RM |title=Molecular genetic studies of the memory of winter |journal=J. Exp. Bot. |volume=57 |issue=13 |pages=3369–77 |year=2006 |pmid=16980591 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erl105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This releases the inhibition of flowering initiation and allows the plants to bloom with the correct timing at the onset of spring. As a somatic memory, this state is not passed on to subsequent generations but has to be acquired by each individual plant. The process of vernalization was falsely assumed to be a stably inherited genetic memory passed on to subsequent generations by the [[Russia]]n geneticist [[Trofim Lysenko]]. Lysenko's claims of genetic memory and efforts to obtain or fabricate results in proof of it had disastrous effects for Russian genetics in the early 20th century (also see: [[Lysenkoism]]).&lt;ref name="pmid15466409"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Amasino R |title=Vernalization, competence, and the epigenetic memory of winter |journal=Plant Cell |volume=16 |issue=10 |pages=2553–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15466409 |doi=10.1105/tpc.104.161070 |pmc=520954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inherited epigenetic memory===
In [[genetics]], [[genomic imprinting]] or other patterns of inheritance that are not determined by DNA sequence alone can form an epigenetic memory that is passed on to subsequent generations through [[meiosis]]. In contrast, somatic genetic memories are passed on by [[mitosis]] and limited to the individual, but are not passed on to the offspring. Both processes include similar epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. involving histones and methylation patterns.&lt;ref name="pmid17467256"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ooi SL, Henikoff S |title=Germline histone dynamics and epigenetics |journal=Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=257–65 |year=2007 |pmid=17467256 |doi=10.1016/j.ceb.2007.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17341434"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gehring M, Henikoff S |title=DNA methylation dynamics in plant genomes |journal=Biochim. Biophys. Acta |volume=1769 |issue=5-6 |pages=276–86 |year=2007 |pmid=17341434 |doi=10.1016/j.bbaexp.2007.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microbial memory===
In microbes, genetic memory is present in the form of inversion of specific DNA sequences serving as a switch between alternative patterns of gene expression.&lt;ref name="pmid12111734"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casadesús J, D'Ari R |title=Memory in bacteria and phage |journal=BioEssays |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=512–8 |year=2002 |pmid=12111734 |doi=10.1002/bies.10102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution===
In [[population genetics]] and [[evolution]], genetic memory represents the recorded history of adaptive changes in a species. Selection of organisms carrying genes coding for the best adapted proteins results in the [[evolution]] of species. An example for such a genetic memory is the [[innate immune response]] that represents a recording of the history of common microbial and viral pathogens encountered throughout the evolutionary history of the species.&lt;ref name="pmid14685686"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dempsey PW, Vaidya SA, Cheng G |title=The art of war: Innate and adaptive immune responses |journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=2604–21 |year=2003 |pmid=14685686 |doi=10.1007/s00018-003-3180-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the somatic memory of the adaptive immune response, the innate immune response is present at birth and does not require the immune system to learn to recognize antigens.

In the history of theories of evolution, the proposed genetic memory of an individual's experiences and environmental influences was a central part of [[Lamarckism]] to explain the inheritance of evolutionary changes.

===Animal behavior===
In [[ethology]], genetic memory refers the inheritance of [[instinct]] in animals.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

'''Gerris''' is [[computer software]] in the field of [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD). Gerris was released as [[free and open-source software]], subject to the requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL), version 2 or any later.

== Scope ==
[[File:Gerris website.png|thumb|right|Banner of the Gerris website]]
''Gerris'' solves the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] in 2 or 3 dimensions, allowing to model industrial fluids (aerodynamics, internal flows, etc.) or for instance, the mechanics of [[droplets]], thanks to an accurate formulation of multiphase flows (including surface tension). Actually, the latter field of study is the reason why the software shares the same name as the [[Gerris|insect genus]].

''Gerris'' also provides features relevant to geophysical flows:
# ocean tide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Msadek |first1=R. |title=Hydrodynamic tidal model of Cook Strait |journal=Technical report, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric research |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# sea state (surface waves)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tsai |first1=C.-C. |first2=T.-H. |last2=Hou |first3=S. |last3=Popinet |title=Wind wave prediction of tropical cyclones by a quadtree-adaptive model |journal=Coastal Engineering |volume=77 |year=2013 |pages=108–119 |doi=10.1016/j.coastaleng.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Popinet |first1=S. |first2=R.M. |last2=Gorman |first3=G.J. |last3=Rickard |first4=H.L. |last4=Tolman |title=A quadtree-adaptive spectral wave model |journal=Ocean Modelling |volume=34 |year=2010 |pages=36–49 |doi=10.1016/j.ocemod.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flow types #1 to #3 were studied using the [[Shallow water equations|shallow-water]] solver included in ''Gerris'', case #4 brings in the [[Primitive equations|primitives equations]] and application #5 relies on the ''spectral'' equations for generation/propagation/dissipation of swell (and/or wind sea): for this purpose ''Gerris'' makes use of the source terms from WaveWatchIII.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/waves/wavewatch/wavewatch.shtml WaveWatchIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, one can note that the (non-hydrostatic) Navier–Stokes solver was also used in the ocean to study:
* fluvial plumes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O'Callaghan |first1=J. |first2=G. |last2=Rickard |first3=S. |last3=Popinet |first4=C. |last4=Stevens |title=Response of buoyant plumes to transient discharges investigated using an adaptive solver |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=115 |year=2010 |pages=C11025 |doi=10.1029/2009jc005645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* internal waves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rickard |first1=G. |first2=J. |last2=O'Callaghan |first3=S. |last3=Popinet |title=Numerical simulations of internal solitary waves interacting with uniform slopes using an adaptive model |journal=Ocean Modelling |volume=30 |year=2009 |pages=16–28 |doi=10.1016/j.ocemod.2009.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* hydrothermal convection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tao |first1=Y. |first2=S. |last2=Rosswog |first3=M. |last3=Brüggen |title=A simulation modeling approach to hydrothermal plumes and its comparison to analytical models |journal=Ocean Modelling |volume=61 |year=2013 |pages=68–80 |doi=10.1016/j.ocemod.2012.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary ''Gerris'' does not allow (in its current status) the modeling of compressible fluids (supersonic flows).

== Numerical scheme ==
Several methods can be used to provide a numerical solution to [[partial differential equation]]s:
* [[finite differences]]
* [[Finite-volume method|finite volumes]]
* [[Finite element method|finite elements]]
''Gerris'' belongs to the ''finite volumes'' family of CFD models.

== Type of grid ==
Most models use meshes which are either structured (Cartesian or curvilinear grids) or unstructured (triangular, tetrahedral, etc.). ''Gerris'' is quite different on this respect: it implements a deal between structured and unstructured meshes by using a tree data structure,{{efn|''quadtree'' en 2D, ''octree'' en 3D}} allowing to refine locally (and dynamically) the (finite-volume) description of the pressure and velocity fields. Indeed the grid evolves in the course of a given simulation owing to criteria defined by the user (''e.g.'' dynamic refinement of the grid in the vicinity of sharp gradients).

== Turbulent closure ==
''Gerris'' mainly aims at [[Direct numerical simulation|DNS]]; the range of [[Reynolds number|Reynolds]] available to the user thus depends on the computing power they can afford (although the auto-adaptive mesh allows one to focus the computing resources on the coherent structures). According to the ''Gerris'' FAQ&lt;ref&gt;[http://gfs.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FAQ ''Gerris'' (Frequently Asked Questions)]&lt;/ref&gt; the implementation of turbulence models will focus on the [[Large eddy simulation|LES]] family rather than [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|RANS]] approaches.

== Programming language, library dependencies, included tools ==
''Gerris'' is developed in C using the libraries [[GLib|Glib]] (object orientation, dynamic loading of modules, etc.) and GTS.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gts.sourceforge.net/ GTS]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter brings in facilities to perform geometric computations such as triangulation of solid surfaces and their intersection with fluid cells. Moreover ''Gerris'' is fully compliant with [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] parallelisation (including dynamic load balancing).

''Gerris'' does not need a meshing tool since the local (and time dependent) refinement of the grid is on charge of the solver itself. As far as solid surfaces are concerned, several input formats are recognized:
* analytic formulas in the parameter file
* GTS triangulated files; note that the ''Gerris'' distribution includes a tool to translate the STL format (exported by various CAD software) into GTS triangulated surfaces
* bathymetric/topographic database in [[K-d tree|KDT]] format; a tool is also provided to generate such a database from simple ASCII listings

Among the various ways to output ''Gerris'' results, let us just mention here:
* Graphical output in PPM format: images can then be converted in (nearly) any format using [[ImageMagick]], and MPEG movies can be generated thanks to [[FFmpeg]] (among others).
* Simulation files (''.gfs''), which are actually parameters files concatenated with fields issued from the simulation; these files can then be (i) re-used as parameter files (defining new initial conditions), or (ii) processed with ''Gfsview''.
* ''Gfsview'', a display software shipped with ''Gerris'', able to cope with the tree structure of the ''Gerris'' grid (a data structure which is not efficiently operated by general visualization software{{efn|However, ''Gerris'' also provides a module exporting its results in Esri Grid format.}}).

== Licence ==
CFD software, as any software, can be developed in various "realms":
* Business;
* Academic;
* Open Source.
As far as CFD is concerned, a thorough discussion of these software development paths can be found in the statement by Zaleski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lmm.jussieu.fr/~zaleski/OpenCFD.html |title=Science and Fluid Dynamics should have more open sources |work=Institut Jean le Rond d'Alembert |author=Stéphane Zaleski |year=2001 |accessdate=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is noteworthy that ''Gerris'' was distributed as [[free and open-source software]] right from the onset of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Popinet |first1=S. |title=Gerris: a tree-based adaptive solver for the incompressible Euler equations in complex geometries |journal=Journal of Computational Physics |volume=190 |year=2003 |pages=572–600 |doi=10.1016/s0021-9991(03)00298-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Popinet |first1=S. |title=Free Computational Fluid Dynamics |journal=Cluster World |volume=2 |year=2004 |pages=2–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Hakuin}}
{{Nihongo|'''Hakuin Ekaku'''|白隠 慧鶴||extra=January 19, 1686 - January 18, 1768}} was one of the most influential figures in [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. He is regarded as the reviver of the [[Rinzai school]] from a moribund period of stagnation, refocusing it on its traditionally rigorous training methods integrating [[meditation]] and [[koan]] practice.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of [[Hara-juku (Tōkaidō)|Hara]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nippon-kichi.jp/article_list.do?ml_lang=en&amp;p=2082 Shoinji Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; at the foot of [[Mount Fuji]]. His mother was a devout [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]], and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist [[monk]]. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the [[Eight Hot Hells]]. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of [[hell]], seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk.

====Shōin-ji and Daishō-ji====
At the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, [[Shōin-ji]]. When the head monk at Shōin-ji took ill, Hakuin was sent to a neighboring temple, Daishō-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the [[Lotus Sutra]], considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying "it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about [[causality|cause and effect]]".

====Zensō-ji====
At age eighteen, he left Daishō-ji for Zensō-ji, a temple close to Hara.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xv}} At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Ch'an]] master [[Yantou Quanhuo]], who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvi}}

====Zuiun-ji====
Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvii}} While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the [[Dharma]] to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xviii-xix}}

===First awakening===

====Eigen-ji====
He again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into [[Kensho|enlightenment]] when he was twenty-four.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xvii}} He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple.
[[File:Hakuin.jpg|left|thumb|Hakuin Ekaku]]

====Shōju Rōjin====
Hakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Shōju Rōjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721).{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxi-xxii}} Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Shōju replied "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!"{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}} Shōju assigned him a series of "hard-to-pass" koans. These led to three isolated moments of [[satori]], but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Shōju meant with this.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}}

Hakuin left Shoju after eight months of study,{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii-xxiii}} without receiving formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; but Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin. Today Hakuin is considered to have received [[dharma transmission]] from Shoju.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html Zen Buddhism: from perspective of Japanese Soto &amp; Rinzai Zen Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040105/http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Taigi'' - great doubt====
Hakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} He was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} When he was twenty-six he read that "all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi-mind fall into Hell".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} This raised a "great doubt" (''taigi'') in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what "bodhi-mind" means, namely working for the good of others.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}}

====Zen sickness====
Hakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a [[nervous breakdown]] by Western medicine. He called it [[Zen sickness]], and sought the advice of a [[Taoist]] cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a [[Mental image|visualization]] and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms.  From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue.  The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.

===Head priest at Shōin-ji===
After another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}}}

It was around this time that he adopted the name "Hakuin", which means "concealed in white", referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=71}}

====Final awakening====
Although Hakuin had several "satori experiences", he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}} At age 41, he experienced a final and total awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the [[sutra]] that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the [[Bodhicitta|Bodhi-mind]] means working for the good of every sentient being:{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}
{{quote|It was the chapter on parables, where the Buddha cautions his disciple Shariputra against savoring the joys of [[Pratyekabuddha|personal enlightenment]], and reveals to him the truth of the [[Bodhisattva]]'s mission, which is to continue practice beyond enlightenment, teaching and helping others until all beings have attained salvation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}}}

He wrote of this experience, saying "suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus". This event marked a turning point in Hakuin's life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}

====Practicing the bodhi-mind====
He would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin's students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors.

====Is that so?====
A well-known anecdote took place in this period:
{{quote|A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near Hakuin. One day, without any warning, her parents discovered she was pregnant. This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.&lt;br&gt;
In great anger the parents went to the master. "Is that so?" was all he would say.&lt;br&gt;
After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors and everything else the child needed by [[takuhatsu]].&lt;br&gt;
A year later the girl could stand it no longer. She told her parents the truth - the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fish market.&lt;br&gt;
The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back.&lt;br&gt;
Hakuin smiled and willingly yielded the child, saying: "Is that so? It's good to hear this baby has his/her father"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Reps|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kimihiko|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.

===Post-satori practice===
[[Hakuin]] saw "deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere"{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35}} as an indispensable part of the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Buddhist path to awakening]]. Hakuin emphasized the need for "post-satori training",{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and 
{{quote|[W]hipping forward the wheel of the Four Universal Vows, pledging yourself to benefit and save all sentient beings while striving every minute of your life to practice the great Dharma giving.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

The insight in the need of arousing [[bodhicitta]] formed Hakuin's final awakening:
{{quote|What is to be valued above all else is the practice that comes after satori is achieved. What is that practice? It is the practice that puts the [[Bodhicitta|Mind of Enlightenment]] first and foremost.&lt;br&gt;
[At] my forty-first year, [...] I at long last penetrated into the heart of this great matter. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I saw it — it was as clear as if it were right there in the hollow of my hand. What is the Mind of Enlightenment? It is, I realized, a matter of doing good — benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

===Koan practice===
Hakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive [[meditation]] on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and [[doubt]] that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the "great doubt", writing, "At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40980460|title=Sculpture in the age of doubt|last=1939-2013,|first=McEvilley, Thomas,|isbn=9781581150230|location=New York|oclc=40980460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakuin used a fivefold classification system:{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}}&lt;br&gt;
1. ''Hosshin'', dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}} They reveal the [[dharmakaya]], or Fundamental.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136}} They introduce "the undifferentiated and the unconditional".{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136-137}}&lt;br&gt;
2. ''Kikan'', dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view;{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148-149}} Where ''hosshin'' koans represent ''tai'', substance, ''kikan'' koans represent ''yu'', function.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=137}}&lt;br&gt;
3. ''Gonsen'', explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=149}} They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=138}}&lt;br&gt;
4. ''Hachi Nanto'', eight "difficult to pass" koans.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}} There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through ''satori''. {{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=139}} It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23}} Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten ''hachi nanto'' koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23-24}}&lt;br&gt;
5.  ''Goi jujukin'' koans, the [[Five Ranks|Five Ranks of Tozan]] and the Ten Grave Precepts.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=151}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}}

Hakuin's emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher.  If the teacher feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, "You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?".  Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the [[Mu (Japanese word)|Mu]] koan. He believed his "Sound of One Hand" to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that "its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud".

===Four ways of knowing===
{{See also|Huayan school#Four Dharmadhatu|l1=Four Dharmadhatu|Five wisdoms}}

Asanga, one of the main proponents of [[Yogacara]], introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the [[Eight Consciousnesses]]: 
# The five senses are connected to the perfection of action,
# Samjna (cognition) is connected to observing knowing,
# Manas (mind) is related to universal knowing,
# Alaya-vijnana is connected to great mirror knowing.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}
In time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the [[Trikaya|three bodies of the Buddha]] ([[Dharmakāya]], [[Sambhogakāya]] and Nirmanakaya), together forming the "Yuishiki doctrine".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}

Hakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}
# The Gate of Inspiration is initial awakening, [[kensho]], seeing into one's true nature.
# The Gate of Practice is the purification of oneself by continuous practice.
# The Gate of Awakening is the study of the ancient masters and the Buddhist sutras, to deepen the insight into the Buddhist teachings, and acquire the skills needed to help other sentient beings on the Buddhist path to awakening.
# The Gate of Nirvana is the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}

===Opposition to "Do-nothing Zen"===
One of Hakuin's major concerns was the danger of what he called "Do-nothing Zen" teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, "passing day after day in a state of seated sleep".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=3}} Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil "emptiness" was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of  followers of the maverick Zen master [[Bankei]].{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=125, 126}} He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities.{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}

===Lay teachings===
An extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing the wisdom of Zen to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the [[rural]] population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in [[Kyoto]], preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from [[Confucianism]], ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings.

In addition to this, Hakuin was also a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the [[vernacular]], and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read.

===Calligraphy===
An important part of Hakuin's practice of Zen was his painting and [[calligraphy]]. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of "visual sermons" that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were [[illiterate]]. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world's leading museums.

==Influence==
Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=391}}

==Writings==
Hakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and [[Kanbun]] Works (4 vols.).&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.zenbunka.or.jp/en/investigation/entry/post_17.html Hakuin Study Group] has been researching the written works of Hakuin.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the best known and edited in English.

'''Herbert Dingle''' (2 August 1890 &amp;ndash; 4 September 1978) was an English physicist and [[natural philosopher]], who served as president of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] from 1951 to 1953. He is best known for [[Criticism of relativity theory|his opposition]] to [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]] and the protracted controversy that this provoked.

==Biography==
Dingle was born in [[London]], but spent his early years in [[Plymouth]], where he was taken following the death of his father, and where he attended Plymouth Science, Art and Technical Schools. Due to lack of money, he left school at the age of 14 and found employment as a clerk, a job which he held for 11 years. At age 25 he won a scholarship to the [[Imperial College]], [[London]], from which he graduated in 1918. In that same year, Dingle married Alice Westacott who later gave birth to a son. As a [[Quaker]], Dingle was exempt from military service during [[World War I]]. He took a position as a Demonstrator in the Physics Department, and devoted himself to the study of [[spectroscopy]] (following his mentor [[Alfred Fowler]]), especially its applications in astronomy. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1922.

Dingle was a member of the British government [[eclipse]] expeditions of 1927 ([[Colwyn Bay]]) and 1932 ([[Montreal]]), both of which failed to make any observations due to overcast skies. He spent most of 1932 at the [[California Institute of Technology]] as a Rockefeller Foundation Scholar. There he met the theoretical cosmologist [[Richard C. Tolman|R.&amp;nbsp;C. Tolman]], and studied relativistic [[cosmology]].

Dingle became a professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at Imperial College in 1938, and was a professor of History and Philosophy of Science at [[University College London]] from 1946 until his retirement in 1955. Thereafter he held the customary title of [[Professor Emeritus]] from that institution. He was one of the founders of the British Society for the History of Science, and served as President from 1955 to 1957.&lt;ref name="whitrow"/&gt; He founded what later became the British Society for the Philosophy of Science as well as its journal, the ''British Journal for The Philosophy of Science''.&lt;ref name="whitrow"&gt;{{cite journal

 | volume= 21

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dingle was the author of "Modern Astrophysics" (1924) and "Practical Applications of Spectrum Analysis" (1950). He also wrote the essay "Relativity for All" (1922)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hwpKAAAAIAAJ Relativity for All] (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; and the monograph ''The Special Theory of Relativity'' (1940). A collection of Dingle's lectures on the history and philosophy of science was published in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific Adventure: Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science'', Pitman 1952, re-published in 1970 by Ayer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uFyTKW6gjo4C The Scientific Adventure: Essays in the History and Philosophy of Science] Pitman 1953&lt;/ref&gt; He also took an interest in English literature, and published ''Science and Literary Criticism'' in 1949, and ''The Mind of Emily Brontë'' in 1974.

==Controversies==&lt;!--Linked from 'Edward Arthur Milne'--&gt;
Dingle participated in two highly public and polemical disputes. The first took place during the 1930s, triggered by Dingle's criticism of [[Arthur Milne|E.&amp;nbsp;A. Milne]]'s cosmological model and the associated theoretical methodology, which Dingle considered overly speculative and not based on empirical data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cosmology-30s "Cosmology: Methodological Debates in the 1930s and 1940s"] from the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|A.&amp;nbsp;S. Eddington]] was another target of Dingle's critique, and the ensuing debate eventually involved nearly every prominent astrophysicist and cosmologist in Britain. Dingle characterized his opponents as "traitors" to the scientific method, and called them "the modern Aristotelians" because he believed their theorizing was based on rationalism rather than empiricism. Some other scientists, notably [[Willem de Sitter]], while not endorsing Dingle's more extreme rhetoric, nevertheless agreed with Dingle that the cosmological models of Milne, Eddington, and others were overly speculative. However, most modern cosmologists subsequently accepted the validity of the hypothetico-deductive method of Milne.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lepeltier, "Edward Milne's influence on modern cosmology", Annals of Science, 1464-505X, Volume 63, Issue 4, 2006, Pages 471 – 481, which states that "The hypothetico-deductive method is now an integral part of cosmology...".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norriss S. Hetherington, Cosmology, 1993. See particularly the article by Georege Gale and John Urani, stating that "This view [the hypothetico-deductive method], quintessentially Milne, survives the attacks of Dingle and the other empiricist traditionalists, in the end becoming the official story of the scientific nature of relativistic cosmology...&lt;/ref&gt;

The second dispute began in the late 1950s, following Dingle's retirement and centered on the theory of [[special relativity]].&lt;ref&gt;

Initially Dingle argued that, contrary to the usual understanding of the famous [[twin paradox]], special relativity did not predict unequal aging of twins, one of whom makes a high-speed voyage and returns to Earth, but he then came to realize and acknowledge that his understanding had been mistaken. He then began to argue that special relativity was empirically wrong in its predictions, although experimental evidence showed he was mistaken about this.&lt;ref&gt;Giulini, Domenico, ''Special Relativity: A First Encounter, 100 Years since Einstein'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately Dingle re-focused his criticism to claim that special relativity was logically inconsistent: "The theory [special relativity] unavoidably requires that A works more slowly than B and B more slowly than A --which it requires no super-intelligence to see is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;Dingle, ''Science at the Crossroads'', p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence he asserted that the well-known reciprocity of the [[Lorentz transformation]] is self-evidently impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on the Dingle Dispute in the journal ''Nature'', 1967, reproduced in Dingle's 1972 book ''Science at the Crossroads''.&lt;/ref&gt; As Whitrow explained in his obituary for Dingle, this is not correct, as it rests on Dingle's mistaken assumption that the conflicting ratios of event times used by Dingle are invariants.&lt;ref name="whitrow"/&gt;

Dingle carried on a highly public and contentious campaign to get this conclusion accepted by the scientific community, mostly through letters to the editors of various scientific periodicals, including ''Nature''. Dozens of scientists responded with answers to Dingle's claims, explaining why the reciprocity of the Lorentz transformation does not entail any logical inconsistency,&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Crawford, Frank&amp;nbsp;S., ''Bull. Inst. Phys.'', 7, 314 (1956); Fremlin, J.&amp;nbsp;H., ''Nature'', 180, 499 (1957); Darwin, Charles, ''Nature'', 180, 976 (1957); Crawford, F.&amp;nbsp;S., ''Nature'', 179, 1071 (1957); Landsberg, P.&amp;nbsp;T. , ''Math. Gaz.'', 47, 197 (1964); McCrea, W.&amp;nbsp;H., ''Nature'', 216, 122 (1967); Fullerton, J.&amp;nbsp;H. , ''Nature'', 216, 524 1967); Barrett,&amp;nbsp;W. , ''Nature'', 216, 524 (1967); Landsberg, P.&amp;nbsp;T., ''Nature'', 220, 1182 (1968); Fremlin, F.&amp;nbsp;H., ''Nature'', 244, 27 (1973); Jacob,&amp;nbsp;R., ''Nature'', 244, 27 (1973); Whippman,&amp;nbsp;M., ''Nature'', 244, 27 (1973); Stedman, G.&amp;nbsp;E., ''Nature'', 244, 27 (1973); [[John Ziman|Ziman,&amp;nbsp;J.]], ''Nature'', 241, 143 (1973); Ellis, G.&amp;nbsp;F.&amp;nbsp;R., ''Nature'', 242, 143 (1973); Armstrong, H.&amp;nbsp;L., ''Nature'', 244, 26 (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; but Dingle rejected all the explanations.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Dingle wrote in a Letter to ''Nature'' in 1957 "Dr. Frank S. Crawford's further communication is welcome as the first attempt to answer my arguments. Hitherto they have been ignored, and independent reasons, which I reject, have been adduced for the opposite conclusion." Sixteen years later he wrote wearily, "It would be profitless to deal separately with the latest "answers" to my question; their diversity tells its own tale, and the writers may see their misjudgments corrected in my book."&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in his 1972 book, ''Science at the Crossroads'' in which Dingle stated that "a proof that Einstein's special theory of relativity is false has been advanced; and ignored, evaded, suppressed and, indeed, treated in every possible way except that of answering it, by the whole scientific world." He also warned: "Since this theory is basic to practically all physical experiments, the consequences if it is false, modern atomic experiments being what they are, may be immeasurably calamitous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dingle | first = Herbert | title = Science at the Crossroads | date = 1972 | publisher = Martin Brian &amp; O'Keeffe  | location = London | isbn = 0-85616-060-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The consensus in the physics community is that Dingle's objections to the logical consistency of special relativity were unfounded.&lt;ref name="whitrow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Science, Churchill and Me: The Autobiography of Hermann Bondi |edition=revised |first1=Hermann |last1=Bondi |first2= |last2=Lord Carrington |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4832-9603-6 |page=90 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSaLBQAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=bSaLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90 Extract of page 90]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prokhovnik, S.J., ''The Logic of Special Relativity'', Cambridge University Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Davies|Davies,&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;]], ''About Time'', Simon and Schushter, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horia-Roman Patapievici''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈhori.a ˈroman pataˈpjevit͡ʃʲ}}; born March 18, 1957) is a Romanian physicist and essayist who served as the head of the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] from 2005 until August 2012.&lt;ref name="antena3.ro"&gt;http://www.antena3.ro/en/life-show/horia-roman-patapievici-resigned-as-president-of-rci-178552.html&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2005, he was a member of the National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives, supporting more openness regarding the files of the Securitate.

==Biography==
Denis Patapievici, his father, moved from [[Cernăuţi]] (now in Ukraine) to [[Occupied Poland]] in 1940, after the Soviet Union occupied and took away [[Bukovina]] from the Kingdom of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/425752/SENATUL-EVZ-PP-Carp-si-Uniunea-Europeana/ "SENATUL EVZ: P.P. Carp si Uniunea Europeana"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', January 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Horia Roman Patapievici was born in [[Bucharest]] and graduated from the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Physics in 1981, where he specialized in the study of lasers. Between 1986 and 1994, he worked as a scientific researcher at the Academy Institute, during which time he also worked as a university assistant at the [[Polytechnic University of Bucharest]] between 1990 and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotidianul.ro/ce_meserii_au_scriitorii-7633.html "Ce meserii au scriitorii"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Cotidianul'', January 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Patapievici then served as the director of Center for German studies at the [[University of Bucharest]] from 1994 until 1996, after which he served until 2000 as the programme director of [[Group for Social Dialogue]] (GDS). He is also a member of the [[Writers' Union of Romania]], one of the founders of the Research Group for Essentials in European Modernity, and an honorary member of the [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]].

His debut as an essayist was in 1992, in the ''[[Contrapunct]]'' journal, and since then he had various contributions in the [[Revista 22]], LA&amp;I, Dilema (now [[Dilema Veche]]), Orizont, Vatra, [[Secolul 20]], ID. He wrote editorials in 22 (1993–2003), LA&amp;I (2003–2004), Dilema Veche (2004–2005), ID (since 2005) and [[Evenimentul Zilei]] (since 2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/411429/Noi-nume-de-marca-in-echipa-EVZ/ "Noi nume de marca in echipa EVZ"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Patapievici was also a TV producer for two shows for [[TVR Cultural]]: "Idei în libertate" (2002) and "Înapoi la argument" (2005).

Since 2004, Patapievici is the director of a cultural journal, ''Idei în dialog'' (Ideas in dialogue), published by the [[Academia Caţavencu]] Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203023709/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/663519/A-fost-lansata-revista-condusa-de-HR-Patapievici/ "A fost lansata revista condusa de H.R. Patapievici"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 3, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Patapievici married in 1981 and has one son, born in 1989.

==Career in public office==

===National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives===

In December 1999, Patapievici was nominated by the [[Christian-Democratic National Peasants' Party (Romania)|National Peasants' Party]] to be a member of the [[National Council for the Study of the Securitate Archives]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120904074202/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/597414/Horia-Roman-Patapievici-pus-de-taranisti-sa-dea-piept-cu-Securitatea/ "Horia Roman Patapievici, pus de taranisti sa dea piept cu Securitatea"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', December 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; an institution which has the purpose to study the files of the [[Securitate]], the secret service of the communist-era Romania.

Patapievici was initially rejected by the Parliamentary committee by a vote of eight to six. While Patapievici met the legal criteria for the position, his candidacy was opposed by representative members of the other political parties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729134956/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/597188/Colegiul-Consiliului-pentru-Studierea-Arhivelor-Securitatii-este-desemnat-dupa-bunul-plac-al--parlamentarilor/ "Colegiul Consiliului pentru Studierea Arhivelor Securitatii este desemnat dupa bunul plac al parlamentarilor"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', December 30, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Democratic Party Senator Casimir Ionesco, whose post-Revolution actions had been criticized earlier in one of Patapievici's books, took a leading role in opposing Patapievici's candidacy, claiming that his application would bring a defiant and revanchist attitude to the committee.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729135304/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/591977/PNTCD-merge-tot-pe-mina-lui-Patapievici/ "PNTCD merge tot pe mina lui Patapievici"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', January 4, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the demand of the [[National Peasants' Party]], the issue of Patapievici's candidacy was reopened in late January 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203025559/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/590894/Taranistii-au-impus-rediscutarea-candidaturii-lui-Horia-Roman-Patapievici/ "Taranistii au impus rediscutarea candidaturii lui Horia Roman Patapievici"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', January 26, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the Parliamentary committee approving his candidacy, despite a dissent of the [[Greater Romania Party]] representative, Dumitru Bălăeţ, who accused Patapievici of lack of patriotism based on some of his previous writings in his book "Politics".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731042932/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/590771/PNTCD-a-reusit-Patapievici-intra-in-arhiva-Securitatii/ "PNTCD a reusit, Patapievici intra in arhiva Securitatii"], ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', January 28, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The council met some difficuties in obtaining some documents from the [[Romanian Intelligence Service|SRI]] archive,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203043922/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/546481/Dosarul-Presa-blocat-de-SRI/ "Dosarul 'Presa', blocat de SRI"] ''Evenimentul Zilei'', September 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and because of this, Patapievici, together with [[Mircea Dinescu]] and [[Andrei Pleşu]] began boycotting the council in October 2001, while demanding full access in the SRI's archives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203021658/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/548303/Dinescu-Plesu-si-Patapievici-boicoteaza-CNSAS/ "Dinescu, Plesu si Patapievici boicoteaza CNSAS"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of the council, which investigated the former collaborators of the Securitate, drew criticism from the far-right Greater Romania Party. [[Daniela Buruiană]] claimed that Patapievici, Dinescu and Pleşu help foreign secret services which want to discredit the Romanian state institutions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/530273/Dupa-ce-a-promis-ca-numele-securistilor-care-au-facut-politie-politica-vor-fi-date-in-vileag-Mircea-Dinescu-a-pus-pe-jar-Comisia-SRI/ "Dupa ce a promis ca numele securistilor care au facut politie politica vor fi date in vileag, Mircea Dinescu a pus pe jar Comisia SRI"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122120837/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/530273/Dupa-ce-a-promis-ca-numele-securistilor-care-au-facut-politie-politica-vor-fi-date-in-vileag-Mircea-Dinescu-a-pus-pe-jar-Comisia-SRI |date=2009-01-22 }}, ''Evenimentul Zilei'', June 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; prompting them to announce that they'll sue her.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203040737/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/528791/Politics/ "Politics"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', July 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, the council decided to publish a list of the former Securitate officers who were involved in the political police. The Romanian intelligence agency, SRI, initially opposed this,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203010859/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/522227/Intilnire-de-gradul-zero-CNSAS-SRI/ "Intilnire de gradul zero CNSAS-SRI"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', September 16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; but, following a meeting between the council and SRI, they reached an agreement. Nevertheless, Patapievici argued that the council is blocked because of political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120729143758/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/522145/Timofte-ar-vrea-Onisoru-n-are-unde/ "Timofte ar vrea, Onisoru n-are unde"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', September 17, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, Patapievici, together with Pleşu and Dinescu attempted to change the head of the council, [[Gheorghe Onişoru]], who, they argued, sided with the SRI in attempting to open up more of Securitate's files, but they failed in gathering the six needed votes among the eleven council members.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203085300/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/517698/Incercare-esuata-de-schimbare-a-conducerii-CNSAS/ "Incercare esuata de schimbare a conducerii CNSAS"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 31, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203031932/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/518450/Fostul-director-CURS-turnator-la-Securitate/ "Fostul director CURS, turnator la Securitate"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The activity of the council continued slowly, publishing the first list of 33 officers of Securitate in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120730155536/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/630661/Lista-celor-33/ "Lista celor 33"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; There were a few attempts of ousting the Patapievici, Pleşu and Dinescu trio, especially from the Social-Democrats and Greater Romania Party,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203005632/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/639597/A-inceput-batalia-pentru-CNSAS/ "A inceput batalia pentru CNSAS"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', January 22, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; but eventually they gave in to public pressure and canceled them.

Before the [[Romanian presidential election, 2004|2004 Romanian presidential election]], the council decided that [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]] was not a Securitate informer, with a minority dissenting view (Patapievici, Pleşu, Dinescu and Secasiu). Pleşu and Dinescu resigned in protest and Patapievici announced he'd do the same thing after the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731163431/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/663927/Dinescu-si-Plesu-au-demisionat/ "Dinescu si Plesu au demisionat"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 8, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanian Cultural Institute===

In January 2005, [[Traian Băsescu]], the newly elected President of Romania, named Patapievici as the new head of the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] (ICR), replacing a 15-year rule of [[Augustin Buzura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/672062/Horia-Roman-Patapievici-la-Institutul-Cultural-Roman/ "Horia-Roman Patapievici, la Institutul Cultural Roman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206010427/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/672062/Horia-Roman-Patapievici-la-Institutul-Cultural-Roman |date=2009-02-06 }}, ''Evenimentul Zilei'', January 18, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While by statute this position is appointed directly by the Romanian president, who is honorary president of the ICR, some political opponents criticized the method of appointment, arguing that the process is conducted without competition or a debate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203053156/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/673727/Pe-semne-Cultura-in-jurul-osului/ "Pe semne: Cultura in jurul osului"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', February 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Patapievici began a reform inside the Institute with a new vision under which the Institute would focus on facilitating cultural exchanges and cultural mediation rather than producing culture.&lt;ref name="evz.ro"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130416142956/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/679434/Razboi-cultural-Buzura---Patapievici/ "Razboi cultural: Buzura - Patapievici"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', April 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his reform efforts, the Institute decided to suspend seven of nine magazines previously published under Patapievici's predecessor on the grounds that the taxpayer-funded magazines were financially unsustainable in the face of increasing monthly losses, declining circulation and rising publication costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120907002944/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/677689/Redactia-quotCulturaquot-protesteaza-fata-de-desfiintarea-revistei/ "Redactia "Cultura" protesteaza fata de desfiintarea revistei"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', March 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012 the newly elected government under Prime Minister [[Victor Ponta]], member of the [[Social Democratic Party (Romania)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and its leader since 2010, moved to transfer control of the ICR and its resources from the Office of the Romanian President to that of the Romanian Senate.&lt;ref name="antena3.ro"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/leave-cultural-body-alone-artists-tell-romanias-senate-164932796.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2012, Patapievici, the two ICR vice presidents, and the ICR managing team resigned to protest the transfer of power, the announced budget cuts, and what they considered the politicization of Romanian culture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.romania-insider.com/romanias-cultural-community-demands-freedom-for-countrys-cultural-institute/62704/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views and criticisms==

Patapievici is a supporter of [[libertarianism|libertarian]] economic policies, arguing that it's "the most efficient cure against the laziness of thought".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/415608/SENATUL-EVZ-Libertarienii/ "SENATUL EVZ: Libertarienii"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', October 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, during a debate over the display of Orthodox Christian icons in classrooms, he defended such display, labeling the people who opposed it as "[[human rights]] fanatics".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/420234/SENATUL-EVZ-Despre-noul-fanatism/ "SENATUL EVZ: Despre noul fanaticism"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', November 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Patapievici has also occasionally come under criticism from political detractors and from opponents of President Băsescu, with whom he has long had a good relationship. An example of this was in 2007 when Patapievici defended Băsescu when the parliament had begun an impeachment procedure against the President.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121203012945/http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/429486/Intelectualii-il-apara-pe-Basescu/ "Intelectualii il apara pe Basescu"], February 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Patavievici  blamed the disagreements between the presidents and prime-ministers on the Romanian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/429594/SENATUL-EVZ-Criza-de-sistem/ "SENATUL EVZ: Criza de sistem"], ''Evenimentul Zilei'', February 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Băsescu labeled Patapievici and two other supporters at the time, [[Gabriel Liiceanu]], and [[Vladimir Tismăneanu]], as "Băsescu's intellectuals", a label that the three dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://www.gandul.info/news/intelectualii-lui-basescu-nu-mai-suporta-sa-fie-vite-insemnate-3548896 „Intelectualii lui Băsescu” nu mai suportă să fie „vite însemnate”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126174655/http://www.gandul.info/news/intelectualii-lui-basescu-nu-mai-suporta-sa-fie-vite-insemnate-3548896 |date=2009-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patapievici was again criticized by some when he publicly defended an alleged action by Băsescu during the 2009 Romanian presidential campaign. On the day of the [[Romanian presidential election, 2009|election]], Catalan newspaper ''[[La Vanguardia]]'' published an interview in which Patapievici was asked about a video recording that had been repeatedly broadcast in Romanian media and which allegedly depicted Băsescu hitting a 10-year-old boy. Patapievici said that he thought Băsescu only pushed the child, and that Băsescu's error was that he did not deny it immediately. Patapievici then compared the incident with the [[Lewinsky scandal]], and, to illustrate his view that Băsescu was a good man, added that he had heard that the president [[Traian Băsescu]] had refused to use a tape offered to his campaign that reputedly depicted political opponent [[Mircea Geoană]] receiving sexual favors.&lt;ref name=lava&gt;[http://www.lavanguardia.es/internacional/noticias/20091206/53837930139/patapievici-tenemos-oligarcas-y-ejercen-un-papel-desagradable.html "Patapievici: "Tenemos oligarcas y ejercen un papel desagradable""], ''La Vanguardia'', December 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Spanish interviewer later clarified that Patapievici did not make any actual claim about the existence of the reputed tape or its authenticity,&lt;ref name="Patapievici reacţionează"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gandul.info/news/patapievici-reactioneaza-am-pomenit-de-existenta-casetei-pentru-a-sublinia-diferenta-dintre-atitudinea-adversarilor-presedintelui-si-cea-a-lui-basescu-insusi-5170236 |title="Patapievici reacţionează" |access-date=2009-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213111913/http://www.gandul.info/news/patapievici-reactioneaza-am-pomenit-de-existenta-casetei-pentru-a-sublinia-diferenta-dintre-atitudinea-adversarilor-presedintelui-si-cea-a-lui-basescu-insusi-5170236 |archive-date=2009-12-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Spanish language depiction of the Patapievici interview was covered in the Romanian press and met with a strong reaction from Mircea Geoană, who called it a "sinister lie".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/mircea-geoana-patapievici-umbla-cu-porcarii-5170065 "Mircea Geoană: "Patapievici umblă cu porcării""], ''Mediafax'', December 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Traian Băsescu]]'s spokesman, [[Sever Voinescu]], and Valeriu Turcan, the spokesman of the Romanian presidency, denied that either Băsescu or the campaign team was ever aware of any such video&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/voinescu-n-am-avut-niciodata-o-caseta-precum-cea-mentionata-in-la-vanguardia-5170276 ''Voinescu: "N-am avut niciodată o casetă precum cea menţionată în La Vanguardia"''], ''Mediafax'', December 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.impactnews.ro/ultima-ora/Turcan:-B%C4%83sescu-nu-de%C5%A3ine-o-caset%C4%83-porno-cu-Geoan%C4%83-25051 ''Turcan: "Băsescu nu deţine o casetă porno cu Geoană"''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091213180155/http://www.impactnews.ro/ultima-ora/Turcan:-B%C4%83sescu-nu-de%C5%A3ine-o-caset%C4%83-porno-cu-Geoan%C4%83-25051 |date=2009-12-13 }} ImpactNews, December 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Patapievici himself denied ever making the accusation and claimed that his words were intentionally mischaracterized and taken out of context by his accusers, clarifying in a statement that he "only mentioned the tape to emphasize the difference in attitude between Băsescu and his opponents." To support his denial, he cited an e-mail sent in English by the Spanish interviewer, Félix Flores: "Mr. Patapievici did not mentioned [sic] the existence of any tape about Mr. Geoana: he just said that Mr. Basescu was offered such a thing and he rejected it. He was not talking about videos -true or fake or may not exist- or against anybody but about Mr. Basescu's moral  attitude."&lt;ref name="Patapievici reacţionează"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17769">'''Human subject research legislation in the United States''' can be traced to the early 20th century. [[Human subject research in the United States]] was mostly unregulated until the 20th century, as it was throughout the world, until the establishment of various governmental and professional regulations and [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]]. Notable – and in some cases, notorious – human subject experiments performed in the US include the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]], [[Human radiation experiments#Experiments performed in the United States|human radiation experiments]], the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram obedience experiment]] and [[Stanford prison experiment]]s and [[Project MKULTRA]]. With growing public awareness of such experimentation, and the evolution of professional ethical standards, such research became regulated by various legislation, most notably, those that introduced and then empowered the [[institutional review board]]s.&lt;ref name="OPRS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.unlv.edu/OPRS/history-ethics.htm|title=History of Research Ethics |last=Office for the Protection of Research Subjects|accessdate=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early research and legislation==
Aside from the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] of 1906 and the [[Harrison Act]] of 1914 banning the sale of some narcotic drugs, there was no federal regulatory control ensuring the safety of new drugs. Thus the early calls for regulation of human experimentation concerned medicine, and in particular, testing of new pharmaceutical [[drug]]s and their release on the market.&lt;ref name=pmn53-54&gt;Paul Murray McNeill, ''The ethics and politics of human experimentation'', CUP Archive, 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-41627-2}},&lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=BbU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Human+experimentation+in+the+United+States&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=United+States&amp;f=false Google Print, p.53-54] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, a drug known as ''[[Elixir Sulfanilamide]]'' was released without any [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref name=pmn53-54/&gt; Reports in the press about potentially lethal [[side effect]]s led to a public outcry. Investigation by the [[American Medical Association]] showed that a poisonous compound, [[diethylene glycol]], was present in the drug.&lt;ref name=pmn53-54/&gt; The AMA concluded that the drug caused more than a hundred deaths – yet the contemporary law did not require the company that released it to test it (the existing laws required only that a drug be clearly labeled, no false claims be made about it, and that it was not adulterated).&lt;ref name=pmn53-54/&gt; A new legislation was proposed by the [[Secretary of Agriculture]] to address the issue but was weakened after opposition from business interests. It was finally included in the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938.&lt;ref name=pmn53-54/&gt;

In the [[aftermath of World War II]], and what became recognized as deeply [[ethics|unethical]] [[Nazi human experimentation|human experimentation carried out by the Nazis]], the [[Nuremberg Code]] – ethical principles governing international [[human experimentation]] – were founded.&lt;ref name=jffkk&gt;James J. F. Forest, Kevin Kinser, ''Higher education in the United States: an encyclopedia, Volume 1education '', ABC-CLIO, 2002, {{ISBN|1-57607-248-7}}, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=sFFX9OIkF2IC&amp;pg=PA526&amp;dq=Human+experimentation+in+the+United+States&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=Human experimentation in the United States&amp;f=false Google Print, p.526-527] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The code highlighted 3 key elements (voluntary informed consent, favorable risk/benefit analysis, and right to withdraw without repercussions) which later became the foundation for further human research regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Todd. "The historical, ethical, and legal background of human-subjects research". Respiratory Care. 53.10 (Oct. 2008): p1325.&lt;/ref&gt; However, neither the Nuremberg Code nor the [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] of 1938 prevented the "thalidomide tragedy" of the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=pmn54-55&gt;Paul Murray McNeill, ''The ethics and politics of human experimentation'', CUP Archive, 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-41627-2}}, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=BbU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Human+experimentation+in+the+United+States&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=United States&amp;f=false Google Print, p.54-55] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thalidomide]] was introduced in 1958, and there were reports of it being unsafe for certain groups, such as pregnant women and young children; however, although the [[Food and Drug Administration]] did not approve it for market, the existing regulations allowed relatively unrestricted testing of the drug.&lt;ref name=pmn54-55/&gt; This led to the abuse of approved drug testing as the means to further a promotional [[marketing]] strategy.&lt;ref name=pmn54-55/&gt; This was addressed by the Drug Amendments legislation of 1962, which introduced a requirement for a series of animal tests before proceeding with human experimentation, and a total of three phases of human clinical trials before a drug can be approved for the market.&lt;ref name=pmn54-55/&gt;&lt;ref name=vhs&gt;Vera Hassner Sharav, ''[http://www.ahrp.org/history/chronology.php Human Experiments: A Chronology of Human Research]''&lt;/ref&gt; The inadequacy of the 1938 and 1962 acts was exposed by revelations in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmn54-55/&gt;

==60s and 70s: Beecher's study and the Tuskegee syphilis experiment==
Another milestone came with [[Henry K. Beecher]]'s 1966 study as published in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''. His study became instrumental in the implementation of federal rules on human experimentation and informed consent.&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmn59-61&gt;Paul Murray McNeill, ''The ethics and politics of human experimentation'', CUP Archive, 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-41627-2}}, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=BbU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Human+experimentation+in+the+United+States&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=United States&amp;f=false Google Print, p.59-61] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hlw&gt;Jon Harkness,Susan E. Lederer, &amp; Daniel Wikler, ''Laying ethical foundations for clinical research'', Public Health Classics, Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 2001, 79 (4)&lt;/ref&gt; Beecher's study listed over 20 cases of mainstream research where subjects were subject to experimentation without being fully informed of their status as research subjects, and without knowledge of the risks of such participation in the research. Some of the research subjects died or were permanently crippled as a result of that research.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt;&lt;ref name=hlw/&gt; One of the cases analyzed was the [[Willowbrook State School]] Case, in which mentally defective children were deliberately infected with [[hepatitis]], under disguise of a [[vaccination]] program.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt;

Beecher's findings were not alone. Evidence emerged that soon after the introduction of [[nuclear weapons]], soldiers and civilians were subjected to potentially dangerous levels of radiation – without consent – to test its health effects (see [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]] and [[Human radiation experiments#Experiments performed in the United States|human radiation experiments in the United States]]).&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank E. Hagan, ''Crime Types and Criminals'', SAGE, 2009, {{ISBN|1-4129-6479-2}}, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=UNKFHlXIaycC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq="American+Nuclear+Guinea+Pigs"&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q="American+Nuclear+Guinea+Pigs"&amp;f=false Google Print, p.266] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

While most major controversies about unethical research were focused on biomedical sciences, there were also controversies involving behavioral, psychological, and sociological experiments such as: the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram obedience experiment]], [[Stanford prison experiment]], [[Tearoom Trade]] study, and others.&lt;ref name=babbie&gt;[[Earl R. Babbie]], ''The Practice of Social Research", 12th edition, Wadsworth Publishing, 2009, {{ISBN|0-495-59841-0}}, p. 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Russell Bernard, ''Social research methods: qualitative and quantitative approaches'', SAGE, 2000, 076191403X, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=VDPftmVO5lYC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Milgram+experiment,+Stanford+prison+experiment&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Milgram experiment%2C Stanford prison experiment&amp;f=false Google Print, p.70-74] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There were also ethical issues related to the [[CIA]]'s [[Project MKULTRA]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Streatfeild, ''Brainwash: the secret history of mind control'', Macmillan, 2007, {{ISBN|0-312-32572-X}}, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=c3U0dRQVrxkC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=MKULTRA+ethics&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=MKULTRA ethics&amp;f=false Google Print, p.87] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] is probably the most infamous case of unethical medical experimentation in the United States.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt; Starting in 1932, investigators recruited 399 impoverished African-American sharecroppers with syphilis for research related to the natural progression of the untreated disease, in hopes of justifying treatment programs for blacks.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt; By 1947, penicillin had become the standard treatment for syphilis, but the Tuskegee scientists decided to withhold [[penicillin]] (and information about it) from the patients.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt; The study continued under numerous supervisors until 1972, when a leak to the press resulted in its termination.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt; Victims included a number of men who died of syphilis, their wives who contracted the disease, and some children who were born with syphilis.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt; Even when the results were made public, the initial reaction of the medical scientific community was to exonerate the study and criticize the popular press for interfering with the research.&lt;ref name=pmn59-61/&gt;

In 1976, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) Office for Protection of Research Subjects (OPRR) was created, and issued its ''Policies for the Protection of Human Subjects'' which recommended establishing independent review bodies, later called [[institutional review boards]].&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;

In 1969, [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] Judge [[Samuel Steinfeld]] dissented in ''[[Strunk v. Strunk]], 445 S.W.2d 145'', and made the first judicial suggestion that the [[Nuremberg Code]] should apply to American [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;

By the early 1970s, cases like the Willowbrook State School and the Tuskegee syphilis experiments were being raised in the U. S. Senate.&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;&lt;ref name=bako9899&gt;Benedict M.

In 1974, Congress passed the [[National Research Act]] which established the [[National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research]] (CPHS) and mandated that the [[Public Health Service]] come up with regulations that would protect the rights of human research subjects.&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmn62-63/&gt; The Commission work from 1974-1978 resulted in 17 reports and appendices, of which the most important were the [[Institutional Review Board Report]] and the [[Belmont Report]] ("''Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research''").&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmn62-63/&gt; The IRB Report endorsed the establishment and functioning of the [[Institutional Review Board]] institution, and the Belmont Report, the Commission's last report, identified "basic ethical principles" applicable to human subject experimentation that became modern guidelines for ethical medical research: "respect for persons", "beneficence" and "justice".&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmn62-63/&gt;

In 1975, the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] (DHEW) created regulation which included the recommendations laid out in the NIH's 1966 ''Policies for the Protection of Human Subjects''.&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt; [[Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations]], known as "The Common Rule," requires that institutional review boards (IRBs) oversee experiments using human subjects.&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;

==Beyond IRBs==
The National Commission was superseded by the [[Ethical Advisory Board]] (EAB), which in turn was superseded in 1980 by the [[President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Biomedical and Behavioral Research]] (PCEMR).&lt;ref name=pmn62-63/&gt; EAB focused on the issues of [[in vitro fertilization]] and prohibited the creation of [[fetus]]es for research purposes; and PCEMR issues recommendation on subjects such as [[brain death]], access to health services, withdrawal of life-support systems, and testing in regards to genetic disease.&lt;ref name=bako9899/&gt;

In 1980 the FDA made prisoners ineligible to be subjects of new drug testing in [[clinical trial]]s (21 CFR 50.44).&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;

On January 15, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] formed the [[Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments]] (ACHRE).&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=achre&gt;[http://www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/report.html Final report of ACHRE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212024008/http://www.eh.doe.gov/ohre/roadmap/achre/report.html |date=2006-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee was created to investigate and report the use of human beings as test subjects in experiments involving the effects of ionizing radiation in federally funded research.&lt;ref name=achre/&gt; The committee attempted to determine the causes of the experiments, and reasons why the proper oversight did not exist, and made several recommendations to help prevent future occurrences of similar events.&lt;ref name=achre/&gt; In 1995&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt; (or 1996 – sources vary&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;) a [[National Bioethics Advisory Commission]] was established, opining on issues such as [[cloning]] of humans, and research involving mentally disabled.&lt;ref name=jffkk/&gt;&lt;ref name=vhs/&gt; In 2001, [[The President's Council on Bioethics]] was founded to consider bioethics issues, such as [[stem cell research]].&lt;ref name=bako9899/&gt; Committee review of research has since then become a standard part of American attitude to ethical issues in science.&lt;ref name=pmn65&gt;Paul Murray McNeill, ''The ethics and politics of human experimentation'', CUP Archive, 1993, {{ISBN|0-521-41627-2}}, &lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?id=BbU8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=Human+experimentation+in+the+United+States&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Human experimentation in the United States&amp;f=false Google Print, p.65] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Obama administration]] replaced this body with the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]].&lt;ref name="EO13521"&gt;[[s:Executive Order 13521|Executive Order 13521]] – ''Establishing the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues'', November&amp;nbsp;24,&amp;nbsp;2009, Vol.&amp;nbsp;74, No.&amp;nbsp;228,&amp;nbsp;{{USFedReg|74|62671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research that does not require IRB review==
Some provisions of medical research regulation allow certain research project to proceed without IRB review. For example, in the United States, research that uses [[electronic health record]] of deceased [[patients]] does not require IRB review.&lt;ref name=dsIDR&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huser | first1 = V. | last2 = Cimino | first2 = J.

[[File:Isagoge abhari.PNG|thumb|manuscript of the Isagoge.]]

The '''''Isagoge''''' ({{lang-el|Εἰσαγωγή}}, ''Eisagōgḗ'') or "Introduction" to [[Categories (Aristotle)|Aristotle's "Categories"]], written by [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and translated into Latin by [[Boethius]], was the standard textbook on logic for at least a millennium after his death. It was composed by Porphyry in [[Sicily]] during the years 268–270, and sent to Chrysaorium, according to all the ancient commentators [[Ammonius Saccas|Ammonius]], Elias, and David. The work includes the highly influential hierarchical classification of [[genus|genera]] and [[species]] from substance in general down to individuals, known as the [[Tree of Porphyry]], and an introduction which mentions the problem of [[universals]].

[[Boethius]]' translation of the work, in Latin, became a standard medieval textbook in European schools and universities, setting the stage for medieval philosophical-theological developments of logic and the problem of universals.  Many writers, such as Boethius himself, [[Averroes]], [[Abelard]], [[Duns Scotus|Scotus]], wrote commentaries on the book. Other writers such as [[William of Ockham]] incorporated them into their [[Sum of Logic|textbooks]] on logic.

==Versions==
[[File:Hunayn ibn-Ishaq al-'Ibadi Isagoge.jpg|thumb|Iluminure from the [[Hunayn ibn-Ishaq]] al-'Ibadi manuscript of the Isagoge.]]
[[File:شرح كتاب ايساغوجي.jpg|thumb|Arabic manuscript of the Isagoge]]
The earliest Latin translation, which is now no longer extant, was made by [[Marius Victorinus]] in the fourth century. [[Boethius]] heavily relied upon it in his own translation. The earliest known Syriac translation was made in the seventh century by [[Athanasius of Balad]]. An early Armenian translation of the work also exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/pearse/morefathers/files/porphyry_isagogue_01_intro.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories ofAristotle.  Preface to the online edition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Introduction'' was translated into Arabic by [[Ibn al-Muqaffa‘]] from a Syriac version. With the Arabicized name ''Isāghūjī'' it long remained the standard introductory logic text in the Muslim world and influenced the study of theology, philosophy, grammar,  and jurisprudence. Besides the adaptations and epitomes of this work, many independent works on logic by Muslim philosophers have been entitled ''Isāghūjī''. Porphyry's discussion of ''accident'' sparked a long-running debate on the application of ''accident'' and ''essence''.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, "Araz" (accident)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Predicables==
The [[predicables]] (Lat. ''praedicabilis'', that which may be stated or affirmed, sometimes called ''quinque voces'' or ''five words'') is, in [[term logic|scholastic logic]], a term applied to a [[Categorization|classification]] of the possible relations in which a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] may stand to its [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. The list given by the schoolmen and generally adopted by modern logicians is based on the original fivefold classification given by [[Aristotle]] ([[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]], a iv. 101 b 17–25): [[definition]] (''horos''), [[genus (logic)|genus]] (''genos''), differentia (''diaphora''), [[property (logic)|property]] (''idion''), [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] (''sumbebekos'').

The scholastic classification, obtained from Boëthius's version of the ''Isagoge'', modified Aristotle's by substituting species (''eidos'') for definition (''horos'').

==Porphyrian tree==
In medieval textbooks, the all-important ''[[Arbor porphyriana]]'' ("Porphyrian Tree") illustrates his logical classification of substance. To this day, taxonomy benefits from concepts in Porphyry's Tree, in classifying living organisms: see [[cladistics]].

==Problem of universals==
The work is celebrated for prompting the medieval debate over the status of [[universals]].  Porphyry writes

:For the moment, I shall naturally decline to say, concerning genera and species, whether they subsist, whether they are bare, pure isolated conceptions, whether, if subsistent, they are corporeal or incorporeal, or whether they are separated from or in sensible objects, and other related matters. This sort of problem is of the very deepest, and requires more extensive investigation.

: αὐτίκα περὶ τῶν γενῶν τε καὶ εἰδῶν τὸ μὲν εἴτε ὑφέστηκεν εἴτε καὶ ἐν μόναις ψιλαῖς ἐπινοίαις κεῖται εἴτε καὶ ὑφεστηκότα σώματά ἐστιν ἢ ἀσώματα καὶ πότερον χωριστὰ ἢ ἐν τοῖς αἰσθητοῖς καὶ περὶ ταῦτα ὑφεστῶτα, παραιτήσομαι λέγειν βαθυτάτης οὔσης τῆς τοιαύτης πραγματείας καὶ ἄλλης μείζονος δεομένης ἐξετάσεως.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_dcMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Aristotelis opera omnia. Ad optimorum librorum fidem accurate ...'', Volume 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he did not mention the problem further, his formulation constitutes the most influential part of his work, since it was these questions that formed the basis of medieval debates about the status of universals.  Do universals exist in the mind, or in reality?  If in reality, are they physical things, or not?  If physical, do they have a separate existence from physical bodies, or are they part of them?

Public philosophy can throw a critical light on the field of practices in which civic struggles take place and the practices of civic freedom available to change them. The focus upon relationships of normativity and power, and the need to bring them into the light of public scrutiny thanks to the particular academic skills available to the researchers, make public philosophy ‘in a new key’ distinctively democratic. The breadth and depth of the work, combined with Tully’s focus on civic freedom and the possibility of the reciprocal elucidation of academic work and citizens’ democratic struggles, make it a major and truly inspiring contribution to contemporary political theory," from [http://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/cbm-prize.shtml "C.B.

He completed his doctorate at the [[University of Cambridge]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and now teaches at the [[University of Victoria]].

His research and teaching comprise a [[public philosophy]] that is grounded in place (Canada) yet reaches out to the world of civic engagement with the problems of our time. He does this in ways that strive to contribute to dialogue between academics and citizens. For example, his research areas include the Canadian experience of coping with the deep diversity of multicultural and multinational citizenship; relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous people; and the emergence of citizenship of the living earth as the ground of sustainable futures.&lt;ref&gt;Paraphrased from James Tully, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a4A2pgfbTo “Faces of UVic Research: James Tully”], [[University of Victoria]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

James Tully is one of the four general editors of the [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/series/sSeries.asp?code=IC Cambridge University Press '' Ideas in Context'' Series]. He  first gained his reputation for his scholarship on the political philosophy of [[John Locke]], and has written on constitutionalism, diversity, indigenous politics, recognition theory, multiculturalism, and the problem of imperialism. He was special advisor to the [[Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples]] (1991–1995). Over his career, Tully has held positions at [[Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], [[McGill University]], [[University of Toronto]], and the [[University of Victoria]].
[[File:WIlliam C Mearns Center For Learning - McPherson Library - The University Of Victoria.jpg|thumb|[[University of Victoria]]]]
After completing his PhD at [[Cambridge University]] and his undergraduate degree at the [[University of British Columbia]], he taught in the departments of Philosophy and Political Science at [[McGill University]] 1977-1996. He was Professor and Chair of the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria 1996-2001. In 2001-2003 he was the inaugural Henry N.R. Jackman Distinguished Professor in Philosophical Studies at the University of Toronto in the departments of Philosophy and Political Science and the Faculty of Law. Tully claims to have enjoyed his time at the University of Toronto, but preferred the open atmosphere and climate in [[British Columbia]]. He eventually returned to the [[University of Victoria]] in 2003, where he is now the Distinguished Professor of Political Science, Law, Indigenous Governance and Philosophy. Tully was influential in shaping the [[University of Victoria]]'s Political Science department, which is renowned for its strong political theory program.

==Political philosophy==

===Renewing and transforming public philosophy===

Tully’s approach to the study and teaching of politics is a form of historical and critical reflection on problems of political practice in the present. It is an attempt to renew and transform the tradition of [[public philosophy]] so it can effectively address the pressing political problems of our age in a genuinely democratic way. It does this by means of a dual dialogue of reciprocal and mutual learning among equals: between academics in different disciplines addressing the same problems (multidisciplinary); and between academics and citizens addressing the problems and struggles on the ground by their own ways of knowing and doing (democratic). The aim is to throw critical light on contemporary political problems by means of studies that free us to some extent from hegemonic ways of thinking and acting politically, enabling us to test their limits and to see and consider the concrete possibilities of thinking and acting differently.&lt;ref&gt;James Tully, "Public Philosophy and civic freedom: a guide to the two volumes," ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom'', and ''Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom'' (Cambridge University Press, 2008), pp. 1-11 (both volumes). For more detail, see ''Public Philosophy I'': Part I: Approaching Practice, pp. 13-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The politics of cultural recognition===

[[File:Bill Reid Haida Gail 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Spirit of Haida Gwaii]]'' by [[Bill Reid]]]]Tully’s 1995, ''Strange Multiplicity: Constitutionalism in an Age of Diversity'' engages with the famous indigenous sculpture ''[[Spirit of Haida Gwaii]]'' by [[Bill Reid]] as a metaphor for the kind of democratic constitutionalism that can help reconcile the competing claims of multicultural and multinational societies.&lt;ref&gt;"''The spirit of Haida Gwaii'', I would now like you to imagine, can be seen as just such a constitutional dialogue, or multilogue, of mutual recognition," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity: Constitutionalism in an Age of Diversity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004 [1995]), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The ‘strange multiplicity’ of cultural diversity is embodied in the varied and assorted canoe passengers "squabbling and vying for recognition and position."&lt;ref&gt;"The passengers are squabbling and vying for recognition and position each in their culturally distinct way. They are exchanging their diverse stories and claims as the chief appears to listen attentively to each, hoping to guide them to reach an agreement, without imposing a metalanguage or allowing any speaker to set the terms of the discussion. The chief’s subjection to the rule of mutual recognition is symbolised by the crests of the crew's nations and families carved in the speaker's staff," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no universal constitutional order imposed from above nor a single category of citizenship, because identities and relations change over time.&lt;ref&gt;"Since recognition is never definitive, the particular constitutional arrangement of the members of the canoe is presumably not meant to be fixed once and for all. Constitutional recognition and association change over time, as the canoe progresses and the members change in various ways. A constitution is more like an endless series of contracts and agreements, reached by periodical intercultural dialogues, rather than an original contract in the distant past, an ideal speech-situation today, or a mythic unity of the community in liberal and nationalist constitutionalism," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; This view rejects the "mythic unity of the community" imagined "in liberal and nationalist constitutionalism."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 26. The critique of modern, presumptively ‘universal’ conceptions of citizenship are developed in Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'' &amp; ''II''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully argues that the concept of ‘culture’ is more flexible and constructive for thinking about the rival claims of political groups than the more rigid and exclusive concept ‘nation.’&lt;ref&gt;"The consequence of national and liberal constitutions, which have been the dominant forms over the last three hundred years, is precisely the contemporary resistance and demands for recognition of the members whose cultures have been excluded, assimilated or exterminated. A just form of constitution must begin with the full mutual recognition of the different cultures of its citizens," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Culture more readily suggests that group identities are plural, overlapping, and changing over time in their encounters with others. Unlike nationalism, the politics of cultural recognition does not assume that every group aspires to its own culturally homogenous ‘nation-state.’&lt;ref&gt;"Although this has been the dominant form of constitutional recognition since the seventeenth century, it cannot be simply extended to the demands for cultural recognition today," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, cultures must find ways to share spaces and co-exist. While they may always strive to determine their own identities and relations, pursuant to "self rule, the oldest political good in the world,"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  the solution is not to crack down on diversity or to impose one cultural model over others.

The solution is to broaden opportunities for participation and contestation, to further democratize institutions and relations of governance, including foundational constitutions. According to Tully, "a constitution should not be seen as a fixed set of rules but, rather, as an imperfect form of accommodation of the diverse members of a political association that is always open to negotiation by the members of the association."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.uvic.ca/socialsciences/politicalscience/people/directory/emeritusfaculty/tullyjim.php “Research,”] James Tully webpage on [[University of Victoria]] website, accessed 18 November 2014; see also: "a constitution can be both the foundation of democracy and, at the same time, subject to democratic discussion and change in practice," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="methodology-note"&gt;A major theme of Tully’s work is a careful reconceptualization or clarification of a series of contested terms, including the notions of constitution, freedom, citizenship, and the adjectives democratic, civic, and global. Tully "re-describes" each to emphasize not static categories or abstract, transcendental or universal qualities, but rather practice or praxis — dialogical relations, action, and contestation. For more on Tully’s methodological approach, drawing heavily on the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], the [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|Cambridge School of thought]], and [[Michel Foucault]], see Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', pp. 4-5, 10, 15-131, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 254-256; see also David Owen, "Series Editor’s Foreword," in James Tully, ''On Global Citizenship: James Tully in Dialogue'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2014), pp. ix-x, Robert Nichols and Jakeet Singh, "Editors' Introduction," ''Freedom and Democracy in an Imperial Context: Dialogues with James Tully'' (London: Routledge, 2014), pp. 1-3.&lt;/ref&gt; No aspect of relations should be off limits to deliberation if called into question by participants affected by those relations. This is what Tully means by "democratic constitutionalism" as opposed to more conventional "constitutional democracy."&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 4"&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  From this perspective, Tully can claim that "[t]he constitution is thus one area of modern politics that has not been democratised over the last three hundred years."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Tully, ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' prefigures a more democratic, pluralistic, and just society. It evokes a simpler, more elegant, and sustainable ethos of gift-reciprocity in all our relationships, human and non-human. Getting along may be messy and imperfect business, but the passengers continue to row cooperatively, and the canoe of society glides onward.&lt;ref&gt;"For all the celebration of diversity and the vying for recognition, the paddles are somehow in unison and they appear to be heading in some direction [...] This seems to imply that the kind of constitutional change required to meet the just demands for recognition can be carried out without capsizing a society," Tully, ''Strange Multiplicity'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practices of civic freedom and global citizenship===

In ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Volume I: Democracy and Civic Freedom'', and ''Volume II: Imperialism and Civic Freedom'' (2008), Tully expands his approach "to a broader range of contemporary struggles: over diverse forms of recognition, social justice, the environment and imperialism."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 4. Tully’s work on ''Public Philosophy I'' &amp; ''II'' "leads him to elaborate the implications of his revised view of freedom for multinational democracy and extend his analysis to encompass the history of Western imperialism," Owen, "Series Editor’s Foreword," in ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. xi-xii. Also, "Tully’s aim, then, is to develop alternative notions of freedom and democracy that can be woven into a non-imperial, or in fact de-imperializing, way of life," Nichols and Singh, "Editors' Introduction," ''Freedom and Democracy'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The two volumes mark a shift toward a principal emphasis on freedom. "The primary question," Tully writes, "is thus not recognition, identity or difference, but freedom; the freedom of the members of an open society to change the constitutional rules of mutual recognition and association from time to time as their identities change."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 189. And "Freedom versus domination is thus the emerging focus of politics in multinational societies at the dawn of the new millennium," Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; This is "civic freedom," referring to the capacity people have to participate in the constitution of their own governance relations.&lt;ref&gt;"This is the fundamental democratic or civic freedom of citizens – having an effective say in a dialogue over the norms through which they are governed," ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 310. And "To be free democratically is not only to be able to participate in various ways in accordance with the principles, rules and procedures of the constitutional system, as important as this is, but also, and crucially, always to be able to take one step back, dissent and call into question the principles, rules or procedures by which one is governed and to enter into (rule-governed) deliberations over them," Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 93-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

To the extent that governance relations restrict this basic freedom, "they constitute a structure of domination, the members are not self-determining, and the society is unfree."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions of oppression, however, do not rule out or discount practices of civic freedom. Tully’s public philosophy is not concerned with ideal conditions or hoped-for peaceful futures. Rather, civic freedom exists in conduct and in relations in the "here and now,"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, Public Philosophy I, pp. 20, 154, 288, Tully, Public Philosophy II, pp. 73, 90, 120-121, 189, 190, 229.&lt;/ref&gt; not least under conditions of oppression and conflict. Against violence and tyranny, Tully argues, practices of civic freedom make the best "strategies of confrontation,"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 280-309.&lt;/ref&gt; because they generate conditions for transformative change. The concluding chapter of ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II'' examines "the democratic means to challenge and transform imperial relationships [and] brings together the three themes of the two volumes: public philosophy, practices of civic freedom and the countless ways they work together to negotiate and transform oppressive relationships."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy I'', p. 8; see especially ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 296-309, and Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 88-97, 305-308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully’s civics-based approach offers a new way of thinking about a diverse array of contemporary and historical traditions of democratic struggle,&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 51-53; "Middle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism: A view of the field from the demos," ''Middle East Law and Governance'', 4 (2012), 225-263.&lt;/ref&gt; including environmental movements&lt;ref&gt;Tully, "An Ecological Ethics for the Present," in ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 73-88; also pp. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt; and indigenous struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, "The Struggle of Indigenous Peoples for and of Freedom," in ''Public Philosophy I'', pp. 257-288&lt;/ref&gt; Tully summarizes the approach and its potential:

&lt;blockquote&gt;‘Practices of civic freedom’ comprise the vast repertoire of ways of citizens acting together on the field of governance relationships and against the oppressive and unjust dimensions of them. These range from ways of ‘acting otherwise’ within the space of governance relationships to contesting, negotiating, confronting and seeking to transform them. The general aim of these diverse civic activities is to bring oppressive and unjust governance relationships under the on-going shared authority of the citizenry subject to them; namely, to civicise and democratize them from below.&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 4"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From this perspective, these kinds of powerful, civic movements are not deviations or anomalies to be corrected or appeased through discipline or cooptation, but exemplars of civic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;"They are classified [by the dominant discourses and institutions] as acts of civil disobedience or rebellion. If these illegal struggles are successful and the extensions institutionalised, then the extensions are redescribed retrospectively as stages in the development of modern citizenship and incorporated within its framework, as in the cases of working-class struggles giving rise to social and economic rights, women gaining recognition as citizens, civil rights movements and recognition of cultural minorities. Thus, what are seen as activities of citizenship by the civic tradition – struggles for new forms of recognition and extensions of citizenship – fall outside of modern [conventional] citizenship with its institutional/status orientation," Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 256, also, pp. 298, 308-309.&lt;/ref&gt; They disclose their positions or grievances not only through words and stated goals but through the very world they bring into being by their actions: civic "activists ''have to be the change'' that they wish to bring about."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, "Two Traditions of Human Rights," in ''Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals'', ed. by Matthias Lutz-Bachmann and Amos Nascimento (London: Ashgate, 2014), p. 151, also, 155, 156.&lt;/ref&gt; "Underlying this way of democratization," Tully argues, "is the Gandhian premise that democracy and peace can be brought about only by democratic and peaceful means."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, "Middle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism," ''Middle East Law and Governance'', 4 (2012), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is no utopian vision, according to Tully, referring to the "thousands" and "millions of examples of civic"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 306, 308.&lt;/ref&gt; practices everyday that make another world not only possible but "''actual''."&lt;ref&gt;"''Another world is actual''," Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

To clarify and reinforce this approach, Tully argues for an expanded conception of the term ''citizenship'' to encompass all forms of governance-related conduct, with an emphasis on "negotiated practices."&lt;ref name="methodology-note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 248"&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Civic'' or ''global'' citizenship refers to the myriad of relations and practices (global and local) people find themselves embedded and participating in.&lt;ref&gt;"From the civic perspective, citizenship comes into being whenever and wherever people who are subject to or affected by practices of governance become active co-agents within them; exercising the powers of having a say (negotiating) and having a hand (powers of self-organization and self-government) in and over the relationships that govern their interaction," Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''global'' draws attention to the diverse and overlapping character of governance — and hence citizen — relations.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 243-249.&lt;/ref&gt; Modes of civic and global citizenship "are the means by which cooperative practices of self-government can be brought into being and the means by which unjust practices of governance can be challenged, reformed and transformed by those who suffer under them."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 272-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully carefully distinguishes his expanded notion of citizenship (diverse, cooperative, civic, global) from the narrower but more conventional notion of citizenship, which he calls "civil citizenship" (modern, institutional, and international).&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 246-309.&lt;/ref&gt; Where ''civic'' denotes practice and pluralism, ''civil'' citizenship singularly refers to "a status given by the institutions of the modern constitutional state in international law."&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 248"/&gt; This kind of (civil) citizenship is associated with the dominant tradition of liberalism, in which the state ensures a free market, a set of negative liberties (especially protections against state infringements into the private sphere), and a narrow range of participation through institutions of free speech and representative government.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 250-256; see also "Two Traditions of Human Rights," in ''Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals'', pp. 139-148.&lt;/ref&gt; Tully argues that this dominant module of civil citizenship is neither universal nor inevitable; rather, it is "one singular, historical form of citizenship among others."&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 248"/&gt; More problematically, the civil tradition often plays handmaiden to empire, insofar as imperial powers operate under international banners of ‘progress’ and ‘liberalism’:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the dominant forms of representative democracy, self-determination and democratisation promoted through international law are not alternatives to imperialism, but, rather, the means through which informal imperialism operates against the wishes of the majority of the population of the post-colonial world.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By contextualizing and de-centering, or "provincializing,"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; modern categories of "allegedly universal"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; citizenship, Tully aims to broaden and democratize the field of citizenship and citizen practices. "This [civic and global] mode of citizenship," he argues, "has the capacity to overcome the imperialism of the present age and bring a democratic world into being."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Tully has emphasized the importance of "coordinating" the different ways that civil (deliberative) and civic (cooperative) citizens address the same political problems, such as social and ecological justice.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, "Two ways of realizing justice and democracy: Linking Amartya Sen and Elinor Ostrom," CRISPP, 16.2 (March 2013), pp. 220-233; also, Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 84-100, especially under "Joining hands and working together," pp. 97-100. To illustrate, "The life of Gandhi provides an example of how these two modes of citizenship can complement each other. As a representative democrat he supported the Congress Party and representative government, and he reasoned and negotiated endlessly in the official public spheres available to him.[omitted footnote] Yet, he also grounded himself in cooperative citizenship practices of non-violent agonistics and regime change, and in alternative practices of social, economic and ecological self-government," Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The transformative power of nonviolence===

In the closing pages of ''Public Philosophy in a New Key, Vol. II'', Tully explicitly links his work to the study and practice of [[nonviolence]]. He identifies four main components of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]’s life practice of [[Satyagraha]] that offer a model for approaching civic freedom and global citizenship practices: 1) noncooperation with unjust institutions, 2) a commitment to nonviolent means of resistance, 3) a focus on local, community-based modes of self-reliance and self-governance, and 4), as a precursor to these three components, "personal practices of self-awareness and self-formation."&lt;ref&gt;"The first is active non-cooperation vis-à-vis any imperial (non-civic) relationship and its corresponding idea of one universal civilisation or cosmopolitanism for all. The second is the way of peace. For Gandhi this consists in civic organisation and uncompromising non-violent confrontation and negotiation with those responsible for imperial relationships with the aim of converting them to non-violent, democratic and peaceful relationships. Thirdly, for these two activities to be effective they have to be grounded in the local field and practices of the alternative world you want to bring about. For Gandhi this consists of ‘constructive work’ in local, self-reliant, civically organised Indian villages and respectful participation in their ways […]  Fourthly, the first three practices are integrated into a singular style of civic life by the more personal practices of self-awareness and self-formation," Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', pp. 308-309.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tully, these cornerstones of nonviolent power "are daily practices of becoming an exemplary citizen."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully has since focused increasingly on the study and practice nonviolent ethics and nonviolent resistance.&lt;ref&gt;"Since publishing ''PPNK'' [''Public Philosophy in a New Key''] I have been presenting the best arguments of the antiwar and peace movements against the politics of an economy of violence and enmity and for a politics of nonviolence and compassion," Tully, ''Democracy and Freedom'', p. 239. See especially Tully, "Two Traditions of Human Rights," in ''Human Rights, Human Dignity and Cosmopolitan Ideals'', pp. 149-156; Tully, "Middle East Legal and Governmental Pluralism: A view of the field from the demos," ''Middle East Law and Governance'', 4 (2012), pp. 225-240, 250-263. "Global Disorder and Two Responses," ''Journal of Intellectual History and Political Thought'', 2.1 (November), pp. 49-62; Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 88-100, 276-319, 325-327, and Tully, ''Freedom and Democracy'', 239-247, 264-266 (there is some overlap between these sources).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the alternative of a politics of reasonable nonviolent cooperation and agonistics (Satyagraha) was discovered in the twentieth century by [[William James]], [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Abdul Gaffar Khan]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King Junior]], [[Thomas Merton]], [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], [[Gene Sharp]], [[Petra Kelly]], [[Johan Galtung]] and [[Barbara Deming]]. They argued that the antagonistic premise of western theories of reasonable violence is false. Nonviolent practices of cooperation, disputation and dispute resolution are more basic and prevalent than violent antagonism. This is a central feature of civic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Democracy and Freedom'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A major overlap between Tully’s civic freedom and the study of nonviolence is the shared emphasis on practice, on methods, on means rather than on ends. "For cooperative citizens," Tully writes, "means and ends are internally related, like a seed to the full-grown plant, as Gandhi put it."&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 96"&gt;Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because means "are pre-figurative or constitutive of ends. Consequently, democratic and peaceful relationships among humans are brought about by democratic and non-violent means."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully repudiates the "depressing history"&lt;ref&gt;"Democratic citizens have learned from this depressing history that distrust and violence beget distrust and violence and from the history of nonviolence that there is another more powerful way that leads to peace," Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; of "self-defeating violent means."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects the idea, prevalent across the spectrum of Western political thought, from revolutionaries to reactionaries (the "reigning dogma of the left and right"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Freedom and Democracy'', p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;) that peaceful and democratic societies can be brought about by coercive and violent means. Rather, according to Tully, "the means of violence and command relationships do not bring about peace and democracy. They too are constitutive means. They bring about [[security dilemma]]s and the spiral of the command relations necessary for war preparation, arms races and more violence."&lt;ref name="Tully, p. 96"/&gt;

For these reasons, Tully extends his civics-based public philosophy to "practitioners and social scientists [who] are beginning to appreciate the transformative power of participatory non-violence and the futility of war in comparison."&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 97. On the "transformative power of nonviolence," see especially ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 306-308: confronting violence with nonviolence "is often considered the fundamental transformative power of non-violence since it transforms the opponents and the relationship between them from one mode of being to another. Along with constructive programmes it is at the core of Gandhi’s Satyagraha. It is called the jiu-jitsu logic of non-violence because it uses the movements and dis-equilibrium of the opponent to bring about the transformation. The non-violent actors are not only offering and suggesting a non-violent alternative in which they can combine their energy and work together rather than wasting it in futile conflict, they also manifest this alternative in their interaction and envelope the violent others in these non-violent and potentially transformative relationships. They are being peace and making peace at one and the same time. Most of the more complex and mediated techniques and strategies of non-violent agonistics are derived from and extend the bodily logic of interaction and transformation of this famous phenomenological prototype. [citing [[Richard Gregg (social philosopher)|Richard Gregg]]'s 1934 ''The Power of Nonviolence''] The other technique that is equally important is non-cooperation. As we have seen, the civic tradition claims that unjust regimes rest not on violence or [[Manufacturing Consent|manufactured consensus]] but on cooperation in the sense of compliance. Therefore, the basic technique of dealing with an unjust regime from Étienne de la Boétie to the Egyptian Spring and non-violent Intifada is to withdraw cooperation in the everyday reproduction of the unjust system of cooperation," Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', pp. 306-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability and Gaia citizenship===
Tully’s approach to nonviolent citizenship practices includes relations with the non-human world. Tully argues that Homo Sapiens should see themselves as interdependent civic citizens of the ecological relationships in which they live and breathe and have their being. As such, they have responsibilities to care for and sustain these relationships that, in reciprocity, sustain them and all the other life forms that are interdependent on them.&lt;ref&gt;"Civic citizens are thus ‘caretakers’ of the goods of the dwelling places in which they live. In so doing, they dissolve the modernist distinction between culture and nature that separates civics from the places in which it is enacted. Every locale and network of locales of civic activity is not only culturally diverse but also a place in the natural world with its web of relationships of biological and ecological diversity. They see the interactive and interdependent relationships between humans and nature as similar in kind to human relationships, and they attend to and care for them in similar ways. They listen and respond carefully to nature as a living being (Gaia) in their ecological sciences and daily practices of treading lightly. Civic citizens realise that this non-metaphorical field of possibilities in human/natural relationships and its limited Spielraum is the ground of all others. They are Gaia citizens," Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully’s "[[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] citizenship"&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''Public Philosophy II'', p. 293; Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 93; Tully, "Trust, Mistrust and Distrust in Diverse Societies," in ''Trust and Distrust in Diverse Societies'', ed. by Dimitrios Karmis, forthcoming; Tully, "Reconciliation Here on Earth," forthcoming ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGzGvxvHz2o video] of talk).&lt;/ref&gt; draws on [[earth science]]s and [[list of life sciences|life sciences]] as well as indigenous traditions. For example, pointing to the work of ecological scientists from [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Rachel Carson]], and [[Barry Commoner]] to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change]], Tully links the unsustainability crisis of the [[Anthropocene]] to his own critique of  "modern civil" modes of governmentality (as violent, exploitative, and destructive).&lt;ref&gt;Tully, ''On Global Citizenship'', p. 93; Tully, "Trust in Diverse Societies," forthcoming; Tully, "Reconciliation Here on Earth," forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, he points to Indigenous knowledge that conceptualises human interconnectedness with the earth as [[Reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|gift-reciprocity relationships]] and as a model for social relationships.&lt;ref&gt;"Just as the living earth consists of gift-reciprocity relationships that sustain the living members, so humans should relate to the living earth and each other in their social relationships in the same general way," Tully, "Reconciliation Here on Earth," forthcoming; and "Moreover, Indigenous peoples insist that they did not invent this system. Rather, like life and earth scientists today, they observe the gift-reciprocity relationship in the symbiotic and symbiogenetic ecological relationships of interdependency that co-sustain and co-evolve non-human forms of life, and they learn from this how human associations should relate to each other," Tully, "Trust in Diverse Societies," forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous Indigenous artwork ''Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' remains exemplary of democratic and pluralistic ways of thinking and acting – between humans and the natural environments on which they depend.&lt;ref&gt;"The canoe is everywhere humans and non-humans dwell together. Wherever we are, we are symbiotically interdependent in the way the passengers are in the canoe. This is why we have responsibilities to respect each other and our diverse ways of living, because, as a matter of fact, they all support each other, like an old growth forest. But, in order to see this, we need to listen patiently to each other and see how the diversity looks from different perspectives, as they are doing," Tully, "Reconciliation Here on Earth," forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tully’s argument is that his account of interdependent agents in relationships of governance and situated freedom can be extended with modifications to describe human situatedness in ecological relationships – as either giving rise to ‘virtuous’ or ‘vicious cycles’, depending on how we act in and on them.&lt;ref&gt;"Whether the partners generate trustful and peaceful relationships through virtuous cycles of reciprocal interaction or distrustful and aggressive relationships through vicious cycles of antagonism depends in part on whether they become aware of this interweaving of their identities in the course of their interactions or whether they hold fast to atomism: the false belief that their individual and collective identities exist prior to and independent of encounter and interaction," Tully, "Trust in Diverse Societies," forthcoming. And "The aim is to work together to transform unsustainable relationships into conciliatory and sustainable ones: that is, to transform a vicious social system into a virtuous social system that sustains the ways of life of all affected," Tully, "Reconciliation Here on Earth," forthcoming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barad earned her doctorate in [[theoretical physics]] at [[Stony Brook University]]. Her dissertation presented computational methods for quantifying properties of [[quark]]s, and other [[fermion]]s, and in the framework of [[lattice gauge theory]].

Barad serves on the advisory board for the feminist academic journals ''Catalyst: Feminism, Theory, Technoscience'' and ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalystjournal.org/ojs/index.php/catalyst/about/displayMembership/6|title=People|website=catalystjournal.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://signsjournal.org/about-signs/masthead/|title=Masthead|date=2012-08-22|work=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|access-date=2017-08-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agential realism&lt;!--'Agential realism' talking inpunitabal bout somthing taboo and 'Intra-action' redirect here--&gt; ==
According to Barad's theory of '''agential realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, the universe comprises phenomena, which are "the ontological inseparability of intra-acting agencies". '''Intra-action'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a neologism introduced by Barad, signals an important challenge to individualist metaphysics. For Barad, '''phenomena'''   or objects do not precede their interaction, rather, 'objects' emerge through particular intra-actions. Thus, apparatuses, which produce phenomena, are not assemblages of humans and nonhumans (as in [[actor-network theory]]). Rather, they are the condition of possibility of 'humans' and 'non-humans', not merely as ideational concepts, but in their materiality. Apparatuses are 'material-discursive' in that they produce determinate meanings and material beings while simultaneously excluding the production of others. What it means to matter is therefore always material-discursive. Barad takes her inspiration from physicist [[Niels Bohr]], one of the founders of quantum physics. Barad's agential realism is at once an epistemology (theory of knowing), an ontology (theory of being), and an ethics. For this, Barad employs the term onto-epistemology. Because specific practices of mattering have ethical consequences, excluding other kinds of mattering, onto-epistemological practices are always in turn onto-ethico-epistemological.

Much of Barad's scholarly work has revolved around her concept of "agential realism," and her theories hold importance for many academic fields, including [[science studies]], STS (Science, Technology, and Society), [[feminist technoscience]], philosophy of science, [[feminist theory]], and, of course, physics. In addition to Bohr, her work draws a great deal on the works of [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Judith Butler]], as demonstrated in her influential article in the feminist journal [[Differences (journal)|differences]], "Getting Real: Technoscientific Practices and the Materialization of Reality."

Barad's original training was in theoretical physics.  Her book, ''Meeting the Universe Halfway'', (2007), includes a chapter that contains an original discovery in theoretical physics, which is largely unheard of in books that are usually categorized as 'gender studies' or 'cultural theory' books{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. In this book, Barad also argues that 'agential realism,' is useful to the analysis of literature, social inequalities, and many other things. This claim is based on the fact that Barad's agential realism is a way of understanding the politics, ethics, and agencies of any act of observation, and indeed any kind of knowledge practice.  According to Barad, the deeply connected way that everything is entangled with everything else means that any act of observation makes a "cut" between what is included and excluded from what is being considered.  Nothing is inherently separate from anything else, but separations are temporarily enacted so one can examine something long enough to gain knowledge about it. This view of knowledge provides a framework for thinking about how culture and habits of thought can make some things visible and other things easier to ignore or to never see.  For this reason, according to Barad, agential realism is useful for any kind of feminist analysis, even if the connection to science is not apparent.

Barad's framework makes several other arguments, and some of them are part of larger trends in fields such as science studies and [[feminist technoscience]] (all can be found in her 2007 book, ''Meeting the Universe Halfway''):

* She defines agency as a relationship and not as something that one "has."
* The scientist is always part of the apparatus, and one needs to understand that his/her participation is needed in order to make scientific work more accurate and more rigorous.  This differs from the view that political critiques of science seek to undermine the credibility of science; instead, Barad argues that this kind of critique actually makes for better, more credible science.
* She argues that politics and ethical issues are always part of scientific work, and only are made to seem separate by specific historical circumstances that encourage people to fail to see those connections.  She uses the example of the ethics of developing nuclear weapons to argue this point, by claiming that the ethics and politics are part of how such weapons were developed and understood, and therefore part of science, and not merely of the "philosophy of science" or the "ethics of science."  This differs from the usual view that one can strive for a politics-free, bias-less science.
* Nevertheless, she argues against moral relativism, which, according to Barad, uses science's "human" aspects as an excuse to treat all knowledge, and all ethical frameworks, as equally false. She uses [[Michael Frayn]]'s play, [[Copenhagen (play)|Copenhagen]], as an example of the kind of moral relativism that she finds problematic.
* She also rejects the idea that science is "only" a language game or set of fictions produced only by human constructions and concepts. Although the scientist is part of the "intra-action" of the experiment, humans (and their cultural constructs) do not have complete control over everything that happens. Barad expresses this point by saying, in Getting Real, that although scientists shape knowledge about the universe, you can't ignore the way the universe "kicks back."

These points on science, agency, ethics, and knowledge reveal that Barad's work is similar to the projects of other science studies scholars such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Andrew Pickering]], and [[Evelyn Fox Keller]].

'''Krastyo Kotev Krastev''' ({{lang-bg|Кръстьо Котев Кръстев}} {{IPA-mk|ˈkrəstjo ˈkɔtɛf ˈkrəstɛf|}}; also transliterated as ''Krǎstjo Krǎstev'', ''Krustyo Krustev'', etc.) (31 May 1866 – 15 April 1919), popularly known as '''Dr. Krastev''' (д-р Кръстев), was a [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] writer, translator, philosopher and public figure most notable as [[Bulgaria]]'s first professional [[Literary criticism|literary critic]]. Krastev was an influential member of the [[modernism|modernist]] ''Misal'' ("Thought") circle, a leading collaboration of writers that aimed to revolutionize [[Bulgarian literature]] and introduce the modern ideas of European literature and philosophy to the country.

==Biography==
Krastyo Krastev was born in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] town of [[Pirot]] (then part of the empire's [[Niš]] district in [[Danube Province, Ottoman Empire|Danube Province]]), today in eastern [[Serbia]].&lt;ref name="a-ya"&gt;{{cite book |title=Българска енциклопедия А–Я |publisher=БАН, Труд, Сирма |language=Bulgarian |year=2002 |chapter=Кръстев, Кръстьо Котев (1866–1919) |isbn=954-8104-08-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his education in his hometown, where he finished a Bulgarian ''progymnasium'' (junior high school). Along with a wave of Bulgarian refugees, his family had to move to the newly established [[Principality of Bulgaria]] in 1878, as Pirot was ceded to the [[Principality of Serbia]] by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. Krastev's family settled in the capital [[Sofia]], where he enrolled at the First Sofia High School for Boys.

Owing to the high school curriculum's focus on [[classical language]]s, he studied [[Ancient Greek]] along with [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[shorthand]] and other subjects. While still at high school, Krastev worked as a shorthand writer for the [[National Assembly of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref name="rechnik"&gt;{{cite book|last=Шишкова|first=Магдалена|author2=Сабина Беляева |author3=Мирослав Дачев |title=Речник по нова българска литература (1878&amp;nbsp;— 1992)|publisher=Хемус|location=София|year=1994|chapter=Кръстьо Кръстев|isbn=978-954-428-061-1|chapterurl=http://www.slovo.bg/showbio.php3?ID=308|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krastev finished high school in 1885 and in 1888 graduated in [[philosophy]] from the [[University of Leipzig]] in the [[German Empire]], where he wrote a doctorate under [[Wilhelm Wundt]],&lt;ref name="cornis-pope"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornis-Pope|first=Marcel|author2=John Neubauer |title=History of the literary cultures of East-Central Europe: junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2004|page=335|isbn=978-90-272-3452-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the father of [[experimental psychology]]. His doctorate discussed [[Hermann Lotze]]'s metaphysical concept of the soul. Krastev was engaged in literary criticism while still in Leipzig, where he wrote a study on [[Ivan Vazov]]'s poetical works.&lt;ref name="rechnik"/&gt;

After his graduation, Krastev returned to Bulgaria to become the headmaster of the [[Kazanlak]] pedagogical school (1888–1890) and then a teacher of [[logic]], [[psychology]] and [[ethics]] at the First Sofia High School for Boys (1890–1891). In 1892, he was employed by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] as a translator. After the opening of [[Sofia University]], Krastev was appointed as a lecturer of philosophy in 1895; he taught philosophy at the Sofia University in 1895–1896, 1899–1907, and 1908–1919. In 1899–1904, he was again a teacher at the First Sofia High School for Boys, and in 1907–1908 he was the headmaster of the Bulgarian pedagogical school in [[Skopje]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Accepted by the Bulgarian Literary Society (today [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]) as a correspondent member in 1898, he was made a full member in 1900.&lt;ref name="a-ya"/&gt; Krastev died in Sofia in 1919.&lt;ref name="rechnik"/&gt;

==Work==
From 1888 on, Krastev gained prominence among the Bulgarian literary society with his regular publications of critics and reviews in the press. He was the editor of a literary magazine while still in Kazanlak, and in 1891 he published the ''Kritika'' ("Critic") magazine, the first Bulgarian magazine devoted to literary criticism.&lt;ref name="a-ya"/&gt; He is best remembered as the editor-in-chief of the literary magazine ''Misal'' ("Thought"), the leading literary magazine in Bulgaria&lt;ref name="stearns"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stearns|first=Peter N.|author2=William Leonard Langer |title=The Encyclopedia of world history: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcour|year=2001|edition=6th|isbn=978-0-395-65237-4|pages=521–522}}&lt;/ref&gt; before [[World War I]], and as being an inseparable part of the eponymous circle formed around it. The circle, which consisted of Krastev, [[Pencho Slaveykov]], [[Peyo Yavorov]] and [[Petko Todorov]], aimed to introduce [[Modernist literature|modernism]] to the Bulgarian public and to develop an [[aesthetic]] sense in the readers. Its goal was also to introduce European influences in Bulgarian literature&lt;ref name="stearns"/&gt; while retaining its unique characteristics.&lt;ref name="a-ya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moussakova"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moussakova|first=Svetla|title=	Le miroir identitaire: Histoire de la construction culturelle de l'Europe. Transferts et politiques culturels en Bulgarie|publisher=Presses Sorbonne Nouvelle|year=2007|pages=85–86|isbn=978-2-87854-388-9|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Misal'' was issued between 1892 and 1907.&lt;ref name="rechnik"/&gt;

As a critic, Krastev contributed to a large number of Bulgarian magazines and newspapers, and had extensive studies on modern Bulgarian literature published in prominent foreign publications such as the [[Saint Petersburg]]-based ''[[Sovremennik]]'' and ''[[Vestnik Evropy]]'' and the ''[[Internationale Wochenschrift]]'' from [[Berlin]]. He was often critical towards the "old" representatives of Bulgarian literature, such as Vazov, [[Zahari Stoyanov]], [[Elin Pelin]], and [[Lyuben Karavelov]], as he was more favourable towards the modern trends and "young" writers, the careers of some of which his reviews boosted. Krastev's philosophical views have been described as emphasizing [[subjective idealism]] while being nevertheless [[eclecticism|eclectic]] in nature. Krastev was a staunch opponent of [[Ludwig Büchner]]'s [[materialism]] and his Bulgarian supporters, and his aesthetic views were influenced by [[Neo-Kantianism]]. Krastev's work as a translator is also notable: he published Bulgarian translations of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s ''[[Emilia Galotti]]'', [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]'', ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' and ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' and works by [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref name="rechnik"/&gt;

'''LDAP Admin''' is a free, open-source [[LDAP]] directory management tool licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]]. Small and compact, LDAP Admin is also highly configurable through the use of the template extensions. In addition to common browsing and editing functions, LDAP Admin provides a directory management functionality by supporting a number of application-specific LDAP objects such as [[Posix]] and [[Samba]] groups and accounts, [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]] objects and a number of [[Active Directory]] objects. It also provides an [[XML]]-based template engine which extends the application in a seamless way allowing it to support virtually unlimited number of user defined objects.

==Features==
Some of the key features include:
*Browsing and editing of LDAP directories
*Recursive operations on directory trees (copy, move and delete)
*Modify operations on datasets
*Password management
*Management of Posix Groups and Accounts
*Management of Samba Groups and Accounts
*Postfix MTA Support
*Template support
*Offline browsing and editing of LDIF files
As of version 1.3 the templates support for [[JavaScript]] and [[VBScript]] was introduced providing for a dynamic templates.

==Limitations==
LDAP Admin runs on the [[Windows]] operating systems only. By using the [[Wine]] software, it is apparently possible to run the application on a [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?bShowAll=true&amp;bIsQueue=false&amp;bIsRejected=false&amp;sClass=version&amp;sTitle=&amp;sReturnTo=&amp;iId=19365&lt;/ref&gt; Since recently{{when|date=July 2017}}, there is also a Linux port&lt;ref&gt;http://ivb.sweb.cz/ldap-en.html&lt;/ref&gt; (still Beta) of LdapAdmin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8559">[[Henry E. Kyburg, Jr.]]'s '''lottery paradox''' &lt;ref&gt;Kyburg, H. E. (1961). ''Probability and the Logic of Rational Belief'',  Middletown, CT:  Wesleyan University Press, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; arises from considering a fair 1000-ticket [[lottery]] that has exactly one winning ticket. If this much is known about the execution of the lottery it is therefore rational to accept that some ticket will win. Suppose that an event is very likely only if the probability of it occurring is greater than 0.99. On these grounds it is presumed rational to accept the proposition that ticket 1 of the lottery will not win. Since the lottery is fair, it is rational to accept that ticket 2 will not win either—indeed, it is rational to accept for any individual ticket ''i'' of the lottery that ticket ''i'' will not win. However, accepting that ticket 1 will not win, accepting that ticket 2 will not win, and so on until accepting that ticket 1000 will not win entails that it is rational to accept that ''no'' ticket will win, which entails that it is rational to accept the contradictory proposition that one ticket wins and no ticket wins.

The lottery paradox was designed to demonstrate that three attractive principles governing [[rational acceptance]] lead to contradiction, namely that
* It is rational to accept a proposition that is very likely true,
* It is irrational to accept a proposition that is known to be inconsistent, and is jointly inconsistent
* If it is rational to accept a proposition A and it is rational to accept another proposition A', then it is rational to accept A and A'.

The paradox remains of continuing interest because it raises several issues at the foundations of knowledge representation and uncertain reasoning: the relationships between  fallibility, corrigible belief and [[logical consequence]]; the roles that consistency, statistical evidence and probability play in belief fixation; the precise normative force that logical and probabilistic consistency have on rational belief.

==History==
Although the first published statement of the lottery paradox appears in Kyburg's 1961 ''Probability and the Logic of Rational Belief'', the first formulation of the paradox appears in his "Probability and Randomness", a paper delivered at the 1959 meeting of the [[Association for Symbolic Logic]], and the 1960 International Congress for the History and Philosophy of Science, but published in the journal ''Theoria'' in 1963. This paper is reprinted in Kyburg (1987).

==Smullyan's variation==

[[Raymond Smullyan]] presents the following variation on the lottery paradox: One is either inconsistent or conceited. Since the human brain is finite, there are a finite number of propositions {{mvar|p}}{{su|b=1}}…{{mvar|p{{su|b={{mvar|n}}}}}} that one believes.  But unless you are conceited, you know that you sometimes make mistakes, and that not everything you believe is true.  Therefore, if you are not conceited, you know that at least some of the {{mvar|p{{su|b={{mvar|i}}}}}} are false.  Yet you believe each of the {{mvar|p{{su|b={{mvar|i}}}}}} individually.  This is an inconsistency.{{harv|Smullyan|1978|p=206}}

==Short guide to the literature==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2016}}
The lottery paradox has become a central topic within [[epistemology]], and the enormous literature surrounding this puzzle threatens to obscure its original purpose.{{Says who|date=March 2016}} Kyburg proposed the [[thought experiment]] to get across a feature of his innovative ideas on probability (Kyburg 1961, Kyburg and Teng 2001), which are built around taking the first two principles above seriously and rejecting the last. For Kyburg, the lottery paradox is not really a paradox: his solution is to restrict aggregation.

Even so, for orthodox probabilists the second and third principles are primary, so  the first principle is rejected. Here too one will see claims that there is really no paradox but an error: the solution is to reject the first principle, and with it the idea of rational acceptance. For anyone with basic knowledge of probability, the first principle should be rejected: for a very likely event, the rational belief about that event is just that it is very likely, not that it is true.

Most of the literature in epistemology approaches the puzzle from the orthodox point of view and grapples with the particular consequences faced by doing so, which is why the lottery is associated with discussions of skepticism (e.g., Klein 1981), and conditions for asserting knowledge claims (e.g., J. P. Hawthorne 2004). It is common to also find proposed resolutions to the puzzle that turn on particular features of the lottery thought experiment (e.g., Pollock 1986), which then invites comparisons of the lottery to other epistemic paradoxes, such as [[David Makinson]]'s [[preface paradox]], and to "lotteries" having a different structure. This strategy is addressed in (Kyburg 1997) and also in (Wheeler 2007). An extensive bibliography is included in (Wheeler 2007).

Philosophical logicians and AI researchers have tended to be interested in reconciling weakened versions of the three principles, and there are many ways to do this, including Jim Hawthorne and Luc Bovens's (1999) logic of belief, Gregory Wheeler's (2006) use of 1-monotone capacities, Bryson Brown's (1999) application of preservationist para-consistent logics, [[Igor Douven]] and Timothy Williamson's (2006) appeal to cumulative non-monotonic logics, Horacio Arlo-Costa's (2007) use of minimal model (classical) modal logics, and Joe Halpern's (2003) use of first-order probability.

Finally, philosophers of science, decision scientists, and statisticians are inclined to see the lottery paradox as an early example of the complications one faces in constructing principled methods for aggregating uncertain information, which is now a discipline of its own, with a dedicated journal, ''[[Information Fusion]]'', in addition to continuous contributions to general area journals.

'''Marcel Conche''' (born 27 March 1922 in [[Altillac]]), is a [[France|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], emeritus professor at the Sorbonne University (Paris).

"Philosophizing ad infinitum" has been published by SUNY (State University of New York) Press, June 2014. It is the translation of one of his major works: "Philosopher à l'infini", published by PUF, Presses Universitaires de France, in 2005.  
https://web.archive.org/web/20160305012343/http://www.sunypress.edu/p-5869-philosophizing-ad-infinitum.aspx

A recent publication (2003), the [[Tao Te Ching]] translation and comments in French, follows the format of previous works, such as ''Héraclite - Fragments'' (fragments of [[Heraclitus]]):
*French translation of the original text
*Commentary in the immediately ensuing chapter

In this book he draws an interesting parallel between the nearly contemporaries [[Lao Zi]] (see [[Tao Te Ching]]) and [[Heraclitus]]: the river of the Greek is compared to the [[Tao|Dao]] of the Chinese.

In some cases (such as the [[Heraclitus]]) the text (as handed down by tradition, copyists, historians or other authors quoting the now unavailable original text) is reordered to follow a more logical order, from the simplest of principles to the most advanced.

'''Media ethics''' is the subdivision of [[applied ethics]] dealing with the specific ethical principles and standards of [[mass media|media]], including [[broadcast media]], [[film]], [[theatre]], the [[arts]], [[print media]] and the internet. The field covers many varied and highly controversial topics, ranging from [[War correspondent|war journalism]] to [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] ad campaigns.

Media ethics involves promoting and defending values such as a universal respect for life and  the rule of law and legality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moldovan|first=Gratian|date=|title=Media Ethics in the Ideological Context of the Twentieth Century|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=13&amp;sid=b975b2a4-ca3c-4480-9425-5f5ed6a3ec10%40sessionmgr4006|journal=Contemporary Readings in Law and Social Justice|volume=6|pages=589–593|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature regarding the ways in which specifically the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online is scarce, thereby complicating the idea for a universal code of media ethics.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deuze I, Yeshua II|first=Mark I, Daphna II|date=December 2001|title=Online Journalists Face New Ethical Dilemmas: Lessons From The Netherlands|url=|journal=Journal of Mass Media Ethics|volume=16|pages=273–292|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Media Ethics ==
Research and publications in the field of information ethics has been produced since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Froehlich|first=Thomas|date=December 2004|title=A Brief History of Information Ethics|url=http://bid.ub.edu/13froel2.htm|journal=Universitat de Barcelona. Facultat de Biblioteconomia i Documentació|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable figures include and Robert Hauptman (who focused his work specifically on censorship, privacy, access to information, balance in collection development, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics), [[Rafael Capurro]], Barbara J. Kostrewski and Charles Oppenheim (who wrote the article "''“Ethics in Information Science”'' , discussing issues as confidentiality of information, bias in information provided to clients or consumers, the quality of data supplied by online vendors, etc).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1990s, the term "information ethics" began to be explored by various Computer Science and Information departments in the United States.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, textbooks such as Richard Severson's ''The Principles of Information Ethics'' and Marsha Cook Woodbury's ''Computer and Information Ethics'', and Deborah G. Johnson's ''Computer Ethics'' were published.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Areas of Media Ethics ==

Media ethics:  Issues of moral principles and values as applied to the conduct, roles, and *content of the mass media, in particular [[journalism ethics and standards]] and [[marketing ethics]];  also the field of study concerned with this topic. In relation to news coverage it includes issues such as [[impartiality]], [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], [[wikt:balance|balance]], [[bias]], privacy, and the [[public interest]]. More generally, it also includes [[stereotyping]], taste and decency, [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], advertising practices such as [[product placement]], and legal issues such as [[defamation]]. On an institutional level it includes debates over [[media ownership]] and control, [[commercialization]], accountability, the relation of the media to the political system, issues arising from regulation (e.g. [[censorship]]) and [[deregulation]].

=== Ethics of journalism ===
{{main|Journalism ethics and standards}}
[[Image:Starlette.jpg|thumb|Photographers crowd around a starlet at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]

The ethics of journalism is one of the most well-defined branches of media ethics, primarily because it is frequently taught in
[[journalism schools|schools of journalism]]. Journalistic ethics tend to dominate media ethics, sometimes almost to the exclusion of other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515000000*/http://smi.curtin.edu.au/netstudies/docs/allen/AllenNCW2001.doc|title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|work=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics covered by journalism ethics include:
* News manipulation. News can manipulate and be manipulated. Governments and corporations may attempt to manipulate news media; governments, for example, by [[censorship]], and corporations by share ownership. The methods of manipulation are subtle and many. Manipulation may be voluntary or involuntary. Those being manipulated may not be aware of this. See: [[news propaganda]].
* [[Truth]]. Truth may conflict with many other values.
** Public interest. Revelation of military secrets and other sensitive government information may be contrary to the [[public interest]], even if it is true. However, [[public interest]] is not a term which is easy to define.
** Privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. [[Privacy]] is also a [[rights|right]], and one which conflicts with [[free speech]]. See: [[paparazzi]].
** Fantasy. Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Journalism may mix fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. See: [[National Enquirer]], [[Jayson Blair]] scandal, [[Adnan Hajj photographs controversy]].
** Taste. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audience's sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth. See [[photojournalism]].
* Conflict with the law. Journalistic ethics may conflict with the law over issues such as the protection of confidential [[news source]]s. There is also the question of the extent to which it is ethically acceptable to break the law in order to obtain news. For example, undercover reporters may be engaging in [[deception]], [[trespass]] and similar [[torts]] and crimes. See [[undercover journalism]], [[investigative journalism]].

=== Online Journalism ===
The Internet has shaped and redefined various ethical and moral issues for both online journalists and journalists  utilizing online resources.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

While some journalists continue to adhere to ethical principles of traditional journalism, many journalists believe that with the absence of a mutually agreed upon code of ethics specifically pertaining to internet ethics, and lack of literature dealing specifically with the ways in which the Internet impacts media ethics in journalism online, the online environment poses new threats to the profession.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==== Core Issues of Media Ethics in Online Journalism ====
Some of the core issues of media ethics in online journalism include commercial pressures, accuracy and credibility (which include he issues dealing with hyperlinks), verification of facts, regulation, privacy, and news-gathering methods.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethics of entertainment media ===
Issues in the ethics of entertainment media include:
* The depiction of violence and sex, and the presence of [[strong language]]. Ethical guidelines and legislation in this area are common and many media (e.g. film, computer games) are subject to ratings systems and supervision by agencies. An extensive guide to international systems of enforcement can be found under [[motion picture rating system]].
* “Fluff or “Celebrity News”: Over the years, print media has been dying out so journalists began to report on what is referred to as “Celebrity News”, or “Fluff.” As more outlets adopt this topic to report on, people become dependent on them. According to Alden Weight, most people know not to completely trust these outlets due to ethical discrepancies, but the issue arises when people who are not as mature or educated find these reports to be completely true.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weight|first=Alden|date=Spring 2011|title=Making A Monkey Look Good: The Case For Consumer Ethics of Entertainment Media|url=|journal=Teaching Ethics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{POV check inline}}
* [[Product placement]]. An increasingly common [[marketing]] tactic is the placement of products in entertainment media. The producers of such media may be paid high sums to display branded products. The practice is controversial and largely unregulated. Detailed article: [[product placement]].
* Advertising: Attraction and persuasion are currently found in modern journalism. It is found that these methods of advertising may alter an audience’s point of view of what is realistic and falsified information.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* [[Stereotypes]]. Both advertising and entertainment media make heavy use of [[stereotypes]]. Stereotypes may negatively affect people's perceptions of themselves or promote socially undesirable behavior. The stereotypical portrayals of [[men]], [[affluence]] and [[ethnic groups]] are examples of major areas of debate
***Women in Media: Entertainment media often exploits female bodies by objectifying and de-humanizing them. By doing so, the concept of female bodies being bought and sold becomes common.
***Media outlets usually use either images or imagery of female bodies to counter negative news that is provided throughout the day.&lt;ref name=":05"/&gt;
* Taste and [[taboos]]. Entertainment media often questions of our [[values]] for artistic and entertainment purposes. [[Normative ethics]] is often about moral values, and what kinds should be enforced and protected. In media ethics, these two sides come into conflict. In the name of art, media may deliberately attempt to break with existing norms and shock the audience. That poses ethical problems when the norms abandoned are closely associated with certain relevant moral values or obligations.  The extent to which this is acceptable is always a hotbed of ethical controversy. See: [[Turner Prize]], [[obscenity]], [[freedom of speech]], [[aesthetics]].

=== Media and democracy ===
In democratic countries, a special relationship exists between media and government. Although the freedom of the media may be [[constitution]]ally enshrined and have precise legal definition and enforcement, the exercise of that freedom by individual journalists is a matter of personal choice and ethics.
Modern democratic government subsists in [[Representation (politics)|representation]] of millions by hundreds. For the representatives to be [[accountability|accountable]], and for the process of government to be [[transparency (humanities)|transparent]], effective communication paths must exist to their [[Electoral district|constituents]]. Today these paths consist primarily of the mass media, to the extent that if [[press freedom]] disappeared, so would most political [[accountability]].
In this area, media ethics merges with issues of [[civil rights]] and [[politics]]. Issues include: 
* Subversion of [[media independence]] by financial interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Moyers]], [http://www.thenation.com/article/media-and-democracy Media and Democracy], [[The Nation]] (Editorial), December 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* Government monitoring of media for intelligence gathering against its own people. See, for example, [[NSA call database]].
See: [[freedom of information]], [[media transparency]] [[Right to Information]].

=== Media integrity ===
Media integrity refers to the ability of a media outlet to serve the [[public interest]] and [[democratic process]], making it resilient to institutional [[corruption]] within the media system,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wiki.lessig.org/Institutional_Corruption|title = Institutional Corruption|last = Lessig|first = Lawrence|website = wiki.lessig.org|access-date = 2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; economy of influence, conflicting dependence and political clientelism. Media integrity encompasses following qualities of a media outlet: 
* [[Editorial independence|independence]] from private or political interests
* [[Media transparency|transparency]] about own financial interests
* commitment to [[journalism ethics and standards]]
* responsiveness to citizens

The concept was devised particularly for the media systems in the region of [[Southeast Europe|South East Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://mediaobservatory.net/sites/default/files/media%20integrity%20matters_za%20web_FINAL.pdf|title = Media Integrity Matters: Reclaiming Public Service Values in Media and Journalism: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia|last =|first =|publisher = Peace Institute|year = 2014|isbn =|editor-last = Petković|editor-first = Brankica|location = Ljubljana|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; within the project [http://mediaobservatory.net/about South East European Media Observatory], gathering organisations which are part of the [http://seenpm.org/about-us/ South East European Network for Professionalization of Media (SEENPM)].

== Attempts to Develop a Universal Code of Media Ethics ==
Within the last two decades, numerous regional discussions have taken place in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia in order to create a universal code of ethics for the information society.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Capurro; Britz|first=Rafael; Johannes B.|date=2010|title=In Search of a Code of Global Information Ethics: The Road Travelled and New Horizons|url=http://www.communicationethics.net/journal/v7n2-3/v7n2-3_feat2.pdf|journal=Ethical Space: The International Journal of Communication Ethics|volume=7|pages=|via=Academic Search Complete}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the core issues in developing a universal code for media ethics is the difficulty of finding a common ground between ethical principles from one culture to another.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Also, such codes may be interpreted differently according to various moral and legal standards.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== UNESCO INFOethics Congresses ===
The ethical facet of the global information society has been on the [[UNESCO]] (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) agenda since 1997, when the organization initiated their first INFOethics Congress.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The objective of this summit was to spark debate on the ethical dimension of the global information society.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The UNESCO INFOethics Congresses then met in 1998 and 2000, where specialists coming from a wide range of educational, scientific, and cultural environments addressed the ethical dimensions of global media and information.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

=== International Symposium on Information Ethics, Karlsuhe, 2004 ===
In 2004, the ICIE, or International Center for Information Ethics, organized the firs international symposium on information ethics in [[Karlsruhe|Karlsuhe, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Experts with varying scientific backgrounds such as computer science, [[information science]], [[media studies]], and economics, gathered from all over the world to discuss the internet from both an ethical and intercultural perspective.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Contexts of media ethics ==

=== Media ethics and the laws ===

=== Media ethics and media economics ===
Media economics where things such as -- [[deregulation]] of media, [[concentration of media ownership]], [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations in the U.S, media [[trade unions]] and labor issues, and other such worldwide regulating bodies, [[Citizen journalism|citizen media]] ([[Low-power broadcasting|low power FM]], [[community radio]]) -- have ethical implications......

=== Media ethics and public officials ===
The [[mass media|media]] has manipulated the way public officials conduct themselves through the advancement of technology. Constant television coverage displays the legislative proceedings; exposing faster than ever before, unjust rulings throughout the government process. [[Truth]] telling is crucial in media ethics as any opposition of [[truth]] telling is considered [[deception]]. Anything shown by the media whether print or video is considered to be original. When a statement is written in an article or a video is shown of a public official, it is the original “truthful” words of the individual official themselves.

=== Intercultural dimensions of media ethics ===
If values differ interculturally, the issue arises of the extent to which behaviour should be modified in the light of the values of specific cultures. Two examples of controversy from the field of media ethics:
* [[Google China|Google's self-censorship in China]].
* The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]] in Denmark, and subsequently worldwide.

== Meta-issues in media ethics ==
One theoretical question for media ethics is the extent to which media ethics is just another topical subdivision of [[applied ethics]], differing only in terms of case applications and raising no theoretical issues peculiar to itself. The oldest subdivisions of applied ethics are [[medical ethics]] and [[business ethics]]. Does media ethics have anything new to add other than interesting cases?

===Similarities between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===

[[Privacy]] and [[honesty]] are issues extensively covered in medical ethical literature, as is
the principle of harm-avoidance. The trade-offs between economic goals and social values has been
covered extensively in [[business ethics]] (as well as medical and [[environmental ethics]]).

===Differences between media ethics and other fields of applied ethics===
The issues of [[freedom of speech]] and aesthetic values (taste) are primarily at home in media ethics. However a number of further issues distinguish media ethics as a field in its own right.

A theoretical issue peculiar to media ethics is the identity of ''observer'' and ''observed''. The press is one of the primary guardians in a democratic society of many of the freedoms, rights and duties discussed by other fields of applied ethics. In media ethics the ethical obligations of the guardians themselves comes more strongly into the foreground. Who guards the guardians? This question also arises in the field of [[legal ethics]].

A further self-referentiality or circular characteristic in media ethics is the questioning of its own values. Meta-issues can become identical with the subject matter of media ethics. This is most strongly seen when artistic elements are considered. [[Benetton Group|Benetton]] advertisements and [[Turner prize]] candidates are both examples of ethically questionable media uses which question their own
questioner.

Another characteristic of media ethics is the disparate nature of its goals. Ethical dilemmas emerge when goals conflict. The goals of media usage diverge sharply. Expressed in a consequentialist manner, media usage may be subject to pressures to maximize: economic profits, entertainment value, information provision, the upholding of democratic freedoms, the development of art and culture, fame and vanity.

'''Monopsychism''' is the belief that all humans share the same eternal [[consciousness]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], [[mind]] and [[intellect]].  It is also a recurring feature in many [[Mysticism|mystical traditions]].

Monopsychism is a doctrine of [[Sabians|Sabianism]], Jewish [[Kabbalah]], and [[Averroism]], and also forms a part of the [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] belief system.

==Aquinas==
[[Thomas Aquinas]] disagreed with this belief and devoted most of his writing to Averroism and criticized monopsychism. One of his works, a commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[On the soul]]'', is titled ''De unitate intellectus contra Averroistas''.&lt;ref&gt;http://dhspriory.org/thomas/DeUnitateIntellectus.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In this commentary, Aquinas demonstrates how [[Averroes]] misinterpreted Aristotle's argument, claiming that the correct interpretation was that an individual's [[nous|intellect]] cannot be independent of his or her physical body.

{{quote|''(...) intellect, can be separated, not indeed from body, as the Commentator'' (Averroes) ''perversely interprets, but from other parts of the soul'' (...)|Aquinas}}

[[File:Reach Toronto.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5| The ''Monument to Multiculturalism'' in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. Four identical sculptures are located in [[Buffalo City Local Municipality|Buffalo City]], [[South Africa]]; in [[Changchun]], [[China]]; in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia]] and in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].|alt=]]

The term '''multiculturalism''' has a range of meanings within the contexts of [[sociology]], of [[political philosophy]], and of colloquial use. In sociology and in everyday usage, it is a synonym for "[[Pluralism (political theory)|ethnic pluralism]]", with the two terms often used interchangeably, for example, a [[cultural pluralism]] in which various ethnic groups collaborate and enter into a dialogue with one another without having to sacrifice their particular identities. It can describe a mixed ethnic community area where multiple cultural traditions exist (such as [[New York City]]) or a single country within which they do (such as Switzerland, Belgium or Russia). Groups associated with an aboriginal or [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] ethnic group and foreigner ethnic groups are often the focus.

In reference to sociology, multiculturalism is the end-state of either a natural or artificial process (for example: legally-controlled [[immigration]]) and occurs on either a large national scale or on a smaller scale within a nation's communities. On a smaller scale this can occur artificially when a jurisdiction is established or expanded by amalgamating areas with two or more different cultures (e.g. [[French Canada]] and [[English Canada]]). On a large scale, it can occur as a result of either legal or illegal [[human migration|migration]] to and from different jurisdictions around the world (for example, [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]] by Angles, Saxons and Jutes in the 5th century or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans, Africans and Asians since the 16th century).

Multiculturalism as a political philosophy involves ideologies and policies which vary widely,&lt;ref name="Harper2011"&gt;{{cite book|author= Thomas L. Harper|title= Dialogues in urban and regional planning|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7mZOF_gFhfYC&amp;pg=PA50|date= 13 January 2011|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 978-0-415-59334-2|page= 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from the advocacy of equal respect to the various cultures in a society,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} through policies of promoting the maintenance of [[cultural diversity]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} to policies in which people of various [[ethnic]] and [[religion|religious]] groups are addressed by the authorities as defined by the group to which they belong.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{cite web|url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Multiculturalism |title= Dictionary.Reference.com |publisher= Dictionary.Reference.com |accessdate= 2010-12-10 | quote = multiculturalism [:] the preservation of different cultures or cultural identities within a unified society, as a state or nation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianmalik"&gt;{{cite news|author= Kenan Malik |url= https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/17/multiculturalism-diversity-political-policy |title= Multiculturalism undermines diversity | work = The Guardian |publisher= Guardian |date= 2010-03-17 |accessdate= 2010-12-10 |location= London | quote = As a political process, however, multiculturalism [...] describes a set of policies, the aim of which is to manage diversity by putting people into ethnic boxes, defining individual needs and rights by virtue of the boxes into which people are put, and using those boxes to shape public policy.

Multiculturalism that promotes maintaining the distinctiveness of multiple cultures is often contrasted{{by whom|date=September 2018}} to other [[settler|settlement]] policies such as [[social integration]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[racial segregation]]. Multiculturalism has been described as a "[[Salad bowl (cultural idea)|salad bowl]]" and as a "[[cultural mosaic]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TuggI-Ye_AUC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Cultural%20mosaic%20Canada&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |page= 31|title= Guide to Western Canada|edition= 7th|first1= Ann Carroll|last1= Burgess|first2= Tom |last2= Burgess|publisher= Globe Pequot Press|year= 2005|isbn= 0-7627-2987-2|accessdate = 2011-01-16}} {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - in contrast to a [[melting pot]].&lt;ref&gt;

Two different and seemingly inconsistent strategies have developed through different government policies and strategies. The first focuses on interaction and communication between different cultures; this approach is also often known{{by whom|date=September 2018}} as [[interculturalism]]. The second centers on diversity and cultural uniqueness, which can sometimes{{quantify|date=September 2018}} result in [[Ethnic competition thesis|intercultural competition over jobs]] (among other things) and may lead to [[ethnic conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2011/february/europes-multiculturalism-leading-to-civil-war-/?mobile=false|title= Europe's Multiculturalism Leading to Civil War? – World – CBN News – Christian News 24-7 |website= www.cbn.com|access-date= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.ifamericansknew.org/history/|title= A Synopsis of the Israel/Palestine Conflict|last= Knew|first= If Americans|website= www.ifamericansknew.org|access-date= 2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussions surrounding the issue of cultural isolation may address the [[ghettoization]] of a culture within a nation and the protection of the cultural attributes of an area or of a nation.

==Prevalence==
In the [[political philosophy]] of multiculturalism, ideas are focused on the ways in which societies are either believed to or should, respond to cultural and religious differences. It is often associated with "identity politics", "the politics of difference", and "the politics of recognition". It is also a matter of economic interests and [[Power (social and political)|political power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/multiculturalism/ Multiculturalism] – Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times political multiculturalist ideologies have been expanding in their use to include and define disadvantaged groups such as [[African American]]s, [[LGBT]], with arguments often focusing on ethnic and religious minorities, minority nations, [[indigenous peoples]] and even the disabled. It is within this context in which the term is most commonly understood and the broadness and scope of the definition, as well as its practical use, has been the subject of serious debate.

Most debates over multiculturalism center around whether or not multiculturalism is the appropriate way to deal with diversity and immigrant integration. The arguments regarding the perceived rights to a multicultural education include the proposition that it acts as a way to demand recognition of aspects of a group's culture subordination and its entire experience in contrast to a [[melting pot]] or non-multicultural societies.

The term multiculturalism is most often used in reference to Western [[nation-state]]s, which had seemingly achieved a de facto single national identity during the 18th and/or 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="ZarateLevy2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Geneviève Zarate|author2=Danielle Levy|author3=Claire Kramsch|title=Handbook of Multilingualism and Multiculturalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYL4_6SvxewC&amp;pg=PA377|date=19 April 2011|publisher=Archives contemporaines|isbn=978-2-8130-0039-2|page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nation-states in Africa, Asia, and the Americas are culturally diverse and are 'multicultural' in a [[descriptive]] sense. In some, [[communalism]] is a major political issue. The policies adopted by these states often have parallels with multiculturalist policies in the Western world, but the historical background is different, and the goal may be a mono-cultural or [[Monoethnicity|mono-ethnic]] [[nation-building]] – for instance in the Malaysian government's attempt to create a 'Malaysian race' by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]]: ''[http://www.economist.com/surveys/displayStory.cfm?story_id=1677228 The changing of the guard]'', April 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiculturalism is seen by its supporters as a fairer system that allows people to truly express who they are within a society, that is more tolerant and that adapts better to social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/22/multiculturalism-blame-culture-segregation |title=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2010-12-10 |location=London |first=Antony |last=Lerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that culture is not one definable thing based on one race or religion, but rather the result of multiple factors that change as the world changes.

Historically, support for modern multiculturalism stems from the changes in Western societies after World War II, in what Susanne Wessendorf calls the "human rights revolution", in which the horrors of institutionalized racism and [[ethnic cleansing]] became almost impossible to ignore in the wake of the [[Holocaust]]; with the collapse of the [[Colonial empire|European colonial system]], as colonized nations in Africa and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]] successfully [[African independence movements|fought for their independence]] and pointed out the discriminatory underpinnings of the colonial system; and, in the United States in particular, with the rise of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which criticized ideals of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] that often led to prejudices against those who did not act according to Anglo-American standards and which led to the development of academic [[ethnic studies]] programs as a way to counteract the neglect of contributions by racial minorities in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Wessendorf, ''The multiculturalism backlash: European discourses, policies and practices'', p. 35; accessed through Google Books, 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Gorski, [http://www.edchange.org/multicultural/papers/edchange_history.html "A Brief History of Multicultural Education"], EdChange.org, November 1999; accessed 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As this history shows, multiculturalism in Western countries was seen to combat racism, to protect minority communities of all types, and to undo policies that had prevented minorities from having full access to the opportunities for freedom and equality promised by the [[liberalism]] that has been the hallmark of Western societies since the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. The [[contact hypothesis]] in sociology is a well documented phenomenon in which cooperative interactions with those from a different group than one's own reduce prejudice and inter-group hostility.

C. James Trotman argues that multiculturalism is valuable because it "uses several disciplines to highlight neglected aspects of our social history, particularly the histories of women and minorities [...and] promotes respect for the dignity of the lives and voices of the forgotten.&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. James Trotman|title=Multiculturalism: roots and realities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ht8UKlutUaMC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=29 January 2012|year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34002-3|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By closing gaps, by raising consciousness about the past, multiculturalism tries to restore a sense of wholeness in a [[postmodern]] era that fragments human life and thought."&lt;ref name="Trotman2002"/&gt;

[[Tariq Modood]] argues that in the early years of the 21st century, multiculturalism "is most timely and necessary, and [...] we need more not less", since it is "the form of integration" that (1) best fits the ideal of [[egalitarianism]], (2) has "the best chance of succeeding" in the "post-[[9/11]], post [[7/7]]" world, and (3) has remained "moderate [and] pragmatic".&lt;ref name="Modood2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tariq Modood|title=Multiculturalism: a civic idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hlEMZuPhpWQC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2007|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-3288-9|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bhikhu Parekh]] counters what he sees as the tendencies to equate multiculturalism with racial minorities "demanding special rights" and to see it as promoting a "thinly veiled racis[m]". Instead, he argues that multiculturalism is in fact "not about minorities" but "is about the proper terms of relationship between different cultural communities", which means that the standards by which the communities resolve their differences, e.g., "the principles of justice" must not come from only one of the cultures but must come "through an open and equal dialogue between them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parekh|first=Bhikhu C.|title=Rethinking multiculturalism: cultural diversity and political theory|year=2002|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-00995-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balibar characterizes criticisms of multiculturalism as "differentialist racism", which he describes as a covert form of racism that does not purport ethnic superiority as much as it asserts stereotypes of perceived "incompatibility of life-styles and traditions".&lt;ref name="Gunew 2004 80"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gunew|first=Sneja|title=Haunted Nations: The colonial dimensions of multiculturalisms|date=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=11 New Fetter Lane, London EC4P 4EE|isbn=0-415-28483-X|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard professor of political science [[Robert D. Putnam]] conducted a nearly decade-long study on how multiculturalism affects social trust.&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Putnam |first = Robert D. |author-link = Robert D.

People in diverse communities "don’t trust the local mayor, they don’t trust the local paper, they don’t trust other people and they don’t trust institutions," writes Putnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Sailer |first = Steve |author-link = Steve Sailer |title = Fragmented future |url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2007/jan/15/00007/ |work = [[The American Conservative]] |publisher = Jon Basil Utley |date = January 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[W]e hunker down. We act like turtles. The effect of diversity is worse than had been imagined. And it’s not just that we don’t trust people who are not like us. In diverse communities, we don’t trust people who do look like us".&lt;ref name="Putnam, Robert D. 2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Putnam has also stated, however, that "this allergy to diversity tends to diminish and to go away... I think in the long run we'll all be better."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michel, "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12802663 Political Scientist: Does Diversity Really Work?]" Tell Me More, NPR. Written 15 August 2007, accessed 15 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ethnologist]] [[Frank Salter]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Relatively homogeneous societies invest more in public goods, indicating a higher level of public altruism. For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government's share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States, Africa and South-East Asia find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. Moscow beggars receive more gifts from fellow ethnics than from other ethnies {{sic}}. A recent multi-city study of municipal spending on public goods in the United States found that ethnically or racially diverse cities spend a smaller portion of their budgets and less per capita on public services than do the more homogeneous cities.&lt;ref&gt;Salter, Frank, ''On Genetic Interests'', p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Lamm]], former three-term Democratic governor of the US state of [[Colorado]], wrote in his essay "I have a plan to destroy America":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Diverse peoples worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other—that is, when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precedent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Lamm |first = Richard D. |title = I have a plan to destroy America |url = http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/lamm.asp |website = Snopes.com |date = 2005 |access-date = 12 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of conservative historians used the religion of the Mexica, better known as the Aztecs as an example of what they see as the flaws of multiculturalism. The Australian historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] cited the accounts of his fellow Australian historian [[Inga Clendinnen]] of the festival of [[Ochpaniztli]] where to honor the Maize Lord a young woman was sacrificed by ripping out her heart so the crops might grow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, still in darkness, silence, and urgent haste, her body was flayed, and a naked priest, a 'very strong man, very powerful, very tall', struggled into the wet skin, with its slack breasts and pouched genitalia: a double nakedness of layered, ambiguous sexuality. The skin of one thigh was reserved to be fashioned into a face-mask for the man impersonating Centeotl, Young Lord Maize Cob, the son of Toci.&lt;ref&gt;Clendinnen, Inga ''Aztecs: An Interpretation'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995. p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Windschuttle argued that the gruesome religion of the Aztecs that required that dozens of young people be sacrificed and eaten every day so that the sun might rise the next day and hundreds of people sacrificed for major holidays as proving that multiculturalism is a facile doctrine that requires Westerners to respect Aztec religion as equal to any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Windshuttle, Keith ''The Killing of History How Literary Critics and Social Theorists Are Murdering Our Past'',  San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997. p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; The American classicist [[Victor Davis Hanson]] used the perceived differences in "rationality" between Moctezuma and Cortés to argue that Western culture was superior to every culture in the entire world, which thus led him to reject multiculturalism as a false doctrine that placed all cultures on an equal footing.&lt;ref name="Hanson, Victor Davis 2001. p. 205"&gt;Hanson, Victor Davis ''Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise to Western Power'', New York: Random House, 2001. p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;
    
In [[New Zealand]] ([[Aotearoa]]), which is officially bi-cultural, multiculturalism has been seen as a threat to the [[Māori people|Maori]], and possibly an attempt by the New Zealand Government to undermine Maori demands for self determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Johnson |first = Jay T. |title = Indigeneity's challenges to the White Settler-State: creating a thirdspace for dynamic citizenship |journal = [[Alternatives: Global, Local, Political]] |volume = 33 |issue = 1 |pages = 29–52 |doi = 10.1177/030437540803300103 |date = January 2008 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Americas have been known to be some of the most multicultural geographical locations, as many of the times there is a diversity of language, religion, and ethnicities present. The South American country [[Brazil]] can also acclaim multiculturalism, and has undergone many changes in the past few decades. Brazil is a controversial country when is comes to defining a multicultural country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/07/18/the-most-and-least-culturally-diverse-countries-in-the-world/|title=A revealing map of the world’s most and least ethnically diverse countries|last=|first=|date=|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two views, in which the Harvard Institute of Economic Research states that Brazil has an intersection of many culture because of recent migration.

Furthermore, Brazil is a country who has made great strides to embrace migrant cultures, and with its increase of Afro-Descent people they have made changes to become more aware and welcoming. There has been an increase of awareness of [[anti-blackness]] and they have actively finding ways to combat racism in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=1f327fa4-9836-4bc5-995e-327ca3017228@pdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=87598842&amp;db=a9h|title=Blackness, Indigeneity, Multiculturalism and Genomics in Brazil, Colombia a...: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
[[File:Mexico City 335.jpg|thumb|Mexico City]]
[[Mexico]] has historically always been a multicultural country. After the betrayal of [[Hernán Cortés|Hernan Cortes]] to the Aztecs, the Spanish conquered the [[Aztec Empire]] and colonized indigenous people. They influenced the indigenous' religion, politics, culture and ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mexico1539.blogspot.com/2008/10/consecuencias-de-la-conquista-de-mexico.html|title=mas alla de la historia: Consecuencias de la conquista de mexico|last=México|first=Conquista De|date=2008-10-29|website=mas alla de la historia|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish opened schools in which they taught [[Christianity]], and the Spanish language which it eventually surpassed the indigenous dialects and languages, making it the most spoken language in Mexico. Mestizo was also born from the conquest, which meant being half-Indigenous and half-Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Index |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1932-ethnic-diversity-in-mexico |title=Ethnic diversity in Mexico : Mexico Travel |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In today's world "Mestizo" has become an umbrella term to those that are non-indigenous, which would include Asian Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022220348/http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/105/10503808.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-10-22|title=Wayback Machine|date=2013-10-22|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mexico City]] has recently been integrating rapidly, doing much better than many cities in a sample conducted by the Intercultural Cities Index (being the only non-European city, alongside [[Montreal]], on the index).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/culture/cities/index/Mexico_en.pdf |title=Microsoft Word – Mexico City PR rev[1&amp;#93;-1.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is an ethnically diverse country with a population composed of approximately 123 million in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Demographics of Mexico|date=2018-07-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Demographics_of_Mexico&amp;oldid=849915621|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a wide variety of ethnic groups, the major group being [[Mestizo]]s followed by [[Indigenous Mexicans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investigacionyciencia.es/revistas/investigacion-y-ciencia/matemticas-del-planeta-tierra-585/el-impacto-del-mestizaje-en-mxico-11442|title=El impacto del mestizaje en México|work=Investigación y Ciencia|access-date=2018-07-25|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many other ethnic groups such as [[Arab Mexicans]], [[Afro-Mexicans]], [[Asian Mexicans]] and [[Mexicans of European descent|White Mexicans]].

From the year 2000 to 2010, the number of people in Mexico that were born in another country doubled, reaching an amount of 961,121 people. Mostly coming from Guatemala and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/inegi/contenidos/espanol/prensa/contenidos/Articulos/sociodemograficas/nacidosenotropais.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427100913/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/inegi/contenidos/espanol/prensa/contenidos/Articulos/sociodemograficas/nacidosenotropais.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-27|title=Wayback Machine|date=2013-04-27|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is quickly becoming a [[melting pot]], with many immigrants coming into the country. It is considered to be a [[cradle of civilization]], which influences their multiculturalism and diversity, by having different civilizations influence them. A distinguishable trait of Mexico's culture is the [[mestizaje]] of its people, which caused the combination of Spanish influence, their indigenous roots while also adapting the culture traditions from their immigrants.

=== Peru ===
[[Peru]] is an exemplary country of multiculturalism, in 2016 the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática|INEI]] reported a total population of 31 million people. They share their borders with Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia, and have welcomed many immigrants into their country creating a diverse community.
[[File:Tambomachay, Cuzco, Perú, 2015-07-31, DD 93.JPG|thumb|Tambomachay, Cuzco, Peru]]
Peru is the home to [[Amerindians]] but after the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish Conquest]], the Spanish brought African, and Asian people as slaves to Peru creating a mix of ethnic groups. After slavery was no longer permitted in Peru, African-Peruvians and Asian-Peruvians have contributed to Peruvian culture in many ways. Today, Amerindians make up 45% of the population, [[mestizo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s 37%, [[White people|white]] 15% and 3% is composed by [[Black people|Black]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryreports.org/country/Peru/population.htm|title=Peru population.

Which attracted Italians, Portuguese, French and German people in look for some [[guano]] for their crops.

In the United States, multiculturalism is not clearly established in policy at the federal level, but ethnic diversity is common in both rural and urban areas.

Continuous mass immigration was a feature of the United States economy and society since the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Isaacs2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ann Katherine Isaacs|title=Immigration and emigration in historical perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5asNot0c5kwC&amp;pg=PA38|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-498-8|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absorption of the stream of immigrants became, in itself, a prominent feature of America's [[national myth]]. The idea of the [[melting pot]] is a [[metaphor]] that implies that all the immigrant cultures are mixed and amalgamated without state intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Zangwill, Israel. ''The Melting Pot,'' 1908.&lt;/ref&gt; The melting pot theory implied that each individual immigrant, and each group of immigrants, assimilated into American society at their own pace. This is different than multiculturalism as defined above, which does not include complete assimilation and integration.&lt;ref name="Suárez-OrozcoSuárez-Orozco2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marcelo M. Suárez-Orozco|author2=Carola Suárez-Orozco|title=The new immigration: an interdisciplinary reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a05uTxwIC4EC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-94916-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Americanized (and often stereotypical) version of the original nation's cuisine, and its holidays, survived.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The melting pot tradition co-exists with a belief in national unity, dating from the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|American founding fathers]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Providence has been pleased to give this one connected country to one united people – a people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language, professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of government, very similar in their manners and customs... This country and this people seem to have been made for each other, and it appears as if it was the design of Providence, that an inheritance so proper and convenient for a band of brethren, united to each other by the strongest ties, should never be split into a number of unsocial, jealous, and alien sovereignties.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Jay]], ''First American Supreme Court Chief Justice'', [[Federalist No. 2|Federalist Paper No. 2]]'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a [[philosophy]], multiculturalism began as part of the [[pragmatism]] movement at the end of the nineteenth century in [[Europe]] and the United States, then as [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political]] and [[cultural pluralism]] at the turn of the twentieth.&lt;ref name="CaputiFoster2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Caputi|author2=Heather Foster|author3=Linda L.

Philosophers, psychologists and historians and early sociologists such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[George Santayana]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[John Dewey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[Alain Locke]] developed concepts of cultural pluralism, from which emerged what we understand today as multiculturalism. In ''Pluralistic Universe'' (1909), William James espoused the idea of a "[[plural society]]." James saw pluralism as "crucial to the formation of philosophical and social [[humanism]] to help build a better, more egalitarian society.&lt;ref name=Boening&gt;{{cite news |last=Boening |first=Astrid B. |title=Euro-Islam&amp;nbsp;– A Constructivist Idea or a Concept of the English School? |newspaper=European Union Miami Analysis (EUMA) |location= |volume=4

The educational approach to multiculturalism has since spread to the [[grade school]] system, as school systems try to rework their curricula to introduce students to diversity earlier – often on the grounds that it is important for minority students to see themselves represented in the classroom.&lt;ref name="Volk2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terese M.

=== Venezuela ===
Venezuela is the home to a variety of ethnic groups, with an estimated population of 32 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/venezuela-population/|title=Venezuela Population (2018) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their population is composed of approximately 68% Mestizo, which means of mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Venezuela.html|title=Venezuela|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan culture is mainly composed by the mixture of their indigenous people, Spanish and African.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/jenny78/venezuela-sociedad-multietnica-y-pluricultural|title=Venezuela sociedad multietnica y pluricultural|website=www.slideshare.net|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a heavy influence of Spaniard culture due to the Spanish Conquest, which influence their religion, language, traditions.

The [[European Union]] is facing unprecedented demographic changes (an aging population, low birth rates, changing family structures and migration). According to the European Commission, it is important, both at EU and national level, to review and adapt existing policies. Following a public debate, a 2006 EU policy paper identified five key policy responses to manage demographic change, among them receiving and integrating migrants into Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=502&amp;langId=en|title=Demographic analysis|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, Europe has always been a mixture of Latin, Slavic, Germanic, Uralic, Celtic, Hellenic, Illyrian, Thracian and other cultures influenced by the importation of Jewish, Christian, Muslim and other belief systems; although the continent was supposedly unified by the super-position of Imperial Roman Christianity, it is accepted that geographic and cultural differences continued from antiquity into the modern age.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert C. Ostergren|author2=Mathias Le Bossé|title=The Europeans: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA226|date=7 March 2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-384-6|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the ideology of [[nationalism]] transformed the way Europeans thought about the [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref name="OstergrenBossé2011" /&gt; Existing states were broken up and new ones created; the new [[nation-states]] were founded on the principle that each [[nation]] is entitled to its own [[sovereignty]] and to engender, protect, and preserve its own unique culture and history. Unity, under this ideology, is seen as an essential feature of the nation and the nation-state; unity of descent, unity of culture, unity of language, and often unity of religion. The nation-state constitutes a culturally [[wikt:Homogeneity|homogeneous]] society, although some national movements recognised regional differences.

Where cultural unity was insufficient, it was encouraged and enforced by the state.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt; The nineteenth century nation-states developed an array of policies – the most important was compulsory [[primary education]] in the [[national language]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guntram Henrik Herb |author2=David H. Kaplan |title=Nations and Nationalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UoQ-ueHjdEC&amp;pg=PA522|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-907-8|page=522|date=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language itself was often standardised by a linguistic academy, and regional languages were ignored or suppressed. Some nation-states pursued violent policies of [[cultural assimilation]] and even [[ethnic cleansing]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

Some countries in the European Union have introduced policies for "social cohesion", "integration", and (sometimes) "assimilation". The policies include:

* Compulsory courses and/or tests on [[historiography and nationalism|national history]], on the [[constitution]] and the [[legal system]] (e.g., the computer-based test for individuals seeking naturalisation in the UK named [[Life in the United Kingdom test]])
* Introduction of an official national history, such as the national [[Canon of Dutch Literature|canon]] defined for the [[Netherlands]] by the [[Frits van Oostrom|van Oostrom]] Commission,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entoen.nu/ |title=Official Web site |publisher=Entoen.nu |accessdate=2010-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion of that history (e.g., by exhibitions about [[Folk hero|national heroes]])
* Tests designed to elicit "unacceptable" values. In [[Baden-Württemberg]], immigrants are asked what they would do if their son says he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] (the desired answer is that they would accept it&lt;ref&gt;BBC report at [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4655240.stm News.BBC.co.uk], full list of questions in German at [http://www.taz.de/index.php?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/01/04/a0154 TAZ.de]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Other countries have instituted policies which encourage cultural separation.&lt;ref name="ReitzBreton2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey G.

Sweden was the first country to adopt an official policy of multiculturalism in Europe. In May 1975, a unanimous Swedish parliament passed an act on a new multiculturalist immigrant and ethnic minority policy put forward by the [[social democracy|social democratic]] government, that explicitly rejected the ideal ethnic homogeneity and the policy of assimilation. The three main principles of the new policy were equality, partnership and freedom of choice. The explicit policy aim of the freedom of choice principle was to create the opportunity for minority groups in Sweden to retain their own languages and cultures. From the mid-1970s, the goal of enabling the preservation of minorities and creating a positive attitude towards the new officially endorsed multicultural society among the majority population became incorporated into the Swedish constitution as well as cultural, educational and media policies. Despite the anti-multiculturalist protestations of the [[Sweden Democrats]], multiculturalism remains official policy in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The multicultural moment: the history of the idea and politics of multiculturalism in Sweden in comparative, transnational and biographical context, 1964–1975|last=Wickström|first=Mats|publisher=Åbo Akademi|year=2015|isbn=978-952-12-3133-9|location=http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe201501071068|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study which involved questionnaires sent to 5,000 people, showed that less than a quarter of the respondents (23%) wanted to live in areas characterised by cultural, ethnic and social diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|title=Svenskar vill ha inhägnat boende {{!}} SvD|last=TT|first=|date=|work=SvD.se|access-date=2018-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322170850/http://www.svd.se/svenskar-vill-ha-inhagnat-boende|archive-date=22 March 2016|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published by [[Gävle University College]] showed that 38% of the population never interacted with anyone from Africa and 20% never interacted with any non-Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|title=Mångfaldsbarometern 2014|last=|first=|publisher=Gävle University College|year=October 2014|isbn=|location=|pages=7–8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621094211/https://www.hig.se/download/18.4db66897149b264e1ba4df24/1417115797086/mangfald.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that while physical distance to the country of origin, also religion and other cultural expressions are significant for the perception of cultural familiarity. In general, peoples with [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion were perceived to be culturally closer than peoples from Muslim countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2017 study by [[Lund University]] also found that social trust was lower among people in regions with high levels of past non-Nordic immigration than among people in regions with low levels of past immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McShane|first1=Karl|date=2017|title=Getting used to diversity?

Indonesia's national motto, ''[[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]]'' ("Unity in Diversity" lit. "many, yet one") enshrined in [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] the national ideology, articulates the diversity that shapes the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Geography of Indonesia | publisher=Indonesia.go.id | url=http://www.indonesia.go.id/en/indonesia-glance/geography-indonesia|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government nurtures and promotes the diversity of Indonesian local culture; adopting a pluralist approach.

Due to migration within Indonesia (as part of government [[transmigration program]]s or otherwise), there are significant populations of ethnic groups who reside outside of their traditional regions. The Javanese for example, moved from their traditional homeland in Java to the other parts of the archipelago. The expansion of the Javanese and their influence throughout Indonesia has raised the issue of [[Javanization]], although [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], Madurese, [[Bugis]] and Makassar people, as a result of their ''merantau'' (migrating) culture are also quite widely distributed throughout the Indonesian archipelago, while [[Chinese Indonesian]]s can be found in most urban areas. Because of [[urbanization]], major Indonesian cities such as [[Greater Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bandung]], [[Palembang]], [[Medan]] and [[Makassar]] have attracted large numbers of Indonesians from various ethnic, cultural and religious backgrounds. Jakarta in particular has almost all Indonesian ethnic groups represented.

However, this transmigration program and close interactions between people of different cultural backgrounds caused socio-cultural problems, as the inter-ethnics interactions have not always been conducted harmoniously. After the [[Post-Suharto era|fall of Suharto]] in 1998 into the 2000s, numbers of inter-ethnic and inter-religious clashes erupted in Indonesia. Like the clashes between native [[Dayak people|Dayak]] tribes against [[Madurese people|Madurese]] transmigrants in [[Kalimantan]] during [[Sambas riots]] in 1999&lt;ref name="hrw"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=February 28, 2001|title=Indonesia: The Violence in Central Kalimantan (Borneo)|url=https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/asia/borneo0228.htm|accessdate=2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sampit conflict]] in 2001.&lt;ref name="flashpoint"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=June 28, 2004|accessdate=2008-08-13|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints: Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also clashes between Muslims and Christians, such as [[Poso riots|violence erupted in Poso]] between 1998 and into 2000,&lt;ref name="BBC flashpoints"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = BBC News| date = 28 June 2004| title = Indonesia flashpoints: Sulawesi| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3812737.stm| accessdate = 13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maluku sectarian conflict|violences in Maluku]] between 1999 and into 2002.&lt;ref name="timedirty"&gt;{{cite news|last=Elegant|first=Simon|title=Indonesia's Dirty Little Holy War|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,187655,00.html|accessdate=31 March 2011|newspaper=Time|date=17 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Indonesia today still struggles and has managed to maintain unity and inter-cultural harmony, through a national adherence of pro-pluralism policy of Pancasila; promoted and enforced by the government and its people.

[[Chinese Indonesians]] are the largest foreign-origin minority that has resided in Indonesia for generations. Despite centuries of acculturation with native Indonesians, because of their disproportionate influence on Indonesian economy, and alleged question of national loyalty, Chinese Indonesians have suffered [[Discrimination against Chinese Indonesians|discrimination]]. The [[Suharto]] ''Orde Baru'' or New Order adopted a forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] policy; which indicated that Chinese cultural elements were unacceptable.{{sfn|Tan|2008|p=24}} Chinese Indonesians were forced to adopt [[Chinese Indonesian surname|Indonesian-sounding names]], and the use of Chinese culture and language was banned. The violence targeting Chinese Indonesians erupted during [[Fall of Suharto#Riots of 13–14 May|riots in 1998.]] As the looting and destruction took place, a number of Chinese Indonesians, as well as looters, were killed. The Chinese Indonesians were treated as the scapegoat of [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis]], a result of ongoing discrimination and segregation policies enforced during Suharto's New Order regime. Soon after the fourth Indonesian President, [[Abdurrahman Wahid]] came into power in 1999, he quickly abolished some of the discriminatory laws in efforts to promote acceptance and to improve inter-racial relationships, such as abolishing the ban on Chinese culture; allowing Chinese traditions to be practised freely. Two years later President [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] declared that the [[Chinese New Year]] (''{{lang|id|Imlek}}'') would be marked as a [[Public holidays in Indonesia|national holiday]] from 2003.{{sfn|Setiono|2003|p=1099}} Today, Chinese Indonesians enjoy the same rights as other Indonesians.

According to [[Harvard University]] professor [[Theodore Bestor]], Japan does look very homogeneous from a distant perspective, but in fact there are a number of very significant minority groups – ethnically different minority groups – in Japan today, such as the already mentioned [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuan people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/at/contemp_japan/cjp_society_02.html |title=Contemporary Japan: Japanese Society |publisher=Asian Topics, [[Columbia University]] |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malaysia]] is a multiethnic country, with [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malays]] making up the majority, close to 58% of the population. About 25% of the population are [[Chinese Malaysian|Malaysians of Chinese descent]]. [[Indian Malaysian|Malaysians of Indian descent]] comprise about 7% of the population. The remaining 10% comprises:
* Native [[East Malaysia]]ns, namely [[Bajau]], [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian]], [[Bidayuh]], [[Dusun]], [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Kadazan]], [[Kedayan]], [[Melanau]], [[Orang Ulu]], [[Sarawakian Malay]]s, etc.
* Other native tribes of [[Peninsular Malaysia]], such as the [[Orang Asli]] and Siamese people, and
* Non-native tribes of Peninsular Malaysia such as the [[Chettiar]]s, the [[Peranakan]] and the Portuguese.

The [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]] or NEP serves as a form of racial equalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6237328.stm Malaysia fury at EU envoy remarks], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes structural changes in various aspects of life from education to economic to social integration. Established after the [[13 May Incident|13 May racial riots]] of 1969, it sought to address the significant imbalance in the economic sphere where the minority [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] population had substantial control over commercial activity in the country.

The [[Malay Peninsula]] has a long history of international trade contacts, influencing its ethnic and religious composition. Predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] before the 18th century, the ethnic composition changed dramatically when the British introduced new industries, and imported Chinese and Indian labor. Several regions in the then [[British Malaya]] such as [[Penang]], [[Malacca]] and [[Singapore]] became Chinese dominated. Until the riots 1969, co-existence between the three ethnicities (and other minor groups) was largely peaceful, although the three main racial groups for the most part lived in separate communities – the Malays in the villages, the Chinese in the urban areas, and the Indians in the towns and plantation. More Malays however have moved into the cities since the 1970s, and the proportion of the non-Malays have been decreasing continually, especially the Chinese, due in large part to lower birth-rate and emigration as a result of [[institutionalized discrimination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |title=Honey, I shrunk the Chinese! |publisher=CPI |date=9 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525132129/http://english.cpiasia.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1804:honey-i-shrunk-the-chinese-&amp;catid=198:helen-ang&amp;Itemid=156 |archivedate=25 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding independence of the [[Federation of Malaya]], a [[social contract (Malaysia)|social contract]] was negotiated as the basis of a new society. The contract as reflected in the [[Constitution of Malaysia|1957 Malayan Constitution and the 1963 Malaysian Constitution]] states that the immigrant groups are granted citizenship, and Malays' special rights are guaranteed. This is often referred to the [[Bumiputra]] policy.

These [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] policies have come under pressure from racialist Malay parties, who oppose perceived subversion of Malay rights. The issue is sometimes related to the controversial [[status of religious freedom in Malaysia]].

===Singapore===
Because of immigration, [[Singapore]] has a Chinese majority population with significant minority populations of [[Malay people|Malays]] and Indians (predominantly [[Tamil people|Tamils]]). Other prominent smaller groups include [[Peranakans]] and [[Eurasians in Singapore|Eurasians]]. Besides [[English Language|English]], Singapore recognizes three other languages—[[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. English was established as the medium of instruction in schools during the 1960s and 1970s and is the language of trade and government while the other three languages are taught as second languages ("mother tongues"). Besides being a [[multilingualism|multilingual]] country, Singapore also acknowledges festivals celebrated by the three main ethnic communities.

During British colonial rule, ethnic enclaves such as [[Geylang]], [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]], and [[Little India, Singapore|Little India]] were enforced. Presently &lt;sup&gt;(2010)&lt;/sup&gt;, remnants of colonial ethnic concentration still exist but housing in Singapore is governed by the Ethnic Integration Policy, which ensures an even ethnic distribution throughout Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) In [[Housing and Development Board|Housing Development Boards of Singapore website]]. Retrieved: November 18, 2010 from [http://www.hdb.gov.sg/fi10/fi10296p.nsf/PressReleases/C515273FA068DD58482576DD00169155?OpenDocument ''Policy Changes To Support An Inclusive And Cohesive Home''].&lt;/ref&gt; A similar policy exists in politics as all [[Group Representation Constituency|Group Representation Constituencies]] are required to field at least one candidate from an ethnic minority.

===South Korea===
[[South Korea]] remains a relatively homogenous country ethnically, linguistically, and culturally.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://aparc.stanford.edu/news/koreas_ethnic_nationalism_is_a_source_of_both_pride_and_prejudice_according_to_giwook_shin_20060802/ Korea's ethnic nationalism is a source of both pride and prejudice, according to Gi-Wook Shin]". The Korea Herald. August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Foreigners, expatriates, and immigrants are often rejected by the mainstream South Korean society and face discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19991013000846/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/CMTS/MonoPaper3-13.html The Life Instability of Intermarried Japanese Women in Korea]" (1999), Eung-Ryul Kim (Korea University and University of Southern California, The Center for Multiethnic and Transnational Studies)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the word "multiculturalism" is increasingly heard in South Korea. In 2007, Han Geon-Soo, Professor of Cultural Anthropology at [[Kangwon National University]], published an article entitled "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", noting: "As the increase of foreign migrants in [South] Korea transforms a single-ethnic homogeneous [South] Korean society into multiethnic and multicultural one, [the South] Korean government and the civil society pay close attention to multiculturalism as an alternative value to their policy and social movement." He argued, however, that "the current discourses and concerns on multiculturalism in [South] Korea" lacked "the constructive and analytical concepts for transforming a society".&lt;ref&gt;Han Geon-Soo, "Multicultural Korea: Celebration or Challenge of Multiethnic Shift in Contemporary Korea?", ''Korea Journal'', Vol. 47 No. 4, Winter 2007, pp. 32–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Stephen Castles of the International Migration Institute argued:
:"Korea no longer has to decide whether it wants to become a multicultural society. It made that decision years ago – perhaps unconsciously – when it decided to be a full participant in the emerging global economy. It confirmed that decision when it decided to actively recruit foreign migrants to meet the economic and demographic needs of a fast-growing society. Korea is faced by a different decision today: what type of multicultural society does it want to be?"&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Castles, [http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf "Will Labour Migration lead to a Multicultural Society in Korea?", Global Human Resources Forum 2007 / International Migration Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725111757/http://www.imi.ox.ac.uk/pdfs/SC%20paper%20on%20MC%20soc%20for%20GHFR%20Korea%202007.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Korea Times]]'' suggested in 2009 that South Korea was likely to become a multicultural society.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/10/123_57884.html "Multiculturalism Likely to Prevail in Korea"], Lee Hyo-sik, ''Korea Times'', December 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, an opinion editorial written by Peter Underwood for the ''[[JoongAng Ilbo]]'' stated: "Media in [South] Korea is abuzz with the new era of multiculturalism. With more than one million foreigners in [South] Korea, 2 percent of the population comes from other cultures." He further opined:
:"If you stay too long, Koreans become uncomfortable with you. [...] Having a two percent foreign population unquestionably causes ripples, but having one million temporary foreign residents does not make Korea a multicultural society. [...] In many ways, this homogeneity is one of Korea’s greatest strengths. Shared values create harmony. Sacrifice for the nation is a given. Difficult and painful political and economic initiatives are endured without discussion or debate. It is easy to anticipate the needs and behavior of others. It is the cornerstone that has helped Korea survive adversity. But there is a downside, too. [...] Koreans are immersed in their culture and are thus blind to its characteristics and quirks. Examples of group think are everywhere. Because Koreans share values and views, they support decisions even when they are obviously bad. Multiculturalism will introduce contrasting views and challenge existing assumptions. While it will undermine the homogeneity, it will enrich Koreans with a better understanding of themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Underwood |first=Peter |date=26 August 2010 |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |title=Multiculturalism in Korea |work=JoongAng Ilbo |location=South Korea |publisher=JoongAng Ilbo |accessdate=2 September 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902022520/http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925120 |archivedate=September 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
[[Turkey]] is a country that borders both Europe and Asia, therefore placing it as the multicultural intersection for Eurasia – thus including people of Armenian, Jewish, Kurds, Arabs, Turks, and Persians decent. This entail influence of Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim influence leaving Turkey to be a multicultural country based on location.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauf|first=Imam Feisal Abdul|date=2005|title=MULTICULTURALISMS: Western, Muslim and Future|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24461190|journal=CrossCurrents|volume=55|issue=1|pages=100–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years there has been an increase of diversity acceptance in Turkey, mainly because there was fear of losing values of the non-existent [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kaya|first=Ayhan|title=Multiculturalism and Minorities in Turkey|date=2013|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20|work=Challenging Multiculturalism|pages=297–316|series=European Models of Diversity|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|doi=10.3366/j.ctt20q22fw.20#page_scan_tab_contents|isbn=9780748664573|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just after the turn of the century, Turkey has embraced its multicultural location and has even began to influence other countries. With Turkey having roots of Islam they have been provided a path for Islam to be accepted into neighboring countries in Europe.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

=== South Africa ===
South Africa is the fifth-most populous country and one of the most developed countries in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-10-most-populated-countries-in-africa.html|title=The 10 Most Populated Countries in Africa|work=WorldAtlas|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa also officially recognises 11 languages including English, making it third behind Bolivia and India in most official languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|title=Census 2011 Census in Brief|last=|first=|date=2015-05-13|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513171240/http://www.statssa.gov.za/census/census_2011/census_products/Census_2011_Census_in_brief.pdf|archive-date=2015-05-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most common languages are Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans. Though South Africa's cultural traditions may decline as it becomes more and more Westernised, it is still known for its diverse culture.

===Cameroon===
Officially known as the Republic of Cameroon, [[Cameroon]] is found in [[central Africa]] consisting of a diverse geographical and cultural area that makes it one of the most diverse countries known today. Ranging from mountains, deserts, and rainforests, to coast-lands and savanna grasslands, its diverse geography makes a large diverse population possible. This diverse geography resembles Africa as a whole and due to this, most people commonly label Cameroon as “Africa in Miniature”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mbenda|first=Huguette Gaelle Ngassa|last2=Awasthi|first2=Gauri|last3=Singh|first3=Poonam K|last4=Gouado|first4=Inocent|last5=Das|first5=Aparup|date=2014-07-16|title=Does malaria epidemiology project Cameroon as ‘Africa in miniature’?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y|journal=Journal of Biosciences|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=727–738|doi=10.1007/s12038-014-9451-y|issn=0250-5991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americas

==== Demographics and Official Languages ====
Before Cameroon’s independence, it was under British and French colonial rule from 1916-1961.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Upon gaining [[sovereignty]], a major colonial influence was evident, having both English and French become the national language to roughly 25,000,000 Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/|title=World Population Prospects - Population Division - United Nations|website=esa.un.org|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhidin_Mulalic/publication/325217271_Perceptions_of_Turkish_Cultural_Diplomacy_in_Bosnia-Herzegovina/links/5afe90e8458515e9a5765501/Perceptions-of-Turkish-Cultural-Diplomacy-in-Bosnia-Herzegovina.pdf#page=261|title=Can Bilingualism Survive in Cameroon?|last=Asanga Fon|first=Nguh Nwei|date=2018-07-26|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these two major languages, a new language consisting of a mixture of French, English, and [[Cameroonian Pidgin English|Pidgin]] known as [[Camfranglais|Frananglais]] gained popularity among Cameroonian residents.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newuh.blog/2012/12/13/cameroon-africa-in-miniature-in-what-sense/|title=Cameroon: Africa in Miniature – In what Sense?|date=2012-12-13|work=KINGSLEY SHETEH'S BLOG|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous Languages ====
Although these three languages are the most common in Cameroon, there are still approximately 273 [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] languages being spoken throughout the country, making it not only culturally diverse but linguistically as well.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CM|title=Cameroon|last=|first=|date=|website=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who speak these indigenous languages are people from [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], Sudanic, [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]], [[Wodaabe]] (or [[Mbororo]]) and even primitive hunter-gatherer groups known as [[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon|title=Cameroon {{!}} Culture, History, &amp; People|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwgia.org/en/cameroon|title=Cameroon|website=www.iwgia.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Indigenous Peoples' Rights ====
Although native to Cameroonian land, they faced constant discrimination much like other indigenous groups around the world. The United Nations General Assembly ([[United Nations General Assembly|UNGA]]) adopted the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples ([[UNDRIP]]) in 2007. What this allowed was the protection of land and resource rights and prevented others from [[wiktionary:Exploitation|exploiting]] or violating them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-12-01|title=Indigenous peoples’ land rights in Cameroon: progress to date and possible futures|url=http://pubs.iied.org/17448IIED/|journal=Briefing|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a group of indigenous Baka and Bagyeli groups united to form Gbabandi. Gbabandi allowed these indigenous groups to have a form of representation and a declared list of requirements that people of Cameroon had to abide by. Among these requirements were guaranteed land rights, peoples' consent to the usage of their sacred land, traditional chiefs and the ability to participate in "local, regional, and national levels" of political and economic matters. As a result, this established a sense of justice and acknowledgment among indigenous groups in Cameroon and posed for future battles for indigenous peoples' rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/rights-land-natural-resources/news-article/2017/declaration-land-rights-gbabandi-platform-cameroon|title=Declaration on land rights from the Gbabandi Platform, Cameroon {{!}} Forest Peoples Programme|website=www.forestpeoples.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morocco ===
[[Morocco]] is located in Northern Africa near the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which then connects to Europe. Morocco is a prime location for a multiculturalism, as it has much influence by neighbouring countries. Morocco has been invaded and colonised by many countries throughout the centuries, which means that they have experienced an influence of many cultures. Some of these invaders include the [[French people|French]], the [[Spaniards]], the [[Arabs]], and several more countries.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This has led to the country becoming not only multicultural, but also multilingual. Officially the language of Morocco is [[Arabic]], but throughout the country many people speak, French, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Arabic, and most recently acknowledging [[Berber languages|Berber]] as a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ennaji|first=Moha|date=2014|title=Recognizing the Berber Language in Morocco: A Step for Democratization|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43773631|journal=Georgetown Journal of International Affairs|volume=15|issue=2|pages=93–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much outside influence of multiculturalism in Morocco, but they have embraced these cultures.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=1f327fa4-9836-4bc5-995e-327ca3017228@pdc-v-sessmgr05&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=54652194&amp;db=a9h|title=Multiculturalism, Gender and Political Participation in Morocco: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[New Zealand]] is a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] Oceanic country that adopted its multicultural policies post World War II. The country used to have immigration policies similar to Australia's [[White Australia Policy]],&lt;ref&gt;Socidad Peruana de Medicina Intensiva (SOPEMI) (2000). ''Trends in international migration: continuous reporting system on migration''. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. pp. 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it would later follow suit with Australia in the 1970s and adopt similar multicultural policies.

The '''NAFTA superhighway''' is a term sometimes used informally to refer to certain existing and proposed highways intended to link  [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Jerome Corsi | title=Bush Administration Quietly Plans NAFTA Super Highway | date=June 12, 2006 | work=Human Events | url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=15497 | accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mark Robinowitz |title=Peak Traffic: Planning NAFTA Superhighways at the End of the Age of Oil |url=http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/051006_peak_traffic.shtml |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091008115439/http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/051006_peak_traffic.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 8, 2009 |work=From the Wilderness |date=May 10, 2006 |accessdate=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ron Paul | title=The NAFTA Superhighway | date=October 31, 2006 | url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul349.html | work=Lewrockwell | accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term has not been used publicly by governments in an official policy context, there are some dissident beliefs about this appellation that are associated with [[conspiracy theories]] regarding alleged secret plans to undermine U.S. sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=December 1, 2007 | title=Highway To Hell?

NAFTA Superhighway a reality | date=December 5, 2007 | accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Development of these routes is supported by the [[North American SuperCorridor Coalition]] as part of a NASCO Corridor.  These include [[Interstate 35]] from Laredo, Texas to the Canadian border that downgrades to a non-freeway route ending at Thunder Bay, Ontario, and [[Interstate 29]], a spur that also downgrades to a regular highway at the border and continues to Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The term is also sometimes used to describe some additional partly-built or proposed highways and [[supercorridor]]s which are intended to connect the road systems of the three nations of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) [[trade bloc]]. One of these is Interstate 69 that is mostly complete from the Canada–US border at Port Huron, Michigan to western Kentucky. In Canada, Ontario Highway 402 and other freeways in the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor can be considered a northeastward extension of this version the NAFTA superhighway. To the southwest, from western Kentucky to the Mexican border, there is currently no single superhighway yet completed. Pending completion of I-69, the main highway links to Mexico follow parts of US routes 45 and 51 from Kentucky to western Tennessee, I-155 from Tennessee to Missouri, parts of Interstates 55 and 40 from Missouri to Arkansas, and I-30 from Arkansas to the Texas stretch of I-35 that continues south to the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas. The uncompleted section of I-69 south of Kentucky is expected to eventually continue southwestward to the Texas Gulf Coast. It will have a spur linking to the original Pan-American route through Mexico to Laredo, and additional branches extending to the Mexican spurs that cross the border at Pharr, Texas, and Brownsville, Texas.

The [[CANAMEX Corridor]] is another major route that links the three NAFTA countries.  It includes Mexican Federal Highway 15, American [[Interstate 19|I-19]] and [[Interstate 15|I-15]], and [[Alberta highway 2]]. The route is sometimes referenced as part of the NAFTA superhighway concept, but it already has a name of its own.  [[Interstate 94]] is an important east-west freeway that indirectly links the CANAMEX Corridor with the I-29 and I-35 routes of the 'NAFTA Superhighway' and the Windsor-Quebec City Corridor.  The Canadian route links with the I-69 and I-94 freeways at the same Port Huron border crossing.

'''Nguyễn Dư''' ([[chữ Hán]]: 阮餘), also called '''Nguyễn Dữ''' (阮與), was a 16th-century [[Han Tu]] poet of Vietnam known for the [[Truyền kỳ mạn lục]] (傳奇漫錄, ''Collection of Strange Tales'').&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M.

Nguyễn Dữ was born in Đỗ Tùng village, Gia Phúc district, Hải Dương province, Việt Nam. He was a student of Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm (1491-1585), a well-known Vietnamese educator, philosopher, and poet. 

[[Truyền kỳ mạn lục]] was his only publication.&lt;ref name="Truyền Kỳ Mạn Lục by Nguyễn Dữ"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=goodreads|title=Truyền Kỳ Mạn Lục by Nguyễn Dữ|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17730518-truy-n-k-m-n-l-c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Johannes Tillich''' (August 20, 1886&amp;nbsp;– October 22, 1965) was a [[German Americans|German-American]] [[Christian existentialism|Christian existentialist]] [[philosopher]] and [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] who is widely regarded as one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor-first = Carl E | editor-last = Braaten | first =Ted | last = Peters |publisher=Fortress Press |year = 1995 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Xax15MpLyjYC&amp;lpg=PA392 | at = backjacket | type = review | quote = The current generation of students has heard only the names of Barth, Brunner, Bultmann, Bonhoeffer, Tillich, and the Niebuhrs. | accessdate = 2011-01-01 |title=A map of twentieth-century theology: readings from Karl Barth to radical pluralism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the general public, he is best known for his works ''The Courage to Be'' (1952) and ''Dynamics of Faith'' (1957), which introduced issues of theology and modern culture to a general readership. In academic theology, he is best known for his major three-volume work ''Systematic Theology'' (1951–63) in which he developed his "method of correlation", an approach of exploring the symbols of Christian [[revelation]] as answers to the problems of human existence raised by contemporary [[Existentialism|existential]] philosophical analysis.&lt;ref name = "CODWR"&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tillich, Paul Johannes Oskar | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions | editor-first = John | editor-last = Bowker | year = 2000 | series = Oxford Reference Online | publisher = Oxford University Press}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =britannica&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tillich, Paul | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 2008 | edition = online | accessdate = 17 February 2008 | url = http://search.eb.com/eb/article-7265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Tillich was born on August 20, 1886, in the small village of [[Starzeddel]] (Starosiedle), [[Province of Brandenburg]], which was [[Former eastern territories of Germany|then part of Germany]]. He was the oldest of three children, with two sisters: Johanna (born 1888, died 1920) and Elisabeth (born 1893). Tillich's [[Prussia]]n father Johannes Tillich was a conservative [[Lutheran]] pastor of the [[Evangelical State Church of Prussia's older Provinces]]; his mother Mathilde Dürselen was from the [[Rhineland]] and more liberal.

When Tillich was four, his father became  [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] of a diocese in [[Bad Schönfliess]] (now [[Trzcińsko-Zdrój]], Poland), a town of three thousand, where Tillich began secondary school (''[[:de:Elementarschule|Elementarschule]]'').  In 1898, Tillich was sent to [[Königsberg in der Neumark]] (now [[Chojna]], Poland) to begin his ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' schooling. He was billeted in a boarding house and experienced a loneliness that he sought to overcome by reading the Bible while encountering [[Humanism|humanistic]] ideas at school.&lt;ref name ="britannica" /&gt;

In 1900, Tillich's father was transferred to [[Berlin]], resulting in Tillich switching in 1901 to a Berlin school, from which he graduated in 1904. Before his graduation, however, his mother died of [[cancer]] in September 1903, when Tillich was 17. Tillich attended several universities — the [[University of Berlin]] beginning in 1904, the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1905, and the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] from 1905 to 1907.  He received his Doctor of Philosophy degree at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1911 and his Licentiate of Theology degree at Halle-Wittenberg in 1912.&lt;ref name=britannica /&gt; During his time at university, he became a member of the [[Wingolf]] in Berlin, Tübingen and Halle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Gesamtverzeichnis des Wingolf | place = Lichtenberg | year = 1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, 1912, Tillich was ordained as a Lutheran minister in the Province of Brandenburg. On 28 September 1914 he married Margarethe ("Grethi") Wever (1888–1968), and in October he joined the [[Imperial German Army]] as a [[chaplain]] during [[World War I]].  Grethi deserted Tillich in 1919 after an affair that produced a child not fathered by Tillich; the two then divorced.{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976}}{{Page needed | date = October 2014}}  Tillich's academic career began after the war; he became a Privatdozent of Theology at the [[University of Berlin]], a post he held from 1919 to 1924.  On his return from the war he had met Hannah Werner-Gottschow, then married and pregnant.&lt;ref name = ptlover&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908007-1,00.html | title = Paul Tillich, Lover | newspaper = Time | date = October 8, 1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1924 they married; it was the second marriage for both. She later wrote a book entitled ''From Time to Time'' about their life together, which included their commitment to open marriage, upsetting to some; despite this, they remained together into old age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Wolfgang Saxon | title = Hannah Tillich, 92, Christian Theologian's Widow |work=New York Times |date=October 30, 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1924 to 1925, Tillich served as a Professor of Theology at the [[University of Marburg]], where he began to develop his systematic theology, teaching a course on it during the last of his three terms. From 1925 until 1929, Tillich was a Professor of Theology at the [[Dresden University of Technology]] and the [[University of Leipzig]]. He held the same post at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]] from 1929 to 1933. Paul Tillich was in conversation with [[Erich Przywara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Thomas | last = O'Meara | title = Paul Tillich and Erich Przywara at Davos | journal = Gregorianum | volume = 87 | year = 2006 | pages = 227–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the University of Frankfurt, Tillich gave public lectures and speeches throughout Germany that brought him into conflict with the [[Nazi]] movement.  When [[Adolf Hitler]] became German Chancellor in 1933, Tillich was dismissed from his position.  [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] visited Germany in the summer of 1933 and, already impressed with Tillich's writings, contacted Tillich upon learning of his dismissal. Niebuhr urged Tillich to join the faculty at New York City's [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]]; Tillich accepted.{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976}}{{Sfn | Tillich | 1964 | p = 16}}

At the age of 47, Tillich moved with his family to the United States. This meant learning English, the language in which Tillich would eventually publish works such as the ''Systematic Theology''.  From 1933 until 1955 he taught at Union Theological Seminary, where he began as a Visiting Professor of [[Philosophy of Religion]].  During 1933–34 he was also a Visiting Lecturer in Philosophy at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name = "britannica" /&gt;

The Fellowship of Socialist Christians was organized in the early 1930s by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and others with similar views.
Later it changed its name to Frontier Fellowship and then to Christian Action.
The main supporters of the Fellowship in the early days included Tillich, [[Eduard Heimann]], [[Sherwood Eddy]] and [[Rose Terlin]]. 
In its early days the group thought capitalist individualism was incompatible with Christian ethics.
Although not Communist, the group acknowledged [[Karl Marx]]'s social philosophy.&lt;ref name=Stone115&gt;{{citation|page=115 |last=Stone|first=Ronald H.|title=Professor Reinhold Niebuhr: A Mentor to the Twentieth Century |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypy5Uz4qm5YC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=2016-03-14 |date=1992-01-01|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-25390-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Johannes Tillich's gravestone in the Paul Tillich Park, New Harmony, Indiana.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Tillich's gravestone in the Paul Tillich Park, New Harmony, Indiana.]]
Tillich acquired [[Tenure (academic)|tenure]] at the Union Theological Seminary in 1937, and in 1940 he was promoted to Professor of [[Philosophical Theology]] and became an American citizen.&lt;ref name = "britannica" /&gt;
At Union, Tillich earned his reputation, publishing a series of books that outlined his particular synthesis of Protestant Christian theology and existential philosophy.  He published ''On the Boundary'' in 1936; ''The Protestant Era'', a collection of his essays, in 1948; and ''The Shaking of the Foundations'', the first of three volumes of his sermons, also in 1948. His collections of sermons would give Tillich a broader audience than he had yet experienced.

His most heralded achievements though, were the 1951 publication of volume one of ''Systematic Theology'' which brought Tillich academic acclaim, and the 1952 publication of ''The Courage to Be''. The first volume of the systematic theology series prompted an invitation to give the prestigious [[Gifford lectures]] during 1953–54 at the [[University of Aberdeen]]. The latter book, called "his masterpiece",{{Sfn | Pauck | Wilhelm | Marion | 1976 | p = 225}} was based on his 1950 [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship]] and reached a wide general readership.&lt;ref name = britannica /&gt;

These works led to an appointment at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1955, where he became one of the University's five University Professors – the five highest ranking professors at Harvard.  He was primarily a professor of undergraduates because Harvard did not have a department of religion for them, but thereby he was more exposed to the wider University and "most fully embodied the ideal of a University Professor."&lt;ref name=Divinings&gt;{{Citation |author-last=Williams |author-first=George Hunston | title =Divinings: Religion At Harvard |volume=2 |pages=424 f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 Tillich became one of the founding members of the [[Society for the Arts, Religion and Contemporary Culture]], an organization with which he maintained ties for the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meyer |first = Betty H. |title=The ARC story: a narrative account of the Society for the Arts, Religion, and Contemporary Culture |year=2003 | publisher = Association for Religion and Intellectual Life | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-97470130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period, he published volume&amp;nbsp;2 of ''Systematic Theology'' and also the popular book ''Dynamics of Faith'' (both 1957). His career at Harvard lasted until 1962 when he moved to the [[University of Chicago]], remaining a professor of theology there until his death in 1965.

Volume&amp;nbsp;3 of ''Systematic Theology'' was published in 1963.  In 1964, Tillich became the first theologian to be honored in Kegley and Bretall's ''Library of Living Theology'': "The adjective 'great,' in our opinion, can be applied to very few thinkers of our time, but Tillich, we are far from alone in believing, stands unquestionably amongst these few".{{Sfn | Kegley | Bretall | 1964 | pp = ix–x}} A widely quoted critical assessment of his importance was [[Georgia Harkness]]' comment: "What [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] was to [[American philosophy]], Tillich has been to American theology".&lt;ref name= timesobit&gt;{{Citation | title =Dr. Paul Tillich, Outstanding Protestant Theologian |work=The Times |date=25 Oct 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = thomas&gt;{{Citation | title = Tillich | first = John Heywood | last = Thomas | publisher = Continuum | year = 2002 | ISBN = 0-8264-5082-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tillich died on October 22, 1965, ten days after having a heart attack. In 1966, his ashes were interred in the [[New Harmony, Indiana#Paul Tillich Park|Paul Tillich Park]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], [[Indiana]]. Gravestone inscription : "And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit for his season, his leaf also shall not wither. And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper."

{{Lutheranism}}

===Method of correlation===
The key to understanding Tillich's theology is what he calls the "method of correlation." It is an approach that correlates insights from Christian [[revelation]] with the issues raised by [[existentialism|existential]], psychological, and philosophical analysis.&lt;ref name =CODWR /&gt;

Tillich states in the introduction to the ''Systematic Theology'':
{{Quote |Theology formulates the questions implied in human existence, and theology formulates the answers implied in divine self-manifestation under the guidance of the questions implied in human existence. This is a circle which drives man to a point where question and answer are not separated.  This point, however, is not a moment in time.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 61}}}}

{{Quote |The Christian message provides the answers to the questions implied in human existence.  These answers are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based and are taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm.  Their content cannot be derived from questions that would come from an analysis of human existence.  They are 'spoken' to human existence from beyond it, in a sense.  Otherwise, they would not be answers, for the question is human existence itself.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}}}

For Tillich, the existential questions of human existence are associated with the field of philosophy and, more specifically, [[ontology]] (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes back to the question of being, or what it means to be, to exist, to be a finite human being.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1955 | pp = 11–20}}  To be correlated with these questions are the theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation.  The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the answers to these questions.  However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich's notion of faith as "ultimate concern" necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 23}}{{Sfn | Tillich | 1952 | pp = 58ff}}  Thus, on one side of the correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer.  This is because the Christian message claims, ''a priori'', that the ''logos'' "who became flesh" is also the universal ''logos'' of the Greeks.{{Sfn |  Tillich | 1951 | p = 28}}

In addition to the intimate relationship between philosophy and theology, another important aspect of the method of correlation is Tillich's distinction between form and content in the theological answers.  While the nature of revelation determines the actual content of the theological answers, the character of the questions determines the form of these answers.  This is because, for Tillich, theology must be an answering theology, or [[Christian apologetics|apologetic theology]]. God is called the "ground of being" because God is the answer to the ontological threat of non-being, and this characterization of the theological answer in philosophical terms means that the answer has been conditioned (insofar as its form is considered) by the question. {{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}  Throughout the ''Systematic Theology'', Tillich is careful to maintain this distinction between form and content without allowing one to be inadvertently conditioned by the other.  Many criticisms of Tillich's methodology revolve around this issue of whether the integrity of the Christian message is really maintained when its form is conditioned by philosophy.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | p = 47}}

The theological answer is also determined by the sources of theology, our experience, and the norm of theology.  Though the form of the theological answers are determined by the character of the question, these answers (which "are contained in the revelatory events on which Christianity is based") are also "taken by systematic theology from the sources, through the medium, under the norm."{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 64}}  There are three main sources of systematic theology: the Bible, Church history, and the history of religion and culture.  Experience is not a source but a medium through which the sources speak.  And the norm of theology is that by which both sources and experience are judged with regard to the content of the Christian faith.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 47}}  Thus, we have the following as elements of the method and structure of systematic theology:

* Sources of theology{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 40}}
** Bible{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 35}}
** Church history
** History of religion and culture
* Medium of the sources
** Collective Experience of the Church
* Norm of theology (determines use of sources)
** Content of which is the biblical message itself, for example:
*** Justification through faith
*** New Being in Jesus as the Christ
*** The Protestant Principle
*** The criterion of the cross

As McKelway explains, the sources of theology contribute to the formation of the norm, which then becomes the criterion through which the sources and experience are judged.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | pp = 55–56}}  The relationship is circular, as it is the present situation which conditions the norm in the interaction between church and biblical message.  The norm is then subject to change, but Tillich insists that its basic content remains the same: that of the biblical message.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 52}}  It is tempting to conflate revelation with the norm, but we must keep in mind that revelation (whether original or dependent) is not an element of the structure of systematic theology per se, but an event.{{Sfn | McKelway | 1964 | p = 80}}  For Tillich, the present-day norm is the "New Being in Jesus as the Christ as our Ultimate Concern".{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 50}}  This is because the present question is one of estrangement, and the overcoming of this estrangement is what Tillich calls the "New Being". But since Christianity answers the question of estrangement with "Jesus as the Christ", the norm tells us that we find the New Being in Jesus as the Christ.

There is also the question of the validity of the method of correlation.  Certainly one could reject the method on the grounds that there is no ''a priori'' reason for its adoption. But Tillich claims that the method of any theology and its system are interdependent. That is, an absolute methodological approach cannot be adopted because the method is continually being determined by the system and the objects of theology.{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 60}}

===Use of "being" in systematic theology===
Tillich used the concept of "being" (''Sein'') in systematic theology.&lt;ref&gt;The development of the intellectual profile of Tillich happened in a context where the fundamental ontology of [[Martin Heidegger]] was also taking shape, and especially in terms of the Heideggerian reflection on the question of being (''Seinsfrage'') as it unfolded in ''Sein und Zeit'' ([[Being and Time]]), the connection of Tillich's notion of being to that of Heidegger has been rarely studied; a recent account of this has been published in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Ontological Meditations on Tillich and Heidegger', ''Iris:'' ''Annales de Philosophie'' Volume 36 (2015), pp. 109-114 (a peer-refereed journal published by the Faculté des lettres et des sciences humaines, Université Saint-Joseph, Beyrouth)&lt;/ref&gt; There are three roles:
{{Quote | …[The concept of Being] appears in the present system in three places: in the doctrine of God, where God is called the being as being or the ground and the power of being; 
in the doctrine of man, where the distinction is carried through between man's essential and his existential being;

and finally, in the doctrine of the Christ, where he is called the manifestation of the New Being, the actualization of which is the work of the divine Spirit. |Tillich{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 10}}}}

{{Quote | …It is the expression of the experience of being over against non-being. Therefore, it can be described as the power of being which resists non-being. For this reason, the medieval philosophers called being the basic ''transcendentale'', beyond the universal and the particular…

The same word, the emptiest of all concepts when taken as an abstraction, becomes the most meaningful of all concepts when it is understood as the power of being in everything that has being. |Tillich{{Sfn | Tillich | 1957 | p = 11}}}}

===Life and the Spirit===
This is part four of Tillich's ''Systematic Theology''. In this part, Tillich talks about life and the divine Spirit.

{{quote|Life remains ambiguous as long as there is life. The question implied in the ambiguities of life derives to a new question, namely, that of the direction in which life moves. This is the question of history. Systematically speaking, history, characterized as it is by its direction toward the future, is the dynamic quality of life. Therefore, the "riddle of history" is a part of the problem of life.&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Systematic Theology, Vol. 2'', p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Absolute faith===
Tillich stated the courage to take meaninglessness into oneself presupposes a relation to the ground of being: absolute faith.&lt;ref&gt;The Courage to Be, page 182&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute faith can transcend the theistic idea of God, and has three elements.

{{quote |… The first element is the experience of the power of being which is present even in the face of the most radical manifestation of non being. If one says that in this experience vitality resists despair, one must add that vitality in man is proportional to intentionality.

The vitality that can stand the abyss of meaninglessness is aware of a hidden meaning within the destruction of meaning.
 |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}

{{quote |The second element in absolute faith is the dependence of the experience of nonbeing on the experience of being and the dependence of the experience of meaninglessness on the experience of meaning. Even in the state of despair one has enough being to make despair possible. |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}

{{quote |There is a third element in absolute faith, the acceptance of being accepted. Of course, in the state of despair there is nobody and nothing that accepts. But there is the power of acceptance itself which is experienced. Meaninglessness, as long as it is experienced, includes an experience of the "power of acceptance". To accept this power of acceptance consciously is the religious answer of absolute faith, of a faith which has been deprived by doubt of any concrete content, which nevertheless is faith and the source of the most paradoxical manifestation of the courage to be.
 |Tillich | |''The Courage to Be'', p.177 }}

===Faith as ultimate concern===
According to the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Tillich believes the essence of religious attitudes is what he calls "ultimate concern".  Separate from all profane and ordinary realities, the object of the concern is understood as sacred, [[numinous]] or holy. The perception of its reality is felt as so overwhelming and valuable that all else seems insignificant, and for this reason requires total surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Concepts of God |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=2010-09-29|last=Wainwright|first=William |accessdate=2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1957, Tillich defined his conception of faith more explicitly in his work, ''Dynamics of Faith''.

{{quote|Man, like every living being, is concerned about many things, above all about those which condition his very existence ... If [a situation or concern] claims ultimacy it demands the total surrender of him who accepts this claim ... it demands that all other concerns ... be sacrificed.&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', pp. 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tillich further refined his conception of faith by stating that, "Faith as ultimate concern is an act of the total personality. It is the most centered act of the human mind ... it participates in the dynamics of personal life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

An arguably central component of Tillich's concept of faith is his notion that faith is "ecstatic". That is to say:

{{quote|It transcends both the drives of the nonrational unconsciousness and the structures of the rational conscious...the ecstatic character of faith does not exclude its rational character although it is not identical with it, and it includes nonrational strivings without being identical with them. 'Ecstasy' means 'standing outside of oneself' - without ceasing to be oneself - with all the elements which are united in the personal center.&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In short, for Tillich, faith does not stand opposed to rational or nonrational elements (reason and emotion respectively), as some philosophers would maintain. Rather, it ''transcends'' them in an ecstatic passion for the ultimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|KR7QAjm3yxU|Tillich Interview part 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that Tillich does not exclude [[atheism|atheists]] in his exposition of faith. Everyone has an ultimate concern, and this concern can be in an act of faith, "even if the act of faith includes the denial of God. Where there is ultimate concern, God can be denied only in the name of God"&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Dynamics of Faith'', p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===God above God===
[[File:Bust of Paul Johannes Tillich (daylight).JPG|thumb|Bust of Tillich by [[James Rosati]] in [[New Harmony, Indiana]]]]
Throughout most of his works Paul Tillich provides an apologetic and alternative ontological view of God. Traditional medieval [[philosophical theology]] in the work of figures such as [[St.&amp;nbsp;Anselm]], [[Duns Scotus]], and [[William of Ockham]] tended to understand God as the highest existing Being{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, to which predicates such as omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, goodness, righteousness, holiness, etc. may be ascribed. Arguments for and against the existence of God presuppose such an understanding of God. Tillich is critical of this mode of discourse which he refers to as "theological theism," and argues that if God is Being [das Seiende], even if the highest Being, God cannot be properly called the source of all being, and the question can of course then be posed as to why God exists, who created God, when God's beginning is, and so on. To put the issue in traditional language: if God is 'being' [das Seiende], then God is a creature, even if the highest one, and thus cannot be the Creator. Rather, God must be understood as the "ground of Being-Itself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lectionarycentral.com/quinquag/tillich.html|title=Paul Tillich|website=www.lectionarycentral.com|access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem persists in the same way when attempting to determine whether God is an eternal essence, or an existing being, neither of which are adequate, as traditional theology was well aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; When God is understood in this way, it becomes clear that not only is it impossible to argue for the "existence" of God, since God is beyond the distinction between essence and existence, but it is also foolish: one cannot deny that there is being, and thus there is a Power of Being. The question then becomes whether and in what way personal language about God and humanity's relationship to God is appropriate. In distinction to "theological theism", Tillich refers to another kind of theism as that of the "divine-human encounter". Such is the theism of the encounter with the "Wholly Other" ("Das ganz Andere"), as in the work of [[Karl Barth]] and [[Rudolf Otto]], and implies a personalism with regard to God's self-revelation. Tillich is quite clear that this is both appropriate and necessary, as it is the basis of the personalism of Biblical Religion altogether and the concept of the "Word of God",&lt;ref&gt;Biblical Religion and the Search for Ultimate Reality, University of Chicago Press: Chicago, 1955, 21-62.&lt;/ref&gt; but can become falsified if the theologian tries to turn such encounters with God as the Wholly Other into an understanding of God as a being.&lt;ref&gt;The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 184.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, God is both personal and transpersonal.&lt;ref&gt;The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tillich's ontological view of God has precedent in Christian theology. Many theologians, especially those in the Hellenistic or Patristic period of Christianity's history that corresponds with the Church Fathers, understood God as the "unoriginate source" (agennetos) of all being.&lt;ref&gt;J.&amp;nbsp;N.&amp;nbsp;D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines, HarperCollins: New York, 1978, 128.&lt;/ref&gt; This view was espoused in particular by [[Origen]], one of a number of early theologians whose thought influenced that of Tillich. Their views in turn had pre-Christian precedents in [[middle Platonism]].

Tillich further argues that theological theism is not only logically problematic, but is unable to speak into the situation of radical doubt and despair about meaning in life. This issue, he said, was of primary concern in the modern age, as opposed to anxiety about fate, guilt, death and condemnation.&lt;ref name="Tillich, Courage To Be, p 184"/&gt; This is because the state of finitude entails by necessity anxiety, and that it is our finitude as human beings, our being a mixture of being and nonbeing, that is at the ultimate basis of anxiety. If God is not the ground of being itself, then God cannot provide an answer to the question of finitude; God would also be finite in some sense. The term "God Above God," then, means to indicate the God who appears, who is the ground of being itself, when the "God" of theological theism has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt.&lt;ref&gt;The Courage to Be, Yale: New Haven, 2000, 190.&lt;/ref&gt; While on the one hand this God goes beyond the God of [[theism]] as usually defined, it finds expression in many religious symbols of the Christian faith, particularly that of the crucified Christ. The possibility thus exists, says Tillich, that religious symbols may be recovered which would otherwise have been rendered ineffective by contemporary society.

Tillich argues that the God of theological theism is at the root of much revolt against theism and religious faith in the modern period. Tillich states, sympathetically, that the God of theological theism {{quote |deprives me of my subjectivity because he is all-powerful and all-knowing. I revolt and make ''him'' into an object, but the revolt fails and becomes desperate. God appears as the invincible tyrant, the being in contrast with whom all other beings are without freedom and subjectivity. He is equated with the recent tyrants who with the help of terror try to transform everything into a mere object, a thing among things, a cog in a machine they control. He becomes the model of everything against which Existentialism revolted. This is the God [[Nietzsche]] said had to be killed because nobody can tolerate being made into a mere object of absolute knowledge and absolute control. This is the deepest root of atheism. It is an atheism which is justified as the reaction against theological theism and its disturbing implications.&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Courage To Be'', p 185.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another reason Tillich criticized theological theism was because it placed God into the subject-object [[dichotomy]]. This is the basic distinction made in [[Epistemology]], that branch of [[Philosophy]] which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. ''Epistemologically'', God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question under the rubric of the relationality of God. The question is "whether there are external relations between God and the creature".&lt;ref name=SysTheoV1P271&gt;{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that "there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself".&lt;ref name=SysTheoV1P271/&gt;

Tillich goes further to say that the desire to draw God into the subject–object dichotomy is an "insult" to the divine holiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Tillich |title=Systematic Theology vol. 1 |page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if God were made into the subject rather than the object of knowledge (The Ultimate Subject), then the rest of existing entities then become subjected to the absolute knowledge and scrutiny of God, and the human being is "reified," or made into a mere object. It would deprive the person of his or her own subjectivity and creativity. According to Tillich, theological theism has provoked the rebellions found in atheism and Existentialism, although other social factors such as the [[industrial revolution]] have also contributed to the "reification" of the human being. The modern man could no longer tolerate the idea of being an "object" completely subjected to the absolute knowledge of God. Tillich argued, as mentioned, that theological theism is "bad theology".
{{quote |The God of the theological theism is a being besides others and as such a part of the whole reality. He is certainly considered its most important part, but as a part and therefore as subjected to the structure of the whole. He is supposed to be beyond the ontological elements and categories which constitute reality. But every statement subjects him to them. He is seen as a self which has a world, as an ego which relates to a thought, as a cause which is separated from its effect, as having a definite space and endless time. He is a being, not being-itself&lt;ref name="Tillich, Courage To Be, p 184"&gt;Tillich, ''Courage To Be'', p 184.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alternatively, Tillich presents the above-mentioned ontological view of God as Being-Itself, [[Ground of Being]], Power of Being, and occasionally as [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]] or God's "Abysmal Being". What makes Tillich's ontological view of God different from theological theism is that it transcends it by being the foundation or ultimate reality that "precedes" all beings. Just as [[Being]] for [[Heidegger]] is ontologically ''prior'' to conception, Tillich views God to be beyond Being-Itself, manifested in the structure of beings.&lt;ref name="Tillich, p 15"&gt;Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; God is not a supernatural entity among other entities. Instead, God is the ground upon which all beings exist. We cannot perceive God as an object which is related to a subject because God ''precedes'' the subject–object dichotomy.&lt;ref name="Tillich, p 15"/&gt;

Thus Tillich dismisses a literalistic [[Biblicism]]. Instead of rejecting the notion of personal God, however, Tillich sees it as a symbol that points directly to the Ground of Being.&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', p 127-132.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Ground of Being ontologically precedes reason, it cannot be comprehended since comprehension presupposes the subject–object dichotomy. Tillich disagreed with any literal philosophical and religious statements that can be made about God. Such literal statements attempt to define God and lead not only to [[anthropomorphism]] but also to a philosophical mistake that [[Immanuel Kant]] warned against, that setting limits against the transcendent inevitably leads to contradictions. Any statements about God are simply symbolic, but these symbols are sacred in the sense that they function to participate or point to the Ground of Being. Tillich insists that anyone who participates in these symbols is empowered by the Power of Being, which overcomes and conquers nonbeing and meaninglessness.

Tillich also further elaborated the thesis of the God above the God of theism in his Systematic Theology.

{{quote |… (the God above the God of theism) This has been misunderstood as a dogmatic statement of a pantheistic or mystical character. First of all, it is not a dogmatic, but an apologetic, statement. It takes seriously the radical doubt experienced by many people. It gives one the courage of self-affirmation even in the extreme state of radical doubt. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p. 12}}

{{quote |… In such a state the God of both religious and theological language disappears. But something remains, namely, the seriousness of that doubt in which meaning within meaninglessness is affirmed. The source of this affirmation of meaning within meaninglessness, of certitude within doubt, is not the God of traditional theism but the "God above God," the power of being, which works through those who have no name for it, not even the name God. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p. 12}}

{{quote |…This is the answer to those who ask for a message in the nothingness of their situation and at the end of their courage to be. But such an extreme point is not a space with which one can live. The dialectics of an extreme situation are a criterion of truth but not the basis on which a whole structure of truth can be built. |Tillich | |''Systematic Theology Vol. 2 '', p.12}}

=== Tillich's ontology of courage ===

In Paul Tillich's work ''The Courage to Be'' he defines courage as the self-affirmation of one's being in spite of a threat of nonbeing. He relates courage to anxiety, anxiety being the threat of non-being and the courage to be what we use to combat that threat. For Tillich, he outlines three types of anxiety and thus three ways to display the courage to be.

1)	The Anxiety of Fate and Death
a.	The Anxiety of Fate and Death is the most basic and universal form of anxiety for Tillich. It relates quite simply to the recognition of our mortality. This troubles us humans. We become anxious when we are unsure whether our actions create a causal damnation which leads to a very real and quite unavoidable death (42-44). "Nonbeing threatens man's ontic self-affirmation, relatively in terms of fate, absolutely in terms of death" (41).
b.	We display courage when we cease to rely on others to tell us what will come of us, (what will happen when we die etc.) and begin seeking those answers out for ourselves. Called the "courage of confidence" (162-63).

2)	The Anxiety of Guilt and Condemnation
a.	This anxiety afflicts our moral self-affirmation. We as humans are responsible for our moral being, and when asked by our judge (whomever that may be) what we have made of ourselves we must answer. The anxiety is produced when we realize our being is unsatisfactory. "It [Nonbeing] threatens man's moral self-affirmation, relatively in terms of guilt, absolutely in terms of condemnation" (41).
b.	We display courage when we first identify our sin; despair or whatever is causing us guilt or afflicting condemnation. We then rely on the idea that we are accepted regardless. "The courage to be is the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable" (164).

3)	The Anxiety of Meaningless and Emptiness 
a.	The Anxiety of Meaninglessness and Emptiness attacks our being as a whole. We worry about the loss of an ultimate concern or goal. This anxiety is also brought on by a loss of spirituality. We as beings feel the threat of non-being when we feel we have no place or purpose in the world. "It [Nonbeing] threatens man's spiritual self-affirmation, relatively in terms of emptiness, absolutely in terms of meaninglessness" (41).
b.	We display the courage to be when facing this anxiety by displaying true faith, and by again, self-affirming oneself. We draw from the "power of being" which is God for Tillich and use that faith to in turn affirm ourselves and negate the non-being. We can find our meaning and purpose through the "power of being" (172-73).

Tillich writes that the ultimate source of the courage to be is the "God above God," which transcends the theistic idea of God and is the content of absolute faith (defined as "the accepting of the acceptance without somebody or something that accepts") (185).

== Popular works ==

Two of Tillich's works, ''The Courage to Be'' (1952) and ''Dynamics of Faith'' (1957), were read widely, including by people who would not normally read religious books. In ''The Courage to Be'', he lists three basic anxieties: anxiety about our biological finitude, i.e. that arising from the knowledge that we will eventually die; anxiety about our moral finitude, linked to guilt; and anxiety about our existential finitude, a sense of aimlessness in life. Tillich related these to three different historical eras: the early centuries of the [[Christian era]]; the [[Reformation]]; and the 20th century. Tillich's popular works have influenced psychology as well as theology, having had an influence on [[Rollo May]], whose "The Courage to Create" was inspired by "The Courage to Be".

== Reception ==

Today, Tillich's most observable legacy may well be that of a spiritually-oriented public intellectual and teacher with a broad and continuing range of influence. Tillich's chapel sermons (especially at Union) were enthusiastically received&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grenz |first=Stanley J. and Roger E. Olson |title=20th-Century Theology: God &amp; the World in a Transitional Age |year=1993 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downers Grove IL |isbn=978-0830815258 |pages=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bj9cJHj3vUwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Tillich was known as the only faculty member of his day at Union willing to attend the revivals of [[Billy Graham]]{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}) Tillich's students have commented on Tillich's approachability as a lecturer and his need for interaction with his audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bunge |first=Nancy |title=From Hume to Tillich: Teaching Faith &amp; Benevolence |url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/38/From_Hume_to_Tillich_Teaching_Faith_and_Benevolence |work=Philosophy Now |publisher=Philosophy Now |accessdate=30 December 2012 |quote=As a former student, I can attest that he invited students to leave questions on the podium and he would invariably open the lecture by responding to them, often in a way that startled the student by revealing what a profound question he or she had asked.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Tillich was University Professor at Harvard, he was chosen as keynote speaker from among an auspicious gathering of many who had appeared on the cover of [[Time Magazine]] during its first four decades. Tillich along with his student, psychologist Rollo May, was an early leader at the [[Esalen Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Walter Truett |title=The Upstart Spring: Esalen and the Human Potential Movement: The First Twenty Years |year=2004 |publisher=iUniverse |location=Lincoln NE |isbn=978-0595307357 |pages=104 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_pOl3_rrr18C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary [[New Age]] catchphrases describing God (spatially) as the "Ground of Being" and (temporally) as the "Eternal Now,"&lt;ref&gt;"There is no present in the mere stream of time; but the present is real, as our experience witnesses. And it is real because eternity breaks into time and gives it a real present. We could not even say now, if eternity did not elevate that moment above the ever-passing time. Eternity is always present; and its presence is the cause of our having the present at all. When the psalmist looks at God, for Whom a thousand years are like one day, he is looking at that eternity which alone gives him a place on which he can stand, a now which has infinite reality and infinite significance. In every moment that we say now, something temporal and something eternal are united. Whenever a human being says, 'Now I am living; now I am really present,' resisting the stream which drives the future into the past, eternity is. In each such Now eternity is made manifest; in every real now, eternity is present." (Tillich, "The Mystery of Time," in ''The Shaking of the Foundations'').&lt;/ref&gt; in tandem with the view that God is not an entity among entities but rather is "Being-Itself"—notions which [[Eckhart Tolle]], for example, has invoked repeatedly throughout his career&lt;ref&gt;In his September 2010 Live Meditation (https://www.eckharttolletv.com/), e.g., Tolle expounds at length on "the dimension of depth".&lt;/ref&gt;—were paradigmatically renovated by Tillich, although of course these ideas derive from Christian mystical sources as well as from ancient and medieval theologians such as [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cary |first=Phillip |title="Augustinian Compatibilism and the Doctrine of Election", in Augustine and Philosophy, ed. by Phillip Cary, John Doody and Kim Paffenroth |year=2012 |publisher=Lexington Books |location=Lanham MD |isbn=978-0739145388 |pages=91 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vAw_jBr38m8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Both Augustine and later [[Boethius]] used the concept of the "eternal now" to investigate the relationship between divine omnipotence and omniscience and the temporality of human free will; and Thomas Aquinas' synthesis of Platonic and Aristotelian ontologies with Christian theology included the concepts of God as the "ground of being" and "being-itself" (''ipsum esse'').&lt;/ref&gt;

The introductory philosophy course taught by the person Tillich considered to be his best student, [[John Edwin Smith]], "probably turned more undergraduates to the study of philosophy at [[Yale]] than all the other philosophy courses put together. His courses in philosophy of religion and [[American philosophy]] defined those fields for many years. Perhaps most important of all, he has educated a younger generation in the importance of the public life in philosophy and in how to practice philosophy publicly."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' (Jan. 24, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s and 1990s the Boston University Institute for Philosophy and Religion, a leading forum dedicated to the revival of the American public tradition of philosophy and religion, flourished under the leadership of Tillich's student and expositor Leroy S. Rouner.

===Criticism===
[[Martin Buber]] criticized Tillich's "[[Transtheism|transtheistic]] position" as a reduction of God to the impersonal "necessary being" of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first =David |last=Novak |author-link= David Novak |title=Buber and Tillich |journal = Journal of Ecumenical Studies |volume=29 | number =2 |date=Spring 1992 |pages=159–74 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xnXMiBAXVZkC&amp;pg=PA89}}, as reprinted in {{citation |title=Talking With Christians: Musings of A Jewish Theologian |year=2005 | publisher =Wm. B. Eerdmans |first=David |last = Novak |page= 101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tillich has been criticized from the [[Barthian]] wing of [[Protestantism]] for what is alleged to be correlation theory's tendency to reduce God and his relationship to man to [[anthropocentric]] terms.  Tillich counters that Barth's approach to theology denies the "possibility of understanding God's relation to man in any other way than heteronomously or extrinsically".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Paul Tillich and Bonaventure: An Evaluation of Tillich's Claim to Stand in the Augustinian-Franciscan Tradition |first=John P. | last = Dourley |page=12 |publisher=Brill Archive | year =1975 |isbn= 978-900404266-7 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=38YUAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Defenders of Tillich claim that critics misunderstand the distinction Tillich makes between God's essence as the unconditional ("das unbedingte") "Ground of Being" which is unknowable, and how God reveals himself to mankind in existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last = Boozer |first = Jack Stewart |title = The place of reason in Paul Tillich's concept of God |type = dissertation | year = 1952 | page = 269 |publisher= [[Boston University]] | url = http://open.bu.edu/xmlui/handle/2144/5096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tillich establishes the distinction in the first chapter of his ''Systematic Theology Volume One:'' "But though God in his abysmal nature &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''footnote: 'Calvin: in his essence' '' &lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is in no way dependent on man, God in his self manifestation to man is dependent on the way man receives his manifestation."{{Sfn | Tillich | 1951 | p = 61}}

Some conservative strains of Evangelical Christianity believe Tillich's thought is too unorthodox to qualify as Christianity at all, but rather as a form of [[pantheism]] or [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tillich held an equally low opinion of biblical literalism.  See {{Harv | Tillich | 1951 | p = 3}}: 'When fundamentalism is combined with an antitheological bias, as it is, for instance, in its biblicistic-evangelical form, the theological truth of yesterday is defended as an unchangeable message against the theological truth of today and tomorrow. Fundamentalism fails to make contact with the present situation, not because it speaks from beyond every situation, but because it speaks from a situation from the past. It elevates something finite and transitory to infinite and eternal validity. In this respect fundamentalism has demonic traits.'&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]]'' states, "At best Tillich was a [[pantheist]], but his thought borders on [[atheism]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | isbn = 978-0-8010-2075-9 |editor-first =Walter A | editor-last = Elwell |title=[[Evangelical Dictionary of Theology]] | first =SN | last = Gundry |chapter = Death of God Theology | chapter-url = http://mb-soft.com/believe/txn/deathgod.htm | accessdate = 2011-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attempts to bring out his subject matter by considering the [[dream hypothesis]]—what if ''this'' were a dream? In Valberg's view, my horizon is what this world would be internal to if ''this'' were all a dream. This leads to "horizonal" conceptions of consciousness, mind, experience, life, the self, etc. Valberg subsequently considers death, and argues that when the meaning of death strikes us in the right way, it presents us with the prospect of nothingness—not there being nothing ''for me'', but nothing ''period''. This corresponds to my horizon being the ''preeminent'' one, corresponding to a weak version of [[solipsism]] (arguably closely related to Hare's [[egocentric presentism]]).  Valberg points out the difficulty of reconciling this with his commitment to the view that he shares the world with metaphysical equals. He continues by re-evaluating many well-studied problems in philosophy in light of this notion of the personal horizon.

Mark Johnston compares this notion to his related but distinct notion of an "arena of presence and action", which contains the stream of consciousness, and argues for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=Mark|title=Surviving Death|year=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400834600|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9151.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9430">'''Philosophical Reflections in the Naisadhacarita''' is the doctoral (Ph.D.) thesis of Harekrishna Meher done in [[Banaras Hindu University]] in 1981. It discusses philosophical ideas as reflected in the Sanskrit Mahakavya ‘Naisadhacaritam’ authored by the distinguished poet [[Sriharsha|Sriharsa]] (12th century). This book  ({{ISBN|9788185094212}}), first published in 1989 by Punthi Pustak Calcutta, is circulated worldwide{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}.

Naisadhacarita Mahakavya of poet [[Sriharsa]] enjoys a prominent position among the five great epics of [[Sanskrit Literature]]. Also known as ‘[[Naishadha]]’ or ‘Naishadhiya’, this epic contains twenty-two cantos completed with 2827 verses. Its main theme is the story of love between Nala, the King of Nisadha country and Damayanti, the Princess of Vidarbha. The story of Nala and Damayanti is found in the [[Mahabharata]] of [[Vyasa]] and [[Kathasaritsagara]] of [[Somadeva]]. The episode of the epic has been taken from the Mahabharata. Poet Sriharsa has remodelled the story and has added the sentiment of love to it.

'''Philosophical Importance of Naisadhacarita :'''
 
In Naisadhacarita, Indian literature and philosophy are interwoven. [[Indian philosophy]] has the celebrity all over the world for its intellectual and practical eminence. The keynote of almost all the philosophical systems is the realization of Truth and Self, annihilation of mundane sufferings and attainment of supreme happiness. Ways are many, but the destination is one. Sriharsa’s epic has several philosophical trends in the light of the thoughts revealed by the minds of the great Aryan thinkers.

Poet Sriharsa is a deep-delved philosopher. His Naisadhacarita, even with its epical characteristics, forms a philosophical profile. This literary composition addresses itself to a critical review of social norms and ethics. Romanticism of the Nala-Damayanti-episode reigns superb; yet other factors of life are also taken into account in the greater perspective of human existence.

Sriharsa has not dilated upon all the topics of all the Indian philosophical systems; still his philosophical purview provides a general survey. Various philosophical notions are compressed and communed with the literary matter of the epic. No sequence is seen in the philosophical allusions and they are found scattered in over two hundred and thirty verses of different cantos.

For the philosophical affluence with scriptural influence, Canto-XVII is really remarkable. Some definite items of almost all the systems, theist and atheist, spiritual and non-spiritual, orthodox and heterodox, are traced with unfailing philosophical focuses.  This significant canto forms an excellent index of Sriharsa’s dexterous genius, originality and inviting innovations in the Indian.philosophical sphere.

It may be observed that with the infusion of philosophical phenomena, Sriharsa’s aim is to suitably embellish the aesthetic status of his literary work and to sincerely evince his philosophical acumen as well. He has successfully designed his poetic art with the philosophical features noticeable not only in plain illustrations, but also in many a double entendre.

Author of the Book, Dr. Meher remarks :

"Sriharsa’s Naisadhacarita seems burdensome for general readers; but it serves as a repository of epical riches. This literary composition earns high admirations from many noted Sanskrit scholars, both oriental and occidental. For the felicitous expression, bold approach, intellectual relevance, emotional charm, scriptural significance, philosophical probing and above all, scholarly structure of Indian wisdom, this epic is renowned as a monumental masterpiece in [[Sanskrit]]."

The Author further expresses :

"Sriharsa’s eruditions on all the philosophical systems are very well marked and the sublimity of Monistic Vedanta has been maintained in the Naisadhacarita. Literary merit has not been belittled by the philosophical concepts inserted into the literature; rather it has been enhanced, since they have been contextually and befittingly utilized as some favourable figures of speech without causing any levity of meaning and without marring the literary beauty of the epic. * * Bearing, though unsystematically, the outlines of diverse philosophical aspects, from [[Carvaka]] up to [[Vedanta]] in a bird’s eye-view, this literary epic appears as an epitome of [[Indian Philosophy]] weighed carefully by the poet-philosopher Sriharsa. Through the scriptural and canonical connections, all the thoughts signify the cultural heritage of the vast country of India and Indianness."

'''Brief Sketch of the Philosophical Study''' :

The book  "Philosophical Reflections in the Naisadhacarita"  is accomplished with ten chapters.

* Chapter- I bears Introduction regarding general observations on Sriharsa and his works.
* In Chapter- II, the heterodox materialism of [[Carvaka]] has been analysed.
* In Chapter -III, views of [[Samkhya]] philosophy have been summarized.
* In Chapter- IV, Concepts of [[Yoga]] philosophy have been discussed.
* In Chapter -V, [[Mimamsa]] philosophy has found a place of discourse.
*In Chapter -VI, some doctrines of [[Bauddha]] philosophy have been elucidated.
* In Chapter- VII, [[Jain]]a philosophy has been briefly brought to the philosophical disquisition.
* Chapter -VIII comprises the concepts of [[Nyaya]]-[[Vaisesika]] philosophy.
* In Chapter -IX, [[Vedanta]] philosophy has been critically construed.
* Chapter- X forms the concluding review on the epic from different angles. Depicting the literary theme of love, Poet Sriharsa has looked into the inner sense of life through various philosophical topics in his Mahakavya ‘Naisadhacarita’.

'''Some Comments on this Thesis''' :

“[[Sriharsha]] has the catholicity to absorb the teachings of both theistic and atheistic schools, and one is astounded to see the fusion of conflicting trends in his court-epic. The writer of the present dissertation has discussed all these issues in the work which can claim originality on many counts. On the whole, my impression on the thesis is extremely favourable. The work is marked by originality of thought and freshness of approach, and I have every reason to believe that it will be admired by posterity as a document successful in its attempt to enrich the stock of human knowledge.”
*(Prof. Dr.Rama Ranjan Mukherjee, Former Vice-Chancellor of [[Burdwan University]])

“The thesis is a definite contribution to the studies of the Naisadhacarita. The study, further, has been very critical and exhaustive as can well be seen from the scholarly examination of the views of the different systems of Indian Philosophy like the [[Carvaka]]s, the [[Nyaya]]-[[Vaisesika]]s, the [[Samkhya]]s, the [[Jain]]as, the different schools of [[Buddhism]] and the [[Advaita]] [[Vedanta]], so laboriously culled from the poem. This presentation reveals not only the hard work on the part of the candidate, but also his sound understanding of the text before him and of Indian Philosophy also. The thesis has been arranged and presented in a systematic manner and has been lucidly written.”
*(Prof. Dr. T.G.Mainkar, Former Director, [[Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute]], [[Pune]])

“The candidate has taken serious pains to see how the poet has worked out the theme in the light of Indian metaphysics and ethics. It is a remarkable amalgam of truth and fiction, fact and artifact. I congratulate the candidate for his honest and sincere attempts, his critical acumen and deep philosophical insight.  I have reasons to believe that it is a real contribution to the world of academicians.”
*(Prof. Dr. K.N. Chatterjee, Former Prof. [[Rabindra Bharati University]], [[Calcutta]])

'''Progressive Utilization Theory''' (Prout), also known by the acronym '''PROUT''', is a [[socioeconomic]] and political theory developed by philosopher and spiritual leader [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="Crovetto2008" /&gt;{{r|"Crovetto2011"}} The theory is based on his holistic outlook of life.{{r|:7|:0}} It is a system of governance&lt;ref name="Skrbina" /&gt; that is inspired by [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as well as Sarkar's own ideas. It aims to be [[Economic progressivism|economically progressive]] and improve [[Social change|social development]].{{r|:7|p=1}} The theory is in line with Sarkar's [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] values which aim to provide "proper care" to every being on the planet, including  humans, animals and plants.{{r|:1}}

== History ==
By 1959, Sarkar had developed the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book ''Ananda Sutram'', published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.{{r|Irving}}

In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation "Proutist Block of India" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{r|fukui|p=357}} The PBI was soon superseded by "Proutist Universal" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).{{When|date=May 2018}} 

The theory has not achieved widespread implementation.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}} Cooperative communities have been established by [[Ananda Marga]] in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout.&lt;ref name=Ellwood/&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}}

==Theory==
=== Overview ===
Prout proposes an [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] system as an alternative to [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], taking ideas from both.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; Under the system [[Tangible property|material goods]] would be [[common ownership|common property]] and [[Distribution (economics)|distributed]] in a rational and equitable way to maximize the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Onwuka /&gt; The distribution intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;

Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to [[industrial organization]]. Key industries and [[public utilities]] would be [[nonprofit organization]]s. Decentralized industry run by [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] unions would provide people's minimum necessities. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers' and consumers' [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

At the political level, Prout rejects [[nationalism]]. Instead, there would be locally governed self-sufficient socioeconomic zones and a [[world government]].&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inayatullah/&gt; There would be a world [[constitution]] and a [[bill of rights]] for animals and plants, as well as humans.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Law of social cycle and governance ===
{{main|Law of social cycle}}
Prout takes account of Sarkat's [[law of social cycle]]. It sees the [[social order]] as consisting of four [[Social class|classes of people]] that cyclically dominate society: ''shudras'' (workers), ''kshatriyas'' (warriors), ''vipras'' (intellectuals) and ''vaishyas'' (acquisitors).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as "... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell, volume 4|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, these different class or psychologies, are not seen as static or mutually exclusive. The theory sees them as evolving over an individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Prout see the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The theory then see the newly powerful class becoming corrupt.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a "spiritual elite" sadvipras (etymologically sad – true, vipra – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; 

Sadvipras would be organized into [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; They would be responsible for the application of force necessary to change the order of dominance within the social order. It is envisioned that large amounts of force, akin to [[revolution]], may be necessary.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Neohumanism ===
{{main|Neohumanism}}
The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar's Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of [[humanism]]{{r|bio|:0}} integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect.{{r|:1}}



=== The five fundamental principles ===
In 1962, Sarkar formally outlined Prout in sixteen [[aphorism]]s (see Chapter 5 of ''Ananda Sutram''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ananda Sutram|last=Anandamurti|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1962|isbn=8172520271|location=Jamalpur|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.

The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows:&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles for a Balanced Economy: An Introduction to the Progressive Utilization Theory|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|publisher=PROUT Research institute|year=2012|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society.
# There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources.
# There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings.
# There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.
# Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive.
An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar's earlier work, ''Idea and Ideology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idea and Ideology|last=Anandamurtii|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The market ===
As far as Prout's values and goals differ from those of [[capitalism]] and [[communism]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/HOH/HOH-8.pdf|title=Panimatzalam’s Voice of Transformation: An Indigenous Mayan Writing Project for Youth Activism|last=Oppenheim|first=Matt|date=|website=North Arizona University|page=144|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in Power|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|publisher=Proutist Bloc India|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so does its [[Economic system|economic structure]]. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout’s propounder argues that these philosophies are "anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc. 

Another criticism of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the denegeration of society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in a Nutshell part 12|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the sovietic central planning committees ([[Gosplan]]) had too much economic decision and cohersion power in the federation (see [[Marxism–Leninism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae1f7e792.pdf|title=An analysis of the Soviet economic growth from the 1950’s to the collapse of USSR|last=Serrano|first=Franklin|last2=Mazat|first2=Numa|date=|website=Centros Raffa|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/inactive/command.pdf|title=Are Command Economies Unstable? Why did the Soviet Economy Collapse?|last=Harrison|first=Mark|date=|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of [[Economic planning|market planning]] that help to create and sustain a healthy economy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing a new economy|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|last2=Sevaergrah|first2=Caroline|publisher=Inner World Books|year=2016|isbn=9781881717539|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economics]] where profit-motive speaks highest.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf|title=Self-Reliant Regional proutist development|last=Ghista|first=Dhanjoo|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|date=|website=Prout.org|page=7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/block-level-planning/|title=Block-level planning|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[diseconomies of scale]]). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Prout also claims that the [[nationalization]] of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Society part 1|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/12/economist-explains-1|title=Why nationalisation has fallen out of favour in Britain|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a "no-profit, no-loss" principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell volume 4 part 21|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key industries vital for the prosperity of society (such as transportation, energy or hospitals), claims Sarkar, should be run by the immediate government as they are too large of operations to be run conveniently by private business men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Prout argues for an "optimal inequality" where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Richard B. Freeman|Richard Freeman]], a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with "negative consequences" in terms of social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/edsall-just-right-inequality.html|title=Just Right Inequality|last=Thomas|first=Edsall|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist‘s motto of from [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]] cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] or [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]].

Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]], where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Economic democracy ===
In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.online.southcentral.edu/students/instructors/MFMyROSEarticle.pdf|title=Living Wage and Optimal Inequality in a Sarkarian Framework|last=Friedman|first=Mark|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roar Bjonnes]], a known Proutist, states, "Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout, therefore, advocates an [[economic democracy]] where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proutist Economics: Discourses on Economic Liberation|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1992|isbn=9788172520038|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike [[capitalism]], where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The third requirement of economic democracy is the [[decentralization]] of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worker and Community: Response to Industrialization in a Nineteenth Century American City, Albany, New York, 1850-1884|last=Greenberg|first=Brian|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=978-0-88706-046-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Small Is Beautiful|last=Schumacher|first=E.F.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1973|isbn=978-0-06-091630-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.

Prout rests upon the concept of a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large-scale key industries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A few problems solved part 9|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga publications|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, key industries vital to the development of the country and of strategic importance&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/prouts-3-tiered-economic-system/?wpdmdl=1652|title=PROUT’s Three-Tiered Enterprise System|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=2015|website=PROUT institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are too complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourses on PROUT|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.

In a Prout system there would be no privately owned corporations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Socio-economic units ===
A socio-economic unit, or Samaj in [[Sanskrit]], is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local [[community]], built on strong feelings of [[solidarity]] and [[Self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In sum, a unit should have common social and economic conditions, geographical potentialities, cultural legacy and language.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similar to [[Bioregionalism|bioregions]], their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Self Reliant Regional Proutistic Development|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|last1=Ghista|first1=Dhanjoo|publisher=Prout Research Institute|year=1991|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan.

Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In Prout these socio-economic units would also create the necessary balance in the world's trade in so much as independently run and self-reliant communities would not need the resources from more developed economic powers seeking to exploit them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;


=== Progress ===
From Prout's perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or it’s GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT - A New Paradigm for Development|last=Logan|first=Ronald|publisher=Ananda Seva Publications|year=2005|isbn=1892345048|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of ''A new Paradigm of Development,'' reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moving along the lines of the [[triple bottom line]] that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a "fourth bottom line",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the [[summum bonum]] of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.

Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2011/11/what-is-progress/|title=What is Progress|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multifarious [[disease]]s that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the "supra-emotional values" intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

"The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one's consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2012/10/a-new-definition-of-social-progress|title=A new definition of social progress|last=|first=|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Abraham Maslow|Maslownian]] perspective, Sarkar defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.

==Criticism==
Prout is a relatively unknown theory.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  [[Johan Galtung]] claimed Prout is unlikely to make it into the western education system: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"P. R. Sarkar was a great thinker and a great practitioner. I have chosen to honor him as a great macrohistorian, focusing on his theory of Social Cycles and their implications for world unity and peace… But, given the ethnocentrism of the USA and Europe, Sarkar will not easily make it into textbooks or courses about civilization"'' ''–'' Johan Galtung &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist [[Paul Erdman]], in the [[Los Angeles Times]] , described Prout as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"a strange mixture of voodoo historical theories and sound economic analysis"''&lt;ref name="Erdman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ravi Batra]] was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]''. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like [[Johan Galtung]], founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that ''"Sarkar’s theory is far superior to [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith’s]] or that of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]."'' &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Some thinkers have proclaimed the pertinence that this theory has in the context of our modern world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Who|date=May 2018}} In the foreword of ''After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World'' political philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote, ''"Alternative visions are crucial at this moment in history. Prout’s cooperative model of economic democracy, based on cardinal human values and sharing the resources of the planet for the welfare of everyone, deserves our serious consideration."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the same book historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote, ''"After Capitalism is refreshingly original. It is spiritual and utopian while remaining grounded in reality. Its analysis is intelligent and its vision inspiring."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Leonardo Boff]], Brazilian theologian and writer, has summed up what he considers to be the importance of Prout: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"The exceptional importance of the Prout system resides in two fundamental points: its completeness and its viability. The entire system comes from a correct understanding of the human being, personal and collective, and authentic human development…" ''&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

According to a description by Terry Irving and [[Rowan Cahill]], Prout "envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth."&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; [[Sohail Inayatullah]] stated that the philosophy "attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution."&lt;ref name=Inayatullah /&gt; [[David Skrbina]] characterized Prout as a "model of social development... which advocates a 'small is beautiful' approach to society."&lt;ref name=Skrbina /&gt;  Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar's economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor [[John A. Ryan]], [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Herman Daly]] in Sarkar's incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

It has been characterized as a form of "progressive socialism"&lt;ref name=Ellwood /&gt; as well as a "socialist theory".&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt; 

Hans Despain noted, in [[Monthly Review]], that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of [[David Schweickart]], [[Gar Alperovitz]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]]. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/its-the-system-stupid/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Joyce''' (born 1966) is a British-Australian-New Zealand philosopher, known for his contributions to the fields of [[meta-ethics]] and [[moral psychology]]. He is Professor of Philosophy at [[Victoria University of Wellington]].

==Background and education==
Joyce was born in England and raised in New Zealand (and is an Australian citizen). After an initial education at the [[University of Auckland]], he received his PhD from [[Princeton University]] in 1998 (studying under [[Gilbert Harman]]). After Princeton, he was a lecturer at the [[University of Sheffield]] for a few years, and then held research fellowships at the [[Australian National University]] and the [[University of Sydney]]. He took up his professorship at [[Victoria University of Wellington]] in 2010.

==Ideas==
;Moral error theory
To hold an error theory about morality is to endorse a kind of radical [[moral skepticism]]--a skepticism analogous to atheism in the religious domain. The atheist thinks that religious utterances, such as "God loves you," really are truth-evaluable assertions (as opposed to being veiled commands or expressions of hope, etc.), but that the world just doesn't contain the items (e.g., God) necessary to render such assertions true. Similarly, the moral error theorist maintains that moral judgments are truth-evaluable assertions (thus contrasting with [[Non-cognitivism|noncognitivism]]) but that the world doesn't contain the properties (e.g., moral goodness, evil, moral obligation) needed to render moral judgments true. In other words, moral discourse aims at the truth but systematically fails to secure it. This view was argued for by [[J.L. Mackie]] in his 1977 book, and Mackie's position and arguments have been developed by Joyce in many publications, most notably his 2001 book ''The Myth of Morality''.

;Moral fictionalism
If a moral error theory is true, then what are we supposed to do with our faulty moral discourse? The natural thought is that we should more or less do away with it (abolitionism). Another possibility is that we should carry on believing it, even while maintaining that it is false (conservationism). Joyce, in contrast, defends a third way—the fictionalist view—which treats morality as a kind of convenient fiction. According to the moral fictionalist, we should carry on using moral discourse, though not believing it or asserting it, such that it has a status similar to make-believe. Joyce likens this view to our familiar use of metaphors, whereby we can convey something important and true via saying something false.

;Moral nativism
Where does the human capacity for moral thinking come from? One view is that it is the by-product of other psychological faculties that evolved for other purposes—perhaps a relatively recent cultural phenomenon that emerged when humans started living in large groups. Joyce has explored and tentatively advocated the alternative nativist view, according to which human moral thinking is a distinct biological adaptation (i.e., that we are "hard-wired" for moral thinking). Joyce hypothesizes that moral thinking evolved in order to strengthen our ancestors' motivation to engage in adaptive cooperative behavior. This is the subject of his 2006 book ''The Evolution of Morality''.

;Evolutionary debunking argument
If human moral thinking evolved in order to strengthen cooperative bonds among our ancestors, then the question arises as to why we should suppose that it provides us with accurate information. Why should we trust our moral intuitions, no matter how strong they are, if we have a reasonable explanation of their origin that is compatible with their being entirely false? Joyce has developed and defended what has come to be known as an "evolutionary debunking argument," according to which the evolutionary origin of human moral thinking might give us cause to doubt our moral judgments. The conclusion of Joyce's debunking argument is not the error-theoretic view that all moral judgments are false (though this is a conclusion he argues for elsewhere), but the epistemological view that all moral judgments are unjustified.

==Works==
Joyce is the author of several books:
* [http://personal.victoria.ac.nz/richard_joyce/essaysonmoralskepticism.html ''Essays in Moral Skepticism''] (OUP, 2016).

* [http://personal.victoria.ac.nz/richard_joyce/mythofmorality.html ''The Myth of Morality''] (CUP, 2001).

He is editor (or co-editor) of several collections:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7666">'''Robert Misrahi''' ({{IPA-fr|miz.ʁa.i|lang}}; born 3 January 1926) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] who specialises in [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Paris]] to [[History of the Jews in Turkey|Turkish-Jewish]] immigrants, Misrahi studied at the [[University of Paris]] (Sorbonne), where he became a protege of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. He is currently the emeritus professor of [[ethical]] philosophy at the [[Université de Paris I]] (Sorbonne), he has published a number of works on Spinoza and published the essentials of his work on the question of happiness. He has published a number of works in publications including ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'', ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]'', ''Le Dictionnaire des philosophies "PUF"'', but also ''[[Libération]]'' and ''[[le Nouvel Observateur]]''.

In November 2002, he published a polemic in the columns of ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'', regarding a book by controversial Italian journalist [[Oriana Fallaci]], ''la Rage et l'Orgueil''.

During his studies at the Sorbonne, Misrahi also became involved with the militant [[Zionism|Zionist]] group [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], which was then conducting an [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine|insurgency in Palestine]] against the British. Misrahi was recruited to carry out an attack on British soil. During a March 1947 visit to [[London]], Misrahi placed a bomb in the Colonial Club, a recreational facility for students and soldiers from British colonies in Africa and the West Indies. The bomb, which detonated on March 7, 1947, blew out the facility's doors and windows and seriously injured several soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Cesarani, David: ''Major Farrans Hat: The Untold Story of the Struggle to Establish the Jewish State'', p. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliav, Yaakov: ''Wanted''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Catholic philosophy}}
'''Romano Guardini''' (17 February 1885 – 1 October 1968) was an Italian-born German Catholic priest, author, and academic. He was one of the most important figures in Catholic intellectual life in the 20th century.

== Life and work==

Guardini was born in [[Verona]], Italy, in 1885. His family moved to [[Mainz]] when he was one year old and he lived in Germany for the rest of his life. He attended the [[Rabanus-Maurus-Gymnasium]]. After studying chemistry in [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] for two semesters, and economics in [[University of Munich|Munich]] and [[University of Berlin|Berlin]] for three, he decided to become a priest. After studying Theology in [[Freiburg|Freiburg im Breisgau]] and Tübingen, he was ordained in [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz|Mainz]] in 1910. He briefly worked in a pastoral position before returning to Freiburg to work on his doctorate in Theology under Engelbert Krebs. He received his doctorate in 1915 for a dissertation on [[Bonaventure]]. He completed his "[[Habilitation]]" in [[Dogmatic Theology]] at the [[University of Bonn]] in 1922, again with a dissertation on Bonaventure. Throughout this period he also worked as a chaplain to the Catholic youth movement.

In 1923 he was appointed to a chair in [[Philosophy of Religion]] at the [[University of Berlin]]. In the 1935 essay "Der Heiland" (The Saviour) he criticized Nazi mythologizing of the person of Jesus and emphasized the Jewishness of Jesus. The [[Nazis]] forced him to resign from his Berlin position in 1939. From 1943 to 1945 he retired to [[Mooshausen]], where his friend [[:de:Josef Weiger|Josef Weiger]] had been parish priest since 1917.

In 1945 Guardini was appointed professor in the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Tübingen]] and resumed lecturing on the Philosophy of Religion. In 1948, he became professor at the [[University of Munich]], where he remained until retiring for health reasons in 1962.

Guardini died in [[Munich, Bavaria]] on 1 October 1968. He was buried in the priests’ cemetery of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri in Munich. His estate was left to the Catholic Academy in Bavaria that he had co-founded.

== Reputation and influence ==
Guardini's books were often powerful studies of traditional themes in the light of present-day challenges or examinations of current problems as approached from the Christian, and especially Catholic, tradition. He was able to get inside such different worldviews as those of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Dante]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [[Kierkegaard]], [[Dostojevski]] and [[Nietzsche]], and make sense of them for modern readers.

His first major work, ''Vom Geist der Liturgie'' (The Spirit of the Liturgy), published during the [[First World War]], was a major influence on the [[Liturgical Movement]] in Germany and by extension on the liturgical reforms of the [[Second Vatican Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Anthony Krieg, ''Romano Guardini: A Precursor of Vatican II''. University of Notre Dame Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-268-01661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally regarded as the father of the liturgical movement in Germany, and in his "Open Letter" of April 1964 to Mgr. Johannes Wagner, the organizer of the Third German Liturgical Congress in Mainz, he "raises important questions regarding the nature of the liturgical act in the wake of individualism, asking whether it is possible for twentieth-century Christians really to engage in worship. Is it possible to 'relearn a forgotten way of doing things and recapture lost attitudes', so as to enter into the liturgical experience?."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradshaw &amp; Melloh|title=Foundations in Ritual Studies: A Reader for Students of Christian Worship|date=2007|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=0-8010-3499-X|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his glad hope that after the call by the Second Vatican Council for liturgical reform, the Church might shift its focus from that of mere ceremonial (though important) to the broader idea of true liturgical action, an act which "embraced not only a spiritual inwardness, but the whole man, body as well as spirit."&lt;ref name="Open Letter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guardini|first1=Romano|title=Open Letter|url=http://www.ecclesiadei.nl/docs/guardini.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He himself gave an example of his meaning: A parish priest of the late 19th century once said (according to Guardini's illustration), "We must organize the procession better; we must see to it that the praying and singing is done better." For Guardini, the parish priest had missed the point of what true liturgical action is. The questions he had asked should have been different. They should have been, "How can the act of walking become a religious act, a retinue for the Lord progressing through his land, so that an 'epiphany' may take place."&lt;ref name="Open Letter"/&gt; [[Pope Paul VI]] offered to make him a cardinal in 1965, but he declined.

As a philosopher he founded no "school", but his intellectual disciples could in some sense be said to include [[Josef Pieper]], [[Luigi Giussani]], [[Felix Messerschmid]], [[Heinrich Getzeny]], [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]], [[Jean Gebser]], [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), and [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]] (later [[Pope Francis]]). In the 1980s Bergoglio began work on a doctoral dissertation on Guardini, though he never completed it. Pope Francis cited Guardini's ''The End of the Modern World'' eight times in his 2015 [[encyclical]] ''[[Laudato si']]'', more often than any other modern thinker who was not pope. [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Iring Fetscher]] were favourably impressed by Guardini's work. He had a strong influence in Central Europe; in [[Slovenia]], for example, an influential group of [[Christian socialist]]s, among whom [[Edvard Kocbek]], [[Pino Mlakar]], [[Vekoslav Grmič]] and [[Boris Pahor]], incorporated Guardini's views in their agenda. Slovak philosopher and theologian Ladislav Hanus was strongly influenced in his works by Guardini, whom he met personally, and promoted his ideas in Slovakia, writing a short monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Hanus, Ladislav. ''Romano Guardini: Mysliteľ a pedagóg storočia''. LÚČ, Bratislava, 1994. {{ISBN|80-7114-124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, Guardini won the [[Peace Prize of the German Book Trade]].

The 1990s saw something of a revival of interest in his works and person. Several of his books were reissued in the original German and in English translation. In 1997 his remains were moved to the ''[[Ludwigskirche (Munich)|Sankt Ludwig Kirche]]'', the University church in Munich, where he had often preached.

Guardini's book ''[[The Lord (book)|The Lord]]'', published in English translation in the late 1940s, remained in print for decades&lt;ref&gt;It was still in print as of 2012, with an ''Introduction'' by [[Pope Benedict XVI]]. {{ISBN|978-0-89526-714-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to publisher Henry Regnery, was "one of the most successful books I have ever published."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.conservativeclassics.com/books/Dissidentbk/book3.pdf |last= Regnery |first= Henry S. |title= Memoirs of a Dissident Publisher |publisher= Regnery Gateway Inc. |location= Lake Bluff, Illinois |date= 1985 |accessdate= 8 September 2007 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071201044256/http://www.conservativeclassics.com/books/Dissidentbk/book3.pdf |archivedate= 1 December 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Flannery O'Connor]] thought it "very fine" and recommended it to a number of her friends.&lt;ref&gt;Flannery O’Connor, ''The Habit of Being.

'''''Social Theory of International Politics''''' is an academic book by [[Alexander Wendt]]. It expresses a constructivist approach to the study of international relations&lt;ref&gt;Kratochwil, Friedrich, Constructing a New Orthodoxy? Wendt's `Social Theory of International Politics' and the Constructivist Challenge, Millennium - Journal of International Studies January 2000 29: 73-101, {{doi|10.1177/03058298000290010901}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the leading texts within the constructivist approach to international relations scholarship.

''Social Theory of International Politics'' expresses a theory that emphasises the role of shared ideas and norms in shaping state behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/55448/g-john-ikenberry/social-theory-of-international-politics&lt;/ref&gt; It is critical of both liberal and realists approaches to the study of international relations which, Wendt argues, emphasize materialist and individualistic motivations for state actions rather than norms and shared values as Wendt argues they should.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/55448/g-john-ikenberry/social-theory-of-international-politics&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of ''Social Theory of International Politics'' in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' G. John Ikenberry argues that the first section of the book is a "winding tour" of constructivism's underpinning. After this Wendt explores possible alternative "cultures" of international relations - Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian - a result of his view that anarchy does not necessarily mean that states must adopt egotistical self-help behaviour. Wendt further explores this view in an influential journal article "[[Anarchy Is What States Make of It]]" published in the journal ''[[International Organization]]''.

The book was the winner of International Studies Association Best Book of the Decade Award 1991-2000.  The title is a reference to Kenneth Waltz's 1979 work ''[[Theory of International Politics]]''.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=February 2014}}

&lt;ref&gt;Wendt, Alexander, dan Daniel Friedheim. "Hierarchy under Anarchy: Informal Empire and the East German State." International Organization 49, no. 4 (1995): 689-721.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four sociologies of international politics===

==Part I: Social Theory==

===Scientific realism and social kinds===

===Ideas all the way down?===

===Structure, agency and culture===

==Part II: International Politics==

===The state and the problem of corporate agency===

===Three cultures of anarchy===
In this chapter Wendt challenges the neorealist view of anarchy and argues that several cultures of anarchy can dominate. These are called Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian cultures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.olivialau.org/ir/archive/wen4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process and structural change===

===Conclusion===

==Criticism==

===Realist criticism===
In a review essay called "The Constructivist Challenge to Structural Realism" Dale Copeland argues from a structural realist perspective and states that Wendt fails to take into account how uncertainty impacts state behaviour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Notwithstanding Wendt's important contributions to international relations theory, his critique of structural realism has inherent flaws. Most important, it does not adequately address a critical aspect of the realist worldview: the problem of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Review: The Copeland, D. (2000) Constructivist Challenge to Structural Realism: A Review Essay, ''International Security'', Vol. 25, No. 2 (Autumn, 2000), pp. 187-212&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Constructivist criticism===
Wendt admits that his version of constructivism is a "thin" version of  constructivism as it “concedes important points to materialist and individualist perspectives [of neorealism] and endorses a scientific approach to social inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), p1&lt;/ref&gt; As such it has been criticised from the position of more radical "thick" constructivists who give less ground to rationalist theories, like Roxanne Lynn Doty,&lt;ref&gt;Roxanne Lynn Doty,  "Desire All the Way Down", 'Review of International Studies, Vol. 26, No. 1 (Jan., 2000), pp. 137-139&lt;/ref&gt; Stefano Guzzini,&lt;ref&gt;Guzzini, Stefano (2000) ‘A Reconstruction of Constructivism in International Relations’, European Journal of International Relations 6(2): 147–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich Kratochwill,&lt;ref&gt;"Friedrich Kratochwill, Constructing a New Orthodoxy? Wendt’s ‘Social Theory of International Politics’ and the Constructivist Challenge" in: Millennium (2000), vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 73–101.&lt;/ref&gt; and Maja Zehfuss.&lt;ref&gt;Maja Zehfuss, “'Constructivism in International Relations: The Politics of Reality'”, Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[statistical significance]] and success rate, the study outperformed similar studies of other psychological interventions for chronic back pain.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

==Symptoms==
Back pain is frequently mentioned as a TMS symptom,&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ucla"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.ucla.edu/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=159 |title=Back Pain: An Unconventional Approach |accessdate=2007-09-12 |last=Greenberg |first=Jerome |date=2000-02-01 |work=Proceedings of UCLA Healthcare |publisher=UCLA Department of Medicine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111220838/http://www.med.ucla.edu/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=159 |archivedate=11 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coen"/&gt; but Sarno defines TMS symptoms much more broadly than that:
* ''Symptom type:'' TMS symptoms include [[pain]], [[stiffness]], [[weakness]], [[paresthesia|tingling]], [[numbness]], [[muscle contracture]]s, [[cramp]]s and other negative sensations, according to Sarno.
* ''Symptom location:'' In addition to the back, Sarno states that TMS symptoms can occur in the [[neck]], [[knee]], [[arm]]s, [[wrists]], and other parts of the body.&lt;ref name="medscape1"/&gt;  Schechter states that the symptoms have a tendency to move to other parts of the body.  He considers symptom movement an important indicator that the pain is from TMS.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Below is a list of criteria for diagnosing TMS, according to Schechter and Sarno:
*''Lack of known physical cause:''  Schechter and Sarno state that a [[physical examination]], tests and [[imaging studies]] is needed to rule out serious conditions, such as tumors.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarno1"/&gt; Sarno considers [[spinal disc herniation]]s to generally be harmless, because he says the symptom location does not even correlate to the herniation location.&lt;ref name="sarno1"/&gt;
*''Tender points:''&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt; While medical doctors use eleven of eighteen tender points as a diagnostic criteria for [[fibromyalgia]], Sarno states that he uses six main tender points to diagnose TMS:  two tender points in the upper [[trapezius muscles]], two in the [[lumbar paraspinal]] muscles and two in the lateral upper [[buttocks]]. He states that these are found in 99% of TMS patients.&lt;ref name="sarno3"/&gt;
*''History of other psychosomatic disorders:''  Schechter and Sarno consider a prior history of other psychosomatic disorders an indication that the patient may have TMS.  They list [[irritable bowel syndrome]] and [[tension headache]] as examples of [[psychosomatic disorders]].&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sarno3"/&gt;

Schechter and Sarno state that if a patient is unable to visit a medical doctor who is trained in TMS, then the patient should see a traditional medical doctor to rule out serious disorders, such as [[fractures]], [[tumors]] and [[infections]].&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="schechter05"/&gt;

==Treatment==

===Treatment protocol===
The treatment protocol for TMS includes education, writing about emotional issues and resumption of a normal lifestyle.  For patients who do not recover quickly, the protocol also includes support groups and/or psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt;

Sarno's protocol for treatment of TMS is used by the Harvard RSI Action Group, a student volunteer organization, as part of their preventative education and support program for people with [[repetitive strain injury]], also referred to as "RSI".&lt;ref name="harvard-RSI"&gt;Harvard RSI Action Group: [http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/handout.doc handout document], and [http://www.rsi.deas.harvard.edu/mb_what_is.html website]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Education
Education may take the form of office visits, lectures and written and audio materials. The content of the education includes the psychological and physiological aspects of TMS.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt; According to Schechter, the education allows the patients to "learn that their physical condition is actually benign and that any disability they have is a function of pain-related fear and deconditioning, not the actual risk of further 're-injury.'"&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

;Writing about emotional issues
Sarno states that each patient should set aside time daily to think and write about issues that could have led to the patient's repressed emotions.  He recommends the following two [[Writing therapy|writing tasks]]:
* ''Writing a list of issues.'' Dr. Sarno states that each patient should try to list out all issues that might contribute to the patient's repressed emotions. He suggests looking in the following areas:  
**(a) certain childhood experiences, such as [[Child abuse|abuse]] or lack of love, 
**(b) personality traits such as [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], [[conscientiousness]] and a strong need to be liked, approved or validated by everyone, 
**(c) current life stresses and pressures, 
**(d) [[aging]] and mortality and 
**(e) situations in which the patient experiences conscious but unexpressed anger.
* ''Writing essays.'' Dr. Sarno recommends that the patient write an essay for each item on the above list. He prefers longer essays because they force the patient to examine the emotional issues in depth.&lt;ref name="sarno2"/&gt;

Schechter developed a 30-day daily journal called "The MindBody Workbook" to assist the patient in recording emotionally significant events and making correlations between those events and their physical symptoms. According to Sarno and Schechter, daily repetition of the psychological process over time defeats the repression through conscious awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Schechter D. The MindBody Workbook. Los Angeles: MindBody Medicine Publications, 1999, {{ISBN|1-929997-05-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Resumption of a normal lifestyle
To return to a normal lifestyle, patients are told to take the following actions:
* ''Discontinuation of physical treatments -'' Sarno advises patients to stop using [[spinal manipulation]], [[physical therapy]] and other physical treatments because "they tend to reinforce erroneously a structural causation for the chronic pain."&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt;
* ''Resumption of normal physical activity -'' Schechter states that patients are encouraged to "gradually be more active, and begin to resume a normal life."&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt; In addition, patients are encouraged "to discontinue the safety behaviours aimed at protecting their 'damaged' backs".&lt;ref name="schechter05"/&gt;

;Support meetings
Sarno uses support meetings for patients who do not make a prompt recovery.  Sarno states that the support meetings (a) allow the patients to explore emotional issues that may be causing their symptoms and (b) review concepts covered during the earlier education.&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt;

;Psychotherapy
Sarno says that about 20% of his patients need [[psychotherapy]]. He states that he uses "short-term, dynamic, analytically oriented psychotherapy."&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt; Schechter says that he uses psychotherapy for about 30% of his patients, and that six to ten sessions are needed per patient.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

;Recovery Program
Alan Gordon, LCSW has created a TMS recovery program on the [http://www.tmswiki.org/ppd/The_Tension_Myositis_Syndrome_Wiki TMS Wiki], which includes various articles, exercises, and segments from sessions exemplifying therapeutic concepts.

===Medical evidence===
While [[psychogenic pain]] and [[pain disorder]] are accepted diagnoses in the medical community, the TMS modality is more controversial.

A non-peer-reviewed 2005 study by Schechter at the Seligman Medical Institute (SMI), co-authored with institute director Arthur Smith, found that treatment of TMS achieved a 57% success rate among patients with chronic back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors=Schechter D, Smith AP | year=2005 | title=Long-Term Outcome of Back Pain Patients Treated by a Psychologically Based Program (Abstract #1112) | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=A–101 | url=http://www.psychosomatic.org/events/2005meetingabstracts.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=2006-09-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927065750/http://www.psychosomatic.org/events/2005meetingabstracts.pdf | archivedate=27 September 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A peer-reviewed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternative-therapies.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/Content.Main/id/45 |title=Info for Authors|work=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|accessdate=2010-01-30 |publisher=InnoVision Communications, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007 study with Schechter, Smith and Stanley Azen, Professor and Co-Director of [[Biostatistics]] in the Department of Preventative Medicine at the [[University of Southern California|USC]] Keck School of Medicine, found a 54% success rate for treatment of TMS (''P''&lt;.00001).  The treatment consisted of office visits, at-home educational materials, writing about emotional issues and psychotherapy.  The average pain duration for the study's patients was 9 years.  Patients with less than 6 months of back pain were excluded to "control for the confounder that most back pain episodes typically resolve on their own in a few weeks."&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

Schechter, Smith and Azen also compared their results to the results of three studies of other psychological treatments for chronic back pain.  The three non-TMS studies were selected because of (a) their quality, as judged by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], and (b) the similarity of their pain measurements to those used in the TMS study.  Of the three non-TMS studies, only one (the Turner study) showed a statistically significant improvement.  Compared to the 2007 TMS study, the Turner study had a lower success rate (26%-35%, depending on the type of psychological treatment) and a lower level of statistical significance (''P''&lt;.05).&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

Schechter, ''et al.''  state that one advantage of TMS treatment is that it avoids the risks associated with surgery and medication, but they caution that the risks of TMS treatment are somewhat unknown due to the relatively low number of patients studied so far.&lt;ref name="schechter07"/&gt;

==Theory==
According to Sarno, TMS is a condition in which unconscious emotional issues (primarily rage) initiate a process that causes physical [[pain]] and other symptoms.  His theory suggests that the unconscious mind uses the [[autonomic nervous system]] to decrease [[blood flow]] to [[muscle]]s, [[nerves]] or [[tendons]], resulting in [[oxygen deprivation]] (temporary micro-[[ischemia]]) and [[metabolite]] accumulation, experienced as pain in the affected tissues.&lt;ref name="medscape1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rashbaum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ruden"&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Ruden  RA | title=Encoding States: A Model for the Origin and Treatment of Complex Psychogenic Pain | journal=Traumatology | year=2008 | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=119–126 | url=http://www.healingthemind.net/Encode3.pdf | doi=10.1177/1534765608315625 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323072611/http://www.healingthemind.net/Encode3.pdf | archivedate=23 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarno theorizes that because patients often report that back pain seems to move around, up and down the spine, or from side to side, that this implies the pain may not be caused by a physical deformity or injury.&lt;ref name = "sarno3"/&gt;

Sarno states that the underlying cause of the pain is the mind's defense mechanism against [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] mental stress and emotions such as [[anger]], [[anxiety]] and [[narcissistic rage]]. The [[conscious mind]] is distracted by the physical pain, as the [[psychological repression]] process keeps the anger/rage contained in the unconscious and thereby prevented from entering conscious [[awareness]].&lt;ref name="coen"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Coen SJ, Sarno JE |title=Psychosomatic avoidance of conflict in back pain |journal=The Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=359–76 |year=1989 |pmid=2530198 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enigma"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Cailliet | first = René  | title = Low Back Disorders: A Medical Enigma  | publisher = Wolters Kluwer Health  | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-7817-4448-2   | page = 14  | authorlink = Rene Cailliet }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarno believes that when patients recognize that the symptoms are only a distraction, the symptoms then serve no purpose, and they go away. TMS can be considered a psychosomatic condition and  has been referred to as a "distraction pain syndrome".&lt;ref name="schechter05"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors=Schechter D, Smith AP | title=Back pain as a distraction pain syndrome (DPS): A window to a whole new dynamic in integrative medicine | journal=Evidence Based Integrative Medicine | year=2005 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3–8 | url=http://www.smi-mindbodyresearch.org/DistractionPain.htm | doi=10.2165/01197065-200502010-00002 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408225556/http://smi-mindbodyresearch.org/DistractionPain.htm | archivedate=8 April 2016 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarno is a vocal critic of [[conventional medicine]] with regard to diagnosis and treatment of [[back pain]], which is often treated by rest, [[physical therapy]], exercise and/or surgery.&lt;ref name="sarno1"/&gt;

==Notable patients==
Notable patients who have been treated for TMS include the following:
*Radio personality [[Howard Stern]] credited TMS treatment with the relief of his "excruciating back and shoulder pain",&lt;ref name="mindbody-back-cover"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain | publisher = Warner Books | year = 1998 | last = Sarno | first = John E. | authorlink = John E.

*''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' co-anchor [[John Stossel]] was treated by Sarno for his chronic debilitating back pain.&lt;ref name="prevention"/&gt;  In a ''20/20'' segment on his former doctor, Stossel stated his opinion that the TMS treatment "cured" his back pain, although he admitted that he continues to have relapses of pain.&lt;ref name="20-20"/&gt;
*Television writer and producer [[Janette Barber]] said that for three years, she had been increasingly unable to walk, and eventually began to use a wheelchair, due to severe ankle pain originally diagnosed as [[tendinitis]].&lt;ref name="larryking"/&gt;  She was later diagnosed and treated for TMS.  According to Barber, she was "pain-free one week after [Sarno's] lecture" and able to walk and run within a few months,&lt;ref name="20-20"/&gt;&lt;ref name="larryking"/&gt;&lt;ref name=foodnetwork&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/hosts_celebrity_chefs/article/0,1974,FOOD_9889_1842044,00.html  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308142934/http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/hosts_celebrity_chefs/article/0,1974,FOOD_9889_1842044,00.html  |dead-url=yes  |archive-date=8 March 2005  |title=Janette Barber (Food Network host biography)  |accessdate=2008-01-25  |df=dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; notwithstanding her "occasional" relapses of pain.&lt;ref name="larryking"/&gt;
*The late actress [[Anne Bancroft]] said that she saw several doctors for back pain, but only Sarno's TMS treatment helped her.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20-20"/&gt;
*The acclaimed filmmaker [[Terry Zwigoff]] said he was on the verge of suicide due to his debilitating back pain, until he turned in desperation to Sarno's method and it "saved [his] life", as well as the life of a woman he told about it more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/terry-zwigoff|title=TERRY ZWIGOFF|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The TMS diagnosis and treatment protocol are not accepted by the mainstream medical community.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="20-20"/&gt;  Sarno himself stated in a 2004 interview with ''[[Medscape]] Orthopaedics &amp; Sports Medicine'' that "99.999% of the medical profession does not accept this diagnosis."&lt;ref name="medscape1"/&gt;  Although the vast majority of medical doctors do not accept TMS, there are prominent doctors who do. [[Andrew Weil]], a notable medical doctor and [[alternative medicine]] proponent, endorses TMS treatment for back pain.&lt;ref name=weilsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA400205 | first = Andrew | last = Weil |title=Help for an Aching Back? |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weilbook"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Weil | first = Andrew | title = Spontaneous Healing: How to Discover and Enhance Your Body's Natural Ability to Maintain and Heal Itself | url = http://tmswiki.wetpaint.com/page/TMS+In+The+Media/revision/8 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130111122055/http://tmswiki.wetpaint.com/page/TMS+In+The+Media/revision/8 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = Ballantine Books | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-449-91064-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mehmet Oz]], a television personality and Professor of Surgery at [[Columbia University]], includes TMS treatment in his four recommendations for treating back pain.&lt;ref name=oz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/health/Dr-Oz-Treatments-for-Low-Back-Pain| first = Mehmet| last = Oz |title=4 Treatments for Low Back Pain |date=2009-09-15 |work=Oprah.com |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard E. Sall, a medical doctor who authored a book on worker's compensation, includes TMS in a list of conditions he considers possible causes of back pain resulting in missed work days that increase the costs of worker's compensation programs.&lt;ref name="hall"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sall, MD  | first = Richard E.  | title = Strategies in Workers' Compensation | publisher = Hamilton Books | year = 2004  | isbn = 0-7618-2771-4   | page = 91 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics in mainstream medicine state that neither the theory of TMS nor the effectiveness of the treatment has been proven in a properly controlled [[clinical trial]],&lt;ref name="sarno2"/&gt; citing the [[placebo effect]] and [[regression to the mean]] as possible explanations for its success.  Patients typically see their doctor when the pain is at its worst and pain chart scores statistically improve over time even if left untreated; most people recover from an episode of back pain within weeks without any medical intervention at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pengel LH, Herbert RD, Maher CG, Refshauge KM |title=Acute low back pain: systematic review of its prognosis |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7410 |page=323 |year=2003 |pmid=12907487 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7410.323 |pmc=169642}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The TMS theory has also been criticized as too simplistic to account for the complexity of pain syndromes.&lt;ref name="20-20"/&gt; James Rainville, a medical doctor at New England Baptist Hospital, said that while TMS treatment works for some patients, Sarno mistakenly uses the TMS diagnosis for other patients who have real physical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-57116120.html |author=Lasalandra, Michael |title=Gettin back to basics; Doctor believes tension, trauma to blame for pain. |work=The Boston Herald |date=11 May 1999 |accessdate=28 August 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarno response was that he had success with many patients who have exhausted every other means of treatment, which he said is proof that regression to the mean is not the cause.&lt;ref name="20-20"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6730">A '''thought collective''', a term originated in German as "''Denkkollektiv''" by the Polish and Israeli physician [[Ludwik Fleck]], is a community of researchers who interact collectively towards the production or elaboration of knowledge using a shared framework of cultural customs and knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/fleck/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Sady|first=Wojciech|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1935 book ''[[Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache; Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv]],'' Fleck identified the scientific production of knowledge as primarily a social process that hinges upon prior discoveries and practices in a way that constrains and preconditions new ideas and concepts. He termed this shared collection of preexisting knowledge a "''Denkstil''" or '''thought style''' and formulated a comparative epistemology of science using these two ideas.

== ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' ==
[[Ludwik Fleck]], a Polish and Israeli physician and biologist working during the 20th century, developed an idea of scientific knowledge creation as being primarily a social practice dependent on the cultural and historical practices within which researchers find themselves. He elaborated this idea with a series of examples in the 1935 essay ''Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache'', together with a book of the same name, however, his ideas went largely unnoticed until Thomas Kuhn's rediscovery of them in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Ludwik. Entstehung Und Entwicklung Einer Wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in Die Lehre Vom Denkstil Und Denkkollectiv. Basel: B. Schwabe, 1935. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the text, Fleck uses the identification of syphilis in the late-1800s and early-1900s as an example of a scientific fact that was supremely conditioned by the historical and social context in which it was discovered. He likens the statement that a scientific fact has been ascertained to a statement of the type "'someone recognizes something,'" a statement meaningless without further context. He continues the example to state that just as the sentence "'Town A is situated to the left of town B'" is incomplete without an observational reference frame, such as "'to someone walking on the road from town C to town B,'" so too is a scientific discovery incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1979|isbn=0226253244|editor-last=Merton|editor-first=Robert K.|location=Chicago|pages=38–50|translator-last=Bradley|translator-first=Fred|translator-last2=Trenn|translator-first2=Thaddeus J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleck's goal for this discussion was to situate the discovery of new scientific facts, a form of epistemological cognition, within the greater environment of knowledge that encompasses them. He promotes with the idea of the ''"Denkkollektiv"'' the tenant that any discovery is an interaction between at least three things, namely the discovered phenomenon, the discoverer, and the existing pool of knowledge from which they draw. By interacting socially in their production of knowledge, researchers produce common concepts and practices that they use to discuss and debate one another's ideas and discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;Brorson, Stig, and Hanne Andersen. “Stabilizing and Changing Phenomenal Worlds: Ludwik Fleck and Thomas Kuhn on Scientific Literature.” ''Journal for General Philosophy of Science / Zeitschrift Für Allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie'', vol. 32, no. 1, 2001, pp. 109–129., www.jstor.org/stable/25171193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stump, David. “The Role of Skill in Experimentation: Reading Ludwik Fleck's Study of the Wasserman Reaction as an Example of Ian Hacking's Experimental Realism.” ''PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association'', vol. 1988, 1988, pp. 302–308., www.jstor.org/stable/192997.&lt;/ref&gt; These common concepts and practices both provide a shared language of science within which they can communicate, and consequently limit the possibilities of thought that the researchers can have. Under the influence of a particular "thought style," the common concepts and practices previously mentioned, a community of researchers "shares joint attributes of problems and judgments considered as evident, joint methods to acquire knowledge, and agrees in the determination of meaningless questions."&lt;ref&gt;Forstner, Christian. “The Early History of David Bohm's Quantum Mechanics Through the Perspective of Ludwik Fleck's Thought-Collectives.” ''Minerva'', vol. 46, no. 2, 2008, pp. 215–229., www.jstor.org/stable/41821460.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this conception of the production of scientific knowledge, the ideas, concepts, and theories of these researchers are permanently conditioned by their present "thought style" and cannot be considered independently of them.

As a result of his formulation of the thought style and thought collective concepts, Fleck attempted to situate the individual scientific discoverer within the system of individuals that compromise the community of interacting researchers. To this end, he maintained that the individual's only contribution to the production of new knowledge is the determination of results that follow from established conceptual preconditions. As he states, "the preconditions correspond to active linkages and constitute that portion of cognition belonging to the collective."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ascertaining of scientific knowledge as such is a result of connections between concepts and ideas that are laid out by the community of researchers, laying the groundwork from which individual researchers can draw their conclusions. Just as a soccer player makes little progress in a game without their interactions among a cooperating team, an individual researcher is lost without the thought collective that shapes their approach to scientific practice. Extending this analogy, ideas and concepts exchange between individuals in the thought collective like passes in a soccer match, each time gaining new directions and a change in momentum. With the greater collective and style of practice taken into account, scientific discoveries can be considered as communal social products influenced by the particular milieu that surrounds them.

[[File:Julius Nyerere cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Julius Nyerere]]]]
'''''Ujamaa''''' ('familyhood' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) was the concept that formed the basis of [[Julius Nyerere]]'s social and economic [[Economic development|development]] policies in [[Tanzania]] after it gained independence from Britain in 1961.

== History ==

===Ideology and practice===
In 1967, President Nyerere published his development blueprint, which was titled the [[Arusha Declaration]], in which Nyerere pointed out the need for an African model of development and that formed the basis of [[African socialism]].  The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word ''[[wikt:ujamaa|ujamaa]]'' means 'extended family', 'brotherhood' or 'socialism'; as a political concept it asserts that a person becomes a person ''through the people'' or community. He is declared servant of God in the Roman catholic Church for his resilient commitment to encourage the art of neighborliness among Tanzanians. The spirit of 'others' or 'community' bringing units of families together, and fostering cohesion, love and service. 

Nyerere used Ujamaa as the basis for a national development project.  He translated the Ujamaa concept into a political-economic management model through several means:

* The creation of a [[one-party system]] under the leadership of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]] (TANU), alleging the need to solidify the cohesion of the newly independent [[Tanzania]].
* The [[institutionalization]] of social, economic, and political equality through the creation of a central democracy; the abolition of [[discrimination]] based on [[ascribed status]]; and the [[nationalization]] of the economy's key sectors.&lt;ref name="Cranford"&gt;{{cite journal | first=Cranford | last=Pratt | year=1999 | title=Julius Nyerere: Reflections on the Legacy of his Socialism | journal=Canadian Journal of African Studies | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=137–52 | doi=10.2307/486390}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[villagization]] of production, which essentially collectivized all forms of local  productive capacity.
* The fostering of Tanzanian [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] through two dimensions: the transformation of economic and cultural attitudes. Economically, everyone would work for both the group and for him/herself; culturally, Tanzanians must learn to free themselves from dependence on European powers. For Nyerere, this included Tanzanians learning to do things for themselves and learning to be satisfied with what they could achieve as an independent state.
* The implementation of free and [[compulsory education]] for all Tanzanians in order to sensitize them to the principles of Ujamaa.&lt;ref name="Cranford"/&gt;
* The creation of a Tanzanian rather than tribal identity through means such as the use of [[Swahili language|Swahili]]

Julius Nyerere's leadership of Tanzania commanded international attention and attracted worldwide respect for his consistent emphasis upon ethical principles as the basis of practical policies. Tanzania under Nyerere made great strides in vital areas of social development: infant mortality was reduced from 138 per 1000 live births in 1965 to 110 in 1985; life expectancy at birth rose from 37 in 1960 to 52 in 1984; primary school enrollment was raised from 25% of age group (only 16% of females) in 1960 to 72% (85% of females) in 1985 (despite the rapidly increasing population); the adult literacy rate rose from 17% in 1960 to 63% by 1975 (much higher than in other African countries) and continued to rise.&lt;ref name="mwalimu"&gt;{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ASWWRgOqk78C&amp;pg=PA141 | title=Mwalimu: the influence of Nyerere | author=Colin Legum, G. R. V. Mmari}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ujamaa (like many other collectivization projects) decreased production, casting serious doubt on the project's ability to offer economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20171366 Martin Plaut, "Africa's bright future"], ''BBC News Magazine'', 2 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyerere used a colonial law, the Preventive Detention Act, to crush opposition.&lt;ref name="mwalimu"/&gt;

In 1967, nationalizations transformed the government into the largest employer in the country. Purchasing power declined,&lt;ref name=stapenhurst&gt;Rick Stapenhurst, Sahr John Kpundeh. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eLh72ZUQcssC&amp;pg=PA3 ''Curbing corruption: toward a model for building national integrity'']. Pp. 153-156.&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to World Bank researchers, high taxes and bureaucracy created an environment where businessmen resorted to evasion, bribery and corruption.&lt;ref name=stapenhurst/&gt; In 1973, a policy of forced villagisation was pursued under [[Operation Vijiji]] in order to promote collective farming.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Siri. (2008) ''[http://www.cmi.no/publications/publication/?3008=land-tenure-and-mining-in-tanzania Land Tenure and Mining In Tanzania]''. Bergen: Chr. Michelson Institute, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline and end===
Eventually a number of factors contributed to the downfall of the development model based on the Ujamaa concept. Among those factors were the [[1970s energy crisis|oil crisis]] of the 1970s, the collapse of export commodity prices (particularly [[coffee]] and [[sisal]]), a lack of foreign direct investment, two successive droughts, and the onset of the [[Uganda-Tanzania War|war with Uganda]] in 1978, which bled the young Tanzanian nation of valuable resources. By 1985 it was clear that Ujamaa had failed to lift Tanzania out of its poor economic state; Nyerere announced that he would retire voluntarily after presidential elections that same year.

==In popular culture==
The [[hip-hop]] scene in Tanzania was greatly influenced by the key ideas and themes of Ujamaa. At the turn of the century, the principles of Ujamaa were resurrected through "an unlikely source: rappers and hip hop artists in the streets of Tanzania."&lt;ref name="lemelle"&gt;Lemelle, Sidney J. "‘Ni wapi Tunakwenda’: Hip Hop Culture and the Children of Arusha". In ''The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture'', ed. Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, pp. 230–54. London; Ann Arbor, MI: Pluto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to years of corrupt government leaders and political figures after Nyerere, themes of unity and family and equality were the messages sent out in a majority of the music being produced. This was in response to the working class oppression and in some sense a form of resistance.&lt;ref name="lemelle"/&gt; The principles of cooperative economics —"local people cooperating with each other to provide for the essentials of living"—&lt;ref&gt;[http://austinweeklynews.1upsoftware.com/main.asp?SectionID=3&amp;SubSectionID=3&amp;ArticleID=455&amp;TM=2172.822 Denied:1up! Software&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; can be seen in the lyrics of many Tanzanian hip-hop artists. They promote self-business and self-made identities in an effort to raise the spirits of the youth and promote change in society.

''Ujamaa'', understood as "Cooperative Economics", is also the fourth of seven principles of the African-American celebration of [[Kwanzaa]]: "To build and maintain our own stores, shops, and other businesses and to profit from them together."

''Ujamaa'' is also the African-American themed undergraduate dorm at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://resed.stanford.edu/house-profiles/theme-houses/ethnic/ujamaa&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8818">{{Chinese salvationism}}
The '''Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 儒宗神教 ''Rúzōng Shénjiào''), also called the '''Luandao''' (鸾道 "Phoenix Way" or 鸾门 ''Luánmén'', "Phoenix Gate")&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, pp. 27-30&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Luanism''' (鸾教 ''Luánjiào'')&lt;ref&gt;Clart, Jones. 2003. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; or—from the name of its cell congregations—the '''phoenix halls''' or '''phoenix churches''' (鸾堂 ''luántáng''), is a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] [[Chinese salvationist religions|congregational religious movement]] of the [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese traditional beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The first phoenix hall was established in [[Magong, Taiwan|Magong]], the capital of the [[Penghu]] Islands, in 1853, and from there the movement spread throughout mainland [[China]] and Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Other names of the movement are '''Rumen''' (儒门 "Confucian Gate[way]) or '''Holy Church of the Confucian Tradition''' (儒宗圣教 ''Rúzōng Shèngjiào'').&lt;ref&gt;Clart, Jones. 2003. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the phoenix halls is to honour the gods through Confucian [[orthopraxy]] (''rú'' 儒 style),&lt;ref&gt;Clart, Jones. 2003. p. 72. Quote: «[...] ''ru'', perhaps best rendered in English as "literati", connects one with the literary style of religious activity in which these groups specialize.»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 24; quote from the statute of the Shenxian Tang (one of the leading phoenix halls): «''That this is called a "phoenix hall" means that it adheres to the Confucian tradition and the teachings of the gods. Therefore it is called "Divine Teachings of the Confucian Tradition". [...]''»&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 27; quote from the statute of the Wumiao Mingzheng Tang: «''The Phoenix School carries on [the work of] Heaven in response to the cyclical movement [of the ages]. Taking Confucianism as its tradition and the gods as [the source of] its teachings.''»&lt;/ref&gt; spreading morality through public lectures and divinely-inspired books (善书 ''shànshū'').&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The Confucian Way of the Gods is defined as '''Houtiandao''' (后天道 "Way of Later Heaven" or "Way of the Manifested") by the antagonistic [[Xiantiandao]] (先天道 "Way of Former Heaven" or "Way of the Primordial") traditions, which claim to be closer to the God of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Clart, 1997. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and doctrine==
[[File:10th century chinese wall panel - detail 08.jpg|thumb|150px|The ''[[fenghuang]]'' as a detail of a 10th-century Chinese relief.]]
The phoenix halls are concerned with the [[salvation]] of the disciples, which basically means [[deification]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; This is worked on in a long process of "cultivating the Way" ([[Tao]]), that is the right mode of living through the basic virtues of benevolence (''ren''), righteousness (''yi''), propriety (''li''), and filial piety (''xiao'').&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Realising the virtues one reaches the state of continuous sincerity (''cheng'') and peace and purity of mind (''jing''), proceeding successfully in the cultivation of one's inner numinous nature (''lingxing'').&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The cultivation of the Way is conceptualised as a path of learning.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol of the [[fenghuang|phoenix]] represents spiritual renewal of the disciple and the social community.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the phoenix halls started in 1853 when a ''[[fuji (planchette writing)|fuji]]''-inspired cult was established in [[Magong, Taiwan|Magong]], the capital of the [[Penghu]] archipelago between [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Magong intellectuals sent a prominent ''[[tongji (spirit medium)|tongji]]'' to [[Quanzhou]], in Fujian, to learn the practice of ''fuji'' from the local Society for Public Goodness (公善社 ''Gōngshànshè'').&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; When the tongji returned in the same year he established the Society for Universal Exhortation (普劝社 ''Pǔquànshè'') to recreate moral conduct, proclaiming the ''Sacred Edict''.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The activities of the society dwindled over the years, especially during the [[Sino-French War]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reformed as the Society for Complete Renewal (一新社 ''Yīxīnshè'') by six government students, in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It held regular public lecturing sessions given by carefully chosen lecturers (''jiangsheng'') who expounded the ''Sacred Edict'' and other morality books.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The texts composed between 1891 and 1903 were collected and published as a single volume entitled the ''Consciousness of the Mysterious Heart'' (觉悟玄心 ''Juéwù xuánxīn'').&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, similar activities were promoted by literati in the [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan County]] of northern Taiwan; the Yilan cults were extremely active and spawned new groups throughout northern and central Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Phoenix halls are a variant of two types of religious organisations, patronised by local intellectual elites, that flourished in mainland [[China]] since the 19th century, in a period of profound social, political and cultural change: [[Taoism|Taoist]] god-writing (''fuji'') cults usually focused upon a particular [[xian (Taoism)|immortal]], and [[Chinese salvationist religions|salvationist charitable societies]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In Taoist societies, the relationship between members and their deity follows the model of disciples and master, with the goal of immortality through self-cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Phoenix halls inherit this internal structure combined with the conservative social reformism of the charitable societies.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; They are concerned with a [[salvation]] of society through the reaffirmation of traditional standards of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, phoenix halls in [[Sichuan]] adopted the name of "Confucian shrines" (儒坛 ''rú tán''). In the same years, under the influence of the medium Yang Mingji, phoenix halls in northern [[Taiwan]] began to unify under the name "Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition" (儒宗神教 ''Rúzōng Shénjiào'') and the liturgical manual ''Rúmén kēfàn'' (儒门科范 ''Liturgical Regulations of the Confucian Way'') published in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Effective unification came after the retrocession of Taiwan in 1945; the "Republic of China Assembly of the Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition" (中华民国儒宗神教会 ''Zhōnghuá Mínguó Rúzōng Shénjiào Huì'') was created in 1978 incorporating over five hundred phoenix halls.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; A new ritual book, the ''Sacred Code of the Phoenix Halls'' (鸾堂圣典 ''Luántáng shèngdiǎn'') was published in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

While early phoenix halls showed ritual patterns inherited from Taoist cults and Longhua [[zhaijiao|vegetarian halls]], since the formation of the Assembly of the Phoenix Halls in 1978 "new-style" urban phoenix halls, such as the Shenxian Tang and the Wumiao Mingzheng Tang, strengthened a Confucian style omitting Taoist and Longhua-derived rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of the Wumiao Mingzheng Tang was influenced by [[Xuanyuanism]] and [[Yiguandao]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The book ''The Mysterious Meaning of the Way of Heaven'' (天道奥义 ''Tiāndào àoyì''), published in the 1980s by the Wumiao Mingzheng Tang, incorporates ''[[Wusheng Laomu]]'', the central concept of Yiguandao and broader [[Chinese Maternism]].&lt;ref&gt;Clart 2003, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Wang Xizhi Huang Ting Jing.jpg|thumb|Part of a [[Song Dynasty]] [[stone rubbing]] of [[Wang Xizhi]]'s manuscript of the ''Yellow Court Classic'']]

'''''The Yellow Court Classic''''' ("Huang Ting Jing", 黄庭经), a Chinese [[Taoist]] [[meditation]] text, was received from the unknown source (according to a lore, as a Heavenly Scripture from the Highest Purity Realm) by Lady  [[Wei Huacun]], one of the founders of Highest Purity Tradition ([[Shangqing School|Shangqing]], 上清),  in the 288 CE. The first reference to the text appears in the archives of the famous alchemist and collector of Taoist texts, [[Ge Hong]] (葛洪) in the 4th century CE.

The manuscript comprises the two parts, the External (Wai, 外) and Internal (Nei, 内) Scenery Scripture. All characters of the shorter (100 verses) text of the External Scripture are fully contained in the longer (435 verses) text of the Internal Scripture. Together, both of the texts are also referred to (within the manuscript itself) as "Jade Book" or "Jade Writing". Fourth century “Sage of Calligraphy”, [[Wang Xizhi]] (王羲之) presented the full text of the Internal Scenery Scripture of the Yellow Court on the stone tables in his classic artwork, a well-known masterpiece of the [[Chinese calligraphy]] .

Since fourth century, this classic visualization [[(Fabrizio Pregadio)]] text has been regularly used in the practice of the Highest Purity (also called Supreme Purity) lineage, as well as the other schools of Taoism.  [[Lü Dongbin]] (吕洞宾), a historical figure, that is also honored in Chinese folklore as a [[Deity]]/[[Xian (Taoism)|Immortal]],  had integrated the material from ''The Yellow Court Classic'' into his own practice and  referenced some parts in his scripture: ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'', that has been later translated by [[Thomas Cleary (sinologist)]] and [[Richard Wilhelm (sinologist)|Richard Wilhelm]] and commented by [[Carl Jung]]. The version of Richard Wilhelm is not well translated and is based on a truncated Chinese text. The version of Thomas Cleary is preferable, well translated and complete.

The literal meaning of the “’’Yellow Court’’’ refers to the central area of the Emperor’s Castle where the Emperor and Ministers gather to try to understand the will of the Heavens and properly regulate the businesses of the Kingdom.  The Yellow color indicates Earth element that is central in the Five Element ([[Wu Xing]], 五行) arrangement. The four sides of the Castle Architecture symbolize the other four elements (Metal, Water, Wood and Fire), while the Heaven symbolizes the Spirit. The overall picture presents an allegory to a harmony between human body, spleen (the Earth element of Yellow color, central of the Five Organs) or the energy center of the body ([[Dantian]], 丹田) and the Nature.

The text of the Yellow Court scriptures provides [[meditation]] instructions for the practitioner’s [[holographic]] alignment with the Universe and its Spiritual Laws and Forces (symbolized by “Heaven”), in the order to regulate and improve functions and processes of the body (symbolized by “Kingdom”). Such Life Cultivation, or Internal Alchemy work should, according to the text, result in the enhanced health and [[longevity]] of a diligent practitioner.  [[Carl Jung]] referred to this mechanism, in his multiple works, including the commentary of ''[[The Secret of the Golden Flower]]'', as the [[Individuation]]. However, in addition to the psychological aspect analyzed by Jung, the Taoist Alchemy process also emphasizes energetic and physical changes in the practitioner’s body, as the components of the holistic personal enhancement.

The key component in the meditative practice of ''The Yellow Court Classic'' is, however, focused on the cooperation with the heavenly spirits ([[Shen (Chinese religion)|Shen]], 神), which are assumed to form the “intelligent”, organizational aspects of the human existence. In addition to the specific locations in the body (like lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, spleen etc.), the nature and mission of these, personified, spirits are designated by color, material and shape of the clothes they wear. The colors usually indicate one of the Five Elements, for instance “red” is associated to the “Heart” and the “Fire” element. The other attributes of the spirits are symbolically associated to the concepts of [[Yin Yang]], Eight Trigrams ([[Bagua]], 八卦) of [[I Ching]] etc. The text of the scripture gradually develops a systematic description of main body elements and functions, as aspects of the Universal Spiritual Harmony in the Human Being.

The Zen-tradition is maintained and transferred by a high degree of institutionalisation,{{sfn|Borup|2008}}{{sfn|Hori|1994}} despite the emphasis on individual experience{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} and the iconoclastic picture of Zen.{{sfn|McRae|2002}}

In Japan, modernity has led to criticism of the formal system and the commencement of lay-oriented Zen-schools such as the [[Sanbo Kyodan]]{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C}} and the [[Ryomo Kyokai|Ningen Zen Kyodan]].&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml Ningen Zen]&lt;/ref&gt; How to organize the continuity of the Zen-tradition in the west, constraining [[charismatic authority]] and the derailment it may bring on the one hand,{{sfn|Bell|2002}}{{sfn|Lachs|1999}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} and maintaining the legitimacy and authority by limiting the number of authorized teachers on the other hand,{{sfn|Koné|2000}} is a challenge for the developing Zen-communities in the west.

==Temple-training==
{{main|Zen ranks and hierarchy}}

Since the [[East Mountain Teaching]], Zen has centered on monastic life. In modern Soto and Rinzai, monasteries serve as training facilities to educate Zen priests, most of whom move on to run their own temple.{{sfn|Borup|2008}}{{sfn|Hori|1994}} Japanese laity has been allowed to participate in Zen training only since the [[Meiji Restoration]].

Japanese Soto and Rinzai are organized in a system of head-temples and sub-temples.

===Soto===
Contemporary Soto-shu has four classes of temples:{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=330, note 29}}
# {{nihongo|''Honzan''|本山||}}, head temples, namely [[Eihei-ji]] and [[Sōji-ji]];
# ''Kakuchi'', teaching monasteries, where at least once a year an ''ango'' (ninety-day retreat) takes place;
# ''Hōchi'', dharma temples;
# ''Jun hōchi'', ordinary temples.

The two head temples or {{nihongo|''honzan''|本山||}} of the Sōtō sect are [[Eihei-ji]] and [[Sōji-ji]]. While Eihei-ji owes its existence to Dōgen, throughout history this head temple has had significantly fewer sub-temple affiliates than the Sōji-ji. During the [[Tokugawa period]], Eiheiji had approximately 1,300 affiliate temples compared to Sōji-ji's 16,200. Furthermore, out of the more than 14,000 temples of the Sōtō sect today, 13,850 of those identify themselves as affiliates of Sōji-ji. Additionally, most of the some 148 temples that are affiliates of Eiheiji today are only minor temples located in [[Hokkaido]]— founded during a period of [[colonization]] during the [[Meiji period]]. Therefore, it is often said that Eiheiji is a head temple only in the sense that it is "head of all Sōtō dharma lineages.{{sfn|Bodiford|1993}}

In an advice to western practitioners, Kojun Kishigami Osho, a dharma heir of [[Kodo Sawaki]], writes:
{{quote|Every year, about 150 novices arrive. About 90 percent of them are sons of temple heads, which leaves only 10 percent who chose this path for themselves. For the autumn session, about 250 monks come together. Essentially what they are learning in these temples is the ability to officiate all kinds of ceremonies and rites practiced by the Soto School – the methods for fulfilling their role. Apart from this aspect, practicing with the idea of developing one’s own spirituality is not prevalent.&lt;ref name =KishigamiRoots group=web&gt;[http://www.zen-road.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=26&amp;lang=en Kojun Kishigami Osho, ''Of roots and branches'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Rinzai===
The Rinzai-school has 14 main-temples, to which subsidiary temples are attached. The 14 branches of Rinzai, by head temple, are:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/head_temples/index.html Head Temples]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/ Rinzai-Obaku zen]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{div col}}
* [[Myōshin-ji]] (founded in 1342 by [[Kanzan Egen]] Zenji)
* [[Nanzen-ji]] (founded by [[Musō Soseki]])
* [[Kenchō-ji]]
* [[Tōfuku-ji]] (founded by [[Enni Ben'en]], 1202–1280)
* [[Engaku-ji]]
* [[Daitoku-ji]] (founded by [[Shūhō Myōchō]])
* [[Hōkō-ji (Shizuoka)|Hōkō-ji]]

* [[Shōkoku-ji]]
* [[Kennin-ji]]
* [[Kōgaku-ji]]
* [[Kokutai-ji]]
{{div col end}}

Sometimes a 15th is included:
* [[Manpuku-ji]], properly part of [[Ōbaku]] instead

==Dharma transmission==
{{See also|Dharma transmission|Zen master|Zen ranks and hierarchy}}

In the western understanding, dharma transmission is primarily the affirmation of awakening by a teacher.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}} But is also part of the continuation and maintenance of Zen-institutions.

===Function of Dharma Transmission===

====Esoteric and exoteric transmission====
According to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which "the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face".{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle,{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}} or the transmission from one vein to another.{{sfn|Faure|2000|p=58}}

Exoteric transmission requires "direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror."{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=9}}

This polarity is recognizable in the emphasis that the Zen-tradition puts on maintaining the correct [[Dharma transmission]], while simultaneously stressing seeing into one's nature. Seeing one's nature gives an autonomous confirmation of Zen's ultimate truth, which may conflict with the need to maintain institutions and traditions.{{refn|group=note|See Sharf (1995-C) {{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=444-452}} for an exposition of the problems that the [[Sanbo Kyodan]] faced, after the death of Yamada Koun. As Sharf notes:
* "[C]harisma can spread too widely, and the resulting centripetal forces pull the organisation apart, with new sects spinning off in several directions".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=445}}
* "[T]he Sanbo Kyodan would not survive long were it to elevate every student with ''kensho'' to the status of master".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=445}}
* "The institution would have little chance of survival were it not to balance claims concerning the ultimacy and autonomy of ''kensho'' with a course of training that inspires obedience and loyalty to the tradition".{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C|p=445}}
These remarks also seem to apply to USA-zen, which lacks central authority, despite the formal ties to Soto-shu of many groups.}}

====Family structure====
According to Bodiford, "Zen is the predominant form of Buddhism because of dharma transmission":{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
{{quote|[I]t has ancestors whom it honors. It honors those ancestors by transmitting their legacy to proper descendants, from generation to generation, who will maintain and carry on their family traditions [...] [I]n Zen this process of transmitting a family legacy is given structural form through the ritual of dharma transmission.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}}}

Bodiford distinguishes seven dimension which are discernible in both family relationships and in dharma lineages:
# Ancestral dimension: "Ancestors (''so'') constitute a fundamental source of power".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}} Performing rituals in honour of the ancestors keeps them in high regard "among the living".{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264}}
# Biological dimension: the dharma lineage creates (spiritual) offspring, just as the family creates new life.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=264-265}}
# Linguistic dimension: dharma heirs receive new names, which reflect their tie to the dharma 'family'.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=265}}
# Ritual dimension: rituals confirm the family relationships. One's teacher is honored in rituals, as are deceised teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=265-266}}
# Legal dimension: teachers have the obligation to discipline their students, just as students have the obligation to obey their teachers.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=266}}
# Institutional and financial dimension: dharma heirs have an obligation to support their home temple, both financially and ritually.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=266-267}}
# Temporal dimension: long-term relationships foster the previous dimensions.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=267}}

The family-model is easier recognized when East Asian languages are being used, because the same terminology is used to describe both earthly and spiritual family relations.{{sfn|Bodiford|2008|p=267-268}}

===Contemporary use of Dharma transmission===
In Soto, dharma transmission establishes a lifelong relation between teacher and student. To qualify as a Zen priest, further training is required.&lt;ref name=Antaiji1 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201003.shtml What does it take to become a full-fledged Soto-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal? Part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antaiji2 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201005.shtml Ten points to keep in mind about dharma transmission]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Antaiji3 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/201007.shtml Ten-e and some words about Zui-se]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rinzai, the most common form of transmission is the acknowledgement that one has stayed in the monastery for a certain amount of time, and may later become a temple priest.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} The common transmission does not include ''inka shōmei'', which is being used for the transmission of the "true lineage" of the masters (''shike'') of the training halls.{{sfn|Borup|2008|p=13}} Training halls are temples which are authorised for further training after being qualified as a temple priest. There are only about fifty&lt;ref name=Antaiji10 group=web&gt;[http://antaiji.dogen-zen.de/eng/adult50.shtml Muho Noelke, ''Part 10: What does it take to become a full-fledged Sōtō-shu priest and is it really worth the whole deal?'']&lt;/ref&gt; to a hundred of such ''inka shōmei''-bearers in Japan.

Although the formal transmission of the dharma-lineage, from Shakyamuni Buddha to the present day, is preserved in this way, it is also seen as problematical in contemporary Zen.{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}{{sfn|Tetsuo|2003}}

===Self-awakening===
{{main|Mushi dokugo}}

The Zen tradition has always stressed the importance of formal Dharma transmission, but there are indeed well known examples of [[Mushi dokugo]], self-awakening, such as [[Nōnin]], [[Jinul]] and [[Suzuki Shōsan]] who attained awakening on their own, though all of them were familiair with the Zen-teachings.

==Zen Universities==
{{See also|:Category:Buddhist universities and colleges|l1=Buddhist universities and colleges}}

Both Soto and Rinzai have educational institutions, such as [[Komazawa University]] and [[Hanazono University]], which stand in strong competition. Several Zen-teachers known in the west have studied there, such as [[Shohaku Okumura]] and [[Keido Fukushima]]. The [[Kyoto University]] was the centre of activities for the [[Kyoto School]], to which belong [[Keiji Nishitani]] and [[Masao Abe]].

==Organization of Western Zen==
Western Zen is mainly a lay-movement, though grounded in formal lineages. Its Japanese background is in mainly lay-oriented new religious movements, especially the [[Sanbo Kyodan]]. Though a number of zen-buddhist monasteries exist in the western world, most practice takes place in Zen centers throughout the western world.

Koné sees three issues in the emerging western Zen tradition: sustainability, legitimacy, and authority.{{sfn|Koné|2000}}
* Sustainability: Zen groups and organizations need income to survive. "Covert centers" offer meditation courses, for which they charge a fee. These groups "often experience a high turnover, with a core of long-time practitioners".{{sfn|Koné|2000}} "Residential centers" have a limited number of long term residents, with a high commitment, who serve a larger lay community. Income is generated by donations. Publicity is low-key, since a rapid growth would threaten the continuity.{{sfn|Koné|2000}}
* Legitimacy: Zen groups need legitimacy, which is "social recognition and acceptance".{{sfn|Koné|2000}} The primary means for this is the "master-disciple relationship" and the "central reference to [[Dharma transmission|transmission]]".{{sfn|Koné|2000}} Various attitudes toward the tradition are possible: emulating the traditions, adaptation of the tradition, a critical stance toward the tradition, and borrowing from the tradition.{{sfn|Koné|2000}}
* Authority: two patterns are discernable, namely spiritual achievement and "spiritual friendship", and "spiritual hierarchy".{{sfn|Koné|2000}} Smaller groups tend toward egalitarity and spiritual friendship, where-as larger groups tend toward more hierarchical organisation.{{sfn|Koné|2000}}

A recurrent issue has been the reliance on [[charismatic authority]] and the resulting teacher scandals.{{sfn|Bell|2002}}{{sfn|Lachs|1999}} Sandra Bell has analysed the scandals at Vajradhatu and the San Francisco Zen Center and concluded that these kinds of scandals are
{{quote|... most likely to occur in organisations that are in transition between the pure forms of [[charismatic authority]] that brought them into being and more rational, corporate forms of organization".{{sfn|Bell|2002}}}}

Robert Sharf also mentions charisma from which institutional power is derived, and the need to balance charismatic authority with institutional authority.{{sfn|Sharf|1995-C}} Elaborate analyses of these scandals are made by Stuart Lachs, who mentions the uncritical acceptance of [[Zen#Zen narratives|religious narratives]], such as lineages and [[dharma transmission]], which aid in giving uncritical charismatic powers to teachers and leaders.{{sfn|Lachs|1999}}{{sfn|Lachs|Year unknown}}{{sfn|Lachs|2002}}{{sfn|Lachs|2006}}{{sfn|Lachs|2011}}

The scandals eventually lead to rules of conduct by the [[American Zen Teachers Association]], and the reorganising of Zen Centers,{{sfn|Wright|2010}} to spread the management of those centers over a wider group of people and diminish the role of [[charismatic authority]]. Another affect was the split in various Zen organisations, such as [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] leaving the Sanbo Kyodan, and [[Joko Beck]] leaving the [[White Plum Sangha]].

==Early life==
Özdemir was born on January 1, 1960 in [[İslahiye]], [[Gaziantep Province]], Turkey. His father, Mustafa, was a farmer and illiterate man. His mother, Ayşe, was a housewife. He grew up in İslahiye and Mardin, where he attended a state boarding school (1974–78).

==Education==
In 1980 he entered Divinity School of [[Ankara University]], where he studied Islamic Philosophy, Theology, Intellectual History, and graduated in 1985. He started graduate studies at METU ([[Middle East Technical University]]), Department of Philosophy, Ankara. He studied for eleven years at METU to complete his studies. He studied with Teo Grünberg, Ahmet İnam, Alparslan Açıkgenç, Yasin Ceylan, Akın Ergüden, and Cemil Akdoğan. During his studies he had to worked as a consultant to the Prime Ministry’s General Directorate of State Archives, (1987-1992).

He received his [[Ph.D.]] from METU in 1996. He presented his major paper, “Towards An Understanding Of Environmental Ethic From A Qur’anic Perspective”,  to an International Conference on “Islam and Ecology” at [[Harvard University]] and later published as a chapter in ''Islam and Ecology'', (Cambridge: Harvard Pres, 2003).

He has traveled widely in the Muslim world and the West. He was visiting professor of Islamic Studies at Hartford University and Hartford Seminary. He lectured with Mary E. Tucker, at a seminar on Religion and Ecology at Gadjah Mada University, Jogyakarta, Indonesia, August 9–16, 2005.

He gives many public lectures and workshops in Turkey, Europe, the [[United States]] and other countries. His father died in 1988, and his mother died in 2009. He addresses different audiences about topics related to the philosophy of religion, world religions, environmental philosophy, sustainable development, religion and the environment, interreligious and intercultural dialogue and education.

== Ideas ==
Özdemir is known for his studies in environmental philosophy in general and Islamic environmentalism in particular. After finishing his dissertation, The Ethical Dimension of Human Attitude Towards Nature (1997), he focused on Religion and Ecology. He founded an elective course on Religion and Ecology at Ankara University, which was later accepted by many universities in Turkey. He presented papers on this topic and participated panel discussions and workshops at home and abroad. Discovering and understanding the meaning of biodiversity for a sustainable ecology, he comes to understand and appreciate the full implication of cultural diversity for a sustainable human society. Then, he began to study Rumis’s work, the greatest Muslim poet and Sufi of the 13th century. 
Rumî’s philosophy and ideas have made a profound impact on his perception of nature. For Rumî, a force—a secret energy—lies beneath the spiritual and material world, informing the invisible, progressive change in the universe (humanity included). This force is love, and it originates in God and moves towards God. The meaning of this understanding is clear for an environmentalist: Everything in the universe is interdependent and interconnected; everything’s well being is dependent on everything else.

In his first major work, The Ethical Dimension of Human Attitude Towards Nature, Özdemir suggested that there is a philosophical and ethical dimension to environmental problems.  While the technological, scientific and other relevant dimensions of the problem are acknowledged, the main emphasis is given to the ethical dimension of the issue at hand.  In addition, it is also argued that there is a direct and strong relationship between environmental problems and our understanding of nature. In other words, our treatment of and attitude towards natural objects mostly depend on how we understand and conceptualize the natural world as such. 
One of his major articles “The Development of Environmental Consciousness in Modern Turkey”, was published in ''Environmentalism in Muslim World'', (ed. [[Richard Foltz]], New York: Nova, 2005). He also contributed with three etnries, “The Prophet Muhammad”, “Rumi”, and “Said Nursi” to in Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature, ed. [[Bron Taylor]] and Jeffrey Kaplan (New York: Continuum, 2003).
His other works mainly were in Turkish and primarily focused on environmental and cultural studies. After working at the Ministry of National Education as Director General, he also interested in education in a comprehensive way and represented the Ministry at International Conferences held by [[UNESCO]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[Council of Europe]], [[European Union]], etc.

Özdemir is the founder President of Society for Intercultural Research and Friendship, (1995).
