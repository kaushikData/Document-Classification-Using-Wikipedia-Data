The '''A1081''' is a road in the south of [[England]]. It starts at [[Luton Airport]] in [[Bedfordshire]] and runs to [[Chipping Barnet|High Barnet]] in [[Greater London]] via [[Harpenden]], [[St Albans]] and [[London Colney]], a distance of around {{convert|20|mi|km}}. For most of its length, the A1081 follows the route of the original [[A6 road (England)|A6]].

==The route==
The first section of the A1081 runs south-west from Luton Airport to the spur of the [[M1 motorway]] on the southern outskirts of Luton. This section is a [[dual carriageway]] known as ''New Airport Way''. Just west of the airport, there is a junction with the [[A505 road|A505]].

At the M1 spur, the A1081 turns south to join the route of the original A6. It skirts the grounds of [[Luton Hoo]] estate, then crosses into [[Hertfordshire]], passing through Harpenden before reaching St Albans.

In St Albans, the road has a junction with the A4147 and A1057 (both making up the former [[A414 road|A414]]), then meets the [[A5183 road|A5183]] (the former [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]). At this point, it bears south-east, bypassing London Colney before reaching junction 22 of the [[M25 motorway]]. There is a junction with the current A414, the ''North Orbital Road'', just north of London Colney.

The A1081 then [[Concurrency (road)|multiplexes]] with the M25 to junction 23 at [[South Mimms]], the junction with the current [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]] and [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]]. From here, it continues south-east to High Barnet, ending at a junction with the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] (the former A1, now the [[A1000 road|A1000]]).

==History==
The A1081 designation was originally used on a 1920s-built road in east London, from [[South Woodford]] to the [[A12 road (England)|A12]] at [[Gants Hill]]; this road is now part of the [[North Circular Road|A406 North Circular Road]] and the A1400.

The current A1081 was established in the 1950s, when the section of the A6 from South Mimms to High Barnet was so renumbered following the re-routing of the A1 onto the 1920s-built Barnet Bypass.

When the M25 was built in the 1980s, it took over the section of the A6 from London Colney to South Mimms, which was already dual carriageway. The section from Luton to London Colney was then renumbered the A1081.

The '''A690''' is a road in [[County Durham]] running from [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] in the east through [[Durham, England|Durham]] to [[Crook, County Durham|Crook]].

==Sunderland section==
Throughout the Sunderland section it is known as either ''Durham Road'' or ''New Durham Road'', and is one of the major routes in and out of the city. A [[single carriageway]] section runs from the city centre to a large [[roundabout]] at the Barnes. The road then climbs a steep hill toward High Barnes, alongside the Bede site of the [[Sunderland College]] before becoming [[dual carriageway]]. Beyond a set of [[traffic lights]] at the ''Prospect Hotel'', the road remains dual carriageway, but the inside lane is a 'no car lane'. (In early 2009 the ''Prospect Hotel'' was demolished to make way for a new Lidl store.) The road then climbs another hill, becoming single carriageway, with the [[Farringdon, Sunderland|Farringdon]] estate to the east and the [[Thorney Close]] estate to the west. A down hill stretch leads into the [[Herrington|East Herrington]] and then on toward the [[A19 road|A19]] fly-over. Just after the A19 intersection, the road once again becomes a dual carriageway with a speed limit of {{convert|50|mph}}. Within the first mile after the A19, the road comes to a notoriously bad intersection - which is frequented by a speed camera van on the Eastbound carriageway just outside the [[Evans Halshaw]]. The road then runs through [[Houghton-le-Spring]], via a locally famous transport feature named ''Houghton Cut''. This huge cut through the hillside was reputedly built with the forced labour of Napoleonic prisoners of war. The road then runs out of the [[City of Sunderland]] boundary and on toward the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]].

The land area of [[Bermuda]] is divided into nine [[parish]]es.  There are also two defined [[municipality|municipalities]], located in the boundaries of two of the parishes.

{{stack|[[Image:Bermuda-divmap.png|right|300px]]}}

==Parishes==
Bermuda has nine "Parishes", originally called "Tribes".  Each of the nine parishes with the exception of St. George's covers the same land area, (2.31 square miles / 5.97&amp;nbsp;km²).  The Parishes are not [[administrative division]]s, and have no relationship with Bermuda's [[electoral district]]s.

Note on pronunciation:
*The "y" in Sandys is often not pronounced
*The second "w" in Warwick is not pronounced

==Municipalities==
*[[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]] (City) (1,100) 
*[[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]] (Town) (1,648)

Whereas the town of St George's is surrounded by St George's Parish, Hamilton Parish and the city of Hamilton are not close to each other geographically.

Saint George's, the larger of the two municipalities, served as Bermuda's capital until 1815 until the newly established Hamilton replaced it.

==Villages==
Bermuda has two villages (unincorporated urban areas)

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===
[[File:Sd11-boom.JPG|thumb|left|A large dhow with two lateen sail rigs and a [[headsail]].  Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

[[File:Adler von Lübeck. Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===
[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Silk Road]] and [[spice trade]] routes later blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 spurring exploration to find alternative sea routes]]
[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

===Portuguese exploration===

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spanish exploration: Columbus and the West Indies===
{{see also|Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Spanish colonization of the Americas}}
[[File:Viajes de colon en.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The four voyages of [[Christopher Columbus]] 1492–1503]]

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456–62.&lt;/ref&gt;—a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2|Catholic Encyclopædia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
[[File:Pulau Maitara and Pulau Tidore from the Floridas Restaurant in Pulau Ternate (Ternate Island), The Moluccas (Maluku) (15182126636).jpg|thumb|View from [[Ternate]] to [[Tidore]] islands in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], where Portuguese Eastward and Spanish Westward explorations ultimately met and clashed between 1522 and 1529&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.
[[File:Yermak Timofeyevich and his band of adventurers crossing the Ural Mountains at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yermak Timofeyevich]] and his band of adventurers crossing the [[Ural Mountains]] at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe]]

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|left|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Kochi were the earliest [[icebreaker]]s and were widely used by Russians in the [[Arctic]] and on [[Siberia]]n rivers.]]
In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.
[[File:Namban-08.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Portuguese ''[[wiktionary:南蛮人|Nanbanjin]]'' arriving at Japan much to the surprise of locals, detail from a [[Nanban trade|Nanban]] panel of the [[Kanō school]], 1593–1600]]
Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scitizen 2007|Scitizen 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

[[File:Jesuites en chine.jpg|thumb|[[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit]] scholars collaborated extensively with Chinese astronomers, introducing [[Copernican principle]]s. Top: [[Matteo Ricci]], [[Adam Schall von Bell|Adam Schaal]] and [[Ferdinand Verbiest]] (1623–1688); Bottom: [[Xu Guangqi|Paul Siu (Xu Guangqi)]], ''Colao'' or Prime Minister of State, and his granddaughter Candide Hiu]]

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

[[File:Kepler-world.jpg|thumb|World map from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s [[Rudolphine Tables]] (1627), incorporating many of the new discoveries.]]
As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11357">{{short description|Second level administrative subdivision of Thailand}}
An '''amphoe''' (sometimes also '''amphur''', {{lang-th|[[:wikt:อำเภอ|อำเภอ]]}}, {{IPA-th|ʔām.pʰɤ̄ː|pron}}) is the second level administrative subdivision of [[Thailand]]. Usually translated as "[[district]]". Amphoe make up the [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]], and are analogous to [[county|counties]]. The chief district officer is ''Nai Amphoe'' ({{lang|th|[[:wikt:นายอำเภอ|นายอำเภอ]]}}). Amphoe are divided into [[tambon]]s, or sub-districts.

Altogether Thailand has 878 districts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Educational Statistics 2016 |url=http://www.en.moe.go.th/enMoe2017/index.php/educational-statistics/educational-statistics-2016 |website=Ministry of Education Thailand |accessdate=5 August 2018 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; not including the [[Districts of Bangkok|50 districts]] of [[Bangkok]] which are called ''[[Khet (country subdivision)|khet]]'' (เขต) since the Bangkok administrative reform of 1972. The number of amphoe in provinces varies, from only three in the smallest provinces, up to the 50 urban districts of [[Bangkok]]. Also the sizes and population of amphoe differ greatly. The smallest population is in [[King Amphoe Ko Kut|Ko Kut]] ([[Trat Province]]) with just 2,042 citizens, while [[Amphoe Mueang Samut Prakan|Mueang Samut Prakan]] ([[Samut Prakan Province]]) has 509,262 citizens. The khet of Bangkok have the smallest areas—Khet [[Samphanthawong]] is the smallest, with only 1.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;—while the amphoe of the sparsely populated mountain regions are bigger than some provinces. [[Amphoe Umphang|Umphang]] ([[Tak Province]]) at 4,325.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the largest and also has the lowest population density.

The names of amphoe are usually unique, but in a few cases different Thai names have the same form in English due to the flaws of the [[romanization#Thai|romanization]] system. The notable exception, however, is the name [[Amphoe Chaloem Phra Kiat (disambiguation)|Amphoe Chaloem Phra Kiat]], which was given to five districts created in 1996 in celebration of the 50th anniversary of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]]'s accession to the throne. ''Chaloem Phra Kiat'' (เฉลิมพระเกียรติ) means "in commemoration of" or "in honour of" a royal family member.

{{Administrative divisions of Thailand}}

== Local administration ==
Each district is led by a district chief officer (nai amphoe, นายอำเภอ), who is appointed by the [[Ministry of Interior (Thailand)|Ministry of Interior]]. The officer is a subordinate of the provincial governor.

==Amphoe mueang==
{{see|Mueang|Muban|Sukhaphiban|Tambon|Thesaban}}
The district which contains the administrative office of the province is the ''amphoe mueang'' (lit. ''town district''). The district should not to be confused with the capital town itself, which is a different administrative entity usually much smaller than the district. Until the 1930s, most of the capital districts had names just like other districts, whereas districts dating back to old provinces had the word ''mueang'' in their name. In 1938 all the capital districts were renamed ''amphoe mueang'', whereas in all non-capital districts ''mueang'' was removed from the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=55|issue=ก|pages=658–666|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาเปลี่ยนนามจังหวัด และอำเภอบางแห่ง พุทธศักราช ๒๔๘๑|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2481/A/658.PDF|date=1938-11-14|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notable exception to this rule is [[Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]], where the capital district is named [[Amphoe Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya]] (instead of ''Amphoe Mueang Ayutthaya''), the same as the province, which is fully named ''Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya''. Also the capital districts of Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces had the same name as the province, which they kept when the two provinces were merged to form Bangkok metropolis.

In most cases the capital district is also the most populous district of the province, as the provincial administration is usually in the largest town of the province. [[Songkhla Province]] is the most striking exception, as the town (and thus also the district) [[Hat Yai]] grew much faster than the capital [[Mueang Songkhla District|Mueang Songkhla]] due to its better transport connections.

There are four districts in Thailand ([[Amphoe Mueang Chan|Chan]], [[Amphoe Mueang Pan|Pan]], [[Amphoe Mueang Suang|Suang]], and [[Amphoe Mueang Yang|Yang]]) which contain the term ''mueang'' in their name as well, even though they are not capital districts. All of these were created relatively recently, between 1973 and 1995.

==King amphoe==
Minor districts (''king amphoe'', กิ่งอำเภอ &amp;mdash; ''"กิ่ง"'' literally "branch") are set up when the administration of areas remote from the district center is inconvenient for citizens. Most of the tasks of the amphoe are transferred to the king amphoe, but it is still partially a subordinate of the amphoe it was created from. When the king amphoe meets the necessary qualifications to become an amphoe, it is usually promoted. However, not every newly created amphoe begins as a king amphoe: if the qualifications are met directly, this phase is skipped. While usually a minor district is upgraded after a few years, in some cases it remains a minor district for decades. For example, [[Amphoe Ko Yao|Ko Yao]] was a minor district for 85 years until it was upgraded in 1988. Sometimes a district is downgraded to a minor district. [[Amphoe Thung Wa|Thung Wa]] lost a lot of its population to neighboring [[Amphoe La-ngu|La-ngu minor district]], so finally La-ngu was upgraded and Thung Wa downgraded. Another example is [[Amphoe Chumphon Buri|Chumphon Buri]], which was reduced after the more developed part was split off to form a new district and the remaining district was downgraded.

The criteria required for an amphoe are a population of at least 30,000 people and at least five ''tambon'', or, if the area is more than {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} from the district office, a population of at least 15,000 and four ''tambon''. &lt;!--how to translate ได้รับความเห็นชอบจากสภาตำบลหรือองค์การบริหารส่วนตำบล หัวหน้าส่วนราชการประจำอำเภอ หัวหน้าส่วนราชการประจำจังหวัดและสภาจังหวัด--&gt;

A minor district is led by a chief officer (Hua Na King Amphoe, หัวหน้ากิ่งอำเภอ).

The Thai word ''king'' (กิ่ง) means "branch" and should not be confused with the English word "king". The officially recommended translation is "minor district"&amp;nbsp;—however they are also quite commonly translated as sub-district, which is the recommended translation for ''tambon'', and also wrongly suggests that they are at a lower administrative level than the ''amphoe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thai-English Transcription of Changwat, Amphoe, King Amphoe and Tambon|isbn=978-974-7857-04-7|url=http://www.dopa.go.th/web_pages/m03050000/documents/thai_eng.zip|year=2007
|publisher=Kō̜ng Wichākān læ Phǣnngān, Krom Kānpokkhrō̜ng|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thai government upgraded all remaining 81 minor districts to full districts on 15 May 2007 in order to streamline administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manager.co.th/Politics/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9500000055625|work=Manager Online|script-title=th:แถลงผลการประชุม ครม. ประจำวันที่ 15 พ.ค. 2550|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt; With publication in the ''Royal Gazette'' on 24 August the order became official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Royal Gazette|volume=124|issue=46 ก|pages=14–21|script-title=th:พระราชกฤษฎีกาตั้งอำเภอฆ้องชัย...และอำเภอเหล่าเสือโก้ก พ.ศ. ๒๕๕๐|url=http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2550/A/046/14.PDF|format=PDF|date=Aug 24, 2007|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==District office==
{{Commons category|District offices of Thailand}}
The administration of the district is housed in an office building called ''thi wa kan amphoe'' (ที่ว่าการอำเภอ), which also marks the center of each district. Distances on road signs are always calculated to this office building. The office is usually in the largest settlement of the district, to make it easily accessible to the majority of the population&amp;nbsp;—one of the tasks of the amphoe is the [[civil registry]], which makes the district the most important of the administrative levels for the Thai public.

'''Argos''' is a [[satellite]]-based system which collects, processes and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms worldwide. What makes Argos unique is the ability to clearly geographically locate the source of the data anywhere on the [[Earth]] utilizing the [[Doppler effect]].

Argos was established in 1978 and since that time, it has provided data to environmental research and protection communities that, in many cases, was otherwise unobtainable.&lt;ref&gt;

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6701221.stm Argos: Keeping track of the planet] Rebecca Morelle, ''[[BBC News]]'', 2007-06-07. Retrieved 2007

&lt;/ref&gt; The system is fully proven and highly reliable. Many remote [[automatic weather station]]s report via Argos.  Argos is a key component of many global research programs including: [[Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere program]] (TOGA), Tagging of Pacific Pelagics (TOPP), [[World Ocean Circulation Experiment]] (WOCE), [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo]], and others. There are currently 22,000 active transmitters, 8,000 of which are used in animal tracking, and over 100 countries utilize the Argos system.

Since the late 1980s Argos transmitters have routinely been deployed on a large number of marine mammals and sea turtles and it continues to serve as the most important tool for tracking long distance movements of both coastal and oceanic species.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/science/seal-tagging-yields-huge-set-of-data-in-northeastern-pacific.html A Tidal Wave of Data on Elephant Seals], [[The New York Times|''The New York Times'' website]], May 21, 2012. Retrieved May 22, 2012; published in the New York edition, May 22, 2012, p.D3.

&lt;/ref&gt; Through upload of data from, for example, [[Pressure sensor|pressure transducers]], it has also been possible to obtain a wealth of knowledge about dive and foraging behavior from unrestrained animals in the wild.

Argos was developed under a [[Memorandum of understanding|Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) between the [[Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales]] (CNES, the French space agency), the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA, USA) and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA, USA).

The system utilizes both ground and satellite-based resources to accomplish its mission. These include:

* instruments carried aboard the NOAA [[polar orbit]]ing environmental satellites ([[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]]), the [[EUMETSAT]] [[MetOp]] satellites, and [[Indian Space Research Organisation|ISRO]] satellites,
* receiving stations around the world,
* and major processing facilities in [[Toulouse]] in France and [[Lanham, Maryland]] in the United States.

This fully integrated system works to conveniently locate and deliver data from the most remote platforms to the user's desktop, often in near real-time.

Argos is operated by CLS/Argos, based in Toulouse, France. CLS has a subsidiary in the U.S., [http://www.clsamerica.com CLS America, Inc]. These companies together operate the system and promote its use.

== Operating Agencies ==
The Argos satellite-based system was set up by:
* the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales ([[CNES]])

The '''Austrian autobahns''' are  [[controlled-access highway]]s in [[Austria]]. They are officially called ''Bundesstraßen A (Bundesautobahnen)'' under the authority of the [[Austrian Federal Government|Federal Government]] according to the Austrian Federal Road Act (''Bundesstraßengesetz''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10011428 Bundesstraßengesetz 1971 {{de icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with the former ''[[Bundesstraße]]n'' highways maintained by the [[States of Austria|Austrian states]] since 2002. 

== History ==
Ideas to build up a [[limited-access road]] network with [[Grade separation|grade separated]] interchanges had been developed already in the 1920s, including a "[[Nibelungenlied|Nibelungen]]" highway along the [[Danube|Donau]] (Danube) river from [[Passau]] to [[Wien]] (Vienna) and further on towards [[Budapest]]. Those plans however had never been carried out due to the lasting economic crisis that hit the country after the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918, exacerbated by the [[Great Depression]]. 

The first autobahn on Austrian territory was the [[West Autobahn]] from [[Salzburg]] to [[Wien]]. Building started immediately after the Austrian [[Anschluss]] in 1938 [the annexation of Austria] on order of [[Adolf Hitler]] as extension of the German ''[[Reichsautobahn]]-Strecke 26'' from [[München]] (Munich) (the present-day [[Bundesautobahn 8]]). However, only {{convert|16.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} including the branch-off of the planned [[Tauern Autobahn]] had been finished on 13 September 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wabweb.net/verkehr/frames/abaltaf.htm "Beginn des Autobahnbaus in Österreich" {{de icon}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308080827/http://www.wabweb.net/verkehr/frames/abaltaf.htm |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction works discontinued the next year due to [[World War II]]. After the war delaying resistance by the [[Allied-occupied Austria|Soviet occupation forces]] as well as claims raised by [[West Germany]] to the former ''Reichsautobahn'' assets obstructed the resumption until 1954. 
[[File:Hinweiszeichen 8a.svg|thumb|80px|Autobahn sign]]
Construction started in the [[United States|US]]-occupied zone of [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] and [[Upper Austria]], partly relying on the pre-war planning, and were extended after the country gained full sovereignty by the 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]]. The first section of the West Autobahn up to [[Mondsee (town)|Mondsee]] was opened in 1958, by 1967 the route between Salzburg and Wien / Vienna was completed. From 1959 onwards the [[Süd Autobahn]] was built to reach the southern state capitals of [[Graz]] and [[Klagenfurt]] from Wien / Vienna. The construction of the Tauern Autobahn was not resumed until 1969. The [[Inn Valley Autobahn]] in the western state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] was built from 1968 onwards, up to today it is not directly connected to the main Austrian autobahn network, as via motorway drivers have to use the German autobahns [[Bundesautobahn 8|BAB 8]] and [[Bundesautobahn 93|93]] along the ''[[Deutsches Eck (transport link)|Deutsches Eck]]'' link.

== Autobahn system ==
Austria currently has 18 autobahns, since 1982 built and maintained by the self-financed [[ASFiNAG]] stock company in Vienna, which is wholly owned by the Austrian republic and earns revenue from road-user charges and tolls. Each route bears a number as well as an official name with local reference, which however is not displayed on road signs. Unusually for European countries, [[Interchange (road)|interchanges]] (between motorways called ''Knoten'', "knots") are numbered by distance in kilometres starting from where the route begins; this arrangement is also used in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Spain]], and most provinces of [[Canada]] (and in most [[United States|American]] states, albeit in miles). The current Austrian Autobahn network has a total length of {{convert|1720|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The system is going to be expanded; one Autobahn is currently under construction, and one more is planned. The transit traffic across the [[main chain of the Alps]] especially by trucks had led to a considerable environmental load to the fragile Alpine ecosystem. Several action groups urge the transfer of freight transport from road to rail. In 1991 Austria signed the [[Alpine Convention]] on the protection of the natural environment.

[[File:Autobahnen und Schnellstraßen in Österreich.svg|thumb|600px|center|A map of the Austrian Autobahn and Schnellstraße system. Blue = Autobahn, Green = Schnellstraße, Dotted = planned or under construction]]

== Traffic laws and enforcement ==
Unlike [[German autobahns]], on Austrian autobahns a general [[speed limit]] of 130&amp;nbsp;km/h (81&amp;nbsp;mph) is set, although as of August 25, 2018, the FPÖ government has been going on a trial for a possible speed limit increase to 140 km/h (87 mph) on the Autobahn 1 freeway. They may only be used by powered vehicles that are designed to achieve at least {{convert|60|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. While on the motorway voluntary stops, U-turns and backward driving are prohibited.

== Schnellstraßen ==
[[File:Hinweiszeichen_8c.svg|thumb|80px|''Autostraße'' sign]]
''Schnellstraßen'' (officially ''Bundesstraßen S'') are federal [[limited-access road]]s very similar to ''Autobahnen''; the chief difference is that they are more cheaply built with fewer tunnels, mostly just following the given topography. Depending on the road extension, they are either signposted as ''Autobahn'' or ''Autostraße'' according to Austrian traffic regulations. The speed limit on ''Schnellstraßen'' is 130 km/h, however on some it is 100 km/h indicated by a sign. The current ''Schnellstraßen'' system has a total length of {{convert|466|km|mi|abbr=on}}. 

As they fit better with the mountainous topography of Austria, ''Schnellstraßen'' often serve as an autobahn substitute. For example, the main link between the Austria's westernmost state of [[Vorarlberg]] and adjacent [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] is entirely provided by the ''[[Arlberg Schnellstraße|S16 Arlberg Schnellstraße]]'', including the [[Arlberg Road Tunnel]] completed in 1979.

== Tolls ==
[[Image:A22 Floridsdorfer Brücke.jpg|thumb|A22 [[Donauuferautobahn]], near the exit Floridsdorfer Brücke]]
Since 1997, the use of all ''Autobahnen'' and ''Schnellstraßen'' requires the purchase of a [[Vignette (road tax)|vignette]] (toll sticker) for passenger cars up to 3.5 [[tonne]]s or a ''GO-Box'' (electronic toll system) for trucks and buses. The toll fee (''Maut'') has to be paid to legally access the Austrian Autobahns at any time except the Autobahns listed below. On routes which are more costly to maintain, mostly [[Central Eastern Alps|Alpine]] routes with tunnels—sections of the [[Pyhrn Autobahn]], the [[Tauern Autobahn]] ([[Tauern Road Tunnel|Tauern Tunnel]]) and the [[Karawanken Autobahn]] ([[Karawanks Tunnel (motorway)|Karawanken Tunnel]]), as well as the [[Brenner Autobahn]]—a toll should be paid which is collected at time of use via [[toll plaza]]s and therefore drivers do not need to have a vignette to use these Autobahns. 

[[Vignette (road tax)|Vignettes]] (coll. ''Pickerl'') are available in varying lengths of validity (10 days, two months, or a year). {{As of|2016}}, a vignette valid for a year costs €85.70 for cars and €34.10 for motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MANDARIN-ORANGE - VIGNETTE COLOR 2016|url=http://www.asfinag.at/toll/toll-sticker|publisher=[[ASFiNAG]]|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove to have paid this fee, the toll stickers have to be put onto the inside of the front windscreen. Once removed, they no longer are valid, so each car on Austrian Autobahns needs its own toll sticker.

Since 2004 trucks must carry the ''GO-Box'', a little white box which counts the length of the Autobahn used by way of electrical control points, queried by overhead [[DSRC]] microwave radio transceivers at different locations. Overhead 3-D infrared laser scanners are used to detect and photograph trucks travelling without it.

A fine of €110 must be paid if a vehicle is on the motorway without a GO-Box or a vignette, or a fine of €240 if a vignette is not affixed onto the windscreen or in one of the approved places or the vehicle is on the motorway with a vignette that has expired or been tampered with. If the driver refuses to pay the fine, then the fine will increase to between €300 and €3,000.

{{Infobox Bilateral relations|Canada–United States|Canada|USA|filetype=svg}}
Because of their proximity and similar sporting cultures, [[Canada]] and [[United States]] are frequent rivals in a wide variety of international sports.

== Overall rivalry and the Olympic Games ==
For both countries, the Soviet Union was often the common rival in most international competitions before 1991.  However, since the fall of the Soviet Union, the two neighbouring countries have been more heated rivals, especially in [[winter sport]]s where the talent pools of the two countries are more evenly matched, although the United States is currently ahead of Canada in gold, silver, bronze, and total medals won. In the Winter Olympics to date, Canada has had the most golds for a host country and is currently dominating in men's ice hockey. In [[summer sports]], the United States' closest rival at the [[Summer Olympics]] is now China. All time, the United States is the number one ranked country in gold, silver, bronze, and total medals won.

In the run-up to the [[1998 Winter Olympics]], ''Los Angeles Times'' columnist Mike Penner named Canada the United States' most important rival, especially in hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/feb/01/news/ss-14560?wwparam=1352415931 |title=Going Toe To Toe - latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1998-02-01 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''USA Today'' ran the headline "Cold War now means Canada", with Canadian columnist Terry Jones reporting that the Canadian Olympic team approved of the comments and shared the news clippings around the athlete's village in Nagano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamNaganoColumns/feb19_jones.html |title=U.S. sees Canada as the new red menace |publisher=Canoe.ca |date=1998-02-19 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baseball ==
It was considered a major upset when Canada defeated the United States in the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], which some commentators called a "Miracle on Dirt", reference to the [[Miracle on Ice]] when the US national hockey team beat the USSR in 1980. 

The United States beat Canada in the 2009 World Baseball Classic in Toronto. The United States also beat Canada in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The United States beat Canada again in the 2017 World baseball classic, by a score of 8-0. Although there is only one Canadian in the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|U.S. Hall of Fame]] ([[Ferguson Jenkins]]), three different Canadian players have been named [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] of either the [[National League|National]] or [[American League]] since 1997 ([[Larry Walker]], NL, 1997; [[Justin Morneau]], AL, 2006; [[Joey Votto]], NL, 2010). The United States is ranked second in the [[WBSC World Rankings]] while Canada placed 8th.

== Cricket ==
While cricket is not among the most popular sports in either country, they have the distinction of having played against each other in the [[Canadian cricket team in the United States in 1844|first ever international match of any sport in 1844]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadacricket.com/?p=1039] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143918/http://www.canadacricket.com/?p=1039 |date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|K.A. Auty Cup}}

==Ice hockey==
For both genders and at all ages groups, Canada - US games are among the most important in international hockey.  Since the decline of the Soviet Union in 1991, this rivalry has certainly been one of the most passionate of all.{{According to whom|date=April 2018}} 

===Men's===
{{main|Canada men's national ice hockey team|United States men's national ice hockey team}}

Ice hockey is by far the most competitive sport between the two countries. The two teams have been close rivals since the early days of international hockey, facing each other for the gold medal at [[Ice hockey at the 1920 Summer Olympics|the first Olympic hockey tournament in 1920]]. The US was not able to defeat Canada until the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Winter Olympics]], and achieved their most recent victory at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980 Olympics.]] However, during the [[1991 Canada Cup]], American defense man [[Gary Suter]] cross-checked and injured Canadian superstar [[Wayne Gretzky]], creating a feeling of animosity among Canadian fans. In 1996, the United States won a victory during a [[best-on-best]] men's tournament by defeating Canada at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]] on Canadian soil in Montreal. Canada took revenge by beating the US for the Gold again at the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympics]] on American soil in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=518285 |title=USA, Canada rivalry has evolved over time - NHL.com - All-Access Vancouver |publisher=NHL.com |date=2010-02-20 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During their next Olympic match, Canada defeated the US in a gold medal game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Olympics]] on Canadian soil in Vancouver, after the United States shocked Canada in the group stage of the tournament.  Most recently, the two teams faced off against each other in the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Olympics]] in Sochi's semi-final for the right to go to the gold medal game, which Canada once again won. 

====Junior====
{{main|Canada–United States junior ice hockey rivalry}}
The two countries are perennial rivals at the [[IIHF World U20 Championship|World Junior Championships]] for players under 20 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Zeisberger |url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/hockey/2011/01/04/16750221.html |title=Canada, U.S. rivalry still strong &amp;#124; Hockey &amp;#124; Sports |publisher=Toronto Sun |date=2011-01-04 |accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Canada men's national junior ice hockey team|Canada]] holds a total of 17 gold medals, while the [[United States men's national junior ice hockey team|United States]] holds four gold medals. In the 2010s decade, the U.S. has won 3 World Junior Championships in 2010, 2013, and 2017, while Canada has won twice in 2015 and 2018.

===Women's===
{{main|Canada women's national ice hockey team|United States women's national ice hockey team|Canada–United States women's national ice hockey rivalry}}
Canada and the U.S. have faced each other in the championship game of nearly every Olympics and World Championships since the beginning of international play. Few of Canada's and the U.S.'s losses have been to teams outside their rivalry. After an American victory during the 1998 Nagano Olympics, the Canadian Olympic team won the next four gold medals; the USA won the most recent gold medal after a penalty shootout in the 2018 final. During the 2002 USA vs Canada ice hockey match for women's gold, Canada won. However, at the World Championships, the rivalry has recently been dominated by the USA who have won 7 of the last 9 World Championships.

==Lacrosse ==

===Field===

====Men's====
No team other than Canada or the US has ever won the [[World Lacrosse Championship]].  The US has nine championships, and Canada has three.

==Rugby union==
{{main|History of rugby union matches between Canada and the United States}}
===Men's===
Both countries are middle-of-pack internationally in rugby union, and therefore closely matched.  Canada's [[List of Canada national rugby union team test matches|first win in an international "test match"]] was against the USA in 1977. The teams formerly faced each other in the regional [[PARA Pan American Championship]] and [[Churchill Cup]], and still do in the [[Pan American Games]] and [[Americas Rugby Championship]].

===Men's===
The two clubs frequently face each other in the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]], however the United States has historically been the stronger side.  The overall record {{as of|2011}} is 14-0 in favor of the United States, and American soccer fans [[Mexico–United States soccer rivalry|generally look to Mexico as the main rival]], while Canada is a secondary rival.&lt;ref name="thescore1"&gt;[http://blogs.thescore.com/footyblog/2011/06/08/canada-us-soccer-rivalry-as-limp-as-a-wet-noodle/] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120701180046/http://blogs.thescore.com/footyblog/2011/06/08/canada-us-soccer-rivalry-as-limp-as-a-wet-noodle/ |date=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has qualified for 10 world cups and has made it to the semifinals in 1930, the quarterfinals in 2002, and has made it to the round of 16 on numerous occasions, while the only time Canada qualified for the World Cup, they lost all their games and failed to score a goal. According to some Americans, Canada is not seen as a rival as they have not beaten the United States since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="thescore1"/&gt;

The US under-23 team defeated Canada to take the bronze medal at the [[Football at the 1999 Pan American Games – Men's tournament|1999 Pan-Am Games]] on Canadian soil in Winnipeg. On the other hand, Canada's under-20 team defeated the US to win their group of the [[2003 CONCACAF U-20 Tournament]] in Charleston, South Carolina.

===Women's===
The two teams are more closely matched than in the men's game, providing for more close finishes.  Notably the two nations faced each other in the final of the [[2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]] on Canadian soil in Edmonton, with the United States winning.  The two nations' senior sides met in the third place match of the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]] on American soil in Carson, California.  Also, Canada's senior team beat the US under-20 team in the final of the 2008 [[Cyprus Cup]].  At the [[2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournament]] in Vancouver, the US defeated Canada 4-0 in the final.

By 2012, the US won every match since 2001, 26 in a row.  There was a [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament – Knockout stage|memorable match between the two teams during 2012 London Olympics semi-finals]], which a concacaf.com columnist had described as the most important of their 26-year-long rivalry on the international scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concacaf.com/page/WOQ/NewsDetail/0,,12813~2872658,00.html |accessdate=November 8, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807083221/http://www.concacaf.com/page/WOQ/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C12813~2872658%2C00.html |archivedate=August 7, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Canadians led the match at three different points, but were ultimately defeated in overtime, allowing the Americans to advance to the Gold Medal Match. The United States most recently won the Women's World Cup on Canadian soil and increased their record to 3 World Cup wins and 4 Olympic gold medals. The overall series is 47 wins for the United States, 3 wins for Canada and 6 draws.

'''Carnia''' ({{lang-fur|Cjargne}} or ''Cjargna''/''Cjargno'' in local variants, {{lang-vec|Ciargna}}, {{lang-de|Karnien}}, {{lang-sl|Karnija}}) is a historical-geographic region in the northeastern [[Italy|Italian]] area of [[Friuli]]. Its 27 municipalities all belong to the [[Province of Udine]], which itself is part of the autonomous [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] region.

== History ==
[[File:Gallia cisalpina.jpg|thumb|Settlement area of the Carni in Roman [[Cisalpine Gaul]]]]
{{See|Carni}}
The name of the region, like neighbouring [[Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]], probably derives from the [[Carni]], a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe who had lived for centuries in the fertile plains between the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]] rivers where other Celtic peoples lived. Starting from 400 BC, the demographic growth and the pressure of the Germanic peoples, originated a migratory flood towards the south. The Carni crossed the Alps via the [[Plöcken Pass]] and settled in the region which is nowadays named Carnia and in the piedmont zone of Friuli. They practiced hunting and breeding. During the hard winters the herders used to move with their cattle down to the piedmont plains. Also they were skilful iron and wood manufacturers. The Carni were headed by a king and a sacerdotal caste of [[druid]]s.

===Antiquity===
The first historical date related to the arrival of the Carni is 186 BC, when some 50,000 Carni, composed of armed men, women and children descended towards the plains (in which they previously used to winter) and on a hill they founded a stable defensive settlement, ''Akileja''. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]], concerned by the expansion of this people, in 183 BC forced back the Carni to the mountains, they destroyed their settlement and they founded a defensive settlement at the north-east boundaries. The new settlement was named [[Aquileia]], after the former Celtic name Akileja. The triumvirs that founded that settlement were Publius Scipio Nasica, Caius Flaminius and Lucius Manlius Acidinus.

In order to stem the Roman expansion and to acquire the fertile and more hospitable plains, the Carni tried to form alliances with the [[Histri]]an, the [[Iapodes|Iapode]], and the [[Taurisci]] Celts. As Rome, in turn, was more and more becoming awere of the impending danger coming from the Carni and as it wanted to accelerate its own expansion, it sent to the north-east the legions of consul [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]], who finally defeated the Carni in a battle of 15 November 115 BC. 

Later on, the Carni, characterised by a docile temper and who had been defeated in battle, submitted to Rome, accepting its commands and its concessions. In the course of the following centuries, the Carni and Roman customs and blood would get mixed and this union of two deeply different cultures would slowly give rise to a new people, the Aquileiese or Friulan People. The mixing of the two languages would give rise to the [[Friulian]] language. In the mean time Aquileia enlarged its importance. It became a [[Municipium]] Romanum in 90 BC; it was an important commercial and hand-craft production centre. Also it was the main port on the [[Adriatic]] sea and a garrison settlemnent.

===Middle Ages===
Upon the [[Decline of the Roman Empire]] and the [[Migration Period]], the area was subdued by invading Germanic [[Ostrogoths]] under [[Theodoric the Great]] and later by the [[Lombards]], who incorporated it into the [[Duchy of Friuli]], part of their [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Italian kingdom]]. With adjacent [[Carantania]], Carnia was conquered by [[Francia|Frankish]] forces in the 774 campaign of [[Charlemagne]]. The Friulian dukes, successors of [[Hrodgaud of Friuli|Hrodgaud]] (d. 776), continued to rule as [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] vassals until the deposition of Duke [[Baldric of Friuli]] by Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] in 828, when it finally became a Carolingian [[march (territory)|march]]. In the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]], the area south of the main chain of the Carnic Alps was attributed to the realm of Emperor [[Lothair I]] ("[[Middle Francia]]"), it was inherited by his eldest son, King [[Louis II of Italy]] in 855.

When in 888 Margrave [[Berengar I of Italy|Berengar I of Friuli]] was crowned [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|King of Italy]], he moved his residence to [[Verona]] and established the large Italian ''[[March of Verona|Marca Veronensis et Aquileiensis]]'', comprising Friuli with Carnia, Veneto (except for [[Venice]] itself) and [[Trentino]]. In 951 Berengar's grandson King [[Berengar II of Italy]] had to lay down arms against the invading forces of King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I of Germany]]. At the 952 [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Augsburg]], he had to declare himself an [[East Francia|East Frankish]] vassal, and the whole Veronese march came under the rule of the German stem duchy of [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. In 976 it became part of the newly established [[Duchy of Carinthia]].

Carnia and Carinthia again went separate ways, when in 1077 King [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Germany]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]] with [[Pope Gregory VII]] split off large parts of Friuli to establish the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia (state)|Patriarchate of Aquileia]] as an [[Imperial State]]. As the patriarchate was gradually conquered by the [[Republic of Venice]], Carnia had passed from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the Venetian ''[[Domini di Terraferma]]'' by 1420.

==Language==
[[Italian language|Italian]] is the official language. Nevertheless, [[Friulian language|Friulian]], a [[Rhaeto-Romance languages|Rhaeto-Romance]] language, is widely spoken. The German [[Southern Bavarian]] dialect is spoken in the linguistic enclaves of [[Sauris]] (''Zahre'') and [[Paluzza]]-Timau (''Tischlwang''), as in the neighbouring regions of [[Veneto]] ([[Sappada]], [[Seven Communities]], [[Thirteen Communities]]) and [[Trentino]] ([[Luserna]] and [[Mocheni Valley]]).

== Geography ==
[[File:Carnia - Udine Provincia.png|thumb|Carnia within the Udine province]]
Carnia is located south of the main chain of the [[Carnic Alps]], in the northwest of the Udine province; it is bounded to the north by [[Austria]] and to the west by the Italian [[Veneto]] region. In the south it borders the [[Province of Pordenone]] and in the east the Canal del Ferro-Valcanale (Ferro-Valcanale outfall) separates it from the central and southern part of the Udine province. The region covers the western part of the mountainous region of the province, but not the eastern part (the [[Julian Alps]]), therefore it borders Veneto and the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], but not [[Slovenia]]. The main town is [[Tolmezzo]].

=== Valleys ===
Carnia is formed of seven valleys. Through each of them runs a stream from which the valleys take their name (except for Valcalda). Each of these valleys is usually referred to as a ''canale'' (in Italian) / ''cjanâl'' (in Friulian), i.e. an ''outfall'', to emphasize its long and narrow shape:

* Bût valley, [[Val Bût]] or Canale di San Pietro (in Friulian: ''Cjanâl di Sant Pieri'')
* Degano valley, [[Val Degano]] or Canale di Gorto (in Friulian: ''Cjanâl di Guart'')
* Lumiei valley, [[Val Lumiei]] (''Valade dal Lumiei'')
* Tagliamento valley, [[Val Tagliamento]] (in Friulian: ''Cjanâl di Soclêf'' or ''Petecarie'')
* Pesarina valley, [[Val Pesarina]] (in Friulian: ''Cjanâl Pedarç'')
* Chiarsò valley, [[Val Chiarsò]] or Canale di Incaroio (in Friulian: ''Cjanâl di Incjaroi'')
* Valcalda valley, [[Valcalda]] (in Friulian: ''Valcjalde'' or ''Cjanâl di Monai'')

Each of these valleys and their homonymous streams meet in a common valley floor where the main centre of Carnia is located: [[Tolmezzo]]

=== Mountains ===
Carnia's mountains are composed by different geologic belts. They are made of three different types of rock: [[limestone]], [[dolostone]] and flint-stone.

Carnia is spanned by the southern slope of the [[Carnic Alps]], which extend from [[Passo di Monte Croce di Comelico]] to [[sella di Camporosso]], where [[Alpi Giulie]] begin and rise (on the Italian side) between [[Fella (river)|Fella]] and the upper Isonzo rivers, and the adjacent [[Carnic Prealps]]. The north side of the Carnic ridge sets up the boundary with [[Austria]]; on the south it is delimited by the stream [[Pontebbana]], and, on the upper side of [[Pontebba]], by the flow of the Fella. Mount [[Coglians]] (m. 2780) is the highest peak of the Carnic Alps. Together with the cluster of [[Creta delle Cjanevate]] it forms an impressive horst at the Austrian boundary. Other main peaks of Carnia are:

* [[Mount Peralba]] m 2,694
* [[Mount Cridola]] m 2,580
* Mount Fleons m 2,507
* [[Mount Pramaggiore]] m 2,479
* [[Mount Bìvera]] m 2,472
* Mount Volaia m 2,470
* [[Creta Forata]] m 2,462
* [[Mount Siera]] m 2,443
* Mount Tiarfin m 2,417
* [[Monte Crostis|Mount Crostis]] m 2,252
* [[Creta di Timau]] m 2,218
* [[Mount Sernio]] m 2,190
* [[Mount Tinisa]] m 2,120

=== Rivers ===
The most important river is the [[Tagliamento]], which springs near the [[Mauria]] Pass (in the municipality of [[Lorenzago di Cadore]]) at an altitude of 1,195 m. Along its long way throughout Carnia, the Tagliamento river riceives water from 6 tributaries, all coming from left with respect to it: the [[Bût]], the [[Degano]], the [[Lumiei]], the [[Pesarina]], the [[Chiarsò]], and the [[Monai]], which name the valleys they lie in.

=== Flora ===
Forests are large and mostly composed of fir, beech, and larch. Pastures are located mainly at high altitudes, on sunny slopes which are not suitable for agriculture.

Carnia boasts a great deal of beautiful scenery thanks to the absence of big industrial centres and to the effective protection by environmentalist public agencies and organisations.

In Carnia 2,000 vegetable species, about a thousand types of [[mushroom]]s, and some fifty types of [[orchid]]s are grown.

Vegetation in Carnia changes with altitude. Up to the elevation of 400–500 metres stand durmast and chestnut forests and some submontane cultivation zones, but very soon thereafter they are replaced by the mountain flora, typical of the forests: beechwood, fir-wood, and pine-wood. Above 1,500 m, the arboreal vegetation becomes rather poor, and trees become more and more sparse, small and stunted up to the tree line, which in Carnia stands at 1,700 metres – the lowest of the Alpine regions Further on, only bushes and emerald-green pastures can be found.

In late spring on the highland pastures, a colour explosion of wild [[azalea]]s and [[gentian]]s can be observed.

=== Climate ===
The climate is severe, with very harsh winters and cool summers. It is characterised by strong winds and abundant precipitation. In comparison to the other areas of the [[Alps]] in Carnia the tree line is lower by about 400-500 m . For example, while in the Western Alps the vegetation stops growing above 2,300 m, in Carnia this is already the case at the elevation of 1,900 metres. This lower vegetation limit is due to the thermal inversion, caused by a constant outflow of a cold wind from the north-east ( the "burano" wind), which reaches the region from the Danube plains and even Siberia.

=== Protected areas ===
In Carnia the following areas have been declared as protected:

* Natural Park of Dolomiti (Parco naturale delle Dolomiti Friulane), located in [[Forni di Sopra]]
* Intermunicipal Park of Carnic Hills (Parco intercomunale delle Colline Carniche), located in [[Villa Santina]]

The '''China–Myanmar border''' is the international border that limits the territory of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and [[Myanmar]] (formerly ''Burma''). The border begins at [[Hkakabo Razi]] (5881 m), the highest mountain in [[Southeast Asia]], passing through the mountain ranges of [[Jigongshan]] and [[Jiangaosh]] (3302 m). It continues through mountainous areas and a small northern section of the [[Mekong River]], before ending at the border with [[Laos]].

Both fault zones are onshore extensions of the Bartlett Deep, or [[Cayman Trench]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]], which marks the tectonic boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].&lt;ref name="Ortega" /&gt; Both faults connect at sea west of the Guatemalan coast. To the west, the Polochic fault may branch onto the Tonala fault of western Chiapas. It does not continue at sea across the Pacific coastal plain and marine shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keppie|first=J.

'''Cleveland Abbe Jr.''' (March 25, 1872 – April 19, 1934) was an [[United States|American]] [[geographer]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on March 25, 1872. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="LeonardMarquis1908"/&gt; He took post-graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]], from which he received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1898. From 1901 to 1903 he studied geography at the [[University of Vienna|Imperial University]], [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name=americana&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia =[[Encyclopedia Americana]] |title=Cleveland Abbe Jr.|quote=American geographer and geologist, son of Cleveland Abbe: b. Washington, D. C, 25 March 1872. After graduating from Harvard University in 1894 he took up a post-graduate course at Johns Hopkins University, receiving his degree of Ph.D. in 1898. In 1894, on graduating from Harvard, he was appointed instructor in physiography at the Corcoran Scientific School of Columbian, now George Washington University, which position he held until 1897. ...&lt;!-- From 1896 until 1901 he was an assistant in the Maryland Geological Survey and, at various times during this period, taught geology and biology in the Western Maryland College. In 1899 he was appointed acting professor of natural sciences in the Winthrop Normal and Industrial College in South Carolina. In 1901 he left this position to follow a two years' special course in geography at the Imperial University, Vienna. Upon his return, two years later, he was appointed aid in the United States Geological Survey and, in 1906, he became research observer in the Weather Bureau. From 1908 to 1910 he was assistant editor of the Monthly Weather Review, after which he was appointed assistant librarian of the Weather Bureau.  --&gt;|year=1918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=52gMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12source=web&amp;ots=OwWnohH0RM&amp;sig=3vjirU_yXC78XmVktqq1U5txOzA |nopp=true |pages=volume 1, p. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, he worked in various occupations at locations in the eastern part of the [[United States]]. He was assistant editor of the ''[[Monthly Weather Review]]'' from 1908 to 1910, then became assistant librarian of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|United States Weather Bureau]].&lt;ref name=americana/&gt; He was dismissed from the government position in 1918 for "sympathies for the [[German Empire|Imperial German Government]]", a charge which he "indignantly denied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Abbe Dismissed For Pro-Germanism.

'''Dmitry Oreshkin''' ({{lang-ru|Дмитрий Орешкин}}; born 27 June 1953 in [[Moscow]]) is a Russian [[political scientist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svoboda.mobi/a/kennedy-anniversary-us-president/26763745.html Dmitry Oreshkin. With Putin, the deluge?]&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from special school No. 49 in Moscow in 1970, the Faculty of Geography of [[Moscow State University]] in 1975, and received Ph.D.  from the Institute of Geography of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] in 1979, (the thesis is devoted to the ancient continental glaciations).

In 1993, together with Andrem Skvortsov and Alexander Belyaev he created an analytical group, "Mercator" (Mercator Group). It was said that using the money earned from a documentary about the [[Aral Sea]] disaster, the group bought an [[Intel 80286]] PC computer in 1993 and began to draw e-cards, reflecting the results of the elections, the growth of crime, environmental crises and vodka consumption by region.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://persona.rin.ru/eng/view/f/0/21313/dmitry-oreshkin Biography Dmitry Oreshkin]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1994, the group is engaged in the manufacture of electronic cards for TV. Collaborated with the ''Results''  [[Yevgeny Kiselyov]], [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], in 1995-1996 he served at the regional Department of JSC  ''Russia's Public television''  ([[Channel One Russia|ORT]]). He makes live maps weather forecast for  ''Meteo-TV''. Engaged in computer simulation for leading news TV channels of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://persona.rin.ru/eng/view/f/0/21313/dmitry-oreshkin Biography Dmitry Oreshkin]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mercator group provided at the invitation of the [[Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation]] some analytical support and  displayed the process and results of Russian Legislative and President Elections. I also  made an electronic atlas of crisis situations for the [[Security Council of Russia]].

In the 2001 he was named  [[Rambler (portal)|Rambler]] ''Man of the year''  in the category  ''Cities and regions''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

In [[Russian legislative election, 2007|2007]], he ran for the [[State Duma]] from [[Union of Right Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://persona.rin.ru/eng/view/f/0/21313/dmitry-oreshkin Biography Dmitry Oreshkin]&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2, 2012he  spoke at a [[2011–13 Russian protests|rally on Bolotnaya square]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://slon.ru/russia/miting_na_sakharova_chto_govoryat_so_stseny-798263.xhtml Митинг на Сахарова. Тексты выступлений. Гудков: «Дума должна назначить перевыборы» — Slon.ru ]&lt;/ref&gt;

April 1, 2014 in his blog on the radio [[Echo of Moscow]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://echo.msk.ru/blog/oreshkin/ Блог Дмитрия Орешкина на радио «Эхо Москвы»]&lt;/ref&gt; strongly criticized Russia for its foreign policy towards [[Ukraine]], saying that : ''An Ambitious story began with a promise to return Ukraine (whole thing!) in the sphere of influence of Moscow, embedding it into the Customs Union and the Eurasian system of values. This is the maximum program. She obviously failed. It is the turn of the program-at least — to take under the wing of at least the Eastern Ukraine along with Crimea Today... ambitions declined: we hear passionate speeches about "our" Kharkiv and Donbas; less about Odessa. Kiev for 10 years slowly migrated to the West, the natural consequence of the greater attraction of the European system of values in comparison with Patriotic tales of the Corporation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://echo.msk.ru/blog/oreshkin/1291114-echo Финита ля комедия]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electro Gyro-Cator''' was claimed to be the world's first automated commercially available [[automotive navigation system]].&lt;ref name="honda"&gt;[http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1981navigationsystem/index.html Honda Worldwide | History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnavi-labo.net/topics/0612hist/history/history01.html "20 Years of Car Navigation" (in Japanese)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819145807/http://www.carnavi-labo.net/topics/0612hist/history/history01.html |date=August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was co-developed by [[Honda]], [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.honda.com/history/challenge/1981navigationsystem/text/04.html Honda Worldwide | History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alpine"&gt;[http://www.alpine.com/e/corporate/museum/78.html Alpine Electronics, Inc. alpine.com | Corporate Info &gt; Beginnings of Alpine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Stanley Electric Co..

Unlike most navigation systems of today, it did not use [[GPS]] [[Satellites]] to maintain its position and discern movement of the vehicle. Rather, it was an [[Inertial navigation system]], because it contained a helium gas [[gyroscope]] that could detect both rotation and movement. A special servo gear was also attached to the transmission housing to feed information to the Gyro-Cator to help maintain position, map speed and distance traveled.&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2007/11/30/hondas-1981-electro-gyrocator-vintage-gps-at-its-finest Honda's 1981 Electro Gyrocator: vintage navigation at its finest - Engadget&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transparent maps were placed inside the unit and it would scroll them past a 6 inch monochrome [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] illuminated screen as the car traveled along. The monitor would indicate by a series of circles (or cross hairs) on the screen to show your current location or display lines for path of travel. A marking pen was also included to help make personal indicators on the map if needed. Adjustments could be made to change the display scale, position, rotation, brightness, and contrast. In its only year of production in 1981, it was announced as an option on that year's [[Honda Accord]] and [[Honda Vigor]], but at ¥300,000 ($2,746 [[USD]]), it was almost a quarter of the value of the car. It is not clear how many units were actually sold to customers as a "dealer option". A patent for gyroscope design was introduced to the US in design patent D274332.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=jS4-AAAAEBAJ&amp;dq=honda&amp;as_drrb_ap=q&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=2009&amp;as_maxm_ap=1&amp;as_maxy_ap=2009&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;as_ptype=2&amp;num=100&amp;rview=1 - "CTR Terminal for vehicle navigation" Patent D274332 at Google Patents]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Documented weight for the unit was roughly 20&amp;nbsp;lb (9&amp;nbsp;kg). A display unit, with a cutaway of the Gyroscope, is currently shown at the [[Honda Collection Hall]] at [[Twin Ring Motegi]], Japan.

The '''Euphrates''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Euphrates.ogg|juː|ˈ|f|r|eɪ|t|iː|z}}; [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: {{Script/Cuneiform|sux|𒌓𒄒𒉣}} ''Buranuna''; {{lang-akk|{{cuneiform|7|𒌓𒄒𒉣}}}} ''Purattu''; {{lang-ar|الفرات}} ''al-Furāt''; {{lang-syr|̇ܦܪܬ}} ''Pǝrāt''; {{lang-hy|Եփրատ}}: ''Yeprat''; {{lang-he|פרת}} ''Perat''; {{lang-tr|Fırat}}; {{lang-ku|Firat}}) is the longest and one of the most historically important rivers of [[Western Asia]]. Together with the [[Tigris]], it is one of the two defining rivers of [[Mesopotamia]] (the "Land between the Rivers"). Originating in [[eastern Turkey]], the Euphrates flows through [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]] to join the Tigris in the [[Shatt al-Arab]], which empties into the [[Persian Gulf]].

== Etymology ==
The [[Ancient Greek]] form ''Euphrátēs'' ({{lang-grc|Εὐφράτης}}, as if from Greek εὖ "good" and ϕράζω "I announce or declare") was adapted from [[Old Persian]] 𐎢𐎳𐎼𐎠𐎬𐎢 ''Ufrātu'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Negev|Gibson|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself from [[Elamite language|Elamite]] 𒌑𒅁𒊏𒌅𒅖 ''ú-ip-ra-tu-iš''. The Elamite name is ultimately derived from a name spelt in [[cuneiform]] as 𒌓𒄒𒉣 , which read as [[Sumerian language]] is "Buranuna" and read as [[Akkadian language]] is "Purattu"; many cuneiform signs have a Sumerian pronunciation and an Akkadian pronunciation, taken from a Sumerian word and an Akkadian word that mean the same. In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] the river was called ''Purattu'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woods|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been perpetuated in [[Semitic languages]] (cf. [[Classical Syriac|Syriac]] ''P(ə)rāṯ'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-Furrāt'') and in other nearby languages of the time (cf. [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] ''Puranti'', [[Subartu|Sabarian]] ''Uruttu''). The Elamite, Akkadian, and possibly Sumerian forms are suggested to be from an unrecorded [[substrate language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Witzel |title=Early Loan Words in Western Central Asia: Substrates, Migrations and Trade ''Contact and Exchange in the Ancient World'', ed. Victor H. Mair (Univ. of Hawaii, 2006), 5; |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/C._ASIA_.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]] suggest the Proto-Sumerian *burudu "copper" (Sumerian ''urudu'') as an origin, with an explanation that Euphrates was the river by which the copper ore was transported in rafts, since Mesopotamia was the center of copper metallurgy during the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2aqp2n2mKkC&amp;pg=PA616&amp;lpg=PA616 |title=Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans: A Reconstruction and Historical Analysis of a Proto-Language and Proto-Culture |page=616 |first=Thomas |last=Gamkrelidze |first2= Vjaceslav |last2=V. Ivanov |year=1995 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest references to the Euphrates come from [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] texts found in [[Shuruppak]] and pre-[[Sargon of Akkad|Sargonic]] [[Nippur]] in southern [[Iraq]] and date to the mid-3rd millennium BCE. In these texts, written in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], the Euphrates is called ''Buranuna'' ([[logogram|logographic]]: UD.KIB.NUN). The name could also be written KIB.NUN.(NA) or &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;KIB.NUN, with the prefix "&lt;sup&gt;[[Dingir|d]]&lt;/sup&gt;" indicating that the river was a [[divinity]]. In Sumerian, the name of the city of [[Sippar]] in modern-day Iraq was also written UD.KIB.NUN, indicating a historically strong relationship between the city and the river.

== Course ==
The Euphrates is the longest river of [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zarins|1997|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerges from the confluence of the [[Karasu (Euphrates)|Kara Su]] or Western Euphrates ({{convert|450|km}}) and the [[Murat River|Murat Su]] or Eastern Euphrates ({{convert|650|km}}) {{convert|10|km}} upstream from the town of [[Keban (District), Elazığ|Keban]] in southeastern Turkey.&lt;ref name=neweden2006a71&gt;{{harvnb|Iraqi Ministries of Environment, Water Resources and Municipalities and Public Works|2006a|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daoudy and Frenken put the length of the Euphrates from the source of the Murat River to the confluence with the [[Tigris]] at {{convert|3000|km}}, of which {{convert|1230|km}} is in [[Turkey]], {{convert|710|km}} in [[Syria]] and {{convert|1060|km}} in Iraq.&lt;ref name=daoudy63&gt;{{harvnb|Daoudy|2005|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=frenken65&gt;{{harvnb|Frenken|2009|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same figures are given by Isaev and Mikhailova.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova384&gt;{{harvnb|Isaev|Mikhailova|2009|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of the [[Shatt al-Arab]], which connects the Euphrates and the Tigris with the [[Persian Gulf]], is given by various sources as {{convert|145|–|195|km}}.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova388&gt;{{harvnb|Isaev|Mikhailova|2009|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Kara Su and the Murat Su rise northwest from [[Lake Van]] at elevations of {{convert|3290|m}} and {{convert|3520|m}} [[Above mean sea level|amsl]], respectively.&lt;ref name=mutin2&gt;{{harvnb|Mutin|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the location of the [[Keban Dam]], the two rivers, now combined into the Euphrates, have dropped to an elevation of {{convert|693|m}} amsl. From Keban to the Syrian–Turkish border, the river drops another {{convert|368|m}} over a distance of less than {{convert|600|km}}. Once the Euphrates enters the [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Upper Mesopotamian]] plains, its [[Grade (slope)|grade]] drops significantly; within Syria the river falls {{convert|163|m}} while over the last stretch between [[Hīt]] and the Shatt al-Arab the river drops only {{convert|55|m}}.&lt;ref name=neweden2006a71/&gt;&lt;ref name=bilen100&gt;{{harvnb|Bilen|1994|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discharge of the Euphrates ===
The Euphrates receives most of its water in the form of rainfall and melting snow, resulting in peak volumes during the months April through May. [[Discharge (hydrology)|Discharge]] in these two months accounts for 36 percent of the total annual discharge of the Euphrates, or even 60–70 percent according to one source, while low runoff occurs in summer and autumn.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova384/&gt;&lt;ref name=neweden2006a91&gt;{{harvnb|Iraqi Ministries of Environment, Water Resources and Municipalities and Public Works|2006a|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average natural annual flow of the Euphrates has been determined from early- and mid-twentieth century records as {{convert|20.9|km3}} at Keban, {{convert|36.6|km3}} at [[Hīt]] and {{convert|21.5|km3}} at [[Hindiya]].&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova385&gt;{{harvnb|Isaev|Mikhailova|2009|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these averages mask the high inter-annual variability in discharge; at [[Birecik]], just north of the Syro–Turkish border, annual discharges have been measured that ranged from a low volume of {{convert|15.3|km3}} in 1961 to a high of {{convert|42.7|km3}} in 1963.&lt;ref name=kolars47&gt;{{harvnb|Kolars|1994|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discharge regime of the Euphrates has changed dramatically since the construction of the first dams in the 1970s. Data on Euphrates discharge collected after 1990 show the impact of the construction of the numerous dams in the Euphrates and of the increased withdrawal of water for irrigation. Average discharge at Hīt after 1990 has dropped to {{convert|356|m3}} per second ({{convert|11.2|km3}} per year). The seasonal variability has equally changed. The pre-1990 peak volume recorded at Hīt was {{convert|7510|m3}} per second, while after 1990 it is only {{convert|2514|m3}} per second. The minimum volume at Hīt remained relatively unchanged, rising from {{convert|55|m3}} per second before 1990 to {{convert|58|m3}} per second afterward.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova386&gt;{{harvnb|Isaev|Mikhailova|2009|p=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neweden2006a94&gt;{{harvnb|Iraqi Ministries of Environment, Water Resources and Municipalities and Public Works|2006a|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tributaries ===
[[File:Murat 05.jpg|right|thumb|View of the [[Murat River]]|alt=A river flowing through a wide valley]]
In Syria, three rivers add their water to the Euphrates; the [[Sajur River|Sajur]], the [[Balikh River|Balikh]] and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]]. These rivers rise in the foothills of the [[Taurus Mountains]] along the Syro–Turkish border and add comparatively little water to the Euphrates. The Sajur is the smallest of these tributaries; emerging from two streams near [[Gaziantep]] and draining the plain around [[Manbij]] before emptying into the [[reservoir]] of the [[Tishrin Dam]]. The Balikh receives most of its water from a [[Karst topography|karstic]] spring near 'Ayn al-'Arus and flows due south until it reaches the Euphrates at the city of [[Raqqa]]. In terms of length, drainage basin and discharge, the Khabur is the largest of these three. Its main karstic springs are located around [[Ras al-Ayn, al-Hasakah|Ra's al-'Ayn]], from where the Khabur flows southeast past [[Al-Hasakah]], where the river turns south and drains into the Euphrates near [[Busayrah]]. Once the Euphrates enters Iraq, there are no more natural tributaries to the Euphrates, although canals connecting the Euphrates basin with the Tigris basin exist.&lt;ref name=hillel95&gt;{{harvnb|Hillel|1994|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holezaitchik&gt;{{harvnb|Hole|Zaitchik|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Tigris–Euphrates river system}}
The [[drainage basin]]s of the Kara Su and the Murat River cover an area of {{convert|22000|km2}} and {{convert|40000|km2}}, respectively.&lt;ref name=neweden2006a71/&gt; Estimates of   the area of the Euphrates drainage basin vary widely; from a low {{convert|233000|km2}} to a high {{convert|766000|km2}}.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova384/&gt; Recent estimates put the basin area at {{convert|388000|km2}},&lt;ref name=neweden2006a71/&gt; {{convert|444000|km2}}&lt;ref name=daoudy63/&gt;&lt;ref name=shahin251&gt;{{harvnb|Shahin|2007|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{convert|579314|km2}}.&lt;ref name=partow4&gt;{{harvnb|Partow|2001|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater part of the Euphrates basin is located in Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. According to both Daoudy and Frenken, Turkey's share is 28 percent, Syria's is 17 percent and that of Iraq is 40 percent.&lt;ref name=daoudy63/&gt;&lt;ref name=frenken65/&gt; Isaev and Mikhailova estimate the percentages of the drainage basin lying within Turkey, Syria and Iraq at 33, 20 and 47 percent respectively.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova384/&gt; Some sources estimate that approximately 15 percent of the drainage basin is located within [[Saudi Arabia]], while a small part falls inside the borders of [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=daoudy63/&gt;&lt;ref name=frenken65/&gt; Finally, some sources also include [[Jordan]] in the drainage basin of the Euphrates; a small part of the eastern desert ({{convert|220|km2}}) drains toward the east rather than to the west.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova384/&gt;&lt;ref name=frenken63&gt;{{harvnb|Frenken|2009|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rafetus euphraticus (29056605113).jpg|thumb|''[[Rafetus euphraticus]]'']]
The Euphrates flows through a number of distinct [[vegetation]] zones. Although millennia-long human occupation in most parts of the Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a [[xeric]] [[woodland]]. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various [[oak]]s, [[pistacia|pistachio trees]], and ''[[Rosaceae]]'' (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and ''Rosaceae''. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including [[einkorn wheat]], [[emmer wheat]], [[oat]] and [[rye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|Hillman|Legge|2000|pp=52–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-[[steppe]] vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syro–Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by [[Artemisia herba-alba|white wormwood]] (''Artemisia herba-alba'') and ''[[Chenopodiaceae]]''. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of [[sheep]] and [[goat]] [[pastoralism]] by its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|Hillman|Legge|2000|pp=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true [[desert]]. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of ''Chenopodiaceae'' or ''[[Poa|Poa sinaica]]''. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a [[riparian zone|riverine forest]]. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the [[Platanus orientalis|Oriental plane]], the [[Populus|Euphrates poplar]], the [[Tamarix|tamarisk]], the [[Fraxinus|ash]] and various wetland plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|Hillman|Legge|2000|pp=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the fish species in the Tigris–Euphrates basin, the family of the [[Cyprinidae]] are the most common, with 34 species out of 52 in total.&lt;ref name=coad&gt;{{harvnb|Coad|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Cyprinids, the [[Mangar (fish)|mangar]] has good [[Recreational fishing|sport fishing]] qualities, leading the British to nickname it "Tigris salmon." The ''[[Euphrates softshell turtle|Rafetus euphraticus]]'' is an endangered [[Trionychidae|soft-shelled turtle]] that is limited to the Tigris–Euphrates river system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1864|pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=navalintelligencedivision203205&gt;{{harvnb|Naval Intelligence Division|1944|pp=203–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] palace reliefs from the 1st millennium BCE depict [[lion]] and bull hunts in fertile landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomason|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteenth to nineteenth century European travellers in the Syrian Euphrates basin reported on an abundance of animals living in the area, many of which have become rare or even extinct. Species like [[gazelle]], [[onager]] and the now-extinct [[Arabian ostrich]] lived in the steppe bordering the Euphrates valley, while the valley itself was home to the [[wild boar]]. Carnivorous species include the [[gray wolf]], the [[golden jackal]], the [[red fox]], the [[leopard]] and the lion. The [[Syrian brown bear]] can be found in the mountains of Southeast Turkey. The presence of [[European beaver]] has been attested in the bone assemblage of the prehistoric site of [[Abu Hureyra]] in Syria, but the beaver has never been sighted in historical times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|Hillman|Legge|2000|pp=85–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bassin Tigre Euphrate.jpg|thumb|Map (in French) showing the locations of dams and barrages built in the [[Syria|Syro]]–[[Turkey|Turkish]] part of the Euphrates basin|alt=Refer to caption]]

The [[Hindiya Barrage]] on the Iraqi Euphrates, based on plans by British civil engineer [[William Willcocks]] and finished in 1913, was the first modern water diversion structure built in the Tigris–Euphrates river system.&lt;ref name=kliot&gt;{{harvnb|Kliot|1994|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hindiya Barrage was followed in the 1950s by the [[Ramadi Barrage]] and the nearby Abu Dibbis Regulator, which serve to regulate the flow regime of the Euphrates and to discharge excess flood water into the [[Depression (geology)|depression]] that is now [[Lake Habbaniyah]]. Iraq's largest dam on the Euphrates is the [[Haditha Dam]]; a {{convert|9|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[embankment dam|earth-fill dam]] creating [[Lake Qadisiyah]].&lt;ref name=neweden2006b2021&gt;{{harvnb|Iraqi Ministries of Environment, Water Resources and Municipalities and Public Works|2006b|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria and Turkey built their first dams in the Euphrates in the 1970s. The [[Tabqa Dam]] in Syria was completed in 1973 while Turkey finished the Keban Dam, a prelude to the immense [[Southeastern Anatolia Project]], in 1974. Since then, Syria has built two more dams in the Euphrates, the [[Baath Dam]] and the Tishrin Dam, and plans to build a fourth dam – the [[Halabiye Dam]] – between Raqqa and [[Deir ez-Zor]].&lt;ref name=jamous&gt;{{harvnb|Jamous|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tabqa Dam is Syria's largest dam and its reservoir ([[Lake Assad]]) is an important source of irrigation and drinking water. It was planned that {{convert|640000|ha|sqmi}} should be irrigated from Lake Assad, but in 2000 only {{convert|100000|–|124000|ha|sqmi}} had been realized.&lt;ref name=Elhadj&gt;{{harvnb|Elhadj|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mutin4&gt;{{harvnb|Mutin|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Syria also built three smaller dams on the Khabur and its tributaries.&lt;ref name=mutin5&gt;{{harvnb|Mutin|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the implementation of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (''{{lang-tr|Güneydoğu Anadolu Projesi}}'', or ''GAP'') in the 1970s, Turkey launched an ambitious plan to harness the waters of the Tigris and the Euphrates for irrigation and hydroelectricity production and provide an economic stimulus to its southeastern provinces.&lt;ref name=kolarsmitchell19&gt;{{harvnb|Kolars|Mitchell|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; GAP affects a total area of {{convert|75000|km2}} and approximately 7 million people; representing about 10 percent of Turkey's total surface area and population, respectively. When completed, GAP will consist of 22 dams – including the Keban Dam – and 19 power plants and provide irrigation water to {{convert|1700000|ha|sqmi}} of agricultural land, which is about 20 percent of the irrigable land in Turkey.&lt;ref name=jongerden138&gt;{{harvnb|Jongerden|2010|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; C. {{convert|910000|ha|sqmi}} of this irrigated land is located in the Euphrates basin.&lt;ref name=aquastat62&gt;{{harvnb|Frenken|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; By far the largest dam in GAP is the [[Atatürk Dam]], located c. {{convert|55|km}} northwest of [[Şanlıurfa]]. This {{convert|184|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} and {{convert|1820|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} dam was completed in 1992; thereby creating a reservoir that is the third-largest lake in Turkey. With a maximum capacity of {{convert|48.7|km3}}, the Atatürk Dam reservoir is large enough to hold the entire annual discharge of the Euphrates.&lt;ref name=isaevmikhailova383384&gt;{{harvnb|Isaev|Mikhailova|2009|pp=383–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of GAP was scheduled for 2010 but has been delayed because the [[World Bank]] has withheld funding due to the lack of an official agreement on water sharing between Turkey and the downstream states on the Euphrates and the Tigris.&lt;ref name=jongerden139&gt;{{harvnb|Jongerden|2010|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from barrages and dams, Iraq has also created an intricate network of canals connecting the Euphrates with  Lake Habbaniyah, [[Lake Tharthar]], and Abu Dibbis reservoir; all of which can be used to store excess floodwater. Via the [[Shatt al-Hayy]], the Euphrates is connected with the Tigris. The largest canal in this network is the Main Outfall Drain or so-called "Third River;" constructed between 1953 and 1992. This {{convert|565|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} canal is intended to drain the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris south of [[Baghdad]] to prevent [[Soil salinity#Salinity due to irrigation|soil salinization]] from irrigation. It also allows large freight barges to navigate up to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=kolars53&gt;{{harvnb|Kolars|1994|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=daoudy127&gt;{{harvnb|Daoudy|2005|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hillel100&gt;{{harvnb|Hillel|1994|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental and social effects ===
{{See also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}

The construction of the dams and irrigation schemes on the Euphrates has had a significant impact on the environment and society of each riparian country. The dams constructed as part of GAP – in both the Euphrates and the Tigris basins – have affected 382 villages and almost 200,000 people have been resettled elsewhere. The largest number of people was displaced by the building of the Atatürk Dam, which alone affected 55,300 people.&lt;ref name=casestudygap10&gt;{{harvnb|Sahan|Zogg|Mason|Gilli|2001|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey among those who were displaced showed that the majority were unhappy with their new situation and that the compensation they had received was considered insufficient.&lt;ref name=casestudygap11&gt;{{harvnb|Sahan|Zogg|Mason|Gilli|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flooding of Lake Assad led to the forced displacement of c. 4,000 families, who were resettled in other parts of northern Syria as part of a now abandoned plan to create an "[[Kurds in Syria#Arab cordon|Arab belt]]" along the borders with Turkey and Iraq.&lt;ref name=anonymous11&gt;{{harvnb|Anonymous|2009|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcdowall475&gt;{{harvnb|McDowall|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hillel107&gt;{{harvnb|Hillel|1994|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the changes in the discharge regime of the river, the numerous dams and irrigation projects have also had other effects on the environment. The creation of reservoirs with large surfaces in countries with high average temperatures has led to increased [[evaporation]]; thereby reducing the total amount of water that is available for human use. Annual evaporation from reservoirs has been estimated at {{convert|2|km3}} in Turkey, {{convert|1|km3}} in Syria and {{convert|5|km3}} in Iraq.&lt;ref name=hillel103&gt;{{harvnb|Hillel|1994|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water quality in the Iraqi Euphrates is low because irrigation water tapped in Turkey and Syria flows back into the river, together with dissolved fertilizer chemicals used on the fields.&lt;ref name=aquastat212&gt;{{harvnb|Frenken|2009|p=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salinity of Euphrates water in Iraq has increased as a result of upstream dam construction, leading to lower suitability as drinking water.&lt;ref name=rahihalihan&gt;{{harvnb|Rahi|Halihan|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many dams and irrigation schemes, and the associated large-scale water abstraction, have also had a detrimental effect on the ecologically already fragile [[Mesopotamian Marshes]] and on freshwater fish [[habitat]]s in Iraq.&lt;ref name=jawad&gt;{{harvnb|Jawad|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muir&gt;{{harvnb|Muir|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inundation of large parts of the Euphrates valley, especially in Turkey and Syria, has led to the flooding of many [[archaeological site]]s and other places of cultural significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McClellan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered [[cultural heritage]] as possible, many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma]] with its unique [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s by the reservoir of the [[Birecik Dam]] has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press.&lt;ref name=tanaka&gt;{{harvnb|Tanaka|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=steele5253&gt;{{harvnb|Steele|2005|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by [[UNESCO]] to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the [[Natufian culture|Natufian]] to the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] period, and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the flood zone. Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include [[Mureybet]], [[Emar]] and Abu Hureyra.&lt;ref name=bounni&gt;{{harvnb|Bounni|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed, which led, among others, to the flooding of the important [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] site of Jerf el-Ahmar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|del Olmo Lete|Montero Fenollós|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Archaeological field survey|archaeological survey]] and [[Rescue archaeology|rescue excavations]] were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq.&lt;ref name=abdulamir&gt;{{harvnb|Abdul-Amir|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake, resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research, but also providing opportunities for [[Archaeological looting in Iraq|looting]], which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq in the wake of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]].&lt;ref name=garcianavarro&gt;{{harvnb|Garcia-Navarro|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palaeolithic to Chalcolithic periods ===
The early occupation of the Euphrates basin was limited to its upper reaches; that is, the area that is popularly known as the [[Fertile Crescent]]. [[Acheulean]] stone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] have been found in the Sajur basin and in the [[El Kowm (archaeological site)|El Kowm oasis]] in the central [[Syrian steppe]]; the latter together with remains of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' that were dated to 450,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muhesen|2002|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schmid|Rentzel|Renault-Miskovsky|Muhesen|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Taurus Mountains and the upper part of the Syrian Euphrates valley, early permanent villages such as Abu Hureyra – at first occupied by [[hunter-gatherer]]s but later by some of the earliest [[farmer]]s, Jerf el-Ahmar, Mureybet and [[Nevalı Çori]] became established from the eleventh millennium BCE onward.&lt;ref name=sagonazimansky4954&gt;{{harvnb|Sagona|Zimansky|2009|pp=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of irrigation, these early farming communities were limited to areas where rainfed agriculture was possible, that is, the upper parts of the Syrian Euphrates as well as Turkey.&lt;ref name=akkermansschwartz74&gt;{{harvnb|Akkermans|Schwartz|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Neolithic villages, characterized by the introduction of [[pottery]] in the early 7th millennium BCE, are known throughout this area.&lt;ref name=akkermansschwartz110&gt;{{harvnb|Akkermans|Schwartz|2003|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupation of lower Mesopotamia started in the 6th millennium and is generally associated with the introduction of irrigation, as rainfall in this area is insufficient for dry agriculture. Evidence for irrigation has been found at several sites dating to this period, including [[Tell es Sawwan|Tell es-Sawwan]].&lt;ref name=helbaek&gt;{{harvnb|Helbaek|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 5th millennium BCE, or late [[Ubaid period]], northeastern Syria was dotted by small villages, although some of them grew to a size of over {{convert|10|ha}}.&lt;ref name=akkermansschwartz163166&gt;{{harvnb|Akkermans|Schwartz|2003|pp=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iraq, sites like [[Eridu]] and [[Ur]] were already occupied during the Ubaid period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oates|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay boat models found at [[Tell Mashnaqa]] along the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] indicate that riverine transport was already practiced during this period.&lt;ref name=akkermansschwartz167168&gt;{{harvnb|Akkermans|Schwartz|2003|pp=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uruk period]], roughly coinciding with the 4th millennium BCE, saw the emergence of truly [[urbanism|urban]] settlements across Mesopotamia. Cities like [[Nagar, Syria|Tell Brak]] and [[Uruk]] grew to over {{convert|100|ha}} in size and displayed monumental architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ur|Karsgaard|Oates|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of southern Mesopotamian pottery, architecture and [[cylinder seal|sealings]] far into Turkey and [[Iran]] has generally been interpreted as the material reflection of a widespread trade system aimed at providing the Mesopotamian cities with raw materials. [[Habuba Kabira]] on the Syrian Euphrates is a prominent example of a settlement that is interpreted as an Uruk colony.&lt;ref name=akkermansschwartz203&gt;{{harvnb|Akkermans|Schwartz|2003|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vandemieroop3839&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===
&lt;!-- deleted file removed [[File:The ancient city of Mari.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] during the 3rd–2nd millennia BCE|alt=A wide valley with a meandering river and a straight canal branching off and flowing through a circular city with two concentric city walls, surrounded by agricultural fields]]--&gt;
During the [[Jemdet Nasr period|Jemdet Nasr]] (3600–3100 BCE) and Early Dynastic periods (3100–2350 BCE), southern Mesopotamia experienced a growth in the number and size of settlements, suggesting strong population growth. These settlements, including [[Sumero-Akkadian]] sites like [[Sippar]], [[Uruk]], [[Adab (city)|Adab]] and [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], were organized in competing [[city-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these cities were located along canals of the Euphrates and the Tigris that have since dried up, but that can still be identified from [[remote sensing]] imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hritz|Wilkinson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar development took place in [[Upper Mesopotamia]], [[Subartu]] and [[Assyria]], although only from the mid 3rd millennium and on a smaller scale than in Lower Mesopotamia. Sites like [[Ebla]], [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Tell Leilan]] grew to prominence for the first time during this period.&lt;ref name=akkermansschwartz233&gt;{{harvnb|Akkermans|Schwartz|2003|p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large parts of the Euphrates basin were for the first time united under a single ruler during the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2154 BC) and [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III]] empires, which controlled – either directly or indirectly through vassals – large parts of modern-day Iraq and northeastern Syria.&lt;ref name=vandemieroop63&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their collapse, the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (1975–1750 BCE) and Mari asserted their power over northeast Syria and northern Mesopotamia, while southern Mesopotamia was controlled by city-states like [[Isin]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] and [[Larsa]] before their territories were absorbed by the newly emerged state of [[Babylonia]] under [[Hammurabi]] in the early to mid 18th century BCE.&lt;ref name=vandemieroop111&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE, the Euphrates basin was divided between [[Kassites|Kassite]] Babylon in the south and [[Mitanni]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Hittites|Hittite Empire]] in the north, with the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC) eventually eclipsing the Hittites, Mitanni and Kassite Babylonians.&lt;ref name=vandemieroop132&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the end of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the late 11th century BCE, struggles broke out between Babylonia and Assyria over the control of the Iraqi Euphrates basin. The [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935–605 BC) eventually emerged victorious out of this conflict and also succeeded in gaining control of the northern Euphrates basin in the first half of the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=vandemieroop241&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the centuries to come, control of the wider Euphrates basin shifted from the Neo-Assyrian Empire (which collapsed between 612 and 599 BC) to the short lived [[Median Empire]] (612–546 BC) and equally brief [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (612–539 BC) in the last years of the 7th century BC, and eventually to the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–333 BC).&lt;ref name=vandemieroop270&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achaemenid Empire was in turn overrun by [[Alexander the Great]], who defeated the last king [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] and died in Babylon in 323 BCE.&lt;ref name=vandemieroop286&gt;{{harvnb|van de Mieroop|2007|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to this, the region came under the control of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (312–150 BC), [[Parthian Empire]] (150–226 AD) (during which several [[Neo-Assyrian]] states such as [[Adiabene]] came to rule certain regions of the Euphrates), and was fought over by the [[Roman Empire]], its succeeding [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Sassanid Empire]] (226–638 AD), until the [[Islamic conquest]] of the mid 7th century AD. The [[Battle of Karbala]] took place near the banks of this river in 680 AD.

After [[World War I]], the borders in Southwest Asia were redrawn in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]], when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|partitioned]]. Clause 109 of the treaty stipulated that the three riparian states of the Euphrates (at that time Turkey, [[France]] for its [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syrian mandate]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for its [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|mandate of Iraq]]) had to reach a mutual agreement on the use of its water and on the construction of any hydraulic installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/Treaty_of_Lausanne |title=Treaty of peace with Turkey signed at Lausanne |publisher=World War I Document Archive |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement between Turkey and Iraq signed in 1946 required Turkey to report to Iraq on any hydraulic changes it made on the Tigris–Euphrates river system, and allowed Iraq to construct dams on Turkish territory to manage the flow of the Euphrates.&lt;ref name=geopolicity1112&gt;{{harvnb|Geopolicity|2010|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey and Syria completed their first dams on the Euphrates – the Keban Dam and the Tabqa Dam, respectively – within one year of each other and filling of the reservoirs commenced in 1975. At the same time, the area was hit by severe drought and river flow toward Iraq was reduced from {{convert|15.3|km3}} in 1973 to {{convert|9.4|km3}} in 1975. This led to an international crisis during which Iraq threatened to bomb the Tabqa Dam. An agreement was eventually reached between Syria and Iraq after intervention by Saudi Arabia and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=shapland117118&gt;{{harvnb|Shapland|1997|pp=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kaya&gt;{{harvnb|Kaya|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar crisis, although not escalating to the point of military threats, occurred in 1981 when the Keban Dam reservoir had to be refilled after it had been almost emptied to temporarily increase Turkey's hydroelectricity production.&lt;ref name=kolars49&gt;{{harvnb|Kolars|1994|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Turkey unilaterally declared that it would ensure a flow of at least {{convert|500|m3}} per second, or {{convert|16|km3}} per year, into Syria, and in 1987 a bilateral treaty to that effect was signed between the two countries.&lt;ref name=daoudy169-170&gt;{{harvnb|Daoudy|2005|pp=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another bilateral agreement from 1989 between Syria and Iraq settles the amount of water flowing into Iraq at 60 percent of the amount that Syria receives from Turkey.&lt;ref name=geopolicity1112/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaya/&gt;&lt;ref name=daoudy1720&gt;{{harvnb|Daoudy|2005|pp=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Turkey, Syria and Iraq instigated the Joint Trilateral Committee (JTC) on the management of the water in the Tigris–Euphrates basin and on 3 September 2009 a further agreement was signed to this effect.&lt;ref name=geopolicity16&gt;{{harvnb|Geopolicity|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On April 15, 2014, Turkey began to reduce the flow of the Euphrates into Syria and Iraq. The flow was cut off completely on May 16, 2014 resulting in the Euphrates terminating at the Turkish–Syrian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/19970|title=A new Turkish aggression against Syria: Ankara suspends pumping Euphrates' water|work=[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]|date=30 May 2014|first=Suhaib|last=Anjarini|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in violation of an agreement reached in 1987 in which Turkey committed to releasing a minimum of {{convert|500|m3}} of water per second at the Turkish–Syrian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuCd0blQ2V0|title=Eupherates of Syria Cut Off by Turkey|date=30 May 2014|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history, the Euphrates has been of vital importance to those living along its course. With the construction of large hydropower stations, irrigation schemes, and pipelines capable of transporting water over large distances, many more people now depend on the river for basic amenities such as electricity and drinking water than in the past. Syria's Lake Assad is the most important source of drinking water for the city of [[Aleppo]], {{convert|75|km}} to the west of the river valley.&lt;ref name=shapland110&gt;{{harvnb|Shapland|1997|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake also supports a modest state-operated fishing industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krouma|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through a newly restored power line, the Haditha Dam in Iraq provides electricity to Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Hara|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jordan''' is situated geographically in [[Southwest Asia]], south of [[Syria]], west of [[Iraq]], northwest of [[Saudi Arabia]] and east of [[Israel]] and the [[West Bank]]; politically, the area has also been referred to in the [[Western world|West]] as the [[Middle East|Middle]] or [[Near East]]. The territory of [[Jordan]] now covers about {{convert|91,880|sqkm}}.

Between 1950 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, although not widely recognized, Jordan claimed and administered an additional {{convert|5,880|sqkm}} encompassing the West Bank; in 1988 and with continuing Israeli occupation, [[King Hussein]] relinquished Jordan's claim to the West Bank in favor of the [[Palestinians]].

Jordan is landlocked except at its southern extremity, where nearly {{convert|26|km}} of shoreline along the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] provide access to the [[Red Sea]].

'''[[Geographic coordinates]]:'''
{{coord|31|00|N|36|00|E|type:country}}

==Boundaries==
[[File:Jordan Topography.png|thumb|350px|[[Borders of Jordan]].]]
Except for small sections of the borders with Israel and Syria, Jordan's international boundaries do not follow well-defined natural features of the terrain. The country's boundaries were established by various international agreements and with the exception of the border with Israel, none was in dispute in early 1989.

Jordan's boundaries with Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia do not have the special significance that the border with Israel does; these borders have not always hampered tribal nomads in their movements, yet for a few groups borders did separate them from traditional grazing areas and delimited by a series of agreements between the United Kingdom and the government of what eventually became Saudi Arabia) was first formally defined in the Hadda Agreement of 1925.

In 1965 Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded an agreement that realigned and delimited the boundary. The realignment resulted in some exchange of territory, and Jordan's coastline on the Gulf of Aqaba was lengthened by about {{convert|18|km}}. The new boundary enabled Jordan to expand its port facilities and established a zone in which the two parties agreed to share petroleum revenues equally if oil were discovered. The agreement also protected the pasturage and watering rights of nomadic tribes inside the exchanged territories.

==Topography==
[[File:Middle East Topographic Political EN.svg|thumb|A satellite map of the Middle East with Jordan in the center.]]
[[File:Salt, Jordan.jpg|thumb|A village near [[Al-Salt]] in the [[Balqa Governorate]].]]
[[File:wadirum66.jpg|thumb|[[Wadi Rum]] in Southern Jordan.]]

The country consists mainly of a [[plateau]]&lt;!--How is it called?--&gt; between {{convert|700|m}} and {{convert|1,200|m}} meters high, divided into [[ridge]]s by [[valley]]s and [[Canyon|gorges]], and a few mountainous areas. West of the plateau, land descents form the East Bank of  the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. The valley is part of the north-south [[Great Rift Valley]], and its successive depressions are [[Lake Tiberias]] (Sea of Galilee; its bottom is about {{convert|-258|m}}), [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]], the [[Dead Sea]] (its bottom is about {{convert|-730|m}}), [[Arabah]], and the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] at the [[Red Sea]]. Jordan's western border follows the bottom of the rift. Although an earthquake-prone region, no severe shocks had been recorded for several centuries.

By far the greatest part of the East Bank is [[desert]], displaying the land forms and other features associated with great aridity. Most of this land is part of the [[Syrian Desert]] and northern [[Arabian Desert]]. There are broad expanses of [[sand]] and [[dune]]s, particularly in the south and southeast, together with [[salt pan (geology)|salt flats]]. Occasional jumbles of sandstone hills or low mountains support only meager and stunted vegetation that thrives for a short period after the scanty winter rains. These areas support little life and are the least populated regions of Jordan.

The drainage network is coarse and incised. In many areas the relief provides no eventual outlet to the sea, so that [[sediment|sedimentary deposits]] accumulate in basins where moisture evaporates or is absorbed in the ground. Toward the depression in the western part of the East Bank, the desert rises gradually into the Jordanian Highlands—a steppe country of high, deeply cut limestone plateaus with an average elevation of about 900 meters. Occasional summits in this region reach 1,200 meters in the northern part and exceed 1,700 meters in the southern part; the highest peak is [[Jabal Ramm]] at 1,754 meters (though the highest peak in all of Jordan is [[Jabal Umm al Dami]] at 1854 meters.  It is located in a remote part of southern Jordan). These highlands are an area of long-settled villages.

The western edge of this plateau country forms an escarpment along the eastern side of the [[Jordan River]]-Dead Sea depression and its continuation south of the Dead Sea. Most of the [[wadi]]s that provide drainage from the plateau country into the depression carry water only during the short season of winter rains. Sharply incised with deep, canyon-like walls, whether flowing or dry the wadis can be formidable obstacles to travel.

The [[Jordan River]] is short, but from its mountain headwaters (approximately 160 kilometers north of the river's mouth at the Dead Sea) the riverbed drops from an elevation of about 3,000 meters above sea level to more than 400 meters below sea level. Before reaching Jordanian territory the river forms the [[Sea of Galilee]], the surface of which is 212 meters below sea level. The Jordan River's principal tributary is the [[Yarmouk River]]. Near the junction of the two rivers, the Yarmouk forms the boundary between Israel on the northwest, Syria on the northeast, and Jordan on the south. The [[Zarqa River]], the second main tributary of the Jordan River, flows and empties entirely within the East Bank.

A 380-kilometer-long rift valley runs from the Yarmouk River in the north to Al Aqaba in the south. The northern part, from the Yarmouk River to the Dead Sea, is commonly known as the Jordan Valley. It is divided into eastern and western parts by the Jordan River. Bordered by a steep escarpment on both the eastern and the western side, the valley reaches a maximum width of twenty-two kilometers at some points. The valley is properly known as ''Al Ghawr'' or ''Al Ghor'' (the depression, or valley).

The rift valley on the southern side of the Dead Sea is known as the Southern ''Ghawr'' and the Wadi al Jayb (popularly known as the Wadi al Arabah). The Southern Ghawr runs from Wadi al Hammah, on the south side of the Dead Sea, to Ghawr Faya, about twenty-five kilometers south of the Dead Sea. Wadi al Jayb is 180 kilometers long, from the southern shore of the Dead Sea to Al Aqaba in the south. The valley floor varies in level. In the south, it reaches its lowest level at the Dead Sea (more than 400 meters below sea level), rising in the north to just above sea level. Evaporation from the sea is extreme due to year-round high temperatures. The water contains about 250&amp;nbsp;grams of dissolved salts per liter at the surface and reaches the saturation point at 110 meters.

The Dead Sea occupies the deepest depression on the land surface of the earth. The depth of the depression is accentuated by the surrounding mountains and highlands that rise to elevations of 800 to 1,200 meters above sea level. The sea's greatest depth is about 430 meters, and it thus reaches a point more than 825 meters below sea level. A drop in the level of the sea has caused the former [[Lisan Peninsula]] to become a land bridge dividing the sea into separate northern and southern basins.

==Climate==
[[File:Jordan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|A [[Köppen climate classification]] map of Jordan.]]
[[File:jordan232.jpg|right|thumb|The countryside near [[Al-Salt|Salt]].]]
[[File:Jordansnow9.jpg|thumb|Snow in Amman.]]
The major characteristic of the climate is the contrast between a relatively rainy season from November to April and very dry weather for the rest of the year. With hot, dry, uniform summers and cool, variable winters during which practically all of the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] occurs, the country has a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean-style climate]].

In general, the farther inland from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] a given part of the country lies, the greater are the seasonal contrasts in temperature and the less rainfall. [[Atmospheric pressure]]s during the summer months are relatively uniform, whereas the winter months bring a succession of marked low pressure areas and accompanying [[cold front]]s. These cyclonic disturbances generally move eastward from over the Mediterranean Sea several times a month and result in sporadic precipitation.

Most of the East Bank receives less than {{convert|120|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain a year and may be classified as a dry [[desert]] or [[steppe]] region. Where the ground rises to form the highlands east of the Jordan Valley, precipitation increases to around {{convert|300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the south and {{convert|500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} or more in the north. The [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan Valley]], lying in the lee of high ground on the West Bank, forms a narrow climatic zone that annually receives up to {{convert|300|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain in the northern reaches; rain dwindles to less than {{convert|120|mm|in|1|sp=us}} at the head of the [[Dead Sea]].

The country's long summer reaches a peak during August. January is usually the coolest month. The fairly wide ranges of temperature during a twenty-four-hour period are greatest during the summer months and have a tendency to increase with higher elevation and distance from the Mediterranean seacoast. Daytime temperatures during the summer months frequently exceed {{convert|36|°C|1}} and average about {{convert|32|°C|1}}. In contrast, the winter months—November to April—bring moderately cool and sometimes cold weather, averaging about {{convert|13|°C|1}}. Except in the rift depression, frost is fairly common during the winter, it may take the form of snow at the higher elevations of the north western highlands. Usually it [[snow]]s a couple of times a year in western [[Amman]].

For a month or so before and after the summer dry season, hot, dry air from the desert, drawn by low pressure, produces strong winds from the south or southeast that sometimes reach [[gale]] force. Known in the Middle East by various names, including the khamsin, this dry, sirocco-style wind is usually accompanied by great dust clouds. Its onset is heralded by a hazy sky, a falling [[barometer]], and a drop in relative humidity to about 10 percent. Within a few hours there may be a {{convert|10|F-change}} to {{convert|15|F-change}} rise in temperature. These windstorms ordinarily last a day or so, cause much discomfort, and destroy [[crop]]s by desiccating them.

The [[Shamal (wind)|shamal]], another wind of some significance, comes from the north or northwest, generally at intervals between June and September. Remarkably steady during daytime hours but becoming a breeze at night, the shamal may blow for as long as nine days out of ten and then repeat the process. It originates as a dry continental mass of polar air that is warmed as it passes over the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. The dryness allows intense heating of the Earth's surface by the sun, resulting in high daytime temperatures that moderate after sunset.

'''Georges François Paul Marie Matheron''' (December 2, 1930 – August 7, 2000) was a French [[mathematician]] and geologist, known as the founder of [[geostatistics]] and a co-founder (together with [[Jean Serra]]) of [[mathematical morphology]]. In 1968, he created the [[Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique]] at the [[Paris School of Mines]] in [[Fontainebleau]]. He is known for his contributions on [[Kriging]] and mathematical morphology. His seminal work is posted for study and review to the Online Library of the ''Centre de Géostatistique'', Fontainebleau, France.

==Early career==
Matheron graduated from ''[[École Polytechnique]]'' and later ''[[Ecole des Mines de Paris]]'', where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[probability]] theory (as a student of [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]]).

From 1954 to 1963, he worked with the French [[Geological Survey]] in Algeria and France, and was influenced by the works of [[Danie G. Krige|Krige]], [[Herbert Sichel|Sichel]], and de Wijs, from the South African school, on the gold deposits of the [[Witwatersrand]]. This influence led him to develop the major concepts of the theory for estimating resources he named Geostatistics.

==Geostatistics==
{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}
{{Technical|section|date=January 2009}}

Matheron’s [''Formule des Minerais Connexes''] became his ''Note Statistique No 1''.  In this paper of November 25, 1954, Matheron derived the degree of associative dependence between lead and silver grades of [[core sample]]s. In his ''Rectificatif'' of January 13, 1955, he revised the arithmetic mean lead and silver grades because his core samples varied in length. He did derive the length-weighted average lead and silver grades but failed to derive the variances of his weighted averages. Neither did he derive the degree of associative dependence between metal grades of ordered core samples as a measure for [[spatial dependence]] between ordered core samples. He did not disclose his primary data set and worked mostly with symbols rather than real measured values such test results for lead and silver in Matheron's core samples. Matheron's ''Interprétations des corrélations entre variables aléatoires lognormales'' of November 29, 1954, was marked ''Note statistisque No 2.'' In this paper, Matheron explored lognormal variables and set the stage for statistics by symbols. Primary data would have allowed him to assess whether or not lead and silver grades departed from the lognormal distribution, or displayed [[spatial dependence]] along core samples in his borehole.

Matheron coined the eponym ''krigeage'' (''[[Kriging]]'') for the first time in his 1960 ''Krigeage d’un Panneau Rectangulaire par sa Périphérie''. In this ''Note géostatistique No 28'', Matheron derived '''''k*''''', his '''estimateur''' and a precursor to the kriged estimate or kriged estimator. In mathematical statistics, Matheron’s '''''k*''''' is the length-weighted average grade of a single panneau in his set. What Matheron failed to derive in this paper was '''''var(k*)''''', the variance of his '''estimateur'''. Matheron presented his ''Stationary Random Function'' at the first colloquium on [[geostatistics]] in the USA. He called on [[Brownian motion]] to conjecture the continuity of his  [[Riemann integral]] but did not explain what Brownian motion and [[ore]] deposits have in common. Matheron, unlike [[John von Neumann]] in 1941 and [[Anders Hald]] in 1952, never worked with [[Riemann sums]]. It was not Professor Dr Georges Matheron but Dr Frederik P Agterberg who derived the distance-weighted average of a set of measured values determined in samples selected at positions with different coordinates in a sample space. What Agterberg did not do was derive the variance of this function.

Matheron did indeed derive length-weighted average grades of core samples and ore blocks but did not derive the variance of these functions. In time, the length-weighted average grade for Matheron's three-dimensional block grade was replaced with the distance-weighted average grade for Agterberg's zero-dimensional point. Both central values turned into honorific kriged estimates or kriged estimators. An infinite set of Agterberg's zero dimensional points fits within any ore block, along any borehole, or inside any sampling unit or sample space. Matheron's block grades and Agterberg's point grades are unique because both are functions without variances.

==Mathematical morphology==
In 1964, Matheron was supervising the PhD [[thesis]] of Jean Serra, dedicated to quantifying the [[ore]] properties of the iron deposit of [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Serra came up with the idea of using [[structuring element]]s for the analysis, which led to the concept of [[hit-or-miss transform]]. The theoretical analysis of this transform led Matheron to derive and investigate the concepts of [[erosion (morphology)|erosion]], [[dilation (morphology)|dilation]], [[opening (morphology)|opening]] and [[closing (morphology)|closing]], which became known later as the basic morphological operators. He also developed a tool for [[Granulometry (morphology)|granulometry]], i.e., the computation of a "size distribution", where he mathematically characterizes the concept of size. In December 1964, Matheron and Serra, together with [http://www.cg.ensmp.fr/bibliotheque/1988/FORMERY/Publication/DOC_00617/FORMERY_Publication_00617.pdf Philippe Formery]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, named this approach '''mathematical morphology'''. It has since evolved into a theory and method that is applied in a variety of [[image processing]] problems and tasks, and is researched worldwide&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ([[#serra94|Serra and Soille (Eds.) 1994]])&lt;/ref&gt; (''main article: [[Mathematical morphology]]''). Matheron continued to contribute to mathematical morphology during the years, his best-known contribution being the [[morphological filtering]] theory, which he developed with Serra in the 1980s.

[http://www.iamg.org/special-lectures/matheron-lecturer.html Matheron Lecture Award] was established &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamg.org/documents/Newsletters/NewslettersHSP/NL71-low%20res.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; by the [http://www.iamg.org International Association for Mathematical Geosciences] (IAMG). This award was named after Georges Matheron. Matheron Lecturers will be selected by a small committee chaired by the IAMG Vice President. The Georges Matheron Lectures will be held annually during IAMG Conferences and during International Geological Congresses. Each year IAMG selects a Georges Matheron Lecturer who is a scientist with proven research ability in the field of spatial statistics or [[mathematical morphology]]. Beginning at IAMG’2006 in Liège, [[Jean Serra]] was the first recipient of this award in 2006, delivered the first Georges Matheron
Lecture.

==The Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique==

In 1968, the [[Paris School of Mines]] created the ''[[Centre de Morphologie Mathématique]]'', located in [[Fontainebleau]], France, and named Matheron its first director. In 1979, the center was renamed ''[[Centre de Géostatistique et de Morphologie Mathématique]]'', and, in 1986, the latter was split into two separate centers: ''[[Centre de Géostatistique]]'', directed by Matheron, and ''Centre de Morphologie Mathématique'', directed by Serra.

'''Guillem Soler''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1380s), sometimes given as '''Guillelmus Soleri''', '''Guillermo Soler''' and '''Guglielmo Soleri''', was a [[Majorca]]n [[cartographer]] of the 15th century.

Little is known of Guillem Soler. Documents establish his existence in [[Majorca]] in 1368, and that he was dead before 1402.  Historians once believed him to be an [[Italian people|Italian]] named  "Guglielmo Soleri" who worked in Majorca,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Beazley (1906: [https://books.google.com/books?id=64MYAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA527#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.527])&lt;/ref&gt; but has since been more confidently identified as probably of [[Catalan people|Catalan]] origin. Majorcan documents identify him as "Guillermi Solerii", citizen of [[Majorca]], master instrument-maker and mapmaker (''bruixoler'').&lt;ref&gt;Baig i Aleu (2001: p.593)&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillem Soler was one of the few [[gentile|non-Jews]] of the [[Majorcan cartographic school]].  A letter of 1387 by King [[John I of Aragon]], written shortly after the death of the great Majorcan cartographer [[Abraham Cresques]], seems to refer to Guillem Soler as a "Christian master" of "similar skill", capable of completing one of Cresques's unfinished maps (uncertain which).&lt;ref&gt;Llopmart (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillem Soler is the author of two significant [[portolan charts]].

* c. 1380 portolan, undated but signed "Guillmus Soleri civis maioricaru me fecit".  This is currently held (Res. Ge. B. 1131) by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in [[Paris]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Pujades (2007) widens the date of Soler's Paris chart to anywhere between 1368 and 1385.  Nonetheless, c. 1380 is customary in older texts, e.g. Beazley (1906: p.527).&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1385 portolan, dated and signed "Gujllmo soleij ciujs Maoicaru me fecit Año A nt, dñj Mccclxx.v", held (CN.3) by the [[Archivio di Stato di Firenze]], in [[Florence]], Italy.

Both are "normal portolan" charts, covering usual range (Mediterranean, Black Sea, Atlantic coast), but contain some stylistic differences.  The first (1380) is considered quite typical of the Majorcan school, geared to geographical depiction, with plenty of illustrations and inland details (e.g. rivers, heraldic shields, mountain ranges).  The latter (1385) portolan seems more reminiscent of the Italian school - that is, more nautically oriented, nearly bereft of illustrations and with very few inland details.&lt;ref&gt;Baig i Aleu (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillem Soler's c. 1380 (Paris) chart gives probably the first depiction of the [[royal arms of England]] as quartered with the royal arms of France (representing the [[English claims to the French throne]] in the 14th century)&lt;ref&gt;Pujades (2007: p.492c)&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillem Soler is also the possible author of a third piece, a recently discovered fragment (21x31 cm) of a Catalan chart, covering only a portion of the west Mediterranean.  It is unsigned and undated, but believed to be prior to the other two known charts.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell ([http://www.maphistory.info/portolanextra.html#E24 2011]).&lt;/ref&gt;   It is privately held.

Guillem Soler is believed to be the father of Majorcan cartographer [[Joan Soler]] and through him ancestral to the later mapmakers [[Rafel Soler]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1430s) and [[Gabriel Soler]] (fl.1460s).  He might also be the grandfather (through his daughter Margarita) of [[Rafel Lloret]] (fl. 1440s)

'''ISO 3166-2:NA''' is the entry for [[Namibia]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Namibia, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[regions of Namibia|14 regions]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|NA}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Namibia. The second part is two letters.

The [[Kavango East]] and [[Kavango West]] regions were created in August 2013 by a split of [[Kavango Region]] (which was named Okavango before 1998). At the same time, [[Caprivi Region|Caprivi]] and [[Karas Region|Karas]] were renamed Zambezi and &amp;#449;Karas, respectively. All changes except the rename of Karas were reflected in the ISO standard on November 3, 2014.

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''Jovan Rajić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Јован Рајић}}; September 21, 1726 – December 22, 1801) was a [[Serbs|Serbian]] writer, historian, traveller, and [[pedagogue]], considered one of the greatest Serbian academics of the 18th century. He was one of the most notable representatives of Serbian [[Baroque literature]] along with [[Zaharije Orfelin]], [[Pavle Julinac]], [[Vasilije III Petrović-Njegoš]], [[Simeon Končarević]], [[Simeon Piščević]], and others (although he worked in the first half of 18th century, as Baroque trends in Serbian literature emerged in the late 17th century).

Rajić was the forerunner to modern [[Serbian historiography]],&lt;ref name="Boia1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lucian Boia|title=Great Historians from Antiquity to 1800: An International Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrENAAAAIAAJ|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-24517-6|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been compared to the importance of [[Nikolay Karamzin]] to [[Russian historiography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=University of Colorado|location=Boulder, Colorado|title=Journal of Central European Affairs|volume=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u049AAAAIAAJ|year=1956|publisher=University of Colorado|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Rajić was born on September 21, 1726 in [[Sremski Karlovci]]. Jovan received his elementary education in his native town, in the school of Deacon Petar Rajkov, a more zealous than learned successor of his own imported Russian teachers, notably '''Emanuel Kozačinski'''. It was through Rajkov that young Jovan Rajić would learn Serbian historiography, which belonged to the latter group. He attended [[Novi Sad]]'s ''[[Petrovaradin]]ska  roždestveno-bogorodičina škola latinsko-slovenska'', the Latino-Slavonic School of Our Lady for young theologians, founded by [[Visarion Pavlović]] and where Russian-born academic Emanuel Kozačinski first began teaching in 1731. He also attended the first Serbian chant school, founded by Metropolitan '''Mojsije Petrović''' in 1721, where he learned "psalm chants" in Serbian and in Greek. In 1744 he moved to [[Komárom]] where he attended a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for four years. Fearing to be converted, he became a student of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] lycée in [[Sopron]] in 1748. He graduated in 1752 and he was ostensibly headed for the church. But his tastes lead him in a different direction for the time being; not content with a knowledge of books only, he wished to know the world and people better. During a period of almost ten years he seized every opportunity for profitable travel whenever he could. He travelled on foot from Hungary to [[Russian Empire]] – a distance of 800 miles -— where he enrolled as a student of the prestigious [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. He remained in [[Kiev]] until 1756 studying [[theology]] and [[liberal arts]]. He immediately formed a friendship with his professors, many of whom were disciples of [[Feofan Prokopovich]], the great reformer of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and one of the founders of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. After graduating from the Kiev academy he travelled to Moscow and [[Smolensk]]. For the next few months he led an unsettled life, attracting attention everywhere by his talents and boldness of his teaching. On his way home he also visited [[Poland]] and various parts of [[Hungary]]. In 1757 he returned to his native Sremski Karlovci and sought a teaching position at a seminary called Pokrovo-Bogorodičina škola, which was denied. Dejected and hurt, he decided to go back to Imperial Russia. He arrived in 1757 back in Kiev where he stayed only for a short time. That same year he travelled to [[Poland]], [[Wallachia]], [[Moldavia]] before taking a ship across the [[Black Sea]] to [[Constantinople]], and from there to [[Mount Athos]], where he spent a few months at the Serbian Monastery of [[Hilandar]], doing research in the library. It wasn't until late 1759 that he became a professor of [[geography]] and [[rhetoric]] in Pokrovo-Bogorodičina škola in Sremski Karlovci. Entering a conflict with high representatives of [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]], he moved to [[Temesvar]], modern day Romania. Life at the episcopal residence was luxurious. Though Rajić resisted the evils attendant on such luxury—loose morals, drunkenness, intrigue—he did acquire a vice which was to embitter the rest of his days, avarice. But more important, he found time in Temesvar to work on his ''History''. After a turbulent year and a half, Rajić left for [[Novi Sad]] at the invitation of the Serbian Bishop of [[Bačka]], [[Mojsije Putnik]]. He was inaugurated [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the institution of higher learning, ''Duhovna kolegija'', by Metropolitan [[Pavle Nenadović]] of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci]] in 1767. There he stayed for more than four years as both rector and professor of theology. His lectures, in which he endeavoured to show that Orthodox theology is in complete harmony with reason, were received with eager interest by the younger generation of thinkers. His unshakable faith in Reason awakened and inspired his students and thus prepared succeeding generations to traverse paths which were closed to Orfelin and to his Serbian contemporaries. In 1772 he went to [[Kovilj monastery]] where, at the age of 46, Rajić became a monk and soon after he was elevated to the monastic rank of [[archimandrite]], and made abbot of the same monastery. He spent the rest of his life in the monastery writing books, mostly with religious and theological themes. In a fruitful lifetime which spanned the last three quarters of the eighteenth century, Rajić brought [[Rationalism]] to its zenith among Serbs in Serbian lands.

He died in the Serbian [[Kovilj monastery]] on December 22, 1801.

==Works==
right[[File:Jovan Rajic History of Serbs.jpg|thumb|right|Jovan Rajić's ''The History of Various Slavic Peoples, especially of Bulgars, Croats and Serbs'', [[Museum of Vuk and Dositej]]]]
He wrote in Serbian, Russian, Latin, German, Hungarian and Old Slavonic. He was one of the best educated Serbian ecclesiastical scholars who knew theology and history better than most in his day. He translated the works of [[Feofan Prokopovich]], [[Peter Mohyla]], [[Platon Levshin]], [[Lazar Baranovych]], Metropolitan Gedeon of Kiev, and various German and Hungarian authors. He wrote the history of the Serbian Orthodox Church and a Serbian [[catechesis]] for children which was first published in Vienna in 1774 and was consequently reprinted many times over for the next 89 years. He is best remembered for his history books.

All of Rajić's research work came from Russian and Serbian sources, particularly [[Đorđe Branković, Count of Podgorica|Đorđe Branković]]'s then unpublished, 2,000-page manuscript. He was a most liberal-minded man, both in politics and religion, an enthusiastic supporter of popular education and a most inspiring teacher and speaker. Rajić was always stating that the business of the Eastern Orthodox Church as a whole is not [[polemic]] but [[irenic]], operating toward peace, moderation and conciliation. He took great interest in the struggle of the Serbs for independence.

His claim on posterity, however, lies not on his irenical writings alone but in the quality of his literary translations and other writings, exhibited at its best in the four-volume work, published in Vienna and Moscow, ''"Istorija raznih slavenskih narodov, naipače Bolgar, Horvatov i Serbov (1794-1795)"'' (The History of various Slavic peoples, particularly the Bulgarians, Croats and Serbs). The ''Istorija'', including the 1795 edition in Moscow that sealed its authority, was bound to the medieval religious historiographical tradition and was influenced by not only Branković's work but also the Russian editions of [[Caesar Baronius]]'s ''"[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]"'', [[Mavro Orbin]]'s ''"Il regno de gli Slavi"'' (The Realm of the Slavs), and [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange]]'s ''"Illyricum vetus et nuovum"'' (1746) (Illyrium: Old and New). Rajić's work is divided into four volumes, each sub-divided in three parts dealing respectively with the history of Bulgarians, Croats and Serbs. His intention was to reconstruct the history of the south Slavic peoples as if they were a single entity. He placed at the centre of his research the people and the new historical sensibility that must serve them. The past was re-evaluated from two main perspectives: to preserve Slav history from falling into oblivion; and to save it from a memory imbued with personal events bound to the tradition of dynastic claims. From the preface it can be inferred that Rajić saw history as the basis for other sciences. Also, Rajić paid attention to the Habsburg dynasty and considered them defenders of the Serbs against Turkish oppression. Yet, at the same time, he cautioned them against the Habsburg's attempts of Germanization and conversion to Uniate Catholicism.

[[File:Liber Floridus page scan A, ca. 1460.jpg| thumb|Lambert, [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Audomar|St. Omer]], ''Liber Floridus'' (Lille and Ninove, 1460)]]
'''''Liber Floridus''''' ("Book of Flowers") is a [[list of historical encyclopedias|medieval encyclopedia]] that was compiled between 1090 and 1120 by Lambert, [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Saint-Omer]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Derolez, ''The autograph manuscript of the Liber Floridus: a key to the encyclopedia of Lambert of Saint-Omer'', 1998. See more recently A. Derolez, ''The Making and Meaning of the Liber Floridus. A Study of the Original Manuscript, Ghent, University Library, MS 92'' (= ''Studies in Medieval and Early Renaissance Art History'' 76), Turnhout: Harvey Miller, 2015 ({{ISBN|978-1-909400-22-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; The text compiles extracts from some 192 or so different works.&lt;ref name="slide217"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-davis.com/MAPS/EMwebpages/217mono.html |title=Index of Cartographic Images Illustrating Maps of the Early Medieval Period 400-1300 A.D |publisher=Henry-davis.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lambert's medieval encyclopedia contains a [[universal history]], a chronological record of events to the year 1119. These are of [[Biblical]], [[astronomical]], [[geographical]], [[philosophical]] and [[natural history]] subjects. Lambert wrote ''Liber Floridus'' originally in Latin, and later it was translated into French as ''Le Livre fleurissant en fleurs''. A detailed description is in the ''Historia comitum Normannorum, comitum Flandriae''.&lt;ref&gt;Herbermann, pp. 758-759&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber Floridus'' was the first of the encyclopedias of the [[High Middle Ages]] that slowly superseded the work of [[Isidore of Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narrative-sources.be "Narrative Sources"]&lt;/ref&gt; The original manuscript, completed in 1120 and dedicated to [[Audomar|Saint Omer]] by Lambert, has been preserved in [[Ghent]], though its latter portion has not survived.&lt;ref&gt;It is MS Gandensis 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A copy is in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Its contents were fully listed and summarized by L. Delisle, "Notice sur les MSS du 'Liber Floridus' composé en 1120 par Lambert, chânoine de Saint-Omer", ''Notices et extraits des MSS du Bibliothèque Nationale'', '''38'''.2 (Paris, 1903), pp 577-791.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a copy in the [[Herzog August Bibliothek]], [[Wolfenbüttel, Germany]].&lt;ref name="slide217"/&gt; There may be as many as six additional extant manuscript copies, dating from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries and produced in [[France]] or [[Flanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestiary.ca/prisources/psdetail4892.htm |title=The Medieval Bestiary - Lambert of Saint-Omer |publisher=Bestiary.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Liber Floridus'' has the reputation of being one of the most famous encyclopedias of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imprs-hist.mpg.de/english/e-doktoranden/e-vorholt.html |title=Hanna Vorholt: '&amp;#39;Tradition and Transformations. The illustrated Manuscripts of the "Liber Floridus" by Lambert of Saint-Omer'&amp;#39; |publisher=Imprs-hist.mpg.de |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
''Liber Floridus'' includes various maps including a [[mappa mundi]]. The Ghent manuscript, being the oldest of the known copies and dating from earlier than 1125, includes a map of parts of Europe and two climate-zone drawings based on the [[Macrobius|Macrobian model]] as an attempt to make a complete world map. The parts of the European map sketch show interesting and odd representations. This manuscript and the associated maps are believed to have been done personally by Lambert.&lt;ref name="slide217"/&gt;

[[File:World map 12th century.jpg|thumb|right|World map of 12th century]]
The Wolfenbüttel and Paris copies with their European "mappa mundi" date from somewhere around 1150. Historians do not believe these were done by Lambert. R. Uhden points out &lt;ref&gt;Uhden, ''Die Weltkarte des Martianus Capella''&lt;/ref&gt; that the world map in the Wolfenbüttel copy has a legend saying the original source was from [[Martianus Capella]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 410 - 439). This reference has been backed up by information found in various other inscriptions on the map that are passages from Martianus' ''Satyricon'', also known as ''De Nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii''.&lt;ref name="slide217"/&gt;&lt;!--are there inscriptions refering to both titles?--&gt;

Lambert collected his material from such sources as [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]]'s ''[[Etymologiae]]'', the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', and the crusade chronicle of [[Bartolf of Nangis]]. Lambert frequently mentions crusaders from Saint-Omer and elsewhere, whom he presumably met when they returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope C. Mayo, "The crusaders under the palm: allegorical plants and cosmic kingship in the 'Liber Floridus'" (''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'' 27, 1973), pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 [[Albert Derolez]] published a copy of the Ghent manuscript, with historical and palaeographical introductions. It included a number of photographs of the original manuscript pages.&lt;ref&gt;Derolez, ''Lamberti S. Audomari Canonici Liber Floridus: Codex Autographus Bibliothecae Universitatis Gandavensis'' (Ghent, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber'' has sometimes been incorrectly attributed to [[Lambert of St-Bertin]], a monk at the [[Abbey of Saint Bertin]]. The compiler of the ''Liber'' was a canon at the nearby church of Our Lady of Saint-Omer. His father, Onulfus, had also been a canon at the same church.&lt;ref&gt;Derolez, ''The autograph manuscript'', pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of identity document policies by country'''.

A national [[identity document]] ("ID", "ID card", "identity card", "IC", "citizen card" or "passport card") is defined as an identity card with photo, usable as an identity card at least inside the country, and which is issued by an official authority.

[[Driver's license]]s and other cards issued by [[regional government]]s indicating certain permissions are not counted here as national identity cards. So for example, by this criterion, the [[Driver's licenses in the United States|United States driver's license]] is excluded, as these are issued by local (state) governments (although these or state IDs are more or less required as nationwide identification).

==Identity card policies by country==

===Countries with compulsory identity cards===
According to a 1996 publication by [[Privacy International]], around 100 countries had enacted laws making identity cards compulsory.&lt;ref name="privacy-international"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/article/id-card-frequently-asked-questions |title=Identity Cards: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Privacy International |date=24 Aug 1996 |archivedate=2011-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903074029/https://www.privacyinternational.org/article/id-card-frequently-asked-questions |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these countries, the card must be shown on demand by authorised personnel under specified circumstances. In some countries alternative proof of identity, such as a driving licence is acceptable. Privacy International said that "virtually no [[common law]] country has a card".&lt;ref name="privacy-international" /&gt;

The term "compulsory" may have different meanings and implications in different countries. {{em|1=Possession}} of a card may only become compulsory at a certain age. There may be a penalty for not {{em|1=carrying}} a card or similar official identification such as a [[passport]]. In some cases a person may be detained until identity is proven. This facilitates police identification of fugitives. In some countries, police need a reason, such as suspicion of a crime or security risk. In other countries, police can ask for official identification without stating a reason. Random checks are rare, except in [[police state]]s. Normally there is an age limit, such as 18, after which possession is mandatory, even if minors aged 15–17 may need a card in order to prove that they are under 18.

In the [[European Union]], a [[European citizen|citizen]]'s national identity card – if it complies with certain technical standards and states citizenship – can in most cases be used to travel (within the EU) in lieu of a passport.&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizens' Rights Directive|Directive 2004/38/EC]] of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Right of Citizens of the Union and their Family Members to Move and Reside Freely Within the Territory of the Member States, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32004L0038 2004 O.J. L 158/77].&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| {{flagcountry|Belgium}}
| ''[[Belgian national identity card|Identiteitskaart / Carte d’Identité / Personalausweis]]'' (Identity Card)
| The card is first issued at age 12, compulsory by 15. Since the beginning of 2005 the '''eID''' ('''e'''lectronic '''ID'''entity card) has been issued to Belgian citizens who apply for a new identity card. Apart from being a form of identification, the card also is used for authentication purposes. Future usages include using the eID as a library card, keycard for restricted areas or chatrooms and the digital signing of documents. It is expected that in 2009 all Belgians will have an eID card.&lt;ref name = "Belgique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eid.belgium.be/ |title=eID |publisher=Government of Belgium |location=Brussels |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomatie.belgium.be/fr/Services/services_a_letranger/carte_identite_pour_belges_etranger |title=La carte d'identité pour les Belges à l'étranger |publisher=Affaires Étrangères, Commerce Extérieur et Coopération au Développement |accessdate=10 Dec 2017|date=2016-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have to be carried at all times.

| ''[[Cédula de identidad|Cédula de Identidad]]'' (Identity Card)
| Compulsory at 18, but rarely required by police.
|-
| {{flagcountry|Botswana}}
| ''Omang'' (National Identity Card)
| It is compulsory for all citizens at age 16, and there are penalties for not obtaining it within one month of turning 16 or obtaining citizenship, whichever comes last. Includes the image of the individual (no headgear or eyewear), their particulars, and their right thumbprint. Valid for 10 years, whereupon it must be renewed and a new photograph taken. Must be presented upon request by any agent of the state, and the state requires all non-state institutions to use the National ID card as the only acceptable means of identification for citizens - passports and driver's licences should not be used, even though they contain most of the information on the ID card, including the ID card number. There are penalties for being issued a replacement card when it has been lost, however, if it is changed to update information on it only the application fee must be paid (e.g., upon expiry, and legal name changes as when a woman gets married and assumes her husband's surname). Every time a new one is issued for whatever reason, a new photograph must be taken. The individual keeps their National ID card number for life, and in recent years it has been linked to the birth certificate number of newborn infants (it is the same number). The National ID card must be surrendered to the government upon the demise of the individual, at which time it will be exchanged for an official death certificate.
|-
| {{flagcountry|Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
| ''[[National identity cards in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Lična Karta / Osobna iskaznica]]'' (Identity Card)
| Compulsory at 16 and is to be carried at all times after turning 18.
|-
| {{flagcountry|Brazil}}
| ''[[Brazilian identity card|Cédula de Identidade]]'' (Identity Card)
| Compulsory to be issued since the age of 18 (though it can be substituted by a series of equivalent documents, see below). It is usually issued, for civilians, by the secretariat of public security of each unit of the federation, but other departments – including the Armed Forces, the Police and some professional councils – can issue alternate identity cards, too. All must meet certain specifications – they are all coloured green – but each unit of the federation can include minor differences such as the numbering scheme, [[typeface|font]], printed seal, and background pattern. 
The card's front has the bearer's picture (with an electronic stamp on it) and right thumb print. It also includes either the bearer's signature or – if the bearer is illiterate – the phrase "cannot sign" (''não assina'') The verso has the unique number assigned the bearer (''registro geral'' or RG), the card's expiration date, the bearer's full name, parents' names, birthplace (locality and federation unit), birth date, and [[CPF (Brazil)|CPF number]]. It may include some additional information. It is officially 102 × 68&amp;nbsp;mm,&lt;ref name="Brasil"&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto/D89250.htm Decreto 89.250], de 27 de dezembro de 1983: Regulamenta a Lei № 7.116, de 29 de agosto de 1983, que assegura valida de nacional às Carteiras de Identidade, regula sua expedição e dá outras providências.&lt;/ref&gt; but lamination tends to make it slightly larger than the [[ISO/IEC 7810 ID-2]] standard of 105 × 74&amp;nbsp;mm, so it is a tight fit in most wallets. A driver's licence has only recently been given the same legal status as the national identity card. In most situations, only a few other documents can be substituted for a national identity card: for example, identification documents issued by national councils of doctors, accountants, dentists, engineers, lawyers, and other professionals.

| ''[[German identity card|Personalausweis]]'' (Identity Card)
| Compulsory for all German citizens aged 16 or older to possess either a "Personalausweis" (identity card) or a passport, but not to carry it. While police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one of those documents, the law does not state that one is obliged to submit the document immediately. Fines may only be applied if an identity card or passport is not possessed at all, if the document is expired or if one explicitly refuses to show ID to the police. If one is unable to produce an ID card or passport (or any other form of credible identification) during a police control, one can (in theory) be brought to the next police post and detained for a maximum of 12 hours, or until positive identification is possible. However, this measure is only applied if the police have reasonable grounds to believe the person detained has committed an offence.&lt;br/&gt;As driving licences are not legally accepted forms of identification in Germany, most persons actually carry their "Personalausweis" with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.nuernberg.de/internet/ordnungsamt/namensaenderung.html | title = nuernberg.de | publisher = Germany | location = Nuernberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National identity cards in Germany|more]]

| [[Greek identity card|''Αστυνομική Ταυτότητα'']] (Police Identity Card)
| In Greece, the biggest change in Identity Documents Law happened in 2000, when some fields of the Police Identity Card (as Greeks call it) were rejected. These fields included religion, addresses, biometric characteristics and fingerprint. Oppositely, some fields were added. These are Latin transliterations of name and surname, blood type and Rhesus of the owner. Under this law, all Greeks over 12 years old must go to a police office to ask for an Identity Card. In Greece, there are many everyday things you cannot do without an ID. In fact, according to an older law, the Police ID is the only legal identity document and no one has a right to ask for more identity documents. Since the 1980s all legal services in Greece must be done with this ID. Also, you can travel within the EU with a Greek National ID card, but it is not advisable since travelling with ID without machine readable zone often causes delay at border controls. Carrying the ID is not compulsory; however during routine police checks, if you are found without an ID, the police officer may take you to the nearest police station for further investigation.

A driving license can be also used for identification from the age of 17. Private entities however, are legally required to accept passport or driver's licence for proof, but often do not accept them, only the ID card, thus in effect almost all citizens have the ID card. Police has the legal power to stop people on streets at random and ask for ID paper only if they have any proof that the person was involved in a crime, or is a witness. If the person has no proof for identification he/she can be detained for maximum 24 hours.

An authorized officer can only do so under certain circumstances. Such circumstances include suspicious behaviour, committing any offence, or if a person is interviewed as a witness of a crime. Identity checks at events where the public order may be in danger are also allowed. Otherwise random identity checks by the police are not allowed in principle but can happen in certain areas such as a train station or suspicious areas such as where prostitution is rife, and a fine for not showing proof of identity may be successfully challenged in such cases. The fine for not being able to show proof of identity when legally required is €60 (16 and over) or €30 (if 14 or 15). Proof of identity is also required when opening a bank account and when entering an employment contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.government.nl/topics/identification-documents/compulsory-identification|title=Compulsory identification|work=government.nl|accessdate=21 Nov 2017|date=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| "Identity Card", "Travel Pass" (with specified destination of travel and written permission)
| [http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&amp;num=6087 Photos]
North Korea is probably the country which imposes the strongest fines for citizens not carrying ID cards. To travel North Koreans need not only an identity card, but also a "travel pass", with specified destination and written permission. Sometimes citizens may be punished with time in a labour camp for not carrying their cards, however this is often only a short sentence and people are usually released upon presentation of the card at a later date. Although much is not known about the properties of the card, it is probably plastic and similar in size to most European ID cards. Between 2004 and 2008, all records were transferred to an electronic Korean-language central database. Obtaining a driving license in North Korea is not usual – except in the case of professional drivers, mechanics, and assistants – since few citizens own cars. Only government officials are issued [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea passport|passports]] because the state restricts citizens travel. North Koreans working abroad are issued contracts between North Korea and the host country to allow for travel, and government officers often accompany and supervise workers.

===Countries with non-compulsory identity cards===
These are countries where official authorities issue identity cards to those who request them, but where it is not illegal to be without an official identity document. For some services, identification is needed, but documents such as passports or identity cards issued by banks or driving licences can be used. In countries where national identity cards are fully voluntary, they are often not so commonly used, because many already have a passport and a driving licence, so a third identity document is often considered superfluous.

{{Main|French national identity card}}

The country has had a national ID card since 1940, when it helped the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities identify 76,000 for deportation as part of [[the Holocaust]].

In the past, identity cards were compulsory, had to be updated each year in case of change of residence and were valid for 10 years, and their renewal required paying a fee. In addition to the face photograph, the card included the family name, first names, date and place of birth, and a unique national identity number relating to the national [[INSEE]] registry, which is also used as the [[national service]] registration number, and as the [[Social Security in France|Social Security]] account number for health and retirement benefits.

Later,{{When|date=July 2011}} the laws were changed{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} so that any official and certified document (even if expired and possibly unusable abroad) with a photograph and a name on it, issued by a public administration or enterprise (such as a rail transport card, student card, [[driving licence]] or [[passport]]) could be used as proof of identity.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Also, law enforcement (''gendarmerie'') can now accept photocopies of these documents{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} when performing identity checks, provided that the original document is presented within two weeks.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} For financial transactions, any of these documents must be equally accepted as proof of identity.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Identity cards are still issued, but are free of charge, and not compulsory. Legislation has been published for a proposed compulsory biometric card system, which has been widely criticised, among others by the "National commission for computing and liberties" (''Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés'', [[CNIL]]), the national authority and regulator on computing systems and databases. Identity cards issued since 2004 include basic biometric information (a digitized fingerprint record, a printed digital photograph and a scanned signature) and various anti-fraud systems embedded within the laminated card.

The [[Health care in France#Health insurance|French health insurance]] card, a [[smart card]] named "[[:fr:Carte Vitale|Carte Vitale 2]]",
includes a digital photograph and other personal medical information in addition to identity elements. The previous version included a chip and a magnetic stripe, but contained very little information.

Both documents can be used to demonstrate Mexican nationality and thus enter Mexico from abroad, be it by air, sea or land.

The Swedish tax authority does since 2009 issue official identity cards for anyone resident in Sweden. [[Driver's license]]s is the most commonly used identity document in Sweden. Between 2005 and 2009 it was almost impossible for immigrants to get a card because of tightened security to get a bank card, since a close family member having a Swedish identity document had to vouch the identity. Not having an ID card in combination with a crime giving a fine (e.g. riding public transport without a ticket), is a suspicion to escape it, which is a reason for detainment in Sweden.

In the past, compulsory ID cards or something compulsory resembling ID cards have existed, such as internal passports for freed African Americans before the [[Abolition of slavery in the USA|abolition of slavery]], and the draft cards for men (during times when men were conscripted into the army). In some states, there is a [[Stop and identify statutes|Stop and identify statute]] meaning that an identity card (or driver's license or other photo id) can be demanded. There is, however, no obligation to carry or own an identification card.

===Countries with no identity cards===
These are countries where official authorities do not issue any identity cards. When identification is needed, e.g. passports, identity cards issued by banks etc., or cards that are not mainly identity cards like driver's licenses can be used. Most countries that are not listed at all in this page have no National ID Card.

| {{flagcountry|Andorra}} || No national identity card in the principality. Passports and driving licenses are most commonly used for identification.&lt;ref name=diariandorra&gt;[https://www.diariandorra.ad/noticies/opinio/2017/06/07/cal_dni_andorra_117006_1129.html Cal un DNI andorrà] (7 June 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; When visiting Spain a passport is needed in lack of national identity card, although driving licenses are often used and accepted unofficially.
|-
| {{flagcountry|Australia}} || In 1985, there was a failed proposal to create an [[Australia Card]]. In 2006 the Australian Government announced the introduction of a non-compulsory [[Health and social services access card (Australia)|Access Card]] that would act as a gateway to services administered by The Department of Human Services. This project, however, was terminated in November 2007. Class A identification documents in most Australian states include State government, Australian Passport (issued by the Federal government), foreign passport, or Residency/Citizenship documents (issued by the Federal government).

|-
|{{flagcountry|Canada}}
|In the past, [[Canadian nationality law#Citizenship ceremonies|Canadian citizenship cards]] were issued to new Canadians upon naturalization and established Canadians (upon request). As of 2012 these cards have been discontinued, and there is no national identity card or equivalent. Driver's licenses issued by the provinces are the primary form of identification. All provinces and territories except Quebec also issue separate photo identification cards for non-drivers. [[Health care in Canada|Health cards]] (issued by the provinces) and [[Canadian passport|passports]] (issued by the Canadian federal government) are used as supplemental or alternative identification.
|-
| {{flagcountry|Denmark}} || No national identity card. When needed, e.g. in banks, a passport or driver's license is used or, for age checks, a municipal identity card. Against authorities a health insurance card (without photo) can be used.
|-
| {{flagcountry|Japan}} || There is an optional {{nihongo|[[Basic Resident Registers Network|Juki Net]]|住基ネット|Jūki netto}} card for Japanese citizens, corresponding to the compulsory {{nihongo|[[Jūminhyō]]|住民票}} record of residential address. The compulsory {{nihongo|[[Alien registration in Japan|Certificate of Alien Registration]]|外国人登録証明書|Gaikokujin Tōroku Shōmeisho}} that all resident foreigners were required to have is being replaced with a [[Alien registration in Japan#Foreign residents' registration system|resident's ID card]] that is essentially the same as the Juki Net card, and resident foreigners are now registered in Jūminhyō, together with Japanese family (if any). Foreigners who enter the country on a visa that is valid for 3 months or less need only a passport with a valid landing permit. Driving licenses, {{nihongo|National Health Insurance Cards|国民健康保険証|Kokumin Kenkō Hoken Shō}}, Certificates of Alien Registration (or the new resident's ID card that replaces it) and passports containing a registration for a Certificate for Alien Registration are accepted as IDs for most purposes.

|-
| {{flagcountry|Norway}} || No national identity card, but private identity cards exist which are needed in banks if not using a passport or driving licence. Bank issued debit cards have had a photo of the holder on the back since the 1980s. The banks have stated that they no longer intend to issue photos on their debit and credit cards, as they think ID-cards should be a public service. This requires people who do not have a driving licence to bring their passport in many situations. Norway decided in 2007 to introduce a voluntary national identity card, to be usable for travel to EEA countries, but they are delayed&lt;ref name="nrk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrk.no/livsstil/etterlyser-nasjonale-id-kort-1.10910502 |title=Etterlyser nasjonale ID-kort - NRK - Livsstil |date=15 Feb 2013 |publisher=Nrk.no |accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are planned to be introduced in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abcnyheter.no/reise/2017/01/05/195268233/politiet-nye-pass-og-nasjonale-id-kort-kommer-1.-april-2018 |title=Politiet: Nye pass og nasjonale ID-kort kommer 1. april 2018 |publisher=ABC Nyheter |date=5 Jan 2017 |accessdate=9 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrk.no/norge/tidspunkt-for-nye-pass-og-id-kort-er-helt-i-det-bla-1.14038161 Ingen tør love når nye pass og ID-kort kommer]&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the delay is that the responsible authority requires absolute security on both the cards and the validation of the identity at issuance.

==Notes==
* As noted above, certain countries do not have national ID cards, but have other official documents that play the same role in practice (e.g. driver's license for the United States). While a country may not make it ''[[de jure]]'' compulsory to own or carry an identity document, it may be ''[[de facto]]'' strongly recommended to do so in order to facilitate certain procedures.
* In most countries, non-resident foreign citizens have to be able to identify themselves through a passport. For residents with "foreign" characteristics (e.g. skin color, dialect) possession of an acceptable identity card might be useful to reduce the risk of harassment from the police and other authorities.
* In many countries, people suspected of crime will be detained until their identity is proven even in countries not requiring an identity card.

[[File:Tashkent-uzbekistan-feve.jpg|thumb]]
'''Independence Square''' ({{lang-uz|Mustaqillik Maydoni}}, Мустақиллик Майдони) is a central square of [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="Independence Square (Mustaqillik Maydoni)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minube.net/place/independence-square-mustaqillik-maydoni--a459321 | title=Independence Square (Mustaqillik Maydoni) | publisher=Minube | accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
After the proclamation of [[Independence Day (Uzbekistan)|Uzbekistan's independence]] in September 1991, "Lenin Square" was renamed in 1992 as "Mustaqillik Maydoni", which translates to "Independence Square" in English. The monument to Lenin was dismantled, and in its place the Monument of Independence of Uzbekistan, in the form of the globe, was erected. Later, in front of the pedestal was set a figure of a woman, symbolising the [[Motherland]].&lt;ref name="Poytaxtning bosh maydoniga “Mustaqillik maydoni” nomi berilganiga 16 yil bo‘ldi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uza.uz/uz/society/poytaxtning-bosh-maydoniga-mustaqillik-maydoni-nomi-berilganiga-16-yil-boldi-04.09.2007-447 | title=Poytaxtning bosh maydoniga "Mustaqillik maydoni" nomi berilganiga 16 yil bo‘ldi | publisher=Uza.Uz | date=4 September 2007 | accessdate=6 January 2015| language=Uzbek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence Square is now the central square of Tashkent; it hosts celebrations and military parades in the days of special events and public holidays.

==History==
The largest square in Tashkent is more like a large park than a square. With several monuments and fountains, surrounded by impressive public buildings and filled with trees and flower beds, the Independence Square in Tashkent is a showcase of modern Uzbekistan.

Today the Independence History consists of several areas: administrative buildings, the recreation area with green zones and fountains, monuments including the Arch of Independence and the Independence Monument.

The story of the Independence square as a center of Tashkent goes back to more than hundred years. The General Governor of Turkestan erected here his military fortress in 1865. Since 1974 this place was called the Avenue of Parades, where military parades and demonstrations of workers were held to celebrate the holidays of May 1, International Workers Day, May 9 - Victory Day, November 7 - Revolution Day.

Passing through the arch of silver with figures of storks around the fountain, which marks the entrance to the Independence Square, you will see the main monument of the Independence square. It is a high pedestal with a golden globe erected on the top. Before the pedestal there is a statue of a seated mother with a baby in her arms. The monumental complex represent the revival of Uzbekistan as a free independent state. The Monument of Independence was erected in 1992, and the complete reconstruction of the area was completed in 2006.

On the opposite sits a statue depicting a mourning mother sadly looking down onto an eternal flame in memory of her children who fell when defending the country, to commemorate the fallen unidentified soldiers in the past World Wars.

Administrative buildings, including the Cabinet of Ministers, Senate of Uzbekistan and the Ministry of Finance are located on the western side of the Independence square in Tashkent.

'''Nares Strait''' ({{lang-da|'''Nares Strædet'''}}{{coord|80|N|070|W|type:waterbody_scale:10000000|display=title|name=Nares Strait}}) is a [[waterway]] between [[Ellesmere Island]] and [[Greenland]] that is the northern part of [[Baffin Bay]] where it meets the [[Lincoln Sea]]. From south to north, the strait includes [[Smith Sound]], [[Kane Basin (waterway)|Kane Basin]], [[Kennedy Channel]], [[Hall Basin]] and [[Robeson Channel]].  During 1962–64 a 20&amp;nbsp;km by 10&amp;nbsp;km ice island drifted southward from the [[Lincoln Sea]] through the Nares and [[Davis Strait]]s to the Atlantic Ocean ([[Labrador Sea]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Münchow |first1=Andreas |first2=Humfrey |last2=Melling |first3=Kelly K |last3=Falkner |year=2006 |title=An Observational Estimate of Volume and Freshwater Flux Leaving the Arctic Ocean Through Nares Strait |url=http://muenchow.cms.udel.edu/papers/Nares_JPO2005.pdf |journal=Journal of Physical Oceanography |volume=36 |number=11 |page=2026 |accessdate=2010-12-23 |doi=10.1175/jpo2962.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nares strait has a nearly permanent current from the north, powered by the [[Beaufort Gyre]], making it harder to traverse for ships coming from the south.

[[File:Wild Arctic Summer.ogv|thumb|left|300px|Time-lapse imagery from July 9 to Sept. 13 2012 shows an ice island calve from [[Petermann Glacier]] and pass through Nares Strait.]]

In 1964, its name, from the British naval officer [[George Strong Nares]], was agreed by the Danish (''Stednavneudvalget'', now ''Stednavnenævnet'') and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]]s.

The strait and neighbouring waters are usually hazardous for navigation and shipping. During August, however, it is usually navigable by [[icebreaker]]s. Prior to 1948, only five vessels were recorded as having successfully navigated north of Kane Basin. In 2009 the ship ''Arctic Sunrise'' made the first known June transit into the Arctic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/01/sermilik-fjord-greenland-global-warming | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Patrick | last=Barkham | title=The Sermilik fjord in Greenland: a chilling view of a warming world | date=2009-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Island]], a tiny island lying within the strait, is claimed by both [[Denmark]] (on behalf of Greenland) and Canada.

[[Thule People]] reached the Nares Strait in the early 13th century, where they hunted with and traded with Vikings.&lt;ref&gt;Inuit-Norse contact in the Smith Sound region/Schledermann, P. McCullough, K.M.&lt;/ref&gt; Archeological remains of Thule Culture and Viking presence are found on [[Ruin Island]].

'''Nicolaus Germanus''' ({{circa|lk=no|1420|1490}}) was a [[Germans|German]] [[cartographer]] who published an edition of [[Jacopo d'Angelo]]'s [[Latin]] translation of [[Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Ptolemy's Geography|Geography]]''. He also created two [[globe]]s depicting earth and sky in 1477, predating [[Martin Behaim]]'s ''[[Erdapfel]]''.

==Name==
''Nicolaus Germanus'' is the [[Latin]] form of the name "[[Nicholas]] the [[Germans|German]]". His exact name is unknown, although it is often given with ''Donis'', ''Donnus'', ''Donmus'', or ''Donus''. These are not, however, names but abbreviated forms of the Latin title "Lord" (''Dominus'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11068a.htm |contribution=Nicolaus Germanus |title=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|History|Bibliography}}
==Life==
The exact dates of his birth and death are not known. He is sometimes referred to as a [[Humanism|Humanist]]{{sfnp|Suárez|1992}} [[Christian monk|monk]] of the [[Benedictine order]]{{efn|The Benedictine monk Donnus Nicholas Germanus ([[floruit|fl.]] 1460-75) was particularly prolific in editing and expanding the Geographia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usm.maine.edu/~maps/exhibit5/sec1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}} possibly from [[Reichenbach Priory (Baden-Württemberg)|Reichenbach Priory]] (now in [[Baden-Württemberg]]).{{efn|Domnus Nicolaus Germanus, a Benedictine (of Reichenbach?) (1466), was the first scholar who modernized [[Ptolemy]] by means of new maps and made him generally accessible. The Benedictine [[Andreas Walsperger]] (1448) made a map of the world in the medieval style. That of the Camaldolese [[Fra Mauro]] (1457) is the most celebrated of all monuments of medieval cartography. It was already enriched by data furnished in Ptolemy's work. The map of Germany designed by Cardinal [[Nicholas of Cusa]] (1401-64), a pupil of [[Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli|Toscanelli]] (1387-1492), was printed in 1491. This prelate was the teacher of [[Peuerbach]] (1432-61), who in turn was the master of [[Regiomontanus]] (1436-67), the most illustrious astronomer since Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subjectgeo.com/wiki/Geography_and_the_Church |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008070103/http://www.subjectgeo.com/wiki/Geography_and_the_Church |archivedate=2007-10-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} His manuscript edition of Ptolemy was ready by around 1468, but not published until 1482.{{sfnp|Suárez|1992}}

==Works==
In 1477, two years after the opening of the [[Vatican Library]], Nicolaus Germanus created a globe each for earth and sky, for which he was paid 200 [[ducat]]s on 11 December 1477 according to a receipt.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Bild:Germanus.jpeg]]&lt;/ref&gt; An additional three ducats were paid the next day for the adding of the papal coat of arms, and four more on 20 December for two covers. The globes are listed in an inventory of 1481. The marchesa of [[Mantua]], Isabella, asked for copies in 1505.{{efn|{{lang-it|Intendiamo, che ne la libraria dil papa sono due spere solide: In una è depicto el Mapamundo, in l'altra li Signi Celesti, cio è el Zodiaco...}}}} The globes were kept in Salle Pontifica (Magna Secreta) until they were lost in the [[1527 Sack of Rome]]. The earth globe of Nicolaus Germanus is considered the first modern to be documented. 
 
Nicolaus Germanus's editions of Ptolemy are notable for including four new inset maps showing new European discoveries and for modifying the world map to reflect Italians' better knowledge of [[Scandinavia]]&lt;ref name=uminn/&gt; following [[Claudius Clavus]]'s 1424 visit to Italy.{{sfnp|Suárez|1992}} Nicolaus Germanus was also the first Western cartographer to publish Ptolemy's more difficult second projection,{{efn|An earlier Greek cartographer completed one in manuscript for [[Maximus Planudes]] {{circa|lk=no|1300}}. It is held in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblioserver.com/newberry/index.php?m=word&amp;kid=17759026 Codex Seragliensis GI 57].&lt;/ref&gt;}} in which parallels of [[latitude]] are made equidistant but [[meridian (geography)|meridians]] converge toward the poles;{{sfnp|Suárez|1992}} it became known in his time as the "Donis Projection".

It was reprinted the same year and again in 1486, with more gold. The 1486 edition is notable as the first atlas to be colored by its publisher prior to sale; uncolored editions are rare.{{sfnp|Suárez|1992}} The printing of the [[Ptolemy's world map|world maps]] in these books was credited to "Johann the Block-cutter" (''Johannes Schnitzer'') or "Johann from [[Armsheim]]" (''{{lang|la|Johannes de Armssheim}}''), distinctive for his use of a reversed capital {{angle bracket|N}} (i.e., {{angle bracket|И}}).&lt;ref name=uminn&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.lib.umn.edu/apps/bell/map/PTO/TOUR/1482u.html |contribution=1482: Ulm |url=https://www.lib.umn.edu/bell |title=James Ford Bell Library |publisher=University of Minnesota |location=Minneapolis |date=2001 |accessdate=7 August 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nijmegen Quarter''' (Dutch: ''Kwartier van Nijmegen'') was the first of the four quarters in which the county, later [[duchy of Guelders]] was divided, as they were separated by rivers. In addition Guelders consisted of [[county of Zutphen|Zutphen Quarter]], the [[Upper Quarter]] and [[Veluwe Quarter]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dutch Republic in the Seventeenth Century: The Golden Age|author1=Prak, M.|author2=Webb, D.|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521843522|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhIxrykbrKUC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each quarter had its own capital.

==Geography==
Nijmegen Quarter, Zutphen Quarter and Veluwe Quarter are the three downstream Lower Quarters that seceded in 1581 to the [[Dutch Republic]], and constitute the present day Dutch province of [[Gelderland]]. Nijmegen Quarter with its capital at the city of [[Nijmegen]], included the area between the [[Meuse]] and [[Rhine]] with the exception of the [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]] [[enclave]] [[Huissen]] and the independent counties of [[County of Buren|Buren]] and [[Culemborg]], that were much later seceded to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Shadow of Burgundy: The Court of Guelders in the Late Middle Ages|author=Nijsten, G.|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521820752|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbjlEuURRKAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quarter was divided in [[Nijmegen]], [[Rijk van Nijmegen]], [[Land of Maas and Waal]], the [[Bommelerwaard]] and [[Betuwe]]. The main cities were then [[Nijmegen]], [[Tiel]] and [[Zaltbommel]]. The quarter had a private university in Nijmegen.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Science in the Netherlands: Survey, Themes and Reference|author1=Van Berkel, K.|author2=Van Helden, A.|author3=Palm, L.C.|year=1999|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004100060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jwjTsRu6AMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Changed text to make factually correct (although title is still incorrect) - the 1992 date only refers to the award of Imperial honours, not all honours. That's why the "awarded after 1992" list includes commemorative medals that haven't been awarded since 1902!</comment>

Honours and Awards listed in '''bold''' print are:

Honours and Awards listed in unbolded print and marked with &lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; are Imperial awards and are considered Australian if conferred prior to 6 October 1992. If conferred after 5 October 1992, Imperial awards are foreign and should be worn accordingly.&lt;ref name=Imp&gt;''"- all Imperial awards made to Australian citizens '''after''' 5 October 1992 are foreign awards and should be worn accordingly."''

'''Reall, Real Equity for All,''' (formerly Homeless International) is a social enterprise focusing on urban [[poverty]] issues (including [[slum]]s and [[social housing]]) in the [[developing world]]. It is a registered both as a [[Charitable organization|charity]] and a [[company limited by guarantee]].

== History ==
Reall, previously Homeless International, was initially created in 1989, following the ''International Year of Shelter for the Homeless Trust'' or IYSH Trust UK, for the 1987 [[International Year of Shelter for the Homeless]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLeod|Mullard|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trust organised a fundraising campaign and offered grants to more than 100 projects, both in the UK and overseas, all related to shelter issues.

After the year ended, demand for support was still present in developing countries (for instance for establishing land tenure, offering loans for house improvements, improving basic infrastructure); the remaining funds were used to set up a permanent organisation, Homeless International, established in 1989. The trustees appointed Ruth McLeod as director, and she remained chief executive until 2007, when Larry English took her succession.

In 2014, Homeless International rebranded as Reall, reflecting its transition from an international development charity to a social enterprise.&lt;ref name="reall" /&gt;

Reall's work is mainly focused on community-led initiatives and on urban poverty, although some of its current partner organisations also work in rural areas. It helps slum dwellers by supporting the development of civil society organisations in Africa and Asia that are rooted in communities and that create housing and basic services solutions, which are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.

== Activities ==
Reall works by supporting community-led projects and initiatives related to [[slum upgrading]] and [[social housing]] development in over 13 countries by supporting 16 local organisations. It provides grants helping these organisations to accomplish their projects and to build their capacity; organisational development support and technical assistance for housing and infrastructure projects; bank guarantees from the Guarantee Fund; capital grants and loans from the [[Community-Led Infrastructure Finance Facility]] (CLIFF); loans from the Bond.

=== Grants ===
Reall disburses around £1 million of grants every year to partner organisations, especially for younger organisations which are developing community work, undertaking surveys and mapping of slums, and piloting demonstration schemes in housing and infrastructure (such as [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]). Such grants are funded by [[Department for International Development|DFID]], [[Comic Relief]], the [[Big Lottery Fund]], the [[EuropeAid Development and Cooperation|European Commission]], the [[Jersey]] Overseas Aid Commission, and private trusts and foundations such as the Baring Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Homeless International's Directors' Reports 2008-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Guarantee Fund ===
The Guarantee Fund was established in 1994 to enable communities of slum dwellers to access loans from banks. Given the perceived high risk of lending to slum dwellers, few banks in developing countries are willing to lend to such organisations. The Guarantee Fund was created to offer guarantees to bank so as to lower their perceived risk. The main contributors to the Fund have been UK [[Housing Association]]s through long-term deposits. The Guarantee Fund has been used chiefly in India and Bolivia.

=== CLIFF ===
{{Main|Community-Led Infrastructure Finance Facility}}
The Community-Led Infrastructure Finance Facility (CLIFF) was created as the result of a DFID-funded research entitled ''Bridging the Finance Gap'', started in 1999, and first piloted in 2002 in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLeod|Mullard|2006|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[venture capital]] facility which allows communities to implement demonstration projects, in order to secure funding for larger-scale projects. CLIFF is typically used to fund more mature organisations, able to take on loans and larger amounts of [[capital finance]], but still unable to access mainstream [[housing finance]] (especially in countries where the [[financial sector]] is still under-developed).

Reall coordinates CLIFF. A first phase ran between 2002 and 2010, with almost £10 million funded by DFID and [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency|SIDA]]; a second phase is running until 2015, with around £20 million committed by the same funders.&lt;ref&gt;Homeless International, [http://www.homeless-international.org/document_1.aspx?id=0:59668&amp;id=0:59663&amp;id=0:59166&amp;id=0:59153 How CLIFF works]&lt;/ref&gt; CLIFF started in India in 2002, in Kenya in 2005, in the Philippines in 2007, in Nepal in 2010, and in West Africa, Malawi, Angola and Zimbabwe in 2011.

=== Bond ===
The Bond (originally named "The Africa Bond") is a [[soft loan]] facility created in 2007, funded mostly by UK Housing Associations through interest-bearing deposits, aimed at providing soft loans to local partner organisations unable to access other forms of loan finance. Loans are typically issued at 6% per annum, for housing projects. As of 2012, loans have been issued to NACHU.&lt;ref&gt;Homeless International,[http://www.homeless-international.org/document_1.aspx?id=0:59665&amp;id=0:59662&amp;id=0:59166&amp;id=0:59153 How the Bond works]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Canadian Geographical Society''' ('''RCGS''') ([[French language|French]]: ''La Société géographique royale du Canada''; ''SRGC'') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[non-profit]] educational organization dedicated to imparting a broader knowledge and deeper appreciation of [[Canada]] &amp;mdash; its people and places, its natural and cultural heritage and its environmental, social and economic challenges.
{{TOC limit|2}}

==History==
The Royal Canadian Geographical Society was founded in 1929 by [[Charles Camsell]] and a group of eminent Canadians, including [[Marius Barbeau]], an ethnographer and folklorist who is today considered a founder of Canadian anthropology, Hon. A.E. Arsenault, Premier of Prince Edward Island and Justice of the province's Supreme Court, Lawrence J. Burpee, [[Secretary for Canada]], International Joint Commission, [[John Wesley Dafoe]], Managing Editor, ''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'', Hon. [[Albert Hudson]], a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], and Dr. O.D. Skelton, Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs.

The Rt. Hon. [[Viscount Willingdon]], Governor-General of Canada, was founding Patron. J. B. [[Joseph Tyrrell]], a geologist and cartographer whose exploits include the discovery of Albertosaurus bones in Alberta's Bandlands, and making first contact with the [[Ihalmiut]] ("People from Beyond") of the [[District of Keewatin|Keewatin]] district of Canada's [[Northwest Territories]], served as founding Honorary President. [[Arthur Philemon Coleman]], a geologist and explorer who between 1884 and 1908 made eight trips of discovery to the Canadian Rockies, was named Honorary Vice-President. At its first meeting, Dr. Camsell said the Society was formed "purely for patriotic purposes," and hoped it would "be a unifying influence upon the life of Canada."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Geographical Journal, Vol. I, No. I, May 1930&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the Acting Secretary, E.S. Martindale, stated the intention of the founders: "The work of making the resources and other geographic factors of each part of the Dominion more widely known and more clearly understood is one of the best educational services that can be undertaken -- and one that cannot be rendered except through a geographic organization animated by a broad national purpose."&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, Vol. 23, p.376&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who have addressed meetings of the RCGS over the years are Sir Francis Younghusband, Sir Hubert Wilkins, Maj. L. T. Burwash, Dr. Isaiah Bowman, Dr. [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], [[Michael Palin]], Dr. Phil Currie, and Sir [[Christopher Ondaatje]].

The RCGS publishes the award-winning English-language [[magazine]], ''[[Canadian Geographic]]'' , which has been published continuously since 1930 (when it was called the ''Canadian Geographical Journal''). The society also publishes ''Canadian Geographic Travel'' quarterly. The Society’s French-language magazine, ''[[Géographica]]'', which is published in collaboration with ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', was introduced in 1997.

In October 2016, it was announced that the Society's new home would be [[Canada and the World Pavilion|an iconic building at 50 Sussex Drive]], Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gillis|first1=Megan|title=Storied Sussex address to become 2017 pavilion, home of Royal Canadian Geographical Society|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/storied-sussex-address-to-become-2017-pavilion-home-of-royal-canadian-geographical-society|accessdate=13 January 2017|work=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=Postmedia|date=24 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society moved into their new headquarters in Spring 2018, and debuted two exhibitions: ''Explore'' by [[Chris Cran]] and ''Lessons From the Arctic: How [[Roald Amundsen]] Won the Race to the South Pole''.

==Programs==
The Royal Canadian Geographical Society helps fund education, expeditions, research and lectures programs. Notably, it was a partner in the 2014 Victoria Strait Expedition that located HMS ''Erebus'', one of two exploration vessels [[Franklin's lost expedition|lost on the British Arctic Expedition]] commanded by [[Sir John Franklin]].

Each fall, the Society hosts the annual College of Fellows Annual Dinner, with notable past speakers include Sir [[Francis Younghusband]], Major General Sir [[James Howden MacBrien]], ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' host [[Alex Trebek]], artist [[Robert Bateman (artist)|Robert Bateman]], actor [[Dan Aykroyd]], ethnobotanist [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], Climate Canada's senior climatologist David Phillips, storm chaser [[George Kourounis]], and award-winning author [[Margaret Atwood]]. In addition, the dinner has been attended by both [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] and [[Governor General]] [[David Johnston]] in the past.

In June 2017, it was granted $2,084,000 in funding from the [[Government of Canada]] to develop the educational resource, a portion of which was drawn from the [[150th anniversary of Canada|Canada 150]] fund.&lt;ref name="fund"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/news/2017/06/canada_150_projecttodevelopanindigenous-lededucationaltool.html|title=Canada 150 Project to develop an indigenous-led educational tool|publisher=Department of Canadian Heritage|date=8 June 2017|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the creation of the ''[[Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada]]'', developed with input from a number of groups and organizations representing [[indigenous peoples in Canada]], including the [[Assembly of First Nations]], [[Indspire]], [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]], the [[Métis National Council]], and the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4416500/indigenous-peoples-atlas-of-canada/|title=The launch of the Indigenous Peoples Atlas of Canada|last=Scott|first=Katie|publisher=[[Global News]]|date=29 August 2018|accessdate=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An issue of each of [[Canadian Geographic]] and [[Géographica]] were dedicated to the project.&lt;ref name="fund" /&gt;

The Singapore Satellite Positioning Reference Network or in short '''SiReNT''', is an infrastructure set up by the Survey Services section of the [[Singapore Land Authority]] to define Singapore's official spatial reference framework and to support the gazetted cadastral system in SVY21. It is a multi-purpose high precision positioning infrastructure which provides both Post Process Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) [[DGPS]] services and Real Time DGPS services. The system supports all types of GPS positioning modes and formats.

SiReNT comprises five GPS reference stations connected to a Data Control Centre (DCC) at Government Data Centre (GDC). The entire set-up is made up of advanced GPS equipment and sophisticated computer hardware, software, communications and network.

SiReNT supports a great variety of applications. It provides data reliability, efficiency and productivity of survey work for land surveyors with the aid of GPS technology. It also offers a wide range of GPS data services with various accuracy levels ranging from metres to centimetres to suit different applications from positioning to tracking and monitoring.

These six GPS Reference Stations receive satellite signals 24 hours a day and transmit GPS data continuously to the Data Control Centre (DCC) for storage and processing. Corrections processed from the data are then streamed to subscribed users. The six reference stations are strategically located at extreme corners of Singapore Island - Senoko, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Keppel, Nanyang Polytechnic, Loyang and Pulau Semakau, so as to provide an extensive coverage.

SiReNT offers 4 types of services, namely Post Processing (PP) On-Demand, Post Processing (PP) Archive, [[Real Time Kinematic]] (RTK) and low accuracy Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) to suit different applications. In 2010, SiReNT introduced support for telematics and structural monitoring solutions.

The '''Strait of Gibraltar''' ({{lang-ar|مضيق جبل طارق}} {{transl|ar|ALA|Madiq Jebel Tariq}}, {{lang-es|Estrecho de Gibraltar}}) is a narrow [[strait]] that connects the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and separates [[Gibraltar]] and [[Peninsular Spain]] in [[Europe]] from [[Morocco]]  and [[Ceuta]] ([[Spain]]) in [[Africa]]. The name comes from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which in turn originates from the Arabic {{transl|ar|Jebel Tariq}} (meaning "Mount Tariq"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Gibraltar |volume=11 |page=938|

==Location==
[[File:Detroit Gibraltar 2007.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Europe (left) and Africa (right)]]
On the northern side of the Strait are [[Spain]] and [[Gibraltar]] (a British overseas territory in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), while on the southern side are [[Morocco]] and [[Ceuta]] (a Spanish [[exclave]] in [[Morocco]]). Its boundaries were known in antiquity as the [[Pillars of Hercules]]. There are several islets, such as the [[Territorial dispute|disputed]] [[Isla Perejil]], that are claimed by both Morocco and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Tremlett, Giles, "Moroccans seize Parsley Island and leave a bitter taste in Spanish mouths", in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its location, the Strait is commonly used for [[illegal immigration]] from Africa to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=605 |title=Migration Information Source – The Merits and Limitations of Spain's High-Tech Border Control |publisher=Migrationinformation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extent===
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Strait of Gibraltar as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization| accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
[[File:StraitOfGibraltar.JPG|thumb|right|A view across the Strait of Gibraltar taken from the hills above Tarifa, Spain]]
The seabed of the Strait is composed of synorogenic Betic-Rif clayey [[flysch]] covered by Pliocene and/or Quaternary calcareous sediments, sourced from thriving cold water coral communities.&lt;ref&gt;De Mol, B., et al. 2012. Ch. 45: Cold-Water Coral Distribution in an Erosional Environment: The Strait of Gibraltar Gateway, in: Harris, P.T., Baker, E.K. (Eds.), Seafloor geomorphology as benthic habitat: GeoHAB Atlas of seafloor geomorphic features and benthic habitats. Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 636–643&lt;/ref&gt;  Exposed bedrock surfaces, coarse sediments and local sand dunes attest to the strong bottom current conditions at the present time.

Around 5.9 million years ago,&lt;ref name="mainarticle"&gt;[[Messinian salinity crisis#Evidence]]&lt;/ref&gt; the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the [[Betic corridor|Betic]] and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the [[gypsum]] and salt deposition range, during what is known as the [[Messinian salinity crisis]]. In this [[chemistry|water chemistry]] environment, dissolved [[minerals|mineral concentrations]], temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to [[precipitate]] many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.

It is estimated that, were the straits closed even at today's higher sea level, most water in the [[Mediterranean basin]] would evaporate within only a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then,&lt;ref name="mainarticle"/&gt; and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.

After a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;At the [[Miocene]]/[[Pliocene]] boundary, c. 5.33 million years before the present&lt;/ref&gt; the Atlantic-Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the [[Zanclean flood]], and has remained open ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[[Preston Cloud|Cloud, P.]], ''Oasis in space. Earth history from the beginning'', New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co. Inc., p. 440. {{ISBN|0-393-01952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion produced by the incoming waters seems to be the main cause for the present depth of the strait (900 m at the narrows, 280 m at the [[Camarinal Sill]]). The strait is expected to close again as the [[African Plate]] moves northward relative to the [[Eurasian Plate]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} but on geological rather than human timescales.

==Important Bird Area==
The Strait has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] by [[BirdLife International]] because hundreds of thousands of [[seabird]]s use it every year to pass between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, including large numbers of [[Cory's shearwater|Cory's]] and [[Balearic shearwater]]s, [[Audouin's gull|Audouin's]], [[yellow-legged gull|yellow-legged]] and [[lesser black-backed gull]]s, [[razorbill]]s and [[Atlantic puffin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;BirdLife International (2012).

==History==
[[File:Strait of Gibraltar by Piri Reis.jpg|thumb|Historic map of the Strait of Gibraltar by [[Piri Reis]]]]
:''For full articles on the history of the north Gibraltar shore, see [[History of Gibraltar]] or [[History of Spain]]. For the full article on the history of the south Gibraltar shore, see [[History of Morocco]].''

Evidence of the first human habitation of the area by [[Neanderthal]]s dates back to 125,000 years ago. It is believed that the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] may have been one of the last outposts of Neanderthal habitation in the world, with evidence of their presence there dating to as recently as 24,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 2008 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/10/neanderthals/hall-text/10 |title=Last of the Neanderthals |journal=National Geographic |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence of Homo sapiens habitation of the area dates back c. 40,000 years.

The relatively short distance between the two shores has served as a quick crossing point for various groups and civilizations throughout history, including Carthaginians campaigning against Rome, Romans travelling between the provinces of Hispania and Mauritania, Vandals raiding south from Germania through Western Rome and into North Africa in the 5th century, Moors and Berbers in the 8th–11th centuries, and Spain and Portugal in the 16th century.

Beginning in 1492, the straits began to play a certain cultural role in acting as a barrier against cross-strait conquest and the flow of culture and language that would naturally follow such a conquest. In that year, the last Muslim government north of the straits was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the straits have come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of the straits after sharing much the same culture and greater degrees of tolerance for over 300+ years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

On the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the [[Romansh language|Romance]] [[Spanish language]], while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the [[Arabic]] language. For the last 500 years, religious and cultural intolerance, more than the small travel barrier that the straits present, has come to act as a powerful enforcing agent of the cultural separation that exists between these two groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The small [[United Kingdom|British]] enclave of the city of [[Gibraltar]] presents a third cultural group found in the straits. This enclave was first established in 1704 and has since been used by Britain to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.

Following the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]] the [[Spanish Republican Navy]] tried to [[blockade]] the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] troops from [[Spanish Morocco]] to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called [[Convoy de la victoria]] was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the strait, breaking the republican blockade.&lt;ref name="Antony Beevor 1982 revised 2006"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Battle for Spain | author = [[Antony Beevor]] | origyear = 1982| year = 2006 | publisher = Orion | isbn = 978-0-7538-2165-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communications==
[[File:Hércules3D.jpg|thumb|3-d rendering, looking eastwards towards the Mediterranean.]]

The Strait is an important [[shipping route]] from the [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Atlantic]].  There are [[ferries]] that operate between Spain and Morocco across the strait, as well as between Spain and [[Ceuta]] and [[Gibraltar]] to [[Tangier]].

===Tunnel across the strait===
{{Main article|Strait of Gibraltar crossing}}

In December 2003, Spain and Morocco agreed to explore the construction of an [[underwater|undersea]] [[Rail transport|rail]] [[tunnel]] to connect their rail systems across the Strait. The gauge of the rail would be {{convert|1435|mm|ftin|abbr=on}} to match the proposed construction and conversion of significant parts of the existing broad gauge system to [[standard gauge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3317149.stm "Europe-Africa rail tunnel agreed"].  [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; While the project remains in a planning phase, Spanish and Moroccan officials have met to discuss it as recently as 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bluedoorhotel.com/2012/04/17/tunnel-to-connect-morocco-with-europe/ |title=Tunnel to Connect Morocco with Europe |date=February 17, 2012 |website=bluedoorhotel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals predict it could be completed by 2025.

==Special flow and wave patterns==
The Strait of Gibraltar links the Atlantic Ocean directly to the Mediterranean Sea. This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, tidal forces, and wind forces.

===Inflow and outflow===
[[File:InternalWaves Gibraltar ISS009-E-09952 54.jpg|thumb|[[Internal wave]]s (marked with arrows) caused by the Strait of Gibraltar. (Mediterranean Sea in upper right.)]]

Through the strait, water generally flows more or less continually in both an eastward and a westward direction. A smaller amount of deeper saltier and therefore denser waters continually work their way westwards (the [[Mediterranean outflow]]), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually work their way eastwards (the [[Mediterranean inflow]]). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods by temporary tidal flows, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. Still, on the whole and over time, the balance of the water flow is eastwards, due to an evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} At the strait's far western end is the [[Camarinal Sill]], the strait's shallowest point which limits mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warm Mediterranean waters.

The Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (''[[Thermohaline circulation|thermohaline]]'', both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much further out at a depth of about {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the strait, before completely losing its identity.

[[File:Camarinal Still Water Mixing (Simplified).jpg|thumb|left|Simplifed and stylized diagram of currents at the Camarinal Sill]]
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], German [[U-boats]] used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, Lawrence. ''U-Boats in the Mediterranean 1941–1944''. Chatham Publishing, 2007, pp. 19 and 182. {{ISBN|9781861762900}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage. No U-boats ever made it back into the Atlantic and all were either sunk in battle or scuttled by their own crews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uboat.net/ops/mediterranean.htm |title=U-boat war in the Mediterranean |publisher=uboat.net |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal waves===
[[Internal wave]]s (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These ''internal waves'' continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and sometimes create [[interference (wave propagation)|interference patterns]] with refracted waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wesson |first=J. C. |first2=M. C. |last2=Gregg |title=Mixing at [[Camarinal Sill]] in the Strait of Gibraltar |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=99 |issue=C5 |year=1994 |pages=9847–9878 |doi=10.1029/94JC00256 |bibcode = 1994JGR....99.9847W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial waters==
Except for its far eastern end, the Strait lies within the [[territorial waters]] of Spain and Morocco. The [[United Kingdom]] claims {{convert|3|nmi}} around Gibraltar on the northern side of the Strait, putting part of it inside British territorial waters. As this is less than the {{convert|12|nmi}} maximum, it means, according to the British claim, that part of the Strait lies in [[international waters]]. The ownership of Gibraltar and its territorial waters is [[Disputed status of Gibraltar#Territorial waters|disputed]] by Spain. Similarly, Morocco disputes Spanish sovereignty over [[Ceuta]] on the southern coast.

==Power generation==
Some studies have proposed the possibility of erecting [[Tidal power#Categories of tidal power|tidal power]] generating stations within the strait, to be powered from the predictable current at the strait.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the [[Atlantropa]] project proposed damming the strait to generate large amounts of electricity and lower the sea level of the Mediterranean by several hundreds of meters to create large new lands for settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xefer.com/iuncturae/2005/03/72 "Atlantropa: A plan to dam the Mediterranean Sea"]. Xefer blog. 16 March 2005. Retrieved on 13 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal would however have devastating effects on the local climate and ecology and would dramatically change the strength of the West African Monsoon.

'''Timor''' is an [[island]] at the southern end of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], north of the [[Timor Sea]]. The island is divided between the [[sovereign state]]s of [[East Timor]] on the eastern part and [[Indonesia]] on the western part. The Indonesian part, also known as [[West Timor]], constitutes part of the [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. Within West Timor lies an [[exclave]] of East Timor called [[Oecusse District]]. The island covers an area of {{convert|30,777|km2|0|abbr=off}}. The name is a variant of ''timur'', [[Malay language|Malay]] for "east"; it is so called because it lies at the eastern end of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. Mainland [[Australia]] is less than 500&amp;nbsp;km away, separated by the mentioned Timor Sea.

The official languages of East Timor are [[Tetum]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], while in West Timor it is [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. Indonesian is also widely spoken and understood in East Timor.

[[Christianity]] is the dominant religion throughout the island of Timor, at about 90% of the population, but unequally distributed as West Timor is 58% Protestant and 37% Catholic, and East Timor is 98% Catholic and 1% Protestant. [[Islam]] and [[animism]] make up most of the remainder at about 5% each across the island.

==Geography==
{{see also|Geography of East Timor|Geography of West Timor}}
Timor is located north of [[Australia]], and is one of the easternmost [[Sunda Islands]]. Together with [[Sumba]], [[Babar Island|Babar]] and associated smaller islands, Timor forms the southern outer [[archipelago]] of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]] with the inner islands of [[Flores]], [[Alor Island|Alor]] and [[Wetar]] to the north, and beyond them [[Sulawesi]].

Timor is the principal island of the [[Outer Banda Arc]], which has been upthrust by collision with the [[Australian continent]]. Timor has older geology and lacks the volcanic nature of the northern Lesser Sunda Islands. The orientation of the main axis of the island also differs from its neighbors. These features have been explained as the result of being on the northern edge of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] as it meets the [[Eurasian Plate]] and pushes into [[South East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Audley-Charles, M.G. (1987) "Dispersal of Gondwanaland: relevance to evolution of the Angiosperms" ''In'': Whitmore, T.C. (ed.) (1987) ''Biogeographical Evolution of the Malay Archipelago'' Oxford Monographs on Biogeography 4, Clarendon Press, Oxford, pp. 5–25, {{ISBN|0-19-854185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate includes a long dry season with hot winds blowing over from Australia. Rivers on the island include the Southern and [[Northern Laclo River]]s in East Timor.

The largest towns on the island are the provincial capital of [[Kupang]] in West Timor, Indonesia and the Portuguese colonial towns of [[Dili]] the capital, and [[Baucau]] in East Timor. Poor roads make transport to inland areas difficult, in East Timor especially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/4029980| jstor = 4029980| volume=15| issue = 3/4| pages=502–513| doi-broken-date = 2018-09-10| title = Post-Conflict Pro-Poor Private-Sector Development: The Case of Timor-Leste| journal = Development in Practice| last1 = Kusago| first1 = Takayoshi| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; East Timor is a poor country, with health issues including malaria and dengue fever. Sources of revenue include gas and oil in the Timor Sea, coffee growing and tourism.

The natural vegetation was [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] with an undergrowth of shrubs and grasses supporting a rich wildlife{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2010}}. However much of the original forest has been cleared for farming{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2010}}, especially on the coasts of Timor and on the smaller islands like Atauro. Apart from one large block in the centre of Timor only patches remain{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2010}}. This ecoregion is part of the [[Wallacea]] area with a mixture of plants and animals of [[Asia]]n and [[Australasia]]n origin; it lies in the western part of Wallacea, in which Asian species predominate.

Many trees are [[deciduous]] or partly deciduous, dropping their leaves during the dry season, there are also [[evergreen]] and thorn trees in the woodland. Typical trees of the lowland slopes include ''[[Sterculia foetida]]'', ''[[Calophyllum|Calophyllum teysmannii]]'' and ''[[Aleurites moluccanus]]''.

During the [[Pleistocene]] [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]], Timor was the abode of extinct [[Island gigantism|giant]] [[monitor lizard]]s similar to the [[Komodo dragon]]. Like [[Flores]], [[Sumba]] and [[Sulawesi]], Timor was also once a habitat of extinct [[Insular dwarfism|dwarf]] [[stegodon]]ts, relatives of [[elephant]]s.

Fauna of today includes a number of endemic species such as the distinctive [[Timor shrew]] and [[Timor rat]]. The [[northern common cuscus]], a [[marsupial]] of Australasian origin occurs as well, but is thought to be introduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/16847/0 IUCN Red List: Northern Common Cuscus] accessed 17 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The island have a great number of birds, mainly of Asian origin with some of Australasian origin. There is a total of 250 species of which twenty four are endemic, due to the relative isolation of Timor, including five threatened species; the [[slaty cuckoo-dove]], [[Wetar ground dove]], [[Timor green pigeon]], [[Timor imperial pigeon]], and [[iris lorikeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|name=Timor and Wetar deciduous forests|id=aa0204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are found in the wetlands whereas [[reticulated python]]s can be found in forests and grasslands of Timor. However, the population sizes and status are unknown.

Frog species in Timor include ''[[Duttaphrynus melanostictus]]'', ''[[Hoplobatrachus tigerinus]]'', ''[[Limnonectes timorensis]]'', ''[[Litoria everetti]]'', and ''[[Polypedates leucomystax]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser H, Ceballos J, Freed P, Heacox S, Lester B, Richards S, Trainor C, Sanchez C, O’Shea M (2011) The herpetofauna of Timor-Leste: a first report.

[[Late Cretaceous]] fossils of marine vertebrates are known from East Timor deposits. These include [[mosasaur]]s such as ''[[Globidens]] timorensis'', [[lamniforme]] sharks, [[coelacanth]]s and the [[Choristodera|choristodere]] ''[[Champsosaurus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;J. H. F.

The earliest historical record about Timor island is 14th century [[Nagarakretagama]], Canto 14, that identify ''Timur'' as an island within [[Majapahit]]'s realm. Timor was incorporated into ancient [[Java]]nese, Chinese and Indian trading networks of the 14th century as an exporter of aromatic [[sandalwood]], [[slavery|slave]]s, [[honey]] and [[wax]], and was settled by both the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], in the end of the 16th century, and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], based in Kupang, in the mid-17th century.

As the nearest island with a European settlement at the time, Timor was the destination of [[William Bligh]] and seamen loyal to him following the infamous [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']] in 1789. It was also where survivors of the wrecked ''[[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS Pandora]]'', sent to arrest the ''Bounty'' mutineers, landed in 1791 after that ship sank in the [[Great Barrier Reef]].

The island has been politically divided in two parts for centuries. The Dutch and Portuguese fought for control of the island until it was divided by [[Treaty of Lisbon (1859)|treaty]] in 1859, but they still did not formally resolve the matter of the boundary until 1912. [[West Timor]], was known as '''Dutch Timor''' until 1949 when it became '''Indonesian Timor''', a part of the nation of [[Indonesia]] which was formed from the old [[Netherlands East Indies]]; while [[East Timor]] was known as [[Portuguese Timor]], a Portuguese colony until 1975. It includes the [[exclave]] of [[Oecussi-Ambeno]] in West Timor.

[[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces occupied the whole island from 1942 to 1945. They were resisted in a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign led initially by [[Australia]]n [[commando]]s.

Following the [[Carnation Revolution|military coup in Portugal]] in 1974 the Portuguese began to withdraw from Timor, [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invasion by Indonesia]], who opposed the concept of an independent East Timor. In 1975, East Timor was annexed by Indonesia and became known as ''Timor Timur'' or 'Tim-Tim' for short. It was regarded by Indonesia as the country's 27th province, but this was never recognised by the [[United Nations]] (UN) or [[Portugal]].

The people of East Timor, through [[Falintil]] the military wing of Fretilin, resisted 35,000 Indonesian troops in a prolonged guerrilla campaign, but the whole island remained under Indonesian control until [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|a referendum held in 1999]] under a UN-sponsored agreement between [[Indonesia]] and [[Portugal]] in which its people rejected the offer of autonomy within Indonesia. The UN then temporarily governed East Timor until it became independent as Timor-Leste in 2002 under the presidency of Falintil leader [[Xanana Gusmão]]. Although political strife continued as the new nation coped with poverty the UN presence was much reduced.

A group of people on the Indonesian side of Timor have been reported active since 2001 trying to establish a [[Great Timor]] State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etan.org/et2005/february/20/26ofical.htm etan.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no real evidence whatsoever that the people of West Timor, most of whom are from [[Atoni]] ethnicity who are the traditional enemy of the East Timorese, have any interest in joining their tribal enemies. Additionally, [[East Timor]]'s independence movement never laid claim to West Timor at any time, before the Indonesian invasion or thereafter. Similarly, the government of East Timor fully recognizes Indonesia's existing boundaries as inherited from the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. This is similar to the position taken by [[Papua New Guinea]] in relation to [[Western New Guinea]], when the former became independent of [[Australia]].

[[Image:MoonTopoLOLA.png|thumb|right|345px|alt=Topography of the Moon measured from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter on the mission [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]], referenced to a sphere of radius 1737.4 km|Topography of the Moon.]]

The '''[[topography]] of the [[Moon]]''' has been measured by the methods of laser altimetry and stereo image analysis, including data obtained during the [[Clementine mission|''Clementine'' mission]]. The most visible topographic feature is the giant far side [[South Pole-Aitken basin]], which possesses the lowest [[elevation]]s of the Moon. The highest elevations are found just to the north-east of this basin, and it has been suggested that this area might represent thick [[ejecta]] deposits that were emplaced during an oblique South Pole-Aitken basin impact event. Other large impact basins, such as the [[Lunar mare|maria]] [[Mare Imbrium|Imbrium]], [[Mare Serenitatis|Serenitatis]], [[Mare Crisium|Crisium]], [[Mare Smythii|Smythii]], and [[Mare Orientale|Orientale]], also possess regionally low elevations and elevated [[Rim (craters)|rim]]s.

Another distinguishing feature of the Moon's shape is that the elevations are on average about 1.9&amp;nbsp;[[Kilometre|km]] higher on the far side than the near side. If it is assumed that the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] is in [[Isostasy|isostatic equilibrium]], and that the density of the crust is everywhere the same, then the higher elevations would be associated with a thicker crust. Using gravity, topography and [[Seismology|seismic]] data, the crust is thought to be on average about {{nowrap|50 ± 15 km}} thick, with the far-side crust being on average thicker than the near side by about 15&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name="W06"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mark Wieczorek |display-authors=etal |title=The constitution and structure of the lunar interior |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry |volume=60 |pages=221–364 |date=2006 |doi=10.2138/rmg.2006.60.3 |first1=M.

This is a list of alleged sightings of [[unidentified flying objects]] or UFOs in the [[Canary Islands]].

== 1976 ==
This reported UFO sighting occurred over the Canary Islands on 22 June 1976. It is notable for its duration (over 40 minutes), multiple locations (it was observed in [[Tenerife]], [[La Palma]], [[La Gomera]], [[Gran Canaria]] and by a ship at sea) and multiple witnesses (several hundred people, including both civilian and military personnel). It is one of the few accounts to include a report of details of the occupants inside the craft. The official report on the incident, by the [[Spanish Air Force]], was declassified in June 1994, but much of its content had already been released to the public in 1977, after journalist J Benitez obtained a number of military files and used them as the basis of a book on UFO cases.

== 2008 ==
At least two people reported spotting a UFO just over the horizon, viewed from [[Lanzarote]] floating off the coast of [[Fuerteventura]]. It apparently vanished after about 3 minutes. The sighting remains unexplained.

'''Urho Kekkonen National Park''' ({{lang-fi|Urho Kekkosen kansallispuisto}}) is a [[national park]] in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], [[Finland]], situated in area of municipalities of [[Savukoski]], [[Sodankylä]] and [[Inari, Finland|Inari]]. Established in 1983 and covering {{convert|2550|km2|sqmi|0}}, it is one of Finland's largest protected areas. It is named after [[Urho Kekkonen]], late [[President of finland|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] of Finland.

The Suomujoki river flows through the northern parts of the diverse park. The marked paths in its western part are an easy destination even for the inexperienced backpacker, whereas the wilderness is good for long and demanding trips.

Most trips to Urho Kekkonen National Park are started from the Kiilopää [[fell]] center, the Aittajärvi lake along the Suomujoki river, or Raja-Jooseppi, and backpackers usually end up nearby the [[Saariselkä]] fell line, for instance on the top of its highest fell, Sokosti. [[Reindeer herding]] is still a common livelihood in the area.
