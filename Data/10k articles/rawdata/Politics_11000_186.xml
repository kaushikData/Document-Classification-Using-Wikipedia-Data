The '''Treason Trial''' was a trial in [[Johannesburg]] in which 156 people, including [[Nelson Mandela]], were arrested in a raid and accused of [[treason]] in South Africa in 1956.

The main trial lasted until 1961, when all of the defendants were found not guilty. During the trials, [[Oliver Tambo]] left the country and was exiled. Whilst in other European and African countries, he started an organisation which helped bring publicity to the [[African National Congress]]'s cause in South Africa. Some of the defendants were later convicted in the [[Rivonia Trial]] in 1964.

[[Albert Lutuli|Chief Luthuli]] has said of the Treason Trial:&lt;blockquote&gt;The treason trial must occupy a special place in South African history. That grim pre-dawn raid, deliberately calculated to strike terror into hesitant minds and impress upon the entire nation the determination of the governing clique to stifle all opposition, made one hundred and fifty-six of us, belonging to all the races of our land, into a group of accused facing one of the most serious charges in any legal system.{{sfn|Joseph|1963|p=14}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==
On 5 December 1956, the South African Police's Security Branch raided and arrested 140 people from around the country on the charge of treason as they enforced the [[Suppression of Communism Act]].&lt;ref name="NYT05"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/12/06/87278056.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=1 |url-access=subscription| title=South Africa Seizes 140 in Race Dispute | work=The New York Times | date=6 December 1956 | agency= | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,12}} Those not based in Johannesburg were flown there in military aircraft and held in custody until a hearing on 19 December 1956.&lt;ref name=NYT05/&gt;{{rp|12}} The raids were follow-ups to those conducted in 1955 and included search warrants to look for documents at 48 anti-government organisations.&lt;ref name=NYT05/&gt;{{rp|12}}

On the 19 December 1956, 153 prisoners were driven to the Johannesburg Drill Hall for a preliminary hearing to examine the states evidence.&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/12/20/86989181.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=18 |url-access=subscription| title=AFRICANS' SINGING DROWNS OUT TRIAL | work=The New York Times | date=20 December 1956 | agency= | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} Magistrate Frederick Wessels was the presiding judge with J.C. van Niekerk as the state's public prosecutor.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;{{rp|18}} An attempt by the prosecutor to proceed with the case was interrupted three times as the noise of 5,000 Black South Africans, hoping to attend the case, surrounded the streets of the Drill Hall and sung [[Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika]].&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;{{rp|18}} The proceedings had to be halted.&lt;ref name=NYT01/&gt;{{rp|18}} The [[Labour Party (UK)|
Labour Party]] in the UK accused the South African Government of intimidating and victimising those opposed to Apartheid, condemning the trial and called South Africa a police state.&lt;ref name="NYT02"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/12/20/86989181.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=18 | title=Laborites are critical | work=The New York Times | date=20 December 1956 | agency= |url-access=subscription| accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

Resuming on 20 December 1956, the hearing was interrupted again when the defence objected to their clients being behind a six foot high wire fence.&lt;ref name="NYT04"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/12/21/84947476.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=9 | title=Police Fire on Mob At Trial in Africa | work=The New York Times | date=21 December 1956 | agency= | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1, 9}} After an adjournment, it was agreed by the two sides to reduce it to a barrier four foot tall.&lt;ref name=NYT04/&gt;{{rp|9}} The prosecutor J.C. van Niekerk then presented an outline of his evidence stretching back to 1953 of the liberation movements activities but his evidence was soon interrupted when violence broke out outside the court.&lt;ref name=NYT04/&gt;{{rp|9}} After police began moving back the crowd of around a 1,000 black protesters, a policeman was injured by a stone and they retaliated by firing into the crowd and surrounding cars and shops, injuring fourteen people. Deputy Police Commissioner Colonel Piet Grobler was able to get his men stop shooting and order was restored.&lt;ref name=NYT04/&gt;{{rp|1,9}}

The trial examination would continue on 21 December 1956 and the prosecutor presented his case as stating that the defendants were subversive, having attended the recent [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] gathering at [[Kliptown]] where speeches had promoted Communism and the creation of the [[Freedom Charter]], the need to seek help abroad and in other evidence, the need to raise money to buy firearms.&lt;ref name="NYT03"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1956/12/22/84717768.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=1|url-access=subscription | title=South African Treason Trial Causes New Rioting | work=The New York Times | date=22 December 1956 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1, 4}} With no charges yet presented to the individual detainees, bail was granted and the trial was then concluded until 9 January 1957.&lt;ref name=NYT03/&gt;{{rp|4}} Rioting broke out at the end of the days proceedings when police charge a group of 400 Black South African protesters.&lt;ref name=NYT03/&gt;{{rp|4}}

On resumption of the preliminary hearing and an examination of the state's evidence on 9 January 1957, three more defendants were added to the charges bringing the number to 156 persons.&lt;ref name="NYT06"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/01/10/93204794.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=14 | title=RACIAL PLOT SEEN IN AFRICAN TRIAL | work=The New York Times | date=10 January 1957 | agency= | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=Hunt, Richard P.|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} The defence would argue that the Freedom Charter was not treasonous, that it did not call for violence and it argued for peace and racial harmony for the country.&lt;ref name=NYT06/&gt;{{rp|14}}

The hearing was still ongoing during August 1957, the accused were spending six hours each day in court.&lt;ref name="NYT07"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/08/25/95814284.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=17 | title=TREASON INQUIRY IN AFRICA DRAGS | work=The New York Times | date=25 August 1957 | agency= | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=Hunt, Richard P.|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}} With the hearing to last a few more months, the magistrate had more 6,200 pages of testimony and 10,000 exhibits to examine and decide whether to pass the sentences himself or let the Attorney General decide whether to proceed to a trial.&lt;ref name=NYT07/&gt;{{rp|17}} The trial was taking so long, the male prisoners formed a choir.&lt;ref name=NYT07/&gt;{{rp|17}}

On 17 December 1957, Attorney General W.J. McKenzie decided to drop charges against 61 and proceed to with the remaining 95 defendants on 13 January 1958.&lt;ref name="NYT08"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1957/12/18/84985090.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=15 | title=SOUTH AFRICA FREES 61 IN TREASON CASE | work=The New York Times | date=18 December 1957 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} Albert Luthuli and 44 Black, six Whites, four Indian and six Coloured defendants were released.&lt;ref name=NYT08/&gt;{{rp|15}}

The hearing resumed on 13 January 1958 with the prosecutor informing the court of the names of those 61 defendants who had been cleared of further charges.&lt;ref name="NYT09"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/01/14/89040051.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=2 | title=TREASON TRIAL RENEWED | work=The New York Times | date=14 January 1958 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=1 September 2017 | author=|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

The hearing concluded on 30 January 1958 with Magistrate F.C. Wessels finding that there was sufficient evidence for the defendants to be tried on charges of high treason.&lt;ref name="NYT10"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/01/31/82207456.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=1 | title=95 IN SOUTH AFRICA HELD AS TRAITORS| work=The New York Times | date=31 January 1958 | agency= | accessdate=2 September 2017 | author=Hunt, Richard P.|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,3}} The defendants were asked to plead, with all pleading not guilty they were released on bail. Their defence lawyers asked for a jury trial, the alternative being a trial by two or three judges, with the former request being rejected by the state in treason trials.&lt;ref name=NYT10/&gt;{{rp|3}}

The Treason Trial began in Pretoria on 1 August 1958 with 91 people on trial having been charged with high treason.&lt;ref name="NYT11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/08/02/82212399.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=4|title=Mass Trial Opens in South Africa|last=|first=|date=2 August 1958|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|others=Reuters|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} The trial saw 57 blacks, 16 whites, 16 Indians and two Coloureds charged with attempting to overthrow the South African government between 1952 and 1956 with the intention to replace it with a communism system.&lt;ref name=NYT11/&gt;{{rp|4}} The defence lawyers opened the trial by lodging an objection to two of the three trial judges. They called for Justice Joseph Ludorf to withdraw because of his involvement as a lawyer in other cases against some defendants while Justice Rans Rumpff should withdraw as he had asked for the former to be appointed as a judge on the treason trial.&lt;ref name=NYT11/&gt;{{rp|4}} The case was then adjourned until the following Monday.&lt;ref name=NYT11/&gt;{{rp|4}}

When the trial resumed on 12 August 1958, chief defence lawyer Israel Maisels continued to challenge the indictment referring to the masses of documentary evidence which he claimed was impossible to read in less than two years, and was a abuse of the court process and that the prosecution did not know what its case was about.&lt;ref name="NYT12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/08/13/82708280.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=8|title=Treason Case Scored|last=|first=|date=13 August 1958|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

After the trial collapsed in October, it was decided in November 1958 to resume the trial on 19 January 1959 with a decision to drop 60 people from the indictment.&lt;ref name="NYT13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/11/14/83423816.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=8|title=South Africa to Resume Trial|last=|first=|date=14 November 1958|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

On 22 November 1958, 30 of the 91 were re-indicted with the charge now been narrowed down to a conspiracy to endanger and overthrow the state based on the 1955 Congress of the People gathering and the adoption of the Freedom Charter.&lt;ref name="NYT14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/11/23/110082797.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=27|title=SOUTH AFRICA OPENS NEW TREASON CASE|last=|first=|date=23 November 1958|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} The remaining 61 were to be indicted in April 1959.&lt;ref name=NYT14/&gt;{{rp|27}}

The trial resumed on 19 January 1959 in Pretoria with the defence arguing for the trial to be moved back to Johannesburg, due to the hardship of travel for the defendants, a city where the majority of them lived.&lt;ref name="NYT14B"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/01/20/89108166.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=8|title=30 IN SOUTH AFRICA ASK VENUE CHANGE|last=|first=|date=20 January 1959|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} The case was postponed on the first day until after lunch as the bus carrying the defendants had broken down.&lt;ref name=NYT14B/&gt;{{rp|8}} Trial resumed on 2 February 1959, with the venue change request squashed and the defence lawyers continuing their argument against the new indictments.&lt;ref name="NYT15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/02/03/89114811.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=6|title=INDICTMENT ATTACKED|last=|first=|date=3 February 1959|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

With the resumption of the trial on 20 April 1959 of the other 61 defendants, it was ended when Judge R.L. Rumpff declared that the Crown's case could not accuse the defendants of conspiracy without saying how they entered into the conspiracy and that they would need to know in order to defend their case.&lt;ref name=NYT16/&gt;{{rp|4}} The defendants could return home and the prosecution would have to decide whether to re-indict them.&lt;ref name="NYT16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1959/04/21/89183556.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=4|title=SOUTH AFRICA SETS 61 'PLOTTERS' FREE|last=|first=|date=21 April 1959|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}}

On 29 March 1961, down to 28 defendants, the trial's verdict was released and they were all found not guilty of treason and discharged.&lt;ref name="NYT17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1961/03/30/118032375.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=1|title=28 AFRICANS FREE IN TREASON TRIAL|last=|first=|date=30 March 1961|work=The New York Times|access-date=22 September 2018|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Judge F.L.H. Rumpff concluded that the prosecution could not show that the ANC had become a communist organisation and therefore no treason could be proven nor that any act of violence was to be used to overthrow the state.&lt;ref name=NYT17/&gt;{{rp|1}} The defendants were met outside the court by their relatives and saw the singing of Nkosi Sikeleli Afrika.&lt;ref name=NYT17/&gt;{{rp|5}}

== Defendants ==

In December 1956, many key members of the [[Congress Alliance]] were arrested and charged with treason, including  almost the entire executive committee of the ANC, as well as the [[SACP]], the [[South African Indian Congress|SAIC]], and the [[South African Congress of Democrats|COD]]. 105 Africans, 21 Indians, 23 whites and 7 coloured leaders were arrested. Ten were women.{{sfn|Sampson|1958|p=}} Many arrestees, including Nelson Mandela, were detained in communal cells in Johannesburg Prison, known as the Fort, resulting in what Mandela described as "the largest and longest unbanned meeting of the Congress Alliance in years."{{sfn|Mandela|1995|p=149}} However, white men, white women, and black people were all held in a separate parts of the jail.

Initially, 156 defendants were charged with high treason. The number of defendants was later reduced to 92. In November 1957, the prosecution reworded the indictment and proceeded a separate trial against 30 accused. Their trial commenced in August 1959. The remaining 61 accused were tried separately before the case against them was dismissed in mid 1960.{{sfn|Mandela|1995|p=196}}

== Defence and Aid Fund ==

After the British Canon [[John Collins (priest)|John Collins]] learnt about the trial, and the calls for the death penalty, he set up the [[Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa]] to pay all legal expenses and look after the families of those on trial. This was one of the first examples of foreign intervention against apartheid in South Africa and proved very successful with over £75,000 being raised towards defending those accused.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with John Collins from the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01b9hbg/The_World_Against_Apartheid_Have_You_Heard_from_Johannesburg_The_Road_to_Resistance/ BBC documentary 'World Against Apartheid' (Episode 1 at 14 minutes)].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, the campaigner [[Mary Benson (campaigner)|Mary Benson]] joined the Defence Fund as its secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senatehouselibrary.ac.uk/blog/no-easy-walk-freedom-nelson-mandela-archives|title=No Easy Walk to Freedom: Nelson Mandela in the Archives – Senate House Library|publisher=|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance of the trial ==

In many ways, the trial and prolonged periods in detention strengthened and solidified the relationships between members of the multi-racial Congress Alliance. [[Rusty Bernstein]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Inter-racial trust and co-operation is a difficult plant to cultivate in the poisoned soil outside. It is somewhat easier in here where ... the leaders of all ethnic factions of the movement are together and explore each other's doubts and reservations, and speak about them without constraint. Coexistance in the Drill Hall deepens and recreates their relationships.{{sfn|Bernstein|1999|p=179}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;The trial and resulting periods of detention also allowed ANC leaders to consult about the direction of their struggle and the possibility of armed struggle. Ironically, the court found that the ANC was nonviolent just as the ANC was starting to question the effectiveness of this strategy.{{sfn|Sisulu|2011|pp=178–181}}

In court, the 156 defendants sat in alphabetical order, visibly displaying the multiracial nature of the anti-apartheid movement. While the defendants sat side by side in court, they were strictly segregated in jail. When the trialists took over their own defence during the State of Emergency, they eventually convinced prison authorities to let them meet to plan their defence and white female defendants, white male defendants and black women defendants were brought to the African men's prison. Yet the prison authorities still sought to physically separate these defendants by race and gender in their meeting space. Mandela describes the practical dilemma the proponents of apartheid faced:&lt;blockquote&gt;The authorities erected an iron grille to separate [[Helen Joseph|Helen]] and Leon [Levy] (as whites) from us and a second partition to separate them from [[Lilian Ngoyi|Lilian]] and Bertha [Mashaba Gxowa] (as African women) ... Even a master architect would have had trouble designing such a structure.{{sfn|Mandela|1995|p=293}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention''' is considered the watershed political event in the modern [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]].  The  convention established term limits for state office holders, provided a requirement for an annual [[balanced budget]], laid the groundwork for the return of federal land such as the island of [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{Okina}}olawe]], and most importantly created the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] in an effort to right the wrongs done towards [[native Hawaiians]] since the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{Okina}}i]] in 1893.  The event also created an ambitious project of preservation of the Hawaiian culture including the adoption of Hawaiian diacritical marks for official usage, use of Hawaiian names, etc.  The Hawaiian language became the official state language of Hawaii for the first time since the overthrow.

A major outgrowth of the constitutional convention was the launching of the political careers of men and women who would later dominate Hawaiian politics.  Delegates to the convention included:

* [[Carol Fukunaga]], future legislative leader
* [[Helene Hale]], future legislative leader
* [[Jeremy Harris (politician)|Jeremy Harris]], future Mayor of Honolulu
* [[Les Ihara, Jr.]], future legislative leader
* [[Barbara Marumoto]], future legislative leader
* [[Joseph M. Souki]], future Speaker of the House
* [[John David Waihee III]], future Governor

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1218">The '''Abolish Self Government Coalition''' was a minor [[Australian Capital Territory]] [[Political parties in Australia|political party]] that experienced limited success in the early years of the [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]]. It opposed [[Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988|self government]] for the ACT, supporting its re-integration into the local government of [[New South Wales]]. The party elected one MLA, [[Dennis Stevenson]], to the ACT Legislative Assembly in 1989; he was re-elected in 1991 but retired in 1995, after which the party declined markedly. It was federally registered on 22 December 1992 and deregistered on 16 June 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/asgc.htm|title=Abolish Self Government Coalition|work=Australian Electoral Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4498">The '''Afghan New Beginnings Programme''' aimed to disarm, demobilise and reintegrate thousands of combatants from the Afghan Militia Forces/[[Afghan Army]] and provide them opportunities to join the Afghan National Army, Afghan National Police or an alternative line of work. The government of [[Afghanistan]] and the ANBP estimated that there might be 100,000 former combatants who could be integrated into [[civilian]] life.&lt;ref name=BhatiaSedra&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhatia |first1=Michael |last2=Sedra |first2=Mark |date=2008 |title=Afghanistan, Arms and Conflict: Armed groups, disarmament, and security in a postwar society |url= |location=Abingdon  |publisher=Routledge |pages=122–123 |isbn=0-415-47734-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian government has said that the mission was completed on July 2005, although only 50,000 soldiers have been captured and integrated into civilian life. There are still an estimated 40,000 soldiers who are loyal to Mohammed Fahim.

The pilot phase of the operation began on 24 October 2003 and focused on [[Kunduz Province]], Gardez, Mazar-e-Sharif, Kandahar, and Kabul.&lt;ref name=BhatiaSedra127&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bhatia |first1=Michael |last2=Sedra |first2=Mark |date=2008 |title=Afghanistan, Arms and Conflict: Armed groups, disarmament, and security in a postwar society |url= |location=Abingdon  |publisher=Routledge |page=127 |isbn=0-415-47734-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deputy chairman of the commission responsible for the disarmament program is Afghan Urban Development Minister [[Yousuf Pushtun]].

The senior DDR advisor from the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) is [[Sultan Aziz]].

The total budget for the DDR process is estimated at US$200 million, of which only $41 million had been secured by phase one, including $35 million from the [[Japan]]ese government.

'''[[Agrarian reform]]s''' or '''[[land reform]]s''' of [[Azerbaijan]] is a set of laws designed and adopted by State Commission on Agrarian Reforms since 1995.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ciis.org.cn/english/2016-09/13/content_9030607.htm|title=Economic Diversification in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=China Institute of International Studies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reforms were initiated and implemented to create new ones and modify existing forms of property and give impetus to economic activity. The main objectives of the reforms were to establish property rights on land, create and further develop market economy, provide the country's citizens with local agricultural products and generally, increase standards of living and welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/prgm/cph/experts/azerbaijan/documents/CPdocuments/APLR_countrypaper.az.pdf|title=Azerbaijan Country Paper/ Land Policy Action Plan|last=Nadirov|first=Faig|date=|website=The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background==
Azerbaijan became an independent state in 1991, and during the early years of independence, the main drivers of the government, such as political, social, economic and public sectors were struggling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/Economy/Reforms/reforms_e.html|title=Economic Reforms|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources indicate that the period between 1991 and 1995 can be characterized as the period of "economic chaos".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yesevi|first=Cagla Gul|date=|title=Turkey-Azerbaijan Energy Relations: A Political and Economic Analysis|url=https://www.econjournals.com/index.php/ijeep/article/viewFile/929/556|journal=International Journal of Energy Economics and Policy|volume=5|pages=27–44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened because the country was hit by several problems, such as unstable political situation, military aggression against Azerbaijan and occupation of its territories, internal movement of refugees and consequently, increased unemployment, huge government spending on national defense due to the war in Nagorno-Karabakh area. The breakup of ties between Azerbaijan and foreign markets due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the rise in prices over 17 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/6685/399770ECA0Land101Official0Use0only1.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Land Reform and Farm Restructuring in Transition Countries: The Experience of Bulgaria, Moldova, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan|last=|first=|date=|website=World Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes eventually resulted in the civil war and sharp slowdown in each sector of the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Azerbaijan had lost its connections in the world market, as did all other Soviet states. One of the most important aspects for improvement was the establishment and implementation of new land policies and reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/portal/Economy/Agriculture/agriculture_03_e.html|title=Land Reforms|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main impetus for land reforms was that the population had to be supplied by the agricultural foods and products, and the cheapest way of doing that was developing the local production.

In order to establish the process of economic breakthrough, the special State Commission on Agrarian Reforms was created by decree of the president of the Azerbaijan Republic No. 313 in March 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://republic.preslib.az/en_f1.html|title=Chronology of significant events on the eve of independence and after gaining the independence|last=|first=|date=|website=Presidential Library: Independent Azerbaijan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the reforms. Another special commission was created in December 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/country-profiles/countries-list/land-tenure-and-related-institutions/en/?country_iso3=AZE|title=Azerbaijan: Prevailing systems of land tenure|last=|first=|date=|website=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United States|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main responsibilities of the State Commission on Agrarian Reforms (SCAR) was to design and elaborate the agrarian reform program. This was done through examination of countries experiencing the transition to market economy and carrying out experiments in different sectors of the country. Other responsibilities of SCAR included examination and verification of territorial land reform programmes, providing instructions on how to implement those reforms and informing the population about the progress of the land reform.

== Reforms==
The first period of agricultural reforms covered the years between 1995 and 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Till 2003, more than 50 decree and standard acts were issued by the government and the President of Azerbaijan Republic.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/149532/43288-012-tacr-02.pdf|title=Azerbaijan: Country Assessment on Land Acquisition and Resettlement|last=|first=|date=|website=Asian Development Bank|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws included the following:

– Land Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan approved by Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan of June 25, 1999.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== On the land reform===
This law was signed on July 16, 1996&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and created a foundation for preceding reforms. As stated in the official document, the purpose of the reform is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cis-legislation.com/document.fwx?rgn=2778|title=Law of the Azerbaijan Republic of July 16, 1996 No. 155-IQ|last=|first=|date=|website=CIS Legislation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... creation of the new relations of land ownership on the basis of the principles of economic independence and social equality, development of market economy and entrepreneurial initiative, achievement of economic independence of the country, including providing the population with food, and increase as a result of this material wealth of the Azerbaijani people.&lt;/blockquote&gt;The procedures of the "On the land" reformed were carried out by the State Commission on Agrarian Reforms (SCAR) with its representative in each region, the Regions Commission on Agrarian Reforms (RCAR).  The RARC comprised the Head of the Executive Power of the according region, the officers from State Land Committee, and independent specialists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The land reform specified the allocation of land into state, municipal and private ownership. The first stage included the free-of-charge allocation of part of the land fund of collective and state farms to citizens according to legal documentation.  The main responsibility of the government institutions were to provide the population with the necessary documents for owning the land and to create a list of requirements for obtaining the land. It also outlines the procedures of privatization of lands and the rights of landowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/country-profiles/countries-list/national-legal-framework/land-legislation/en/?country_iso3=AZE|title=Azerbaijan: Land Legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On the land tax===
{{Main|Taxation in Azerbaijan}}
The Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan "On the land tax" determines the rules of calculation, payments, objects and period of the land tax. The lands that are allocated to persons according to the legislation are considered as object for taxation. However, there exist several exemptions for this type of tax – the lands for common use (regardless of who is the owner – an individual or state), the lands which are under the state protection and reserves, the recreational lands, the lands used for the cultural-historical purpose, natural funds (water, wood) engaged in industrial activity and lands that are unusable or of little use, transferred to individuals for agricultural purposes – are exempted from taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxes.gov.az/modul.php?name=qanun&amp;cat=3&amp;lang=_eng|title=The Tax Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Taxes of the Republic of Azerbaijan|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is withheld in the form of lump sum, meaning that regardless of the amount of the economic activity the taxpayers will only pay a fixed amount of tax each year.

=== On state land cadastre, land monitoring and structure===
This law was signed on December 22, 1998&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and it regulates the conduct of state land cadaster, controls the use of land on the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This cadaster is a collection of data considering the registration of land tenure, the quantity and quality of land and their economic estimation. The control of organizational works on lands is crucial, because by this way the government monitors the condition of lands, namely levels of fertility and pollution. By controlling and taking actions in a timely manner, the government can prevent and eliminate the negative consequences of irrational use of land.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aplr.org/conference/en/experts_papers/legal_framework/Legal%20Framework%20of%20the%20Property%20Rights_Az_eng.htm|title=Legislative Sphere of Property Rights in Azerbaijan; Politico-legal Issues of Land Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=Association of Land and Real Estate Professionals|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This law identifies the unified system of documentation for the state land cadastre. This includes the rights of landowners, the certificates on transfer, etc.

=== On land rent===
This reform determines the procedures of renting the land, the required documentations and conditions for the transfer. It also identifies the possible types of transferring the land for the temporary use – short-term and long-term use. The taxes on land, the procedures of payment, the object of taxation and taxpayers are specified in this law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== On the land market===
This law reflects the issues about the land-market relations, the objectives and tasks of the legislation on the land market, the rules and laws concerning the land market, the resolution of disputes, the procedures following the infringement of the legislation, etc. This law specifies natural and legal persons as participants of the land market, and states that they can act in form of tenants, depositors, as well as users of the land. The issues concerning foreigners, international organizations and legal persons have found their reflection in this Law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{Basic Forms of government}}
An '''associated state''' is the minor partner in a formal, free relationship between a political territory with a degree of statehood and a (usually larger) nation, for which no other specific term, such as [[protectorate]], is adopted. The details of such '''free association''' are contained in [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution 1541 (XV) Principle VI,&lt;ref name="resolution 1541 (XV)"&gt;''See'': the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the [[United Nations]] approved [http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf resolution 1541 (XV)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121100604/http://unyearbook.un.org/1960YUN/1960_P1_SEC3_CH4.pdf |date=21 January 2012 }} (pages: 509–510) defining free association with an independent State, integration into an independent State, or independence&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Compact of Free Association]] or [[Associated Statehood Act]] and are specific to the countries involved. In the case of the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]], the details of their free association arrangement are contained in several documents, such as their respective constitutions, the 1983 Exchange of Letters between the governments of [[New Zealand]] and the Cook Islands, and the 2001 Joint Centenary Declaration. Free associated states can be described as independent or not, but free association is not a qualification of an entity's statehood or status as a subject of international law.

Informally it can be considered more widely: from a post-colonial form of [[protectorate| amical protection]], or [[protectorate]], to [[asymmetrical federalism|confederation of unequal members]] when the lesser partner(s) delegate(s) to the major one (often the former colonial power) some authority normally exclusively retained by a sovereign state, usually in such fields as defense and foreign relations, while often enjoying favorable economic terms such as market access.

According to some scholars, a form of association based on benign protection and delegation of sovereignty can be seen as a defining feature of [[microstates]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ams.hi.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Microstates_OccasionalPaper.pdf|title = Microstates as Modern Protected States: Towards a New Definition of Micro-Statehood|last = Dumieński|first = Zbigniew|date = 2014|journal = |accessdate = 20 August 2014|doi = |pmid = |publisher = Centre for Small State Studies|series = Occasional Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[federacy]], a type of government where at least one of the subunits in an otherwise unitary state enjoys autonomy like a subunit within a federation, is similar to an associated state, with such subunit(s) having considerable independence in internal issues, except foreign affairs and defence. Yet in terms of international law{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} it is a completely different situation because the subunits are not independent international entities and have no potential right to independence.

The [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was the first associated state of the [[United States]]. From 1935 to 1946, the foreign affairs and military of the Philippine commonwealth were handled by the United States although it was otherwise constitutionally separate and independent in domestic matters.

The [[Federated States of Micronesia]] (since 1986), the [[Marshall Islands]] (since 1986), and [[Palau]] (since 1994) are associated with the [[United States]] under what is known as the [[Compact of Free Association]], giving the states international [[sovereignty]] and ultimate control over their territory. However, the governments of those areas have agreed to allow the United States to provide defense; the U.S. federal government fund grants an access to U.S. social services for citizens of these areas. The United States benefits from its ability to use the islands as strategic military bases.

[[Tokelau]] (a [[dependent territory]] of [[New Zealand]]) voted on a [[Tokelauan self-determination referendum, 2006|referendum in February 2006]] to determine whether it wanted to remain a New Zealand territory or become the third state in free association with New Zealand. While a majority of voters chose free association, the vote did not meet the two-thirds threshold needed for approval. A repeat [[Tokelauan self-determination referendum, 2007|referendum in October 2007]] under [[United Nations]] supervision yielded similar results, with the proposed free association falling 16 votes short of approval.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10472094"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10472094 |title=Tokelau votes to remain dependent territory of New Zealand |author=Gregory, Angela |date=25 October 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other comparable relationships==
Other situations exist where one state has power over another political unit. A [[dependent territory]] is an example of this, where an area has its own political system and often internal self-government, but does not have overall sovereignty. In a loose form of association, some sovereign states cede some power to other states, often in terms of foreign affairs and/or defence.

The foreign affairs of [[Bhutan]], a Himalayan Buddhist monarchy, were partially handled by the neighbouring republic [[India]] (from 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mea.gov.in/pressrelease/2007/03/treaty.pdf |title=Indo-Bhutan Friendship Treaty }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(30.6&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}})&lt;/ref&gt;), in a loose form of association, although [[Bhutan]] is otherwise constitutionally separate and independent in all other matters. A similar relationship existed between [[Sikkim]] and India from 1950 until 1975, when Sikkim became a state of India.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}

According to a law of the [[Tatarstan|Republic of Tatarstan]] (1990–2000) and the Treaty of Mutual Delegation of Powers between it and the [[Russian Federation]] (1994), from 1994 to 2000 Tatarstan was considered a sovereign state under international law, but associated with Russia.

According to statements of officials of [[Abkhazia]] and [[Transnistria]] ([[List of states with limited recognition|self-proclaimed partially recognized republics]] seceded from the former USSR's constitutive republics of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Moldova]]), both intend after recognition of their independence to become associated states of the Russian Federation. In Transnistria a [[Transnistrian referendum, 2006|referendum took place in September 2006]], in which secession from Moldova and "future free association" with Russia was approved by a margin of 97%, even though the results of the referendum were internationally unrecognized.

==Former Commonwealth associated states==
A formal association existed under the [[Associated Statehood Act 1967]] between the [[United Kingdom]] and the six [[West Indies Associated States]]. These were former British colonies in the [[Caribbean]]: [[Antigua and Barbuda|Antigua]] (1967–1981), [[Dominica]] (1967–1978), [[Grenada]] (1967–1974), [[Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla]] (1967–1983), [[Saint Lucia]] (1967–1979), and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] (1969–1979). Under this arrangement, each state had full control over its [[constitution]]. The United Nations never determined whether these associated states had achieved a full measure of self-government within the meaning of the [[United Nations Charter]] and General Assembly resolutions. Within a few years after the status of associated state was created, all six of the former associated states requested and were granted full independence, except for [[Anguilla]] within the former [[St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla]] union, which separated from the associated state before independence and remains a United Kingdom dependent territory.

==Microstates as modern protected states==
The existence of free relationship based on both delegation of [[sovereignty]] and benign protection can be seen as a defining feature of microstates. According to the definition of microstates proposed by Dumienski (2014): "Microstates are modern protected states, i.e. sovereign states that have been able to unilaterally depute certain attributes of sovereignty to larger powers in exchange for benign protection of their political and economic viability against their geographic or demographic constraints."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Adopting this approach permits separating microstates from both small states and autonomies or dependencies. Microstates understood as modern protected states include such states as [[Bhutan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bedjaoui|first=Mohammed|title=International Law: Achievements and Prospects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrTsNTzcY7EC&amp;pg=PA51|year=1991|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=92-3-102716-6|pages=51–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liechtenstein]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], [[Vatican City]], [[Andorra]], [[Niue]], [[the Cook Islands]], or [[Palau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''''Baasskap''''' was a concept referring to [[white supremacy]] in [[South Africa]] which was used during [[apartheid]].

Proponents of ''baasskap'' (who constituted the largest faction of apartheid ideologues in the National Party, and state institutions) applied segregation in a systematic way, in order to preserve racial purity, and to allow for the domination of Afrikaners in the economic and  political spheres. However, proponents of ''baasskap'' were not opposed to black South African participation in the economy, as long as black labour was controlled in a manner that preserved the economic domination of Afrikaners.&lt;ref name="Kuperus1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=T. Kuperus|title=State, Civil Society and Apartheid in South Africa: An Examination of Dutch Reformed Church-State Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzuJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=7 April 1999|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=978-0-230-37373-0|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent proponents of ''baasskap'' included [[J.G. Strydom]], [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] from 1954 to 1958, and [[C.R. Swart]], Minister of Justice.&lt;ref name="Kuperus1999"/&gt; [[Hendrik Verwoerd]] had sympathy for the "purist" faction of apartheid ideologues, which opposed economic integration of Africans (in contrast to supporters of ''baasskap'' who were more concerned with white domination in an integrated economy).&lt;ref name="Kuperus1999"/&gt; Nonetheless, Verwoerd provided the hitherto crude concept of ''baasskap'' with a veneer of intellectual respectability.&lt;ref name="sparksNews24"/&gt;

According to the Department of State website, the Bureau secures military base access and overflight permission to support the deployment of [[Military of the United States|U.S. military forces]].

The Bureau seeks to create and manage defense relationships with allies of the [[United States]], regulate arms transfers, control access to military technology, and combat the illegal trafficking of small arms or light weapons. It also is responsible for training and equipping international peacekeepers and other military personnel.

The Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement within the Bureau of Political Affairs manages the Humanitarian Mine Action Program and publishes the "SAFE PASSAGE":&lt;ref&gt;https://www.state.gov/t/pm/wra/61833.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A Newsletter for the Humanitarian Mine Action and Small Arms/Light Weapons Communities. The office also publishes "To Walk The Earth In Safety"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/rpt/walkearth/2006/|title=To Walk the Earth in Safety (2006)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a publication that summarizes the current U.S. effort to rid the world of the most pressing land mine and ordnance problems in a country-by-country format. Finally they have published a number of [[press release]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/t/pm/wra/prsrl/|title=Press and Other Releases|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that describe ongoing efforts within those communities and the Office's efforts in support of these aims. The [[United Nations]] Mine Action Centre defines "mine action" as removing [[land mine]]s from the ground, assisting victims, and also teaching people how to protect themselves from danger in environments affected by land mines.

'''Christian Action Research and Education''' ('''CARE''') is a social policy charity based in the [[United Kingdom]], with offices in London, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

==Founding and programmes==
CARE began in 1971 as the [[Nationwide Festival of Light]], but was renamed in 1983 to reflect a substantial shift in emphasis. Over the following decades it established the following departments, in the belief that Christians should show active care as well as campaigning for moral standards in society:&lt;ref name="ourstory"&gt;[http://www.care.org.uk/about/our-story Our Story], CARE. Retrieved 15 December 2011. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218214344/http://www.care.org.uk/about/our-story# |date=2011-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Care for the Family, now independent of CARE as the UK sister ministry of [[Focus on the Family]]&lt;ref name=fundamentalist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.focusonthefamily.com/about/historical-timeline|title=Historical Timeline|website=Focus on the Family|accessdate =17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Care Confidential, which runs pregnancy counselling centres, and became independent in July 2011&lt;ref name=moralagenda&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/28/christain-activists-grab-moral-agenda |title=Christian activists poised to win concessions on abortion after 40 years |newspaper =The Guardian |date=28 August 2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Quinn}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Caring Services (defunct)
*Care for Education (defunct)
*Fostering, long term and remand care (defunct)

CARE also runs the "Leadership Programme", an internship programme securing placements for graduates. Some work as researchers for [[Member of Parliament (UK)|MPs]], mostly in the Conservative party, and [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] while others work in Christian NGOs.&lt;ref name=ourstory/&gt; The funding of political research assistants by a "right-wing Christian" lobby group has attracted controversy, although CARE claims that there is a clear separation between the internships and its lobbying side.&lt;ref name="fundamentalist"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1975933/Christian-fundamentalists-fighting-spiritual-battle-in-Parliament.html|title=Christian fundamentalists fighting spiritual battle in Parliament|last=Modell|first=David|date=17 May 2008|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=15 December 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/god_on_their_side_1_1373136 |title=Anger at minister's Christian intern | newspaper =Times Educational Supplement |date=21 December 2001 | author= Warwick Mansell |author2=Jon Slater |accessdate=15 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike journalists, researchers have virtually unrestricted access to parliamentary documents and in 2008 [[Paul Burstow]] MP was questioned after failing to include a research assistant's CARE sponsorship on the main register -though he said he didn't believe they had behaved improperly.&lt;ref name="indy-2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Merrick|first=Jane|title=Right-wing Christian group pays for Commons researchers|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-rightwing-christian-group-pays-for-commons-researchers-802607.html|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=Independent|date=30 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124091518/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-rightwing-christian-group-pays-for-commons-researchers-802607.html|archivedate=2009-11-24|quote=CARE connections (list of MPs)|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2014-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finance==
CARE's annual income to March 2011 was over £2&amp;nbsp;million, mostly from voluntary donations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1066963 1066963 - CARE (Christian Action Research and Education)], summary on the website of the [[Charity Commission]].

The cost of the intern programme is around £70,000 p.a.&lt;ref name="indy-2008"/&gt; 
It is supported by 40,000 donors.&lt;ref name=scotsman1/&gt;

==Impact==
CARE has been described as "an [[evangelical]] charity that promotes traditional [[family values]]";&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DAUuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c9MEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1258%2C2250277 "In bad taste?"]. (4 October 1988). ''The News-Journal''. p.2A.&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation has actively campaigned against [[LGBT rights]], [[abortion]], [[stem cell research]] and [[Euthanasia|assisted dying]] bills. Its work has been dismissed in the House of Lords as "[[propaganda]]".&lt;ref name="indy-2008" /&gt;

===Opposition to homosexuality, abortion and prostitution===
[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] insiders credited CARE with significant influence in support of [[Section 28]] regarding education and homosexuality.&lt;ref name="indy-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=scotsman1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/god_on_their_side_1_1373136 |title=God on their side? |newspaper =The Scotsman|date= 12 May 2002 |accessdate=15 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CARE has received media criticism for its stance on abortion and homosexuality and was accused in 2000 by MP [[Ben Bradshaw]] of being "a bunch of homophobic bigots".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kamal Ahmed |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/30/religion.uk?mobile-redirect=false |title=Onward Christian lobbyists &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date=2000-07-30 |accessdate=2014-03-18 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Tris Reid-Smith |url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/uk-mp-cuts-ties-christian-gay-%E2%80%98cure%E2%80%99-charity160312 |title=UK MP cuts ties to Christian gay ‘cure’ charity |publisher=Gay Star News |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARE has also been criticised for their opposition to abortion and gay rights by [[Kate Smurthwaite]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' who reported that the organisation sponsored a conference claiming homosexuality could be cured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smurthwaite|first=Kate|title=Anti-abortion CARE and campaigns to MPs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/apr/19/extreme-anti-abortion-groups-infiltrate|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 April 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, CARE sponsored what they described as a "[[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]]" event&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2009/04/26/100-protest-outside-london-gay-cure-conference/ "100 protest outside London 'gay cure' conference"]. ''PinkNews''.&lt;/ref&gt; about homosexuality and promoting [[Reparative therapy|"'gay cure' therapy"]], which CARE billed as "mentoring the sexually broken". The conference also included a keynote speech from [[National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality]] (NARTH) founder Joseph Nicolosi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Booth|first1=Robert|last2=Ball|first2=James|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/13/gay-cure-christian-charity-mps-interns |title='Gay cure' Christian charity funded 20 MPs' interns]|website=The Guardian|date=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside Arthur Goldberg, co-founder of [[Jews Offering New Alternatives to Homosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Patrick McCormick. [http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/07/14/mp-who-took-interns-from-gay-cure-event-sponsor-appointed-as-welsh-secretary/ "MP who took interns from 'gay cure' event sponsor, appointed as Welsh Secretary"]. ''PinkNews''. 14 July 2014, 11:16 PM.&lt;/ref&gt;

CARE have funded the network of [[CareConfidential]] [[crisis pregnancy center|crisis pregnancy centres]] in the UK, some of which came under criticism in an investigation by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' when counsellors were filmed undercover claiming abortions would increase chances of breast cancer and could predispose women to becoming child sexual abusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/10622815/Abortion-scandal-women-told-terminations-increase-chance-of-child-abuse.html |title= Abortion scandal: women told terminations increase chance of child abuse |date=10 February 2014 |newspaper = Daily Telegraph |accessdate=11 February 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CARE are listed in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]'s register of all-party groups as the secretariat of the [[All-party parliamentary group]] (APPG) on Prostitution and the Global Sex Trade, a pressure group to encourage 'government action to tackle individuals who create demand for sexual services'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmallparty/register/prostitution-and-the-global-sex-trade.htm |title=House of Commons - Register Of All-Party Groups as at 28 February 2014: Prostitution and the Global Sex Trade |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, CARE backed a [[private member's bill]] to prohibit the advertising of prostitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.care.org.uk/news/latest-news/time-ban-prostitution-adverts |title=Time to ban prostitution adverts |last1=Mildred |first1=James |last2= |first2= |date=5 Jun 2015 |website=care.org.uk |publisher=Christian Action Research and Education |access-date=8 November 2015 |quote=Leading Christian charity CARE (Christian Action Research &amp; Education) is backing an historic attempt by a senior Peer to ban prostitution adverts from newspapers and online sites across England and Wales.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Advertising of Prostitution (Prohibition) Bill 2015-16, which was introduced by [[Lord McColl of Dulwich]] in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/advertisingofprostitutionprohibition.html |title=Advertising of Prostitution (Prohibition) Bill [HL] 2015-16 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=parliament.uk |publisher=UK Parliament |access-date=5 June 2015 |quote=A Bill to prohibit the advertising of prostitution; and for connected purposes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other campaigns===
CARE's 2010 report on taxation claimed that the tax burden had moved from single people with no dependants into families with two adults but only a single earner in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economicvoice.com/christian-charity-care-claims-single-earner-families-worst-off-in-uk/50017150 |title=Christian charity claims single earner families worst off in UK |date=7 March 2011 |first=Jeff |last=Taylor |newspaper=Economic Voice |accessdate=15 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65TbblZlx?url=http://www.economicvoice.com/christian-charity-care-claims-single-earner-families-worst-off-in-uk/50017150 |archivedate=15 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Voice''/''Vote'') is a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[list of political parties in Croatia|political party]] in [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/foto-u-dvorani-wow-osnovana-stranka-glas-za-seficu-izabrana-anka-mrak-taritas-evo-tko-je-sve-iz-drugih-stranaka-dosao-ma-konvenciju/6347797/ |title=FOTO: U DVORANI 'WOW' OSNOVANA STRANKA 'GLAS' Za šeficu izabrana Anka Mrak Taritaš, evo tko je sve iz drugih stranaka došao ma konvenciju - Jutarnji List |publisher=Jutarnji.hr |date=2017-06-14 |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Petra Mlačić/Vijesti.hr |url=http://www.vijesti.rtl.hr/novosti/hrvatska/2695971/bivsi-hns-ovci-osnovali-glas-zelimo-okupiti-ljude-kojima-su-se-izbori-i-politika-zgadili/ |title=Bivši HNS-ovci osnovali GLAS: 'Želimo okupiti ljude kojima su se izbori i politika zgadili' — Vijesti.hr |publisher=Vijesti.rtl.hr |date= |accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The party was founded by four former [[Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats|Croatian People's Party]] (HNS) MP's led by [[Anka Mrak Taritaš]] who were dissatisfied with HNS entering a coalition with the conservative [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and supporting [[Cabinet of Andrej Plenković]] since June 2017.

==History==
The Party's founding congress was held on 9 July 2017, while it was officially registered with the [[Ministry of Public Administration (Croatia)|Ministry of Public Administration]] on 26 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scontent.fzag1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/20525367_260284281156768_1243589449038002763_n.jpg?oh=58a9b334ea1cda6bf9d01fee366cdb91&amp;oe=59F17CDF] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glas automatically became a parliamentary party with four MP's, making it the fifth largest party in the country in terms of parliamentary representation. In addition, [[Jozo Radoš]] also left HNS and joined Glas, so the party also has one [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]]. Radoš sits in the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group]].

Another notable member is [[Vesna Pusić]].

On 1 December 2017 the party was admitted into the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party]] as an affiliate member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aldeparty.eu/news/alde-welcomes-new-member-parties|title=ALDE welcomes new member parties|website=Aldeparty.eu|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
Party president Mrak-Taritaš described Glas as "a modern, progressive, trans-ideological party in the left center, acceptable to people who are liberal, social-liberal and social-democratic." Party's emphasis will be placed on individual freedoms and rights, stable institutions and diversity as a comparative advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novilist.hr:8090/index.php/Vijesti/Hrvatska/MRAK-TARITAS-U-AKCIJI-Bivsi-HNS-ovci-sutra-i-formalno-osnivaju-novu-stranku-otkrili-na-koga-ciljaju?meta_refresh=true|title=MRAK TARITAŠ U AKCIJI Bivši HNS-ovci sutra i formalno osnivaju novu stranku, otkrili na koga ciljaju|website=Novilist.hr|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">The '''clerk''', '''chief clerk''', or '''secretary''' of a [[legislative chamber]] is the senior administrative officer responsible for ensuring that its business runs smoothly. This may encompass keeping custody of documents [[Laying before the house|lain before the house]], received, or produced; making records of proceedings; allocating office space; enrolling of members, and administering an [[oath of office]]. The clerk in some cases has a ceremonial role. A clerk may also advise the [[speaker (politics)|speaker]] or members on [[parliamentary procedure]], acting in American parlance as a "[[Parliamentarian (consultant)|parliamentarian]]". 

In the [[Westminster system]], the clerk is usually an apolitical [[civil servant]], and typically attains the position through promotion and retains it until retirement.  

In the United States, while clerks are usually [[nonpartisan]], they are often elected by the assembly members at the beginning of each term. At the federal level, and typically at state level, the lower house has a "(chief) clerk" while the upper house has a "secretary".

{{PoliticsUK}}
The '''Court of St James's''' is the [[Court (royal)|royal court]] for the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Sovereign]] of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=SJP_Hist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/History.aspx |title=History of St. James's Palace | publisher=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |date=August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/History.aspx |archive-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[Ambassador]]s and [[High Commissioner]]s to the United Kingdom are formally received by the Court, and all Ambassadors and High Commissioners from the United Kingdom are formally accredited from the Court—not the United Kingdom—as they are representatives of [[The Crown]].&lt;ref name=SJP_Hist/&gt;  However it should be noted that this accreditation is only in relation to the Crown in right of the United Kingdom, not the Crown in right of any other [[Commonwealth realm]], each of which have their own diplomatic services to represent the monarch in Her role as sovereign of each such country.

The [[Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps]] (before 1920, [[Master of the Ceremonies]]), who acts as the link between the British monarch and foreign diplomatic missions, is permanently based at [[St James's Palace]].&lt;ref name=StJamessPalace /&gt; In 1886, there were only six Ambassadors in London, with 37 other countries represented by Ministers.&lt;ref name=Ambassadors&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Audiences/Ambassadorscredentials.aspx |title=Ambassadors' credentials | publisher=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |date=August 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/RoyalEventsandCeremonies/Audiences/Ambassadorscredentials.aspx |archive-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, this had increased to 175 foreign missions accredited to the Court of St James's:&lt;ref name=GOVuk01&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk |title=Foreign embassies in the UK | publisher=UK Government |date=January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 47 [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissions]] from [[Commonwealth countries]] and 128 embassies from non-Commonwealth countries.&lt;ref name=GOVuk01/&gt;

Official meetings and receptions associated with the court, such as [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] meetings or the annual Diplomatic Reception attended by 1,500 guests, are held wherever the monarch is in residence&amp;nbsp;– usually Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref name=BuckinghamPalace /&gt;

==Name==
The court is named after [[St James's Palace]], hence the ''{{'}}s'' at the end of the name. This is because St James's Palace is the most senior royal palace&lt;ref name=StJamessPalace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/Today.aspx |title=St. James's Palace | publisher=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |date=August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/StJamessPalace/Today.aspx |archive-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has remained the official residence of the [[British Monarchy]]&lt;ref name=SJP_Hist /&gt; despite the nearby [[Buckingham Palace]] becoming the main [[London]] residence of all the British sovereigns since the accession of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1837.&lt;ref name=StJamessPalace/&gt;&lt;ref name=BuckinghamPalace&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx |title=Buckingham Palace | publisher=The Official Website of the British Monarchy |date=August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309035640/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/BuckinghamPalace/BuckinghamPalace.aspx |archive-date=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the court's name is spoken, it is sometimes incorrectly identified as the ''Court of St James'', without a separate "iz" pronunciation for the possessive '''s'' suffix.&lt;ref name="You say St James', I say St James's.

'''Creole people''' are [[ethnic group]]s which originated during the [[Colonial era|colonial-era]] from [[racial mixing]] between [[European peoples|European]]s and non-European peoples, known as [[creolisation]]. These groups are typically descended from [[White people|White]] Western European [[settler colony|colonial settlers]], [[West African]] [[Slavery|slaves]], [[Haitians]] and [[indigenous people]]s of the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]]. Creole peoples vary widely in ethnic background and mixture, and many have since developed distinct [[ethnic identity|ethnic identities]]. The development of [[creole languages]] is attributed to, but independent of, the [[ethnogenesis|emergence]] of creole ethnic identities.

==Etymology and overview==
The [[English language|English]] word ''creole'' derives from the [[French language|French]] ''créole'', which in turn came from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''crioulo'', a [[diminutive]] of ''cria'' meaning a person (especially a [[servant]]) raised in one's house. ''Cria'' is derived from ''criar'', meaning "to raise or bring up,", itself derived from the [[Latin]] ''creare'', meaning "to make, bring forth, produce, beget".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etymonline.com/word/creole&lt;/ref&gt; Creole is also known by [[cognate]]s in other languages, such as crioulo, criollo, creolo, créole, kriolu, criol, kreyol, kreol, kriol, krio, and kriyoyo.

The following [[ethnic groups]] have been historically characterized as "creole" peoples:
* [[Afro-Brazilian|Afro-Brazilian Crioulos]]
* [[Aku people|Aku Krio people]]
* [[Atlantic Creole]]s
* [[Belizean Kriol people]]
* [[Cape Verdeans]] (Crioulos)
* [[Criollo people]] (European diaspora born in Spanish Colonial Americas)
* [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandino Creole peoples]]
* [[Haitian Creole people]] 
**[[Affranchi]]s
* [[Afro-Honduran#Creoles|Afro-Honduran Creoles]]
* [[Americo-Liberian|Liberian Creole people]]
* [[Louisiana Creole people]] 
**[[Creoles of color]]
* [[Mauritian Creole people]]
* [[Nigerian Creoles|Nigerian Creole people]]
* [[Seychellois Creole people]]
* [[Sierra Leone Creole people]]
* [[Surinamese Creole people]]

== United States ==

=== Alaska ===
People of mixed [[Alaska Native]] American and Russian ancestry are Creole, sometimes colloquially spelled "Kriol". The intermingling of ''[[promyshlenniki]]'' men with [[Aleut people|Aleut]] and [[Alutiiq]] women in the late 18th century gave rise to a people who assumed a prominent position in the economy of Russian Alaska and the north Pacific rim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rocinak.sasktelwebsite.net/roc/creole.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724054518/http://rocinak.sasktelwebsite.net/roc/creole.htm |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chesapeake Colonies ===
{{Main article|Chesapeake Colonies}}During the early settlement of the colonies, children born of immigrants in the colonies were often referred to as "Creole". This is found more often in the Chesapeake Colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=387JNEjpczQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 |title=First Generations: Women in Colonial America |author=Carol Berkin |page=9 |website=Books.google.com |date= 1997-07|accessdate=2016-10-03|isbn=9780809016068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Louisiana ===
{{Main article|Louisiana Creole people|Creoles of color}}
In the [[United States]], the word "Creole" refers to people of any race or mixture thereof who are descended from colonial French [[La Louisiane]] and colonial Spanish [[Louisiana (New Spain)]] settlers before the Louisiana region became part of the United States in 1803 with the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Both the word and the ethnic group derive from a similar usage, which began in the 16th Century, in the Caribbean that distinguished people born in the French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies from the various new arrivals born in their respective, non-Caribbean homelands.  Some writers from other parts of the country have mistakenly assumed the term to refer only to people of mixed racial descent, but this is not the traditional [[Louisiana]] usage. In Louisiana, originally Creole was only used to describe people of French and then Spanish descent who were born in Louisiana and used the term to distinguish themselves from newly arrived immigrants. Later, the terms were differentiated further after the emergence of a newly mixed-race group that began to share the usage of the identity, as well as newly arriving Anglo-Americans lumping whites, mixed and blacks into a general francophone "Creole" cultural group. The later distinctions were French Creole (European ancestry), Creole of Color (someone of mixed racial ancestry), and sometimes slaves were referred to as Black Creole (meaning someone of primarily African descendant). There were also Spanish Creoles, but most in the city of New Orleans were integrated into the French Creole group as time went on, and ultimately both origins formed an indistinguishable "Latin" combination. However, Spanish Creoles survive today in Louisiana just outside of the city of New Orleans as the [[Isleños]] and Malagueños, both found in southern Louisiana. These distinctions were of the various groups in the Creole culture of Louisiana, especially that of New Orleans. Formally, in the early years of New Orleans, whites of French and Spanish descent were defined as the White Creoles and mixed racial people were described as free people of color and slaves were described as Creole slaves, meaning a possession of the Creoles (full European descent). However, all racial categories of Creoles - from Caucasian, mixed racial, African, to Native American - tended to think and refer to themselves solely as Creole, a commonality in many other [[Francophone]] and [[Iberoamerican]] cultures, who tend to lack strict racial separations common in [[United States History]] and other countries with large populations from [[Northern Europe]]'s various cultures. This more racially neutral quality still persists to modern day as many Creoles do not use race as factor for being a part of the ethno-culture. 

Contemporary usage has broadened the meaning of [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creoles]] to describe a broad cultural group of people of all races who share a French and Spanish background. Louisianans who identify themselves as "Creole" are most commonly from historically [[French language|Francophone]] and [[Hispanic]] communities. Some of their ancestors came to Louisiana directly from [[France]], [[Spain]] and others came via the French and Spanish colonies in the [[Caribbean]] and Canada. Many Louisiana Creole families arrived in Louisiana from [[Saint-Domingue]] as refugees from the [[Haitian Revolution]], along with other immigrants from Caribbean colonial centers like [[Santo Domingo]] and [[Havana]]. The center of Creole culture in Louisiana is now focused on a combination between the two European based cultures, along with the Native American and African influences brought on through the centuries. 

Spoken Creole is dying with the dissolution of Creole families and  continued 'Americanization' in the area. Most remaining Creole [[lexemes]] have drifted into popular culture. Traditional French Creole is spoken among those families determined to keep the language alive or in regions below New Orleans around St. James and St. John Parishes where German immigrants originally settled (also known as 'the German Coast', or La Côte des Allemands) and cultivated the land, keeping the ill-equipped French Colonists from starvation during the Colonial Period and adopting commonly spoken French and Creole French (arriving with the exiles) as a language of trade.

Creoles are largely Roman Catholic and influenced by traditional French and Spanish culture left from the first Colonial Period, officially beginning in 1722 with the arrival of the [[Ursulines|Ursuline Nuns]], who were preceded by another order, the sisters of the Sacred Heart, with whom they lived until their first convent could be built with monies from the French Crown. (Both orders still educate girls in 2010). The "fiery Latin temperament" described by early scholars on New Orleans culture made sweeping generalizations to accommodate Creoles of Spanish heritage as well as the original French.  The mixed race creoles, descendants of mixing of European colonists, slaves and Native Americans or sometimes 'Gens de Couleur' (free men and women of colour), began during the colonial periods with the arrival of slave populations. All Creoles, regardless of race, are a group of collective cultures known as "Creole", though many non-Louisianans do not distinguish between the two groups Creole groups, those of full European descent and those of mixed race. They do not recognize the distinctions made in the New Orleans area between the original white colonists whose offspring were the original first born Creoles in Louisiana and those that were a mixture of people of European ancestry and slave populations (or free men and women of color).

They were also referred to as 'criollos', a word from the Spanish language meaning "created" and used in the post-French governance period to distinguish the two groups of New Orleans area and down river Creoles. Both mixed race and European Creole groups share many traditions and language, but their socio-economic roots differed in the original period of Louisiana history. Actually the French word Creole is derived from the Portuguese  word Crioulo, which described Spaniards born in the Americas as opposed to Spain.

The term is also often used to mean simply "pertaining to the [[New Orleans]] area".

Louisianians descended from the French [[Acadians]] of Canada are technically creoles in a strict sense but are more commonly referred to as, and identify as, '[[Cajuns]]' - a derivation of the word Acadian, indicating French Canadian settlers as ancestors. The distinction between "Cajuns" and "Creoles" is stronger today than it was in the past because American racial ideologies have strongly influenced the meaning of the word "Creole" to the extent that there is no longer unanimous agreement among Louisianians on the word's precise definition. Today, many assume that any francophone person of European descent is Cajun and any francophone of African descent is Creole—a false assumption that would not have been recognized in the nineteenth century. Some assert that "Creole" refers to aristocratic urbanites whereas "Cajuns" are agrarian members of the francophone working class, but this is another untrue distinction. Creoles may be of any race and live in any area, rural or urban. The Creole culture of Southwest Louisiana is thus more similar to the culture dominant in Acadiana than it is to the Creole culture of New Orleans. Though the land areas overlap around New Orleans and down river, Cajun/Creole culture and language extend westward all along the southern coast of Louisiana, concentrating in areas southwest of New Orleans around Lafayette, and as far as Crowley, Abbeville and into the rice belt of Louisiana nearer Lake Charles and the Texas border.

The parishes of Pointe Coupee, Evangeline and Avoyelles are largely Creole, although many inhabitants self-identify as "Cajun" despite lacking Acadian ancestry. Today, the Parish of Avoyelles probably has one of the largest percentages of French Creole descendants in its population, according to www.avoyelles.com

=== Mississippi ===
Mississippi Gulf Coast has a significant population of Creoles -especially in Pass Christian, Gulfport, Biloxi, Pascagoula, and surrounding areas. Here, Creole is used to describe descendants of French or Spanish colonists with a mixed racial heritage -French or Spanish mixed with African American or Native American.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-living/2012/04/creoletown_name_racial_identit.html&lt;/ref&gt; The area was first settled by French colonists. In 1720, the capital of French Louisiana was Biloxi, MS.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biloxi,_Mississippi&lt;/ref&gt; A community known as Creoletown is located in Pascagoula, MS -with it's history on record.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.gulflive.com/mississippi-press-living/2012/04/creoletown_name_racial_identit.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many in this location are Catholic and have also used Creole/French and English languages. 

=== Texas ===
Texas Gulf Coast have a significant population of Creole mostly in Southeast Texas areas such as ([[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], [[Port Arthur, Texas|Port Arthur]], and [[Orange, Texas|Orange]]). Southwestern Louisiana Creole language is mostly spoken in [[Southeast Texas|Southeastern Texas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html|title=French Creole Heritage|publisher=Laheritage.org|date=|accessdate=April 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830084559/http://www.laheritage.org/CreoleHeritage/index.html|archive-date=August 30, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Africa ==

=== Portuguese Africa ===

The ''crioulos'' of mixed Portuguese and African descent eventually gave rise to several major ethnic groups in Africa, especially in [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[São Tomé e Príncipe]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] (especially [[Annobon Province]]), [[Ziguinchor]] ([[Casamance]]), [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]]. Only a few of these groups have retained the name ''crioulo'' or variations of it:

* [[Cape Verde]]
: the dominant ethnic group, called ''Kriolus'' or ''Kriols'' in the local language; the language itself is also called "[[Cape Verdean Creole|Creole]]";
* [[Guinea-Bissau]]
: ''Crioulos''
* [[São Tomé and Príncipe]]
: ''Crioulos''

== Brazil ==

{{see also|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}  

In Brazil, the word ''crioulo'' initially denoted persons of Portuguese parentage who were born in Brazil (as distinct from colonists who were born in Portugal), as was the case in Portuguese-speaking Africa. During [[Slavery in Brazil|the slavery years]], it eventually came to denote a person of primarily African ancestry born in Brazil. In colonial Brazil, it was common to refer to a Brazilian-born slave as a ''crioulo,'' whereas slaves from Africa were known as "Africans". ''Crioulo'' was used to refer to slaves born and raised in Brazil. Later, ''crioulos'' was used to refer to all people of African ancestry in Brazil, where many people were of mixed ethnicity. In modern-day Brazil, the word is considered pejorative in similar context to the [[Nigger|N-word]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aulete.com.br/crioulo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Former Spanish colonies ==

In regions that were formerly colonies of [[Spain]], the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''[[criollo people|criollo]]'' (implying "native" or "local") historically denoted a class in the [[Casta|colonial caste system]], comprising people born in the colonies but of totally or at least largely [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent. The word came to refer to things distinctive of the region, as it is used today, in expressions such as "comida criolla" ("country" food from the area).

In the period of initial settlement of Latin America, the Spanish crown often passed over Criollos for the top military, administrative, and religious offices in the colonies in favor of the Spanish-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'' (literally "born in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]").

The word ''criollo'' is the origin and cognate of the French word ''creole''.

=== Spanish America ===
The racially based caste system was in force throughout the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the Americas]], since the 16th century. By the 19th century, this discrimination and the example of the [[American Revolution]] and the ideals of [[the Enlightenment]] eventually led the Spanish American Criollo elite to rebel against the Spanish rule. With the support of the lower classes, they engaged Spain in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] (1810–1826), which ended with the break-up of former Spanish Empire in America into a number of independent republics.

=== Spanish Philippines ===
Racial mixture in the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]] occurred mostly during the Spanish colonial period from the 16th to 19th century. The same Spanish racial caste system imposed in Latin America extended also to the Philippines, with a few major differences.
 
Persons of pure Spanish descent born in the Spanish Philippines were those to whom the term ''Filipinos'' originally applied, though they were also called '''[[Criollo people|Insulares]]''' ("islanders", i.e. Spaniard born in the Philippine islands) or '''Criollos''' ("Creoles", i.e. [Philippine-born Spaniard] "Locals"). Persons of pure Spanish descent, along with many mestizos and castizos, living in the Philippines but born in Spanish America were classified as 'Américanos'. The Philippine-born children of 'Américanos' were classified as 'Filipinos'. During this era, the term "Filipinos" had not yet extended to include the majority indigenous Austronesian population of the Philippines to whom Filipinos has now shifted to imply.  

The [[social stratification]] based on class that continues to this day in the Philippines has its beginnings in the Spanish colonial era with this caste system. Officially, however, the Spanish colonial caste system based on race was abolished after the Philippines' independence from Spain in 1898, and the word 'Filipino' expanded to include the entire population of the Philippines regardless of racial ancestry.

== Caribbean ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
In many parts of the [[Southern Caribbean]], the term Creole people is used to refer to the mixed-race descendents of Europeans and Africans born in the islands. Over time, there was intermarriage with residents from Asia as well. They eventually formed a common culture based on their experience of living together in islands colonized by the French, Spanish and English.

A typical creole person from the Caribbean has French or Spanish ancestry, mixed with African and Native American. As workers from Asia entered the islands, Creole people of color intermarried with Tamil, Lebanese, Indian and Chinese. The latter combinations were especially common in Guadeloupe. The foods and cultures are the result of a creolization of these influences.{{Cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Languages ===
{{See also|Languages of the Caribbean|Creole language}}

Creole, "Kreyòl" or "Kweyol" also refers to the [[creole languages]] in the Caribbean, including [[Antillean Creole]], [[Barbadian Creole]], [[Belizean Creole]], [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Haitian Creole]], [[Bahamian Creole]], [[Trinidadian Creole]], [[Guyanese Creole]], and among others.

People speak Antillean Creole on the following islands:
St. Lucia,
Martinique,
Dominica,
Guadeloupe,
St. Martin,
Saint-Barthélemy,
French Guiana,
and Trinidad &amp; Tobago.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Indian Ocean==

{{see also|Mauritian Creole |Réunion Creole|Seychellois Creole}}
The usage of creole in the islands of the southwest of the Indian Ocean varies according to the island. In [[Mauritius]], the term Creole refers to [[people of color|colored people]] which have the ancestry of Africans with some French &amp; Indian blood. The term also indicates the same to the people of [[Réunion]] and [[Seychelles]].&lt;ref name="chaudenson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Chaudenson |title=Creolization of Language and Culture |isbn=978-0-203-44029-2|publisher=CRC press |page=11 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In all three societies, creole also refers to the new languages derived from French and incorporating other languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18526">'''Education inequality in China''' exists on multiple levels, with significant disparities occurring along gender, geographical, and ethnic divides. More specifically, disparities exist in the distribution of educational resources nationwide, as well as the availability of education on levels ranging from basic to higher education.

== History after 1949 ==
{{Main|History of education in China}}Shortly after the [[Chinese Revolution of 1949]], the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] government was confronted with heavy educational disparities across the nation. In the years following the Chinese Revolution, the Chinese government attempted to address these disparities with alternating approaches, creating periods of differing emphasis on opposing educational models. The first model, based on egalitarianism, emphasizes equality across regions of varying economic wealth and development. Conversely, the second model, based on competition, emphasizes individualistic competition, rationalizing any existing educational disparities as a necessary sacrifice for national economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://personal.psc.isr.umich.edu/yuxie-web/files/pubs/Hannum-Xie1994.pdf|title = Trends in educational gender inequality in China: 1949-1985|last = Hannum|first = Emily|date = 1994|journal = Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Xie|first2 = Yu|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese government also focused educational policies on higher education and specialized training, leaving basic education underdeveloped throughout large parts of the country. Government funding for education was reserved for urban areas; rural communities, already at an economic disadvantage, were left to fund their own schools, exacerbating the already existing divide between urban and rural education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When [[People's commune|collectivization]] policies passed in 1955, placing rural families into agricultural cooperatives that distributed income on the basis of labor hours, the importance of education dropped even further within these rural communities, and they were much less likely to fund primary education for the children of their communities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Also beginning in the 1950s, the ''[[Hukou system|hukou]]'' [[Hukou system|system]] assigned the Chinese population into urban and rural regions, exacerbating continuously worsening inequalities within health, employment, housing, and education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Further complicating education policy, people of rural-''hukou'' status are able to live and work in urban areas without changing their ''hukou'' designation. According to Xiaogang Wu's tabulation, based on figures from the 2000 Chinese Census, an estimated 33% of city residents were actually designated as rural-''hukou'' holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economic transition, school expansion and educational inequality in China, 1990–2000|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027656241000003X|journal = Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|date = 2010-03-01|pages = 91–108|volume = 28|series = New Directions in Education Transitions Research|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.rssm.2009.12.003|first = Xiaogang|last = Wu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant shift in education finance policy occurred in 1982 with the introduction of decentralization, in which provincial governments were now individually in control of financing education within their region. The change in policy sought to capitalize on rapid income growth by funding education from non-governmental sources, and in the 1980s and 1990s, the government share of education expenditures dropped even as total education expenditures increased.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Unequal China: The political economy and cultural politics of inequality|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cr8jijWHOOUC|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-05-07|isbn = 9781136229985|first = Wanning|last = Sun|first2 = Yingjie|last2 = Guo}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, families had to pay increased tuition and fees, and schools turned to surcharges and social contributions to fund themselves.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Education for children of poorer families was only attainable with state subsidies, which often did not reach the families who were most in need. Tuition and fees also increase as students move from lower to higher grade levels, so even if these poorer students were able to move through the education system, many were prevented from even completing their compulsory education by economic barriers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, this shift to a wider financial base for education also coincided with rising interprovincial inequality, significantly impairing education opportunities for children in poorly developed rural provinces.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Geography and educational inequality in China|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X06000289|journal = China Economic Review|date = 2006-01-01|pages = 253–265|volume = 17|series = Symposium on Inequality, Market Development, and Sources of Growth in China under Accelerating ReformTechnology, Human Capital, and Economic Development|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.chieco.2006.04.003|first = Emily|last = HANNUM|first2 = Meiyan|last2 = WANG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although basic education policies remain in control of the Communist Party, increased open-mindedness shown by party authorities indicates the possibility of more substantial educational reform, in addition to recent reforms to the national college entrance examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chinese Education Since 1949: Academic and Revolutionary Models|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=piC0BQAAQBAJ|publisher = Elsevier|date = 2014-05-19|isbn = 9781483188904|first = Theodore Hsi-en|last = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although educational inequality has lessened overall, great gaps in educational attainment still exist between populations on multiple divides, affirming the need for a regional focus within reform initiatives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Gender stratification ===
Although recent studies have shown reductions in gender inequality within Chinese education since the 1980s, disparities still remain across different regions of China. Studies have indicated that education in rural areas of China shows significantly greater gender disparity than education in urban areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An analysis of education inequality in China|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059314000273|journal = International Journal of Educational Development|date = 2014-07-01|pages = 2–10|volume = 37|doi = 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2014.03.002|first = Jun|last = Yang|first2 = Xiao|last2 = Huang|first3 = Xin|last3 = Liu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, the rural illiteracy rate of females has consistently been over twice that of males, despite an overall decrease in illiteracy in rural regions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

However, with rapid economic growth, the increase of parental income enables more children to obtain at least a basic education, and this greatly increases chances of girls going to school as well. Previously, it was common for parents to prioritize the education of sons over that of their daughters; with greater opportunities, the demand for female education can be easier satisfied, fueling an increase in the actual demand for female education as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender Inequality in Education in China: A Meta-Regression Analysis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/coep.12006/abstract|journal = Contemporary Economic Policy|date = 2014-04-01|issn = 1465-7287|pages = 474–491|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/coep.12006|first = Junxia|last = Zeng|first2 = Xiaopeng|last2 = Pang|first3 = Linxiu|last3 = Zhang|first4 = Alexis|last4 = Medina|first5 = Scott|last5 = Rozelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographical stratification ===
There are a number of factors that contribute to the existing disparities between urban and rural education, with the latter lagging far behind the former as a result of economic, social, and political disparities. In China, the household registration system separates citizens into urban residence and rural residence. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu|first=Y|date=2008|title=Does “hukou” still matter? The household registration system and its impact on social stratification and mobility in China|url=|journal=Social Sciences in China|volume=29|pages=56-75|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;The underfunding of rural schools, inadequate government efforts to provide financial aid for rural students, and the current household registration system all contribute to the urban-rural educational divide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Interprovincial inequality in school funding has increased, along with increased dependence in non-budgeted funding sources.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Research indicates that the disparity between provincial primary educational expenditures per student nearly doubled between 1990 and 2000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additionally, while overall illiteracy rates have dropped since 1980, the disparity between urban and rural illiteracy rates continued to increase, with the rural illiteracy rate double that of urban areas in 2000.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Spatial inequality in education and health care in China|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043951X05000179|journal = China Economic Review|date = 2005-01-01|pages = 189–204|volume = 16|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.chieco.2005.02.002|first = Xiaobo|last = ZHANG|first2 = Ravi|last2 = KANBUR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recent problem causing regional education disparity is the migration of a large portion of China's rural population into urban areas.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In many rural regions, particularly within smaller rural towns, this decrease in population also creates problems for schools. As a result, to confront drastic increases in enrollment, many schools consolidate students of multiple grade levels into multigrade classes, a practice that not only challenges teachers, but also negatively affects the quality of education that students receive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

As a result of the vast numbers of rural workers migrating to the cities to find employment opportunities, many children are left behind, keeping these children in rural schools that still lag far behind their urban counterparts. For rural children who do follow their parents to urban areas, the ''hukou'' system bars them from attending urban public schools; these children often must attend private schools that charge higher tuition even while offering subpar education.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Ethnic stratification ===
The population of China mainly consists of the [[Han Chinese|Han]] ethnic majority, with 55 [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] accounting for around 8% of the total population. However, this small minority population accounts for almost half of China's absolute poor, highlighting the severe income inequality that exists between China's majority Han population and numerous minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Poverty and Inequality among Chinese Minorities - By A.S. Bhalla and Shufang Qiu|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8411.2007.193_15.x/abstract|journal = Asian-Pacific Economic Literature|date = 2007-05-01|issn = 1467-8411|pages = 83–84|volume = 21|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8411.2007.193_15.x|first = Ding|last = Sai}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, research indicates that minority education attainment in urban areas, such as Beijing, is on par with Han population attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasmath|first=Reza|date=2007|title=The Paradox of Ethnic Minority Development in Beijing|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913307x233700|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=6|issue=4|pages=466|doi=10.1163/156913307X233700|issn=1569-1330}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While overall enrollment rates have risen for both the Han Chinese population and the Chinese minority population, minority enrollment rates remain lower than that of the Han majority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Educational stratification by ethnicity in China: Enrollment and attainment in the early reform years|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1353/dem.2002.0005|journal = Demography|date = 2002-02-01|issn = 0070-3370|pages = 95–117|volume = 39|issue = 1|doi = 10.1353/dem.2002.0005|first = Emily|last = Hannum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from enrollment rates, ethnic disparities in education have also manifested in the form of cultural marginalization, especially with the emergence of state-sponsored curriculum that enforces assimilation. To preserve individual cultures and languages, many ethnic groups have created multilingual school systems.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Minority Education in China: Balancing Unity and Diversity in an Era of Critical Pluralism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ybAaAgAAQBAJ|publisher = Hong Kong University Press|date = 2014-02-04|isbn = 9789888208135|first = James|last = Leibold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of education inequality ==
Education heavily influences social and economic mobility, with research indicating that higher levels of parental education positively influence their children's levels of education. This connection is especially significant within rural communities, with education playing a large role in breaking the vicious cycle of poverty.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rising Inequality in China: Challenges to a Harmonious Society|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0dCaAAAAQBAJ|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-10-31|isbn = 9781107002913|first = Shi|last = Li|first2 = Hiroshi|last2 = Sato|first3 = Terry|last3 = Sicular}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Guangjie Ning's contrasting analysis of existing research suggests that income inequality and education equality are mutually reinforcing factors, perpetuating a vicious cycle of their own. Therefore, by Ning's logic, in accordance with the popular perception of education as a means of escape from poverty, children from poorer families theoretically need education the most, yet encounter greater economic barriers that prevent continuation of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Can educational expansion improve income inequality?

== Current education policy ==
{{Main|Education in China}}Currently, variations in education policy across different levels of schooling continue to contribute to educational inequality. Even within the same region, school attendance and tuition are regulated differently, often causing confusion for families new to the education system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
[[File:补课.png|thumb|A typical high school classroom in China.]]
Beginning in the early 1980s, grades 1-6 have been designated as compulsory education; it was not until the mid-1990s that grades 7-9 were also designated as compulsory.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This regulation of earlier education was enhanced by the elimination of tuition for grades 1-9 in the early 2000s, and in recent years, the poor are now able to obtain subsidies for the education of their children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This system of 9 year compulsory education has been partially successful in rural areas, with regions reporting very high primary-level enrollment and completion rates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Basic education in China’s rural areas: a legal obligation or an individual choice?|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059303001111|journal = International Journal of Educational Development|date = 2004-01-01|pages = 5–21|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ijedudev.2003.09.001|first = Fengshu|last = Liu}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, grades 10-12 have not been designated as compulsory, and high secondary-level dropout rates break the 9 year compulsory education cycle even earlier.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Additionally, in rural areas, the tuition for public high school is comparatively higher than that of most other developing countries, further discouraging rural households from focusing their income on upper secondary education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additionally, as a result of China’s large population, college enrollment slots are still restricted in availability, with tuition so high that the costs far dwarf the income of a typical family in poverty. Recent efforts to expand college education availability, coupled with increasing emphasis on scholarships and loans, may help counter rising tuition costs (and other income-related barriers to higher education).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite tuition challenges, more and more students have been able to graduate from college, with the number of college graduates quadrupling in the past decade.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|title = China’s Education Gap|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/05/opinion/sunday/chinas-education-gap.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2014-09-04|access-date = 2015-11-20|issn = 0362-4331|first = Helen|last = Gao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an attempt to level the playing field, the ''[[National Higher Education Entrance Examination|gaokao]]'', or Chinese university examination, offered extra points for students of ethnic minority backgrounds, although this was scaled back in recent 2014 reforms to national examination policy after multiple cases of ethnicity alteration prompted national backlash.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The new reforms also included provisions for provincial quotas, requiring universities to reserve a designated number of admission seats for students from outside of the university’s region.&lt;ref&gt;Burkhoff, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10977">The '''Eger Bloodbath''' was the culmination of an internal purge in the army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. On 25 February 1634, a group of Irish and Scottish officers acting under the approval of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]] assassinated [[generalissimo]] [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] and a group of his companions in the town of [[Cheb|Eger]] (today Cheb, [[Czech Republic]]). The assassins were equated to executioners by a royal decree and rewarded with property confiscated from the families of their victims. The purge continued through the persecution of other high-ranking military personnel who were seen as Wallenstein's supporters.

[[File:Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt - Portrait of the Duke of Wallenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|Portrait of Wallenstein by [[Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt]].]]
[[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] was born on 24 September 1584, into the noble Bohemian [[Waldstein family]]. On 28 August 1599, he enrolled into the [[University of Altdorf]] but was soon expelled due to his involvement in brawls. He spent the next couple of years traveling around Europe. In 1604, he enlisted as an ensign into the military of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He fought during the closing stage of the [[Long Turkish War]], rising to the rank of colonel by the outbreak of [[Bocskai uprising]] during which he commanded a unit of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian Estates]] militia. In 1607, he became the chamberlain of Ferdinand of Styria, future [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. In May 1609, he married Lucretia Vičkov, a widow of considerable means who died in 1614 granting Wallenstein her property. Wallenstein had previously secured his fortune by converting from the Protestant [[Unity of the Brethren]] denomination to Catholicism during the ongoing Recatholicazation campaign in Bohemia.{{sfn|Wittich|1900|pp=582–585}}

At the outbreak of the 1618 [[Bohemian Revolt]] he demonstrated his loyalty to the crown by fighting his former coreligionists represented by the Bohemian Estates. A unit of cuirassiers whom he had recruited at his own expense fought at the decisive [[Battle of White Mountain]] which ended the revolt in the crown's favor.{{sfn|Wittich|1900|pp=582–585}} In 1623, Wallenstein married Elizabeth von Harrach the daughter of [[Karl von Harrach]] an influential member of emperor Ferdinand's [[Geheimrat]] (Privy Council). Harrach's two other daughters married [[Adam Erdmann Trčka von Lípa]] and Wallenstein's cousin Max von Waldstein.{{sfn|Felgel|1879|pp=637–638}} Wallenstein's newly acquired connections and riches enabled him to purchase vast estates formerly belonging to rebel barons, loan the emperor vast sums of money and raise thousands of troops. He campaigned extensively during the [[Thirty Years' War]] repelling incursions by the pretender to the Hungarian throne [[Gabriel Bethlen]], defeating the Mansfeldian army in the [[Palatinate campaign]] of 1623. Those successes were followed by victories against the Danes between 1626 and 1628 which ended their intervention into the war. In February 1628, Wallenstein wrote off 4,750,000 florins of debt to the imperial treasury, in exchange he was elevated into an imperial prince and received the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg]]. While his army was now triple the size of that of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], the empire's biggest ally. His meteoric rise to power was unprecedented in its scale became increasingly controversial among the members of the League who feared that their own possessions might be confiscated shall they disobey the emperor's command.{{sfn|Wittich|1900|pp=585–588}}

In July 1630, the Catholic League used the opportunity of the Regensburg Electoral Congress to demand Wallenstein's dismissal. Wallenstein's reluctance to participate in the life of the court allowed his opponents to spread malicious rumors about him. Such as his supposed ambitions to take the imperial throne for himself. Notably the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg Spanish]] faction of the court was enraged at his failure to intervene into the [[Eighty Years' War]]. Bowing to outside pressure Ferdinand dismissed the general on 13 August. The [[Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years' War]] that took place on the same year swung the balance of power against the empire. Many still saw the former generalissimo as the only military commander capable of maintaining a balance among the opposing forces, his reinstatement was thus formalized on 13 April 1632.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=454–456, 492}} Wallenstein spent most of the following year campaigning separately from his senior officers who operated autonomously, many of whom avoided him for fear of his rage outbursts. An axis of his opponents within the army began corresponding in encoded messages, criticizing his passive approach and the lack of opportunities for promotion stemming from it. Ferdinand found his responses to criticism inadequate and the two disagreed on the number of issues such as the unsanctioned release of the captured Protestant general [[Jindřich Matyáš Thurn]] and Wallenstein's refusal to conduct offensives during the winter months.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=535–538}}

==Massacre==
[[Image:Ermordung-wallensteins-in-eger-anonymer-kupferstich 1-640x370.jpg|thumb|300px|Wallenstein's assassination.]]
[[File:Ermordung der Offiziere Wallensteins-anonyme Federzeichnung.jpg|thumb|300px|Assassination of Wallenstein's inner circle.]]

Wallenstein was increasingly criticized for his passivity in face of a Swedish incursion into [[Bavaria]] and the collapse of [[Lorraine]] under French pressure. His dislike of courtly life and the influence exerted by the church upon the emperor created an axis of undercover opposition that launched a [[smear campaign]] against him. On 11 January 1634, [[Gundakar, Prince of Liechtenstein]] sent Ferdinand II an official request, recommending Wallenstein's liquidation. A day later, Wallenstein summoned his colonels to sign the First Pilsner Reverse, a declaration of personal loyalty, 49 of them signed immediately while [[Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch]] and Scherffenberg gathered signatures in Silesia and Upper Austria respectively. Numerous commanders signed the Reverse so as not to arouse suspicion, while at the same time a party centered around [[Ottavio Piccolomini]] began circulating an anonymous tract that summarized the army's grudges against Wallenstein.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=532–537}} On 17 February, Scherffenberg was arrested in [[Vienna]]. On 18 February, a second patent was released accusing Wallenstein of conspiracy and condemning him to death, its publication was delayed so as not to split the army in two. Wallenstein's letters refuting the accusations against him remained unanswered, after realizing that the emperor was positioning troops in such a manner as to surround him he decided to flee to the Swedes.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=539–541}} 

Wallenstein, [[Christian von Ilow]] and other loyal officers departed from their headquarters on 22 February along with 1,300 men. Irish colonel [[Walter Butler of Roscrea|Walter Butler]], the leader of a group of Irish and Scottish officers hired by Piccolomini to assassinate Wallenstein, was ordered by the unsuspecting general to follow them with his 900 dragoons. On 24 February, Wallenstein reached [[Cheb|Eger]], most of the trusted troops camped outside of the town as it was already garrisoned Butler's dragoons and other anti-Wallenstein elements.. The following day Ilow held a series of meetings with the would be assassins trying to persuade them to remain loyal to their commander. They made the decision to go on with Piccolomini's plan, fearing that they would be branded as rebels should they fail to do so. At 6.00 p.m., Wallenstein's inner circle consisting of Ilow, Trčka von Lípa, [[Vilém Kinský]] and Captain Niemann were invited by the conspirators to the city's castle for a formal dinner. During the course of the dinner a servant nodded indicating that the conspirators were ready. Six dragoons burst into the dining hall shouting "Who is a good Imperialist?", Butler, John Gordon and Walter Leslie rose from the table yelling "Long live Ferdinand!". Kinský was killed immediately, although he made a desperate attempt to fight back. Ilow grabbed his sword and charged at Gordon; before being able to strike he was knocked to the ground by the dragoons and killed, others met a similar fate. Wallenstein was killed in his residence at 10.00 p.m. An imperial decree equated the participants of the perpetrators of the Eger Bloodbath with executioners.{{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=539–541, 580}} {{sfn|Hallwich|1881|pp=32–33}}

On 1 March, the commander of the [[Troppau]] garrison (an officer under Schaffgotsch's command) declared his allegiance to Wallenstein, unaware of what had previously happened. An investigation into the incident proved that Schaffgotsch was not implicated the uprising. In the second half of April, he was sent to Vienna upon his request, where he continued to be interrogated. On 31 March 1635, Schaffgotsch was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and sentenced to death. Schaffgotsch pleaded not guilty citing the fact that Wallenstein was not officially relieved of his command and as such he was obliged to follow his orders. On 4 July, presiding judge [[Heinrich von Schlick]] ordered the use of torture which failed to produce a confession of guilt. A day later, the emperor confirmed the death sentence which was implemented on the morning of 24 July 1635. Schaffgotsch's execution was part of larger purge that included the execution of the Troppau garrison commander and the demotion and the temporary imprisonment of seven generals including {{illm|Francis Albert of Saxe-Lauenburg|de|Franz Albrecht von Sachsen-Lauenburg}}, all of the convicted were signatories of the Pilsner Reverse.{{sfn|Krebs|1885|pp=543–545}} {{sfn|Wilson|2011|pp=537–542, 580}}

"'''El Recuento De Los Daños'''" (The tale of the damages) is a single from the album ''[[Más Turbada Que Nunca]]'' by the Mexican singer [[Gloria Trevi]].

The song was released on Mexican radio in 1994.  Though the song, like most Gloria Trevi songs of the day, used indirect references, "El Recuento De Los Daños" became well known for its music video aired on public television that broke taboos while bolting out lyrics explaining the depths of [[violence against women]], in a heavily [[machismo]] and still traditional Mexico of 1994.

==Music video==
Though technically a love-related song, it exposed the taboo and hitherto unspoken practice of men punching pregnant women they conceived out of wedlock in order to kill the fetus (''del firme impacto de tus manos'', "the firm impact of your hands"&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/artist/302949/gloria-trevi/biography Gloria Trevi] - Billboard.com&lt;/ref&gt;) by purposely eye opening lyrics.  The music video shows a girl with blood drenching her swollen abdomen (a miscarriage), as well as a [[child abduction]].  The lyrics at the beginning of the chorus also goes ''Yo no puedo reponerme de ese beso que me subio al cielo, que es el mismo que ahora me hunde en el infierno'' ("I cannot recover from that kiss that took me to Heaven, the same one which now plunges me to hell").

==Effects==
Later, Trevi herself was sentenced to jail for conspiring with director Sergio Andrade to sexually abuse women.  After her acquittal on lack of evidence and release from jail, Trevi in 2007 sued a Mexican promoter who accused her of murdering her own child she lost while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/blogs/sound-check/its-really-complicated-life-and-times-gloria-trevi#axzz2y02yljsL|title=It's (Really) Complicated: The Life and Times of Gloria Trevi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fans heavily suspected that she was legally framed and jailed related to her boldness to speak out against social ills.

The song's title was used for an [[Univision]] investigative program concerning the scandal.

==Top==
The song hit top of the Latin charts in America as well as Mexico.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt;

{{Ranks of Nobility}}
An '''emperor''' (through [[Old French]] ''empereor'' from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[imperator]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|emperor|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[monarch]], and usually the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] ruler of an [[empire]] or another type of imperial realm. '''Empress''', the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife ([[empress consort]]), mother ([[empress dowager]]), or a woman who rules in her own right ([[empress regnant]]). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher [[honour]] and [[Royal and noble ranks|rank]] than [[king]]s. In [[Europe]], the title of Emperor has been used since the [[Middle Ages]], considered in those times equal or almost equal in dignity to that of [[Pope]] due to the latter's position as visible head of the Church and spiritual leader of the Catholic part of [[Western Europe]]. The [[Emperor of Japan]] is the only currently [[List of current sovereign monarchs|reigning monarch]] whose title is translated into English as Emperor.

Both emperors and kings are [[monarch]]s, but emperor and empress are considered the higher monarchical titles. In as much as there is a strict definition of emperor, it is that an emperor has no relations implying the superiority of any other ruler and typically rules over more than one nation, therefore a king might be obliged to pay [[tribute]] to another ruler,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/south-east-se-asia/china-art/a/forbidden-city|title=The Forbidden City|last=Peng|first=Dr. Ying-chen|date=|website=Khan Academy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be restrained in his actions in some unequal fashion, but an emperor should in theory be completely free of such restraints. However, monarchs heading empires have not always used the title in all contexts—the British sovereign did not assume the title Empress of the British Empire even during the [[British Raj|incorporation of India]], though she was declared Empress of India.

In [[Western Europe]], the title of Emperor was used exclusively by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], whose imperial authority was derived from the concept of ''{{lang|la|[[translatio imperii]]}}'', i.e. they claimed succession to the authority of the [[Western Roman Emperor]]s, thus linking themselves to Roman institutions and traditions as part of state ideology. Although initially ruling much of Central Europe and northern Italy, by the 19th century the Emperor exercised little power beyond the German-speaking states. Although technically an elective title, by the late [[16th century]] the imperial title had in practice come to be inherited by the [[Habsburg]] [[Archdukes of Austria]] and following the [[Thirty Years' War]] their control over the states (outside the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], i.e. [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and various territories outside the empire) had become nearly non-existent. However, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned [[Emperor of the French]] in 1804 and was shortly followed by [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared himself [[Emperor of Austria]] in the same year. The position of Holy Roman Emperor nonetheless continued until [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated that position in 1806. In [[Eastern Europe]], the monarchs of [[Russia]] also used ''translatio imperii'' to wield imperial authority as successors to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. Their status was officially recognised by the Holy Roman Emperor in 1514, although not officially used by the Russian monarchs until 1547. However, the Russian emperors are better known by their Russian-language title of [[Tsar]] even after [[Peter the Great]] adopted the title of [[Emperor of All Russia]] in 1721.

Historians have liberally used emperor and empire anachronistically and out of its Roman and European context to describe any large state from the past or the present. Such pre-Roman titles as [[Great King]] or [[King of Kings]], used by the Kings of Persia and others, are often considered as the equivalent. Sometimes this reference has even extended to non-monarchically ruled states and their spheres of influence such as the [[Athenian Empire]] of the late 5th century BC, the [[Angevin Empire]] of the [[Plantagenets]] and the [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]] and [[American imperialism|American]] "empires" of the [[Cold War]] era. However, such "empires" did not need to be headed by an "emperor". Empire became identified instead with vast territorial holdings rather than the title of its ruler by the mid-18th century.

For purposes of protocol, emperors were once given [[Order of precedence|precedence]] over kings in international diplomatic relations, but currently precedence amongst [[heads of state]] who are sovereigns—whether they be kings, queens, emperors, empresses, princes, princesses and to a lesser degree presidents—is determined by the duration of time that each one has been continuously in office. Outside the European context, emperor was the translation given to holders of titles who were accorded the same precedence as European emperors in diplomatic terms. In reciprocity, these rulers might accredit equal titles in their native languages to their European peers. Through centuries of international convention, this has become the dominant rule to identifying an emperor in the modern era.

==Roman tradition==

In the [[ancient Rome|Roman]] tradition a large variety in the meaning and importance of the imperial form of monarchy developed: in ''intention'' it was always the highest office, but it could as well fall down to a redundant title for nobility that had never been near to the "Empire" they were supposed to be reigning. Also the ''name'' of the position split in several branches of Western tradition, see below.

The importance and meaning of [[coronation]] ceremonies and [[regalia]] also varied within the tradition: for instance [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s could only be crowned emperor by the [[Pope]], which meant the coronation ceremony usually took place in Rome, often several years after these emperors had ascended to the throne (as "king") in their home country. The first [[Latin Empire of Constantinople|Latin Emperors of Constantinople]] on the other hand had to be present in the newly conquered capital of their empire, because that was the only place where they could be granted to become emperor.

Early [[Roman Emperor]]s avoided any type of ceremony or regalia different from what was already usual for republican offices in the [[Roman Republic]]: the most intrusive change had been changing the color of their robe to purple. Later new symbols of worldly and/or spiritual power, like the [[Globus cruciger|orb]], became an essential part of the imperial accessories.

Rules for indicating successors also varied: there was a tendency towards ''male'' ''inheritance'' of the supreme office, but as well election by noblemen, as ruling empresses are known (for empires not too strictly under [[salic law]]). Ruling monarchs could additionally steer the succession by adoption, as often occurred in the two first centuries of Imperial Rome. Of course, intrigue, murder and military force could also mingle in for appointing successors; the Roman imperial tradition made no exception to other monarchical traditions in this respect. Probably the epoch best known for this part of the imperial tradition is [[Roman Emperor (Crisis of the Third Century)|Rome's third century]] rule.

==Roman Empire and Byzantine emperors==

===Classical Antiquity===
{{Main|Roman emperor|Imperator}}
[[File:Rimini083.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A statue of the dictator [[Julius Caesar]].]]

When [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]] turned into a ''de facto'' [[monarchy]] in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch.  Ancient Romans abhorred the name [[King of Rome|Rex ("king")]], and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule.  [[Julius Caesar]] had been [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome.  Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

[[File:Statue-Augustus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Augustus]], the first emperor of the Roman Empire.]]
[[Augustus]], considered the first [[Roman emperor]], established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man.  One of these offices was ''[[princeps senatus]]'', ("first man of the Senate") and became changed into Augustus' chief honorific, ''[[Princeps|princeps civitatis]]'' ("first citizen") from which the modern English word and title [[prince]] is descended.  The first period of the [[Roman Empire]], from 27 BC – 284 AD, is called the ''[[principate]]'' for this reason.  However, it was the informal descriptive of ''[[Imperator]]'' ("commander") that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.  Previously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had ''[[imperium]]'', Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all ''imperium''.  (''Imperium'' is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)

Beginning with Augustus, ''Imperator'' appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453.  After the reign of Augustus' immediate successor [[Tiberius]], being proclaimed ''imperator'' was transformed into the act of accession to the [[head of state]]. Other honorifics used by the Roman Emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor:

*'''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''' (as, for example, in [[Suetonius]]' ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Twelve Caesars]]''). This tradition continued in many languages: in German it became "[[Kaiser]]"; in certain [[Slavic languages]] it became "[[Tsar]]"; in Hungarian it became "[[Császár]]", and several more variants. The name derived from [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[cognomen]] "Caesar": this cognomen was adopted by all Roman emperors, exclusively by the ruling monarch after the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] had died out. In this tradition Julius Caesar is sometimes described as the first Caesar/emperor (following Suetonius). This is one of the most enduring titles, Caesar and its transliterations appeared in every year from the time of [[Caesar Augustus]] to Tsar [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Symeon II of Bulgaria]]'s removal from the throne in 1946.
*'''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''' was the [[honorific]] first bestowed on Emperor Augustus: after him all Roman emperors added it to their name. Although it had a high symbolical value, something like "elevated" or "sublime", it was generally not used to indicate the office of ''Emperor'' itself. Exceptions include the title of the ''[[Augustan History]]'', a semi-historical collection of Emperors' biographies of the 2nd and 3rd century. Augustus had (by his last will) granted the feminine form of this honorific ([[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]) to his wife. Since there was no "title" of Empress(-consort) whatsoever, women of the reigning dynasty sought to be granted this honorific, as the highest attainable goal. Few were however granted the title, and certainly not as a rule all wives of reigning Emperors.
*'''[[Imperator]]''' (as, for example, in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]''). In the [[Roman Republic]] Imperator meant "(military) commander". In the late Republic, as in the early years of the new monarchy, ''Imperator'' was a title granted to Roman generals by their troops and the [[Roman Senate]] after a great victory, roughly comparable to [[field marshal]] (head or commander of the entire army). For example, in AD 15 [[Germanicus]] was proclaimed ''Imperator'' during the reign of his adoptive father [[Tiberius]]. Soon thereafter "Imperator" became however a title reserved exclusively for the ruling monarch. This led to "Emperor" in English and, among other examples, "Empereur" in French and "Mbreti" in Albanian. The Latin feminine form [[Imperatrix]] only developed after "Imperator" had taken on the connotation of "Emperor".
*'''[[Autokrator]]''' (Αὐτοκράτωρ) or '''[[basileus#Romans and Byzantines|Basileus]]''' (βασιλεύς): although the Greeks used equivalents of "Caesar" (Καῖσαρ, ''Kaisar'') and "Augustus" (in two forms: transliterated as {{lang|grc|Αὔγουστος}}, ''Augoustos'' or translated as {{lang|grc|Σεβαστός}}, ''[[Sebastos]]'') these were rather used as part of the name of the Emperor than as an indication of the office. Instead of developing a new name for the new type of monarchy, they used {{lang|grc|αὐτοκράτωρ}} (''autokratōr'', only partly overlapping with the modern understanding of "[[Autocracy|autocrat]]") or {{lang|grc|βασιλεύς}} (''[[basileus]]'', until then the usual name for "[[Monarch|sovereign]]"). ''Autokratōr'' was essentially used as a translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' in Greek-speaking part of the Roman Empire, but also here there is only partial overlap between the meaning of the original Greek and Latin concepts. For the Greeks ''Autokratōr'' was not a military title, and was closer to the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' concept ("the one with unlimited power"), before it came to mean Emperor. ''Basileus'' appears not to have been used exclusively in the meaning of "emperor" (and specifically, the Roman/Byzantine emperor) before the 7th century, although it was a standard informal designation of the Emperor in the Greek-speaking East.

After the turbulent [[Year of the four emperors]] in 69, the [[Flavian Dynasty]] reigned for three decades. The succeeding [[Nervan-Antonian Dynasty]], ruling for most of the 2nd century, stabilised the Empire. This epoch became known as the era of the ''[[Nerva–Antonine dynasty#Five Good Emperors|Five Good Emperors]]'', and was followed by the short-lived [[Severan Dynasty]].

During the [[Crisis of the 3rd century]], [[Barracks Emperor]]s succeeded one another at short intervals. Three short lived secessionist attempts had their own emperors: the [[Gallic Empire]], the [[Britannic Empire]], and the [[Palmyrene Empire]] though the latter used ''rex'' more regularly.

The [[Principate]] (27 BC – 284 AD) period was succeeded by what is known as the [[Dominate]] (284 AD – 527 AD), during which Emperor [[Diocletian]] tried to put the Empire on a more formal footing.  Diocletian sought to address the challenges of the Empire's now vast geography and the instability caused by the informality of succession by the creation of co-emperors and junior emperors.  At one point, there were as many as five sharers of the ''imperium'' (see: [[Tetrarchy]]).  In 325 AD [[Constantine I]] defeated his rivals and restored single emperor rule, but following his death the empire was divided among his sons. For a time the concept was of one empire ruled by multiple emperors with varying territory under their control, however following the death of [[Theodosius I]] the rule was divided between his two sons and increasingly became separate entities.  The areas administered from Rome are referred to by historians the [[Western Roman Empire]] and those under the immediate authority of Constantinople called the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] or (after the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] in 636 AD) the [[Byzantine Empire|Later Roman or Byzantine Empire]].  The subdivisions and co-emperor system were formally abolished by [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] in 480 AD following the death of [[Julius Nepos]] last Western Emperor and the ascension of [[Odoacer]] as the ''de facto'' King of Italy in 476 AD.

===Byzantine period===
{{Main|Byzantine Emperor}}

====Before the 4th Crusade====
[[File:Sanvitale03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Under [[Justinian I]], reigning in the 6th century, parts of Italy were for a few decades (re)conquered from the [[Ostrogoths]]: thus, this famous [[mosaic]], featuring the Byzantine emperor in the center, can be admired at [[Ravenna]].]]

Historians generally refer to the continuing Roman Empire in the east as the [[Byzantine Empire]] after [[Byzantium]], the original name of the town that [[Constantine I]] would elevate to the Imperial capital as [[New Rome]] in AD 330. (The city is more commonly called [[Constantinople]] and is today named [[Istanbul]]). Although the empire was again subdivided and a co-emperor sent to Italy at the end of the fourth century, the office became unitary again only 95 years later at the request of the [[Roman Senate]] and following the death of [[Julius Nepos]], last Western Emperor. This change was a recognition of the reality that little remained of Imperial authority in the areas that had been the Western Empire, with even Rome and Italy itself now ruled by the essentially autonomous [[Odoacer]].

These Later Roman "Byzantine" Emperors completed the transition from the idea of the Emperor as a semi-republican official to the Emperor as an [[absolute monarch]]. Of particular note was the translation of the Latin ''Imperator'' into the Greek ''[[Basileus]]'', after Emperor [[Heraclius]] changed the official language of the empire from Latin to Greek in AD 620. Basileus, a title which had long been used for [[Alexander the Great]] was already in common usage as the Greek word for the Roman emperor, but its definition and sense was "King" in Greek, essentially equivalent with the Latin ''Rex''. Byzantine period emperors also used the Greek word "autokrator", meaning "one who rules himself", or "monarch", which was traditionally used by Greek writers to translate the Latin ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]''. Essentially, the Greek language did not incorporate the nuances of the Ancient Roman concepts that distinguished ''imperium'' from other forms of political power.

In general usage, the Byzantine imperial title evolved from simply "emperor" (''basileus''), to "emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn'') in the 9th century, to "emperor and autocrat of the Romans" (''basileus kai autokratōr tōn Rōmaiōn'') in the 10th.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Alexandrovič Ostrogorsky|George Ostrogorsky]], "Avtokrator i samodržac", ''Glas Srpske kraljevske akadamije'' CLXIV, Drugi razdred 84 (1935), 95–187&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, none of these (and other) additional epithets and titles had ever been completely discarded.

One important distinction between the post Constantine I (reigned AD 306–337) emperors and their pagan predecessors was [[cesaropapism]], the assertion that the Emperor (or other head of state) is also the head of the Church. Although this principle was held by all emperors after Constantine, it met with increasing resistance and ultimately rejection by bishops in the west after the effective end of Imperial power there. This concept became a key element of the meaning of "emperor" in the Byzantine and Orthodox east, but went out of favor in the west with the rise of [[Roman Catholicism]].

The Byzantine empire also produced three women who effectively governed the state: the Empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and the Empresses [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zoe]] and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]].

====Latin emperors====
In 1204 Constantinople fell to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] and the [[Franks]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]].  Following the tragedy of the horrific [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking]] of the city, the conquerors declared a new "Empire of Romania", known to historians as the [[Latin Empire of Constantinople]], installing [[Baldwin IX]], [[Count of Flanders]], as Emperor. However, Byzantine resistance to the new empire meant that it was in constant struggle to establish itself.  Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos succeeded in recapturing Constantinople in 1261.  The [[Principality of Achaea]], a vassal state the empire had created in [[Morea]] (Greece) intermittently continued to recognize the authority of the crusader emperors for another half century.  Pretenders to the title continued among the European nobility until circa 1383.

====After the 4th Crusade====
With Constantinople occupied, claimants to the imperial succession styled themselves as emperor in the chief centers of resistance:  The [[Laskaris|Laskarid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Nicaea]], the [[Komnenos|Komnenid]] dynasty in the [[Empire of Trebizond]] and the [[Doukas|Doukid]] dynasty in the [[Despotate of Epirus]].  In 1248, the Epirus recognized the Nicaean Emperors, who then recaptured Constantinople in 1261.  The Trebizond emperor formally submitted in Constantinople in 1281,&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, Donald MacGillivray, ''The Last Centuries of Byzantium'', second edition (Cambridge: University Press, 1993), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; but frequently flouted convention by styling themselves emperor back in Trebizond thereafter.

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Suleiman Agostino.JPG|thumb|190px|[[Agostino Veneziano]]'s [[engraving]] of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor Suleiman the Magnificent wearing his [[Süleyman the Magnificent's Venetian Helmet|Venetian Helmet]].&lt;ref&gt;Agostino never saw the Sultan, but probably did see and sketch the helmet in Venice.&lt;/ref&gt; Note the four tiers on the helmet, symbolizing his imperial power, and excelling the three-tiered [[papal tiara]].&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1968. "Turquerie" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series 26 (5): 229.&lt;/ref&gt; This tiara was made for 115,000 [[ducats]] and offered to Suleiman by the French ambassador [[Antonio Rincon]] in 1532.&lt;ref&gt;Garnier, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; This was a most atypical piece of headgear for a Turkish sultan, which he probably never normally wore, but which he placed beside him when receiving visitors, especially ambassadors. It was crowned with an enormous feather.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rulers]] held several titles denoting their Imperial status. These included:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[Sultan]], [[Khan (title)|Khan]], Sovereign of the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Imperial House of Osman]], [[Sultan of Sultans]], [[Khan of Khans]], [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] and [[Caliph|Successor of the Prophet of the Lord of the Universe]], Protector of the Holy Cities of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]], Emperor of The Three Cities of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Edirne|Adrianopole]] and [[Bursa]] as well as many other cities and countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nobility of the World Volume VIII- Turkey|url=http://www.almanachdegotha.org/id244.html|website=Almanch De Saxe Gotha|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Ottoman capture of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman sultans began to style themselves '''Kaysar-i Rum''' (Emperor of the Romans) as they asserted themselves to be the heirs to the Roman empire by right of conquest.  The title was of such importance to them that it led them to eliminate the various Byzantine successor states — and therefore rival claimants — over the next eight years.  Though the term "emperor" was rarely used by Westerners of the Ottoman sultan, it was generally accepted by Westerners that he had imperial status.

==Holy Roman Empire==
{{Main|Holy Roman Emperor}}
The ''Emperor'' of the Romans' title was a reflection of the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' (''transfer of rule'') principle that regarded the Holy Roman Emperors as the inheritors of the title of Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]], despite the continued existence of the [[Byzantine Empire|Roman Empire]] in the east.

From the time of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]] onward, much of the former [[Carolingian]] kingdom of [[Eastern Francia]] became the Holy Roman Empire. The  [[prince-elector]]s elected one of their peers as [[King of the Romans]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] before being crowned by the [[Pope]]. The Emperor could also pursue the election of his heir (usually a son) as King, who would then succeed him after his death. This junior King then bore the title of Roman King (King of the Romans). Although technically already ruling, after the election he would be crowned as emperor by the Pope. The last emperor to be crowned by the pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]; all emperors after him were technically ''emperors-elect'', but were universally referred to as ''Emperor''.

==Austrian Empire==
{{Main|Emperor of Austria}}
The first Austrian Emperor was the last Holy Roman Emperor Francis II. In the face of aggressions by [[Napoleon]], Francis feared for the future of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. He wished to maintain his and his family's Imperial status in the event that the Holy Roman Empire should be dissolved, as it indeed was in 1806 when an Austrian-led army suffered a humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. After which, the victorious Napoleon proceeded to dismantle the old ''Reich'' by severing a good portion from the empire and turning it into a separate [[Confederation of the Rhine]].  With the size of his imperial realm significantly reduced, Francis II, ''Holy Roman Emperor'' became Francis I, ''Emperor of Austria''. The new imperial title may have sounded less prestigious than the old one, but Francis' [[dynasty]] continued to rule from Austria and a Habsburg monarch was still an emperor (''Kaiser''), and not just merely a king (''König''), in name.

The title lasted just a little over one century until 1918, but it was never clear what territory constituted the "[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]".  When Francis took the title in 1804, the Habsburg lands as a whole were dubbed the ''Kaisertum Österreich''.  ''Kaisertum'' might literally be translated as "emperordom" (on analogy with "kingdom") or "emperor-ship"; the term denotes specifically "the territory ruled by an emperor", and is thus somewhat more general than [[Reich]], which in 1804 carried connotations of universal rule.  Austria proper (as opposed to the complex of Habsburg lands as a whole) had been an Archduchy since the 15th century, and most of the other territories of the Empire had their own institutions and territorial history, although there were some attempts at centralization, especially during the reign of Marie Therese and her son Joseph II and then finalized in the early 19th century.  When Hungary was given self-government in 1867, the non-Hungarian portions were called the Empire of Austria and were officially known as the "Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'')".  The title of Emperor of Austria and the associated Empire were both abolished at the end of the First World War in 1918, when [[German Austria]] became a [[republic]] and the other kingdoms and lands represented in the Imperial Council established their independence or adhesion to other states.

==Emperors of Europe==
[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]'s close cultural and political interaction with its Balkan neighbors [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]], and with Russia (Kievan Rus', then Muscovy) led to the adoption of Byzantine imperial traditions in all of these countries.

===Bulgaria===
In 913, [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] was crowned Emperor ([[Tsar]]) by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] and imperial regent [[Nicholas Mystikos]] outside the Byzantine capital. In its final simplified form, the title read "Emperor and Autocrat of all Bulgarians and Romans" (''Tsar i samodarzhets na vsichki balgari i gartsi'' in the modern vernacular). The Roman component in the Bulgarian imperial title indicated both rulership over Greek speakers and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans, however this component was never recognised by the Byzantine court.

Byzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial title was revoked by the succeeding Byzantine government. The decade 914–924 was spent in destructive warfare between Byzantium and Bulgaria over this and other matters of conflict. The Bulgarian monarch, who had further irritated his Byzantine counterpart by claiming the title "Emperor of the Romans" (''basileus tōn Rōmaiōn''), was eventually recognized, as "Emperor of the Bulgarians" (''basileus tōn Boulgarōn'') by the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus I|Romanos I Lakapenos]] in 924. Byzantine recognition of the imperial dignity of the Bulgarian monarch and the patriarchal dignity of the [[Patriarch of All Bulgaria|Bulgarian patriarch]] was again confirmed at the conclusion of permanent peace and a Bulgarian-Byzantine dynastic marriage in 927. In the meantime, the Bulgarian imperial title may have been also confirmed by the [[pope]].  The Bulgarian imperial title "tsar" was adopted by all Bulgarian monarchs up to the fall of Bulgaria under Ottoman rule. 14th-century Bulgarian literary compositions clearly denote the Bulgarian capital ([[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]]) as a successor of Rome and [[Constantinople]], in effect, the "Third Rome".

After Bulgaria obtained full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, its monarch, who was previously styled ''Knyaz'', [prince], took the traditional title of ''Tsar'' [king] and was recognized internationally as such.{{by whom|date=November 2016}}

===France===
The kings of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' and the [[July Monarchy]] used the title ''Empereur de France'' in diplomatic correspondence and treaties with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] emperor from at least 1673 onwards. The Ottomans insisted on this elevated style while refusing to recognize the Holy Roman Emperors or the Russian tsars because of their rival claims of the [[translatio imperii|Roman crown]]. In short, it was an indirect insult by the Ottomans to the HRE and the Russians. The French kings also used it for [[Morocco]] (1682) and [[Persia]] (1715).

====First French Empire====
{{See also|First French Empire}}
[[File:NapoleanCoronationDavid.jpg|thumb|300px|One of the most famous Imperial coronation ceremonies was that of Napoleon, crowning himself Emperor in the presence of [[Pope Pius VII]] (who had blessed the [[regalia]]), at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris]].&lt;br&gt;The painting by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] commemorating the event is equally famous: the gothic cathedral restyled ''[[Empire (style)|style Empire]]'', supervised by the [[Letizia Ramolino|mother of the Emperor]] on the balcony (a fictional addition, while she had not been present at the ceremony), the pope positioned near the altar, Napoleon proceeds to crown his then wife, [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] as Empress.]]
[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], who was already First Consul of the French Republic (''Premier Consul de la République française'') for life, declared himself '''[[Emperor of the French]]''' (''Empereur des Français'') on 18 May 1804, thus creating the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (''Empire Français'').

Napoleon relinquished the title of Emperor of the French on 6 April and again on 11 April 1814.
Napoleon's infant son, [[Napoleon II of France|Napoleon II]], was recognized by the Council of Peers, as Emperor from the moment of his father's abdication, and therefore reigned (as opposed to ruled) as Emperor for fifteen days, 22 June to 7 July 1815.

====Elba====
Since 3 May 1814, the Sovereign Principality of [[Elba]] was created a miniature non-hereditary Monarchy under the exiled French Emperor Napoleon I. Napoleon I was allowed, by the treaty of Fontainebleau with (27 April), to enjoy, for life, the imperial title. The islands were ''not'' restyled an empire.

On 26 February 1815, Napoleon abandoned Elba for France, reviving the French Empire for a [[Hundred Days]]; the Allies declared an end to Napoleon's sovereignty over Elba on 25 March 1815, and on 31 March 1815 Elba was ceded to the restored [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] by the Congress of Vienna. After his final defeat, Napoleon was treated as a general by the British authorities during his second exile to Atlantic Isle of [[St. Helena]]. His title was a matter of dispute with the governor of St Helena, who insisted on addressing him as "General Bonaparte", despite the "historical reality that he had been an emperor" and therefore retained the title.&lt;ref&gt;''Napoleon'', Vincent Cronin, p419, HarperCollins, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Napoleon'', Frank McLynn, p644, Pimlico 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mémorial de Sainte Hélène'', Emmanuel De Las Cases, Tome III, page101, published by Jean De Bonnot, Libraire à l'enseigne du canon, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second French Empire====
{{See also|Second French Empire}}
Napoleon I's nephew, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], resurrected the title of emperor on 2 December 1852, after establishing the [[Second French Empire]] in a presidential [[coup]], subsequently approved by a plebiscite. His reign was marked by large scale public works, the development of social policy, and the extension of France's influence throughout the world. During his reign, he also set about creating the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (headed by his choice of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], a member of the [[House of Habsburg]]), to regain France's hold in the Americas and to achieve greatness for the 'Latin' race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1O6HwzwQs4C&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Race and nation in modern Latin America |first1=Nancy P. |last1=Appelbaum |first2=Anne S. |last2=Macpherson |first3=Karin Alejandra |last3=Rosemblatt |publisher=UNC Press Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8078-5441-9 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III was deposed on 4 September 1870, after France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] followed and after the death of his son Napoleon (IV), in 1879 during the Zulu War, the Bonapartist movement split, and the Third Republic was to last until 1940.

===Iberian Peninsula===
====Spain====
The origin of the title ''[[Imperator totius Hispaniae]]'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''Emperor of All [[Hispania|Spain]]''&lt;ref&gt;Notice that, before the emergence of the modern country of Spain (beginning with the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]] in 1492), the Latin word ''[[Hispania]]'', in any of the [[Iberian Romance languages]], either in singular or plural forms (in English: Spain or Spains), was used to refer to the whole of the Iberian Peninsula, and not exclusively, as in modern usage, to the country of Spain, thus excluding Portugal.&lt;/ref&gt;) is murky. It was associated with the [[List of Leonese monarchs|Leonese monarchy]] perhaps as far back as [[Alfonso the Great]] (''r.'' 866–910). The last two kings of its [[Astur-Leonese dynasty]] were called emperors in a contemporary source.

King [[Sancho III of Navarre]] conquered Leon in 1034 and began using it. His son, [[Ferdinand I of Castile]] also took the title in 1039. Ferdinand's son, [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile]] took the title in 1077. It then passed to his son-in-law, [[Alfonso I of Aragon]] in 1109. His stepson and Alfonso VI's grandson, [[Alfonso VII of Castile|Alfonso VII]] was the only one who actually had an imperial coronation in 1135.

The title was not exactly hereditary but self-proclaimed by those who had, wholly or partially, united the Christian northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], often at the expense of killing rival siblings. The popes and Holy Roman emperors protested at the usage of the imperial title as a usurpation of leadership in western Christendom. After Alfonso VII's death in 1157, the title was abandoned, and the kings who used it are not commonly mentioned as having been "emperors", in Spanish or other historiography.

After the fall of the Byzantine Empire, the legitimate heir to the throne, [[Andreas Palaiologos]], willed away his claim to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1503.

====Portugal====
[[File:Jean-Baptiste Debret - Retrato de Dom João VI (MNBA).jpg|thumb|[[John VI of Portugal|John VI]], [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King of Portugal and the Algarves]], [[Emperor of Brazil]].]]
After the independence and proclamation of the [[Empire of Brazil]] from the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Kingdom of Portugal]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]], who became Emperor, in 1822, his father, King [[John VI of Portugal]] briefly held the honorific style of Titular [[Emperor of Brazil]] and the treatment of ''His Imperial and Royal Majesty'' under the 1825 [[Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825)|Treaty of Rio de Janeiro]], by which Portugal recognized the independence of Brazil. The style of Titular Emperor was a life title, and became extinct upon the holder's demise. John VI held the imperial title for a few months only, from the ratification of the Treaty in November 1825 until his death in March 1826. During those months, however, as John's imperial title was purely honorific while his son, Pedro I, remained the sole monarch of the Brazilian Empire.

===Great Britain===
{{Main|British Emperor}}
In the late 3rd century, by the end of the epoch of the ''barracks emperors'' in Rome, there were two [[List of Roman Emperors#Britannic Empire 286 to 297|Britannic Emperors]], reigning for about a decade. After the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]], the Imperator [[Cunedda]] forged the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]] in northern Wales, but all his successors were titled kings and princes.

====England====
There was no consistent title for the king of England before 1066, and monarchs chose to style themselves as they pleased. Imperial titles were used inconsistently, beginning with [[Athelstan]] in 930 and ended with the [[Norman conquest of England]]. [[Empress Matilda]] (1102–1167) is the only English monarch commonly referred to as "emperor" or "empress", but she acquired her title through her marriage to [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].

During the rule of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals]] declared that 'this realm of England is an Empire...governed by one Supreme Head and King having the dignity and royal estate of the [[imperial Crown]] of the same'. This was in the context of the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]] and the [[English Reformation]], to emphasize that England had never accepted the quasi-imperial claims of the papacy.  Hence England and, by extension its modern successor state, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], is according to English law an Empire ruled by a King endowed with the imperial dignity. However, this has not led to the creation of the ''title'' of Emperor in England, nor in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], nor in the United Kingdom.

====United Kingdom====
[[File:George V of the united Kingdom.jpg|thumb|right|[[George V]], [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]], [[Emperor of India]].]]
In 1801, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] rejected the title of Emperor when offered. The only period when British monarchs held the title of ''Emperor'' in a dynastic succession started when the title [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]] was created for [[Queen Victoria]]. The government led by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], conferred the additional title upon her by an Act of Parliament, reputedly to assuage the monarch's irritation at being, as a mere Queen, notionally inferior to her own daughter ([[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]], who was the wife of the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|reigning German Emperor]]); the Indian Imperial designation was also formally justified as the expression of Britain succeeding the former [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] as [[suzerain]] over hundreds of [[princely state]]s. The [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] provided for the abolition of the use of the title "[[Emperor of India]]" by the [[British monarch]], but this was not executed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] until a [[royal proclamation]] on 22 June 1948. Despite this, George VI continued as king of India until 1950 and as king of Pakistan until his death in 1952. 

The last Empress of India was George VI's wife, [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].

===German Empire===
{{Main|German Empire}}
[[File:Kohner - Kaiser Wilhelm II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[German Emperor]] and the [[King of Prussia]].]]
Under the guise of idealism giving way to realism, German nationalism rapidly shifted from its liberal and democratic character in 1848 to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] prime minister [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s authoritarian ''[[Realpolitik]]''. Bismarck wanted to unify the rival German states to achieve his aim of a conservative, Prussian-dominated Germany. Three wars led to military successes and helped to convince German people to do this: the [[Second war of Schleswig]] against Denmark in 1864, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] in 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] against the [[Second French Empire]] in 1870–71. During the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]] in 1871, the [[North German Confederation]], supported by its allies from [[southern Germany]], formed the [[German Empire]] with the proclamation of the Prussian king [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as German Emperor in the Hall of Mirrors at the [[Palace of Versailles]], to the humiliation of the French, who ceased to resist only days later.

After his death he was succeeded by his son [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] who was only emperor for 99 days. In the same year his son [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] became the third emperor within a year. He was the last German emperor. After the empire's defeat in World War I the empire, called in German ''Reich'', had a president as head of state instead of an emperor. The use of the word ''Reich'' was abandoned after the Second World War.

===Russia===
[[File:Profile portrait of Catherine II by Fedor Rokotov (1763, Tretyakov gallery).jpg|thumb|Empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great]]]]
In 1472, the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia Palaiologina]], married [[Ivan III of Russia|Ivan III]], grand prince of Moscow, who began championing the idea of Russia being the successor to the Byzantine Empire. This idea was represented more emphatically in the composition the monk Filofej addressed to their son [[Vasili III of Russia|Vasili III]]. After ending Muscovy's dependence on its [[Mongol]] overlords in 1480, Ivan III began the usage of the titles [[Tsar]] and Autocrat (''samoderzhets''). His insistence on recognition as such by the emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1489 resulted in the granting of this recognition in 1514 by Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to Vasili III. His son [[Ivan the Terrible|Ivan IV]] emphatically crowned himself [[Tsar of Russia]] on 16 January 1547. The word "Tsar" derives from Latin Caesar, but this title was used in Russia as equivalent to "King"; the error occurred when medieval Russian clerics referred to the biblical Jewish kings with the same title that was used to designate Roman and Byzantine rulers — "Caesar".

On 31 October 1721, [[Peter the Great|Peter I]] was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. The title used was Latin "''Imperator''", which is a westernizing form equivalent to the traditional Slavic title "''Tsar''". He based his claim partially upon a letter discovered in 1717 written in 1514 from Maximilian I to Vasili III, in which the Holy Roman Emperor used the term in referring to Vasili.

A formal address to the ruling Russian monarch adopted thereafter was 'Your Imperial Majesty'. The crown prince was addressed as 'Your Imperial Highness'.

The title has not been used in Russia since the abdication of Emperor [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] on 15 March 1917.

[[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] produced four reigning Empresses, all in the eighteenth century.

===Serbia===
{{main|Emperor of Serbia}}
In 1345, the Serbian King [[Stefan Dusan|Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]] proclaimed himself Emperor ([[Tsar]]) and was crowned as such at [[Skopje]] on [[Easter]] 1346 by the newly created [[Serbian Patriarch]], and by the Patriarch of Bulgaria and the autocephalous Archbishop of Ohrid. His imperial title was recognized by Bulgaria and various other neighbors and trading partners but not by the Byzantine Empire. In its final simplified form, the Serbian imperial title read "Emperor of Serbs and Greeks" (''цар Срба и Грка'' in modern Serbian). It was only employed by Stefan Uroš IV Dušan and his son Stefan Uroš V in Serbia (until his death in 1371), after which it became extinct. A half-brother of Dušan, [[Simeon Uroš]], and then his son [[Jovan Uroš]], claimed the same title, until the latter's abdication in 1373, while ruling as dynasts in [[Thessaly]]. The "Greek" component in the Serbian imperial title indicates both rulership over Greeks and the derivation of the imperial tradition from the Romans.

==Emperors in the Americas==

===Pre-Columbian traditions===
The Aztec and Inca traditions are unrelated to one another. Both were conquered under the reign of King [[Charles I of Spain]] who was simultaneously emperor-elect of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the fall of the Aztecs and fully emperor during the fall of the Incas. Incidentally by being king of Spain, he was also Roman (Byzantine) emperor in pretence through [[Andreas Palaiologos]]. The translations of their titles were provided by the Spanish.

====Aztec Empire====
The only [[pre-Columbian]] North American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Hueyi Tlatoani]]'' of the [[Aztec Empire]] (1375–1521). It was an [[elected monarchy]] chosen by the elite. Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Hernán Cortés]] slew Emperor [[Cuauhtémoc]] and installed puppet rulers who became vassals for Spain.

====Inca Empire====
The only pre-Columbian South American rulers to be commonly called emperors were the ''[[Sapa Inca]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] (1438–1533). Spanish conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]], conquered the Inca for Spain, killed Emperor [[Atahualpa]], and installed puppets as well. Atahualpa may actually be considered a usurper as he had achieved power by [[Inca Civil War|killing his half-brother]] and he did not perform the required coronation with the imperial crown ''[[mascaipacha]]'' by the ''Huillaq Uma'' (high priest).

===Post-Columbian Americas===

====Brazil====
[[File:Pedro Américo - D. Pedro II na abertura da Assembléia Geral.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[List of monarchs of Brazil|Emperor of Brazil]] in [[regalia]] at the opening of the General Assembly (oil painting by [[Pedro Américo]]).]]
When [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] ordered the invasion of Portugal in 1807 because it refused to join the [[Continental System]], the Portuguese [[House of Braganza|Braganzas]] moved their capital to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to avoid the fate of the [[Spanish Bourbons]] (Napoleon I arrested them and made his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] king). When the French general [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] arrived in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese fleet had already left with all the local elite.

In 1808, under a British naval escort, the fleet arrived in Brazil. Later, in 1815, the Portuguese Prince Regent (since 1816 [[John VI of Portugal|King João VI]]) proclaimed the ''[[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]'', as a union of three kingdoms, lifting Brazil from its colonial status.

After the fall of Napoleon I and the [[liberal Wars|Liberal revolution]] in Portugal, the Portuguese royal family returned to Europe (1821). Prince Pedro of Braganza (King João's older son) stayed in South America acting as regent of the local kingdom, but, two years later in 1822, he proclaimed himself [[Peter I of Brazil|Pedro I]], first [[Emperor of Brazil]]. He did, however, recognize his father, João VI, as ''Titular Emperor of Brazil'' —a purely honorific title—until João VI's death in 1826.

The empire came to an end in 1889, with the overthrow of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Emperor Pedro II]] (Pedro I's son and successor), when the Brazilian republic was proclaimed.

====Haiti====
[[Haiti]] was declared an empire by its ruler, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], who made himself Jacques I, on 20 May 1805. He was assassinated the next year. Haiti again became an empire from 1849 to 1859 under [[Faustin Soulouque]].

====Mexico====
[[File:X-Large Portrait of Maximiliano.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]]]]

In Mexico, the [[First Mexican Empire]] was the first of two empires created. After the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire|declaration of independence]] on September 15, 1821, it was the intention of the Mexican parliament to establish a commonwealth whereby the [[King]] of Spain, [[Fernando VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], would also be [[Emperor of Mexico]], but in which both countries were to be governed by separate laws and with their own legislative offices. Should the king refuse the position, the law provided for a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] to accede to the Mexican throne.

Ferdinand VII, however, did not recognize the independence and said that Spain would not allow any other European prince to take the throne of Mexico. By request of Parliament, the president of the regency [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was proclaimed emperor of Mexico on 12 July 1822 as [[Agustín I]]. Agustín de Iturbide was the general who helped secure Mexican independence from Spanish rule, but was overthrown by the [[Plan of Casa Mata]].

In 1863, the invading French, under [[Napoleon III]] (see above), in alliance with Mexican conservatives and [[Mexican nobility|nobility]], helped create the [[Second Mexican Empire]], and invited Archduke Maximilian, of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]], younger brother of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], to become emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I of Mexico]]. The childless Maximilian and his consort [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]], daughter of [[Leopold I of Belgium]], adopted Agustín's grandsons Agustin and Salvador as his heirs to bolster his claim to the throne of Mexico. Maximilian and Carlota made [[Chapultepec Castle]] their home, which has been the only palace in North America to house sovereigns. After the withdrawal of French protection in 1867, Maximilian was captured and executed by the liberal forces of [[Benito Juárez]].

This empire led to French influence in the Mexican culture and also [[French Mexican|immigration from France]], Belgium, and Switzerland to Mexico.

==Persia (Iran)==
{{further|Shah|King of Kings}}

In [[Iran|Persia]], from the time of [[Darius the Great]], Persian rulers used the title "[[King of Kings]]" (''[[Shah]]anshah'' in Persian) since they had dominion over peoples from the borders of India to the borders of Greece and Egypt. [[Alexander]] probably crowned himself ''shahanshah'' after conquering Persia{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, bringing the phrase ''basileus ton basileon'' to Greek. It is also known that [[Tigranes the Great]], king of Armenia, was named as the king of kings when he made his empire after defeating the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]]. Georgian title "mephet'mephe" has the same meaning.

The last ''shahanshah'' ([[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]]) was ousted in 1979 following the [[Iranian Revolution]]. ''Shahanshah'' is usually translated as ''king of kings'' or simply ''king'' for ancient rulers of the [[Achaemenid]], [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]], and [[Sassanid]] dynasties, and often shortened to ''shah'' for rulers since the [[Safavid]] dynasty in the 16th century.  Iranian rulers were typically regarded in the West as emperors.

==Indian subcontinent==
{{main|Chakravartin}}
The Sanskrit word for emperor is ''[[Samrāj]]'' or ''Chakravartin''. This word has been used as an epithet of various Vedic deities, like Varuna, and has been attested in the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], possibly the oldest compiled book among the Indo-Europeans. ''Chakravarti'' refers to the king of kings. A ''Chakravarti'' is not only a sovereign ruler but also has feudatories.

Typically, in the later Vedic age, a Hindu high king (''[[Maharaja|Maharajah]]'') was only called ''Samrāṭ'' after performing the Vedic ''[[Rajasuya]]'' sacrifice, enabling him by religious tradition to claim superiority over the other kings and princes. Another word for emperor is ''sārvabhaumā''. The title of ''Samrāṭ'' has been used by many rulers of the Indian subcontinent as claimed by the Hindu mythologies. In proper history, most historians call [[Chandragupta Maurya]] the first ''samrāṭ'' (emperor) of the Indian subcontinent, because of the huge empire he ruled. The most famous emperor was his grandson [[Ashoka the Great]]. Other dynasties that are considered imperial by historians are the [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]], [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], [[Kakatiya Empire|Kakatiya]], [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysala]] and the [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]].

[[Rudhramadevi]] (1259–1289) was one of the most prominent rulers of the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] on the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] Plateau, being one of the few ruling queens (empress) in Indian history.

After India was invaded by the Mongol Khans and Turkic Muslims, the rulers of their major states on the subcontinent were titled ''Sultān'', In this manner, the only empress-regnant ever to have actually sat on the throne of Delhi was [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]].  The [[Mughal Emperor]]s were the only Indian rulers for whom the term was consistently used by Western contemporaries. For the period from 1877 to 1947 when British Emperors ruled [[British India]] as the pearl in the crown of the British Empire, see above.

{{Main|Emperor of Ethiopia}}
[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]], [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] from 1930 to 1974.]]
From 1270 the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopia]] used the title {{transl|am|Nəgusä Nägäst}}, literally "King of Kings". The use of the ''king of kings'' style began a millennium earlier in this region, however, with the title being used by the Kings of [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksum]], beginning with [[Sembrouthes]] in the 3rd century.

Another title used by this dynasty was {{transl|am|Itegue Zetopia}}. {{transl|am|Itegue}} translates as Empress, and was used by the only reigning Empress, [[Zauditu of Ethiopia|Zauditu]], along with the official title {{transl|am|Negiste Negest}} ("Queen of Kings").

In 1936, the Italian king [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] claimed the title of [[Emperor of Ethiopia]] after Ethiopia was occupied by Italy during the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]]. After the defeat of the Italians by the British and the Ethiopians in 1941, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] was restored to the throne but Victor Emmanuel did not relinquish his claim to the title until 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vadala|first=Alexander Attilio|date=2011-01-01|title=Elite Distinction and Regime Change: The Ethiopian Case|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156913311x590664|journal=Comparative Sociology|volume=10|issue=4|pages=636–653|doi=10.1163/156913311X590664|issn=1569-1330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central African Empire===
{{Main|Emperor of Central Africa}}
In 1976, President [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]] of the [[Central African Republic]], proclaimed the country to be an autocratic [[Central African Empire]], and made himself Emperor as Bokassa I. The expenses of his coronation ceremony actually bankrupted the country. He was overthrown three years later and the republic was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/heads-of-states-and-governments-a-worldwide-encyclopedia-of-over-2300-leaders-1945-through-1992/oclc/30075961|title=Heads of states and governments: a worldwide encyclopedia of over 2,300 leaders, 1945 through 1992|last=Lentz|first=Harris M|date=1994-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0899509266|location=Jefferson, N.C.|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Asian tradition==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2015}}
The rulers of China and (once Westerners became aware of the role) Japan were always accepted in the West as emperors, and referred to as such.  The claims of other East Asian monarchies to the title may have been accepted for diplomatic purposes, but it was not necessarily used in more general contexts.

===China===
{{Main|Emperor of China}}
[[File:Qin Shi Huang BW.png|thumb|upright|Qin Shi Huang]]

The [[East Asian]] tradition is different from the Roman tradition, having arisen separately. What links them together is the use of the Chinese logographs 皇 (''huáng'') and 帝 (''dì'') which together or individually are imperial. Because of the cultural influence of China, China's neighbors adopted these titles or had their native titles conform in ''[[hanzi]]''. Anyone who spoke to the emperor was to address himself as bìxià (陛下, lit. the "Bottom of the Steps"), corresponding to "[[Imperial Majesty (style)|Imperial Majesty]]"; shèngshàng (聖上, lit. Holy Highness); or wànsuì (萬歲, lit. "You, of Ten Thousand Years").

In 221 BC, [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]], who was [[Chinese sovereign|king]] of [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] at the time, proclaimed himself ''[[Shi Huangdi]]'' (始皇帝), which translates as "first emperor". ''Huangdi'' is composed of ''huang'' ("august one", 皇) and ''di'' ("sage-king", 帝), and referred to legendary/mythological [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|sage-emperors]] living several millennia earlier, of which three were ''huang'' and five were ''di''. Thus Zheng became [[Qin Shi Huang]], abolishing the system where the ''huang''/''di'' titles were reserved to dead and/or mythological rulers. Since then, the title "king" became a lower ranked title, and later divided into two grades. Although not as popular, the title 王 ''wang'' (king or prince) was still used by many monarchs and dynasties in China up to the [[Taiping Rebellion|Taipings]] in the 19th century. 王 is pronounced ''vương'' in Vietnamese, ''ō'' in Japanese, and ''wang'' in Korean.

The imperial title continued in China until the [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown in 1912. The title was briefly revived from 12 December 1915 to 22 March 1916 by President [[Yuan Shikai]] and again in early July 1917 when General [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]] attempted to restore last Qing emperor [[Puyi]] to the throne. Puyi retained the title and attributes of a foreign emperor, as a personal status, until 1924. After the Japanese occupied [[Manchuria]] in 1931, they proclaimed it to be the Empire of [[Manchukuo]], and Puyi became emperor of Manchukuo. This empire ceased to exist when it was occupied by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In general, an emperor would have one empress (''Huanghou'', 皇后) at one time, although posthumous entitlement to empress for a [[concubines|concubine]] was not uncommon. The earliest known usage of ''huanghou'' was in the [[Han Dynasty]]. The emperor would generally select the empress from his [[concubine]]s. In subsequent dynasties, when the distinction between wife and concubine became more accentuated, the [[crown prince]] would have chosen an empress-designate before his reign. [[Early Imperial China|Imperial China]] produced only one reigning empress, [[Wu Zetian]], and she used the same Chinese title as an emperor (''Huangdi'', 皇帝). Wu Zetian then reigned for about 15 years (690–705 AD).

===Japan===
{{Main|Emperor of Japan}}
[[File:Emperor Showa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Hirohito]] (裕仁), or the [[Shōwa Emperor]] (昭和天皇), the last Japanese Emperor having ruled with prerogative powers, combined with assumption of divinity (photographed 1926).]]
{{cleanup|section|reason=The second paragraph contains many grammar mistakes.|date=June 2014}}

The earliest Emperor recorded in [[Kojiki]] and [[Nihon Shoki]] is [[Emperor Jimmu]], who is said to be a descendant of [[Amaterasu]]'s grandson Ninigi who descended from Heaven ([[Tenson kōrin]]). If one believes what is written in [[Nihon Shoki]], the Emperors have an unbroken direct male lineage that goes back more than 2,600 years.

In ancient Japan, the earliest titles for the sovereign were either ヤマト大王/大君 (''yamato ōkimi'', Grand King of Yamato), 倭王/倭国王 (''waō''/''wakokuō'', King of Wa, used externally), or 治天下大王 (''amenoshita shiroshimesu ōkimi'', Grand King who rules all under heaven, used internally). As early as the 7th century the word 天皇 (which can be read either as ''sumera no mikoto'', divine order, or as ''tennō'', Heavenly Emperor, the latter being derived from a Tang Chinese term referring to the Pole star around which all other stars revolve) began to be used. The earliest use of this term is found on a wooden slat, or ''[[mokkan]]'', unearthed in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture in 1998. The slat dated back to the reign of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jitō]]. The reading 'Tennō' has become the standard title for the Japanese sovereign up to the present age. The term 帝 (''mikado'', Emperor) is also found in literary sources.

Japanese monarchs were given their official title by the Chinese emperor. The new Japanese monarch after coming into power would send a representative to China and receive the anointment. They would receive their official title on several golden plates of several meters tall. Since the Japanese monarchs changed their title to 天皇 (Heavenly Emperor) in 607, the Chinese emperor refused to anoint the Japanese king, thus, ending relations with Japan for the next few hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/02/15/national/history/once-upon-a-time-china-anointed-a-king-of-japan/#.U2exSPldVRY|title=Once upon a time, China anointed a 'King of Japan' - The Japan Times|work=The Japan Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Japanese emperors used Chinese imperial titles,{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}, rarely was the Chinese-style "[[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]]" used. In the Japanese language, the word ''tennō'' is restricted to Japan's own monarch; ''kōtei'' (皇帝) is used for foreign emperors. Historically, [[Daijō-tennō|retired emperors]] often kept power over a child-emperor as de facto regent. For a long time, a ''[[shōgun]]'' (formally the imperial generalissimo, but made hereditary) or an [[Sesshō and Kampaku|imperial regent]] wielded actual political power. In fact, through much of Japanese history, the emperor has been little more than a figurehead.

After World War II, all claims of divinity were dropped (see [[Ningen-sengen]]). The Diet acquired all prerogative powers of the Crown, reverting the latter to a ceremonial role.&lt;ref&gt;Although the [[Emperor of Japan]] is classified as constitutional monarch among political scientists, the current constitution of Japan defines him only as 'a symbol of the nation' and no subsequent legislation states his status as the ([[head of state]]) or equates the Crown synonymously with any government establishment.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 20th century, Japan was the only country with an emperor on the throne.

As of the early 21st century, Japan's succession law prohibits a female from ascending the throne. With the birth of a daughter as the first child of the current [[crown prince]], [[Crown Prince Naruhito|Naruhito]], Japan [[Crown Prince Naruhito#Marriage and Family|considered abandoning that rule]]. However, shortly after the announcement that [[Princess Akishino|Princess Kiko]] was pregnant with her [[Prince Hisahito of Akishino|third child]], the proposal to alter the [[Imperial Household Law]] was suspended by [[Prime Minister]] [[Junichiro Koizumi]]. On 3 January 2007, after the birth of her son, [[Prince Hisahito]], Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] announced that he would drop the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070103/ap_on_re_as/japan_imperial_succession&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Keep this section updated in line with the page for Emperor of Japan --&gt;

Currently, many{{who|date=November 2016}} believe the new prince of Japan will ascend the throne, as the law defines. Historically, Japan has had eight reigning empresses who used the genderless title ''Tennō'', rather than the female consort title ''kōgō'' (皇后) or ''chūgū'' (中宮). There is ongoing discussion of the [[Japanese Imperial succession controversy]].
&lt;!--
Emperor's highest wife is called Kogo, and the female emperor is not called Kogo but Tenno as her male counterparts. The female emperor should be called (天皇 Ten-no) but Empress is usual in Western parlances. However, how should female emperor's husband be called? It has not been provided in Japan yet, because no female emperor was married when reigning: only single women (widows, unmarrieds) have been female emperors in history, or a wife or widow of an emperor or Crown Prince was made female Tenno (i. e., she was already Kogo or something like it).
--&gt;
Although current Japanese law prohibits female succession, all Japanese emperors claim to trace their lineage to ''[[Amaterasu]]'', the Sun Goddess of the [[Shinto|Shintō]] [[religion]]. &lt;!-- Shinto religion does not recognize a "supreme" kami, rather, kami and humans alike are viewed equally.--&gt; Thus, the Emperor is thought to be the highest authority of the Shinto religion, and one of his duties is to perform Shinto rituals for the people of Japan.

===Korea===
[[File:Gojong of the Korean Empire 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emperor Gojong]] of the [[Korean Empire]]]]

The rulers of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BC-668 AD) used the title of ''[[Taewang]]'' ([[Hangul]]: 태왕, [[Hanja]]: 太王), literally translated as the ''Greatest of the Kings''. Also some [[Silla]] (57 BC-935 AD) rulers including [[Beopheung of Silla|Beopheung]] and [[Jinheung of Silla|Jinheung]] used this title for their declaration of independence from the influence of [[Goguryeo]].

The rulers of [[Balhae]] (698–926) internally called themselves ''Seongwang'' ([[Hangul]]: 성왕, [[Hanja]]: 聖王).&lt;ref&gt;[[s:新唐書/卷219|New Book of Tang vol.209]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of [[Goryeo]] used the titles of emperor and [[Son of Heaven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Em |first1=Henry |title=The Great Enterprise: Sovereignty and Historiography in Modern Korea |date=2013 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822353725 |pages=24–26 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxAd2Aw_jP0C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Mongolian invasions]] (1231–1258), however, Korea relinquished the imperial title.

The rulers of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392–1897) still used the term "King of the Joseon" ([[Hangul]]: 조선국왕, [[Hanja]]: 朝鮮國王). In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–'95, Japan defeated the [[Qing Dynasty]] China, and the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] was concluded in which Japan had China recognize the independence and autonomy of Korea. However, [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]] used term of "His Majesty the Great Monarch" ([[Hangul]]: 대군주폐하, [[Hanja]]: 大君主陛下), not an official imperial title.

In 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the founding of the [[Korean Empire]] (1897–1910), and became emperor of Korea. [[Emperor Gojong]] declared the new [[Korean era name|era name]] "Gwangmu" ([[Hangul]]: 광무, [[Hanja]]: 光武, Warrior of light). The Korean Empire maintained their state until 1910 — though it was an Empire by name, it was in fact in the process of being absorbed by Japan.

===Mongolia===
Pre-Mongol Kingdoms such as the Xiongnu used the title "[[Chanyu|Chanu]]" meaning "Ruler of all" in old Mongolian. However it was not until the Chanu name was dropped and instead replaced by "Khan" that the rulers of Mongolia claimed the divine right as the ruler of all under the blue sky, this rule was closely tied with the ancient religious beliefs of the people of Mongolia ([[Tengrism]]). The title [[Khagan]] ([[Khan (title)|khan]] of khans or grand khan) was held by [[Genghis Khan]], founder of the [[Mongol Empire]] in 1206. After 1271, the emperors of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] also took the Chinese title ''huangdi'', or [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. Only the Khagans from Genghis Khan to the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 are normally referred to as Emperors in English.

===Vietnam===
[[File:Bảo Đại au pouvoir.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bảo Đại]], the last Emperor of Vietnam]]
Ngô Quyền, the first ruler of [[Đại Việt]] as an independent state, used the title ''Vương'' (王, ''King''). However, after the death of Ngô Quyền, the country immersed in a civil war known as [[12 Warlords Rebellion|Chaos of the 12 Lords]] that lasted for over 20 years. In the end, [[Đinh Bộ Lĩnh]] unified the country after defeating all the warlords and became the first ruler of Đại Việt to use the title ''Hoàng Đế'' (皇帝, ''Emperor'') in 968. Succeeding rulers in Vietnam then continued to use this Emperor title until 1806 when this title was stopped being used for a century.

Đinh Bộ Lĩnh wasn't the first to claim the title of ''Đế'' (帝, ''Emperor''). Before him, [[Lý Bí]] and [[Mai Thúc Loan]] also claimed this title. However, their rules were very short lived.

The Vietnamese emperors also gave this title to their ancestors who were lords or influence figures in the previous dynasty like the Chinese emperors. This practice is one of many indications of the idea "Vietnam's equality with China" which remained intact up to the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Tuyet Nhung Tran, Anthony J. S. Reid|title=Việt Nam Borderless Histories|year=2006|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-299-21770-9|ref=harv|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 the newly established Nguyễn dynasty requested canonization from Chinese [[Jiaqing Emperor]] and received the title ''Quốc Vương'' (國王, ''King of a State)'' and the name of the country as ''An Nam'' (安南) instead ''Đại Việt'' (大越). To avoid unnecessary armed conflicts, the Vietnamese rulers accepted this in diplomatic relation and use the title Emperor only domestically. However, Vietnamese rulers never accepted the vassalage relationship with China and always refused to come to Chinese courts to pay homage to Chinese rulers (a sign of vassalage acceptance). China waged a number of wars against Vietnam throughout history, and after each failure, settled for the tributary relationship. The Yuan dynasty under [[Kublai Khan]] waged three wars against Vietnam to force it into a vassalage relationship but after successive failures, [[Kublai Khan]]'s successor, [[Temür Khan]], finally settled for a tributary relationship with Vietnam. Vietnam sent tributary missions to China once in three years (with some periods of disruptions) until the 19th century, [[Sino-French War]] France replaced China in control of northern Vietnam.

The emperors of the last dynasty of Vietnam continued to hold this title until the French conquered Vietnam. The emperor, however, was then a puppet figure only and could easily be disposed of by the French for more pro-France figure. Japan took Vietnam from France and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]-occupied Vietnam was declared an [[Empire of Vietnam|empire]] by the Japanese in March 1945. The line of emperors came to an end with [[Bảo Đại]], who was deposed after the war, although he later served as head of state of [[South Vietnam]] from 1949-55.

==Oceania==
The lone holders of the imperial title in [[Oceania]] were the heads of the semi-mythical [[Tuʻi Tonga Empire]].

'''The European Firearms Directive''' is a law of the [[European Union]] which sets minimum standards regarding civilian firearms acquisition and possession that EU Member States must implement into their national legal systems.

The Member States are free to adopt more stringent rules, which leads to differences in the extent of citizens' legal access to firearms within different EU countries – see ''[[Overview of gun laws by nation#European Union|Gun laws in European Union countries]]''.

The 1985 [[White Paper]] on completion of the [[internal market]] (by the [[European Commission]]) stressed that the absence of border checks must not provide an incentive to buy arms in countries with less strict legislation. This goal was to be reached by approximation of the countries' national legislation on firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Prior to abolition of the internal border controls under the [[Schengen Agreement]], the Council of the European Communities adopted the Directive '''91/477/EEC''', which was later, in 2008, amended by Directive '''2008/51/EC'''. As a Directive, it is not a self-executing norm, but a legislative act which requires [[Member State of the European Union|Member State]] to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving it. Member States must meet the minimum requirements laid down by the directive, but may also elect to adopt more stringent rules.&lt;ref name="dir3"&gt;''European Firearms Directive, Art. 3''&lt;/ref&gt; Certain countries such as the United Kingdom are thus unaffected as they have maintained more stringent gun control laws than those effectively set as a minimum by the European Union, while others, like the [[Czech Republic]], were forced to introduce more regulation in their national legislation.

The original Directive No. 91/477/EC was adopted in 1991 on the background of abolition of intra-Community frontiers. It aimed at partial approximation of national legislation that would prevent passing possession of firearms from one Member State to another, unless it is done according to rules established by the Directive. At the same time, the Directive introduced the [[European Firearms Pass]] that would allow hunters and [[target shooter]]s to move between the Member States without unnecessary impediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

That, however, does not apply to a journey through Member States that have more stringent laws and generally prohibit such firearms within their territory.&lt;ref name="dir12"&gt;''European Firearms Directive, Art. 12.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amending Directive No. 2008/51/EC==

Following the signing of the United Nations Protocol on the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts, components and ammunition, annexed to the Convention against transnational organised crime, the European Council and Parliament noted the need to amend the existing firearms directive in order to bring European legislation in line with the UN Protocol rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The main aim of the Commission proposal rested in banning B7 firearms (and objects that look alike).

Opponents point out that no such firearm has previously been used during commitment of a terror attack in EU. Of 31 terror attacks committed in the EU in the years preceding the Commissions proposal, 9 were committed with guns, the other 22 with explosives or other means ([[2016 Nice attack|truck in Nice]]). Of these 9, 8 cases made use of either illegally smuggled or illegally refurbished deactivated firearms (for which the European Commission didn't enact any rules, despite being tasked to do so in the Directive No. 2008/51/EC, see above) while during the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]] a military rifle stolen from the army, was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armietiro.it/le-b7-mai-usate-armi-8075| title=Le B7?

The European Commission didn't present an impact assessment for the proposed amendment Directive. One was prepared by the Czech Ministry of Interior, according to which the main impacts of the proposed Directive amendment, if accepted, would be:&lt;ref name="impas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/analyza-moznych-dopadu-revize-smernice-o-kontrole-strelnych-zbrani.aspx| title=Analýza možných dopadů revize směrnice 91/477/EHS o kontrole nabývání a držení střelných zbraní |publisher=Czech Ministry of Interior|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Risks to internal security''' due to possible transfer of legal firearms into illegality and potentially black market, into hands of criminals and terrorists, as many owners would refuse to surrender their firearms.
* '''Risk to defensive capabilities''' due to crippling of firearms manufacturing and possible move of small arms factories abroad.
* '''Threat to national culture''' due to destroying of private collectors and museums owned firearms.
* '''Rise of unemployment''' connected with crippling of legal firearms manufacturing and trade.
* '''Impact on hunting''' due to restrictions of semi-automatic rifles, leading to rise in animal-car accidents and connected damages, injuries and deaths.
* '''Impact on state budget''' due to combination of having to pay up to tens of billions Czech crowns (billions of Euros) as compensation for banned firearms and rise in unemployment

The [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union#List of rotations|Dutch EU Presidency]] introduced 2nd reworked version of the amendment proposal on 4 April 2016. Apart from taking over all of Commission's proposals, Netherlands went further with proposing, among other things, a total ban on all semi-automatic firearms capable of being fitted with a magazine with more than six rounds, i.e. all pistols and most existing semi-automatic rifles.&lt;ref name="impas"/&gt;

Three weeks later, the Dutch presidency introduced a third version of the amendment proposal. This time Netherlands proposed, on top of EU Commission proposal, to ban self-loading firearms that have a magazine with more than 20 rounds attached, as well as ban such magazines themselves. According to Czech Ministry of Interior Impact Assessment it would make a total chaos in firearms categorisation (i.e. a firearm would be B category when a 15 round magazine is inserted, and A category a second later after inserting a different, larger magazine) as well as vagueness, as it allowed also interpretation that all firearms that might potentially accept a larger than 20 rounds magazines might be themselves banned. The Impact Assessment further pointed out that millions of now legally owned standard capacity magazines could be expected to flow into the black market. Moreover, such firearms could only be owned only for hunting and sporting purposes, having crippling effect in countries where self defence is prevailing reason for firearm possession, such as the Czech Republic. To appeal to some disagreeing countries (Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland), the proposal now included special exemptions for firearms possessions by military reserve or militia members.&lt;ref name="impas"/&gt;

The Dutch Presidency proposed to remove the entire D category of firearms and move the firearms into C category, i.e. making for example muzzle loaders subject to same rules as firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guns.com/2016/06/08/then-they-came-for-the-muzzleloaders-eu-moves-to-regulate-black-powder-guns-due-to-terrorism-video/| title=Then they came for the muzzleloaders: EU moves to regulate black powder guns due to terrorism |publisher=Guns.com|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LIBE and IMCO EP Committees amendment proposals====
The amendment proposal was introduced at the European Parliaments' Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO). Its members slammed the proposal as "unworkable". According to IMCO chair [[Vicky Ford]], the Commission proposal "was poorly worded and we need to make sure that the legislation is practicable."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/parliament-slams-commissions-unworkable-gun-law-proposals| title=Parliament slams Commission's 'unworkable' gun law proposals |work=Parliament Magazine|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led to filing of over 900 proposals for changes to the Commission amendment proposal.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

====Trilogue final proposal====
&lt;div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; width: 21.5em; text-align: right; font-size: 0.86em; font-family: lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"&gt;
&lt;div style="border: 1px solid #999999; background: #fffffa; text-align: left; padding: 1em 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;
'''Trilogue''' is a process of closed-door meetings between selected representatives of European Commission, Council and Parliament, that leave no publicly available papertrail as regards decision making of EU legislation. It usually ends in first reading legislation approval in Parliament with no public political debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/where-european-democracy-goes-to-die-european-parliament/| title=Where European democracy goes to die |publisher=Politico|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Instead of going through the standard process of up to three rounds of debate and amendment between the Council and the Parliament, the Firearms Directive Amendment proposal entered the Trilogue.

=====COREPER=====
The [[European Council]]'s position on the issue was negotiated through [[Committee of Permanent Representatives]] (COREPER). In a leaked "non-paper" that was sent to other countries' representations shortly before the 30 November 2016 meeting, the Permanent Representation of France to the EU pointed out that France, (Germany), Italy and Spain consider the following as particularly essential goals:&lt;ref name="non-paper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunlex.cz/component/attachments/download/197| title=Non-paper on the revision of Council directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons |publisher=Permanent Representation of France to the EU|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="106Fredom of information act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunlex.cz/component/attachments/download/198| title= Odpověď na žádost o informace [Answer to information request under the Freedom of Information Act] |publisher=Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lex106"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gunlex.cz/clanky/hlavni-clanky/75-dulezite/2674-jak-to-chodi-v-bruselu| title=Jak to chodí v Bruselu [The way it is done in Brussels] |publisher=Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* total ban on semiautomatic firearms that were converted from automatic ones and subjecting "salute and acousting weapons" to the Directive regime,
* definition of precise derogations from prohibitions that would avoid invocation of internal security derogation,
* implementation of Europe-wide system for exchange of information,
* ensuring close control of sales of firearms, especially by means of distance communication, and
* exclusion of technical standards for deactivation from the scope of the directive.

On 20 December 2016, the COREPER, which included a representative of Switzerland (the rules extend to the country due to its membership of [[Schengen Area]]) reached a majority decision in favour of the proposed amendment. Only two countries opposed: Luxembourg, which would prefer more firearm restrictions, and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/security/news/eu-states-reach-difficult-compromise-on-firearms/| title=EU states reach difficult compromise on firearms |publisher=Euractiv|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Czech Republic further lodged a declaration of reservations which was published by the Czech Ministry of Interior. According to the declaration key elements of the proposal are inappropriate in substance and legally unclear and sometimes disproportionate. It further included regrets over unclear, unnecessary, overbroad and injudicious prohibitions of some semi-automatic firearms which may "cause transfer of significant portion of firearms that are held legally now into illegal ownership or even black market and thus increase their availability to terrorists and criminals". The Czech Republic also stated concern about last minute changes to the proposal about which the Member States were not informed in advance and thus could not properly evaluate their impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/declaration-of-the-czech-republic-firearms.aspx| title=Declaration of the Czech Republic on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons |publisher=Government of the Czech Republic|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The COREPER version was closer to the second Dutch proposal (third reworked version) than to original Commission version.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=====IMCO=====
[[File:ZB_vz._26_at_Great_Patriotic_War_museum_in_Smolensk.jpg|thumb|right|Under 2015 Commission proposal, "A" category firearms, such as this museum owned WW2 [[ZB vz. 26|ZB.26]], would need to be destroyed or deactivated,&lt;ref name="Art6destruction" /&gt;]]
On 26 January 2017, IMCO Committee accepted the COREPER amendment proposal by majority of 25 to 9 votes. Among those that did not support the proposal were all four Czech committee members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://polcms.secure.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/upload/938523eb-57a5-433f-859f-e3d54f9f769f/roll%20call%20vote%2026%20January%202017.pdf| title=Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection: Result of roll-call votes of 26 January 2017 |publisher=IMCO|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vicky Ford, the IMCO negotiators amended the proposal to defend the interests of legal owners and close some loopholes, especially on poorly deactivated firearms. Ford commented that she would prefer a version that would not include magazine limitations, however she accepted it as it was of extreme importance to some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audiovisual.europarl.europa.eu/Assetdetail.aspx?id=13a48fb0-e9c6-469b-a482-a70700bad183| title=Control of the acquisition and possession of weapons: extracts from the vote and statement by Vicky Ford (ECR, UK) |publisher=European Parliament|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow rapporteur [[Dita Charanzová]] said that she has never in her career met a proposal that would be this much politicised, with the Commission exercising extreme pressure especially by the end of the negotiations. Charanzová said that, since first proposing the amendment in 2015, the Commission had not presented an Impact Assessment, although it is required by its own legislative rules and although she had asked for it numerous times. She further asked the Commission what it had done with over 28,000 inputs gained during public consultation phase, but to no avail. Further, representatives of the Commission would often bring last minute changes to meetings they couldn't justify – at one point trying to answer her objection "with a definition taken from Wikipedia". Charanzová also noted the rise of anti-EU sentiment connected with the proposal.&lt;ref name="char"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firearms-united.com/2017/02/19/eu-gun-ban-dita-charanzova-speaks-out-to-firearms-united/| title=EU Gun Ban: Dita Charanzová speaks out to Firearms United |publisher=Firearms United|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mylène Troszczynski]] filed a minority opinion on behalf of the [[Europe of Nations and Freedom|ENF]], according to which the legislation "seeks only to restrict the civil liberties of blameless citizens in their efforts to acquire and possess firearms".&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

====European Parliament Vote====
The European Parliament voted on the proposal during its session on 14 March 2017.

There were altogether 164 proposals for amendments filed by MEPs that sought to change the text negotiated in the Trialogue.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament Art. 53(3), any provisional agreement reached in the Trialogue under Art 69f(4) "shall be given priority in voting and shall be put to a single vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEP Dita Charanzová put forward a motion on behalf of the [[ALDE Group]] that would allow voting on the MEPs' proposals for changes, arguing that the plenary "has never had the opportunity to take the position on this important text as it was negotiated directly by the Committee, therefore I ask all my colleagues to vote in favor of this request which would simply allow all members to express their opinions". Vicky Ford then argued that these amendments had been debated in the Committee, discussed with the Council and ultimately rejected by the Member States. She argued that adopting the amendments would "destabilize the entire agreement", throwing away "all the hard work" and "success that the Parliament has had in improving the text". Charanzová's proposal was rejected by unknown margin, as, according to chair "the vote was absolutely clear for everyone to see, there is no point in having a check" with no record of number of votes cast being made.&lt;ref name="session coverage"&gt;{{Citation

====European Council vote====
European Council approved the proposal by majority vote on 25 April 2017. The Czech Republic, Luxembourg and Poland voted against the proposal.

====Publishing====
The Directive was published under No. (EU) 2017/853 on 17 May 2017 in the Official Journal. Member States will have 15 months to implement the Directive into their national legal systems.

===Content===
{{col-begin}}

====Newly prohibited firearms====
{{col-2}}
Under the 2017 Directive, certain firearms formerly classified as B category (''subject to authorization'') firearms are newly reclassified as A category (''prohibited'') firearms and thus they are banned for certain classes of civilians. These are:
* '''converted semi-automatic firearms''', i.e. automatic firearms, which have been converted into semi-automatic firearms&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 19(b)(ii)(6.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
** This ban will affect especially countries where converted former government surplus firearms are popular for home defence or hunting, such as the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="impas" /&gt;
** During the drafting of Directive, the ban was contested due to the fact that up to 2017 Directive, there were no records of which firearms were newly made semi-automatic ones and which were converted to semi-automatic from government surplus select fire firearms (for example vz.58 are offered in both variants, with the only practical difference to end user being double price of those not falling under the ban).&lt;ref name="impas" /&gt;
* '''standard capacity magazines''' possession by legal gun owners&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 19(b)(ii)(7.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
** The 2017 Directive prohibits legal gun owners from possessing a loading device with capacity of more than 21 rounds in case of short firearms (pistols) and more than 11 rounds in case of long firearms (rifles). If inserted into a given class firearm, the legal gun owner should lose authorisation to acquire and possess a B category firearm.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 5(3)''&lt;/ref&gt;
** The Directive does not include any penalty for possession of such loading device by a person other than a B category firearm authorisation holder.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 5(3) a contrario''&lt;/ref&gt;
** During the drafting of Directive, standard capacity magazines for semi-automatic rifles were either 20 (for [[5.56×45mm]] cartridges typical in Switzerland) or 30 rounds (for [[7.62×39mm]] or [[5.56×45mm]] cartridges typical in most of the EU).&lt;ref name="impas" /&gt;
** The ban was labelled as unenforceable due to a very large number of standard capacity magazines in circulation. Moreover, certain magazines may be inserted into both short and long firearms, or may accept various types of ammunition with differing capacity count for each.&lt;ref name="impas" /&gt;
* '''personal defence weapons''' (PDW), i.e. semi-automatic long firearms (firearms that are originally intended to be fired from the shoulder) that can be reduced to a length of less than 60&amp;nbsp;cm without losing functionality by means of a folding or telescoping stock or by a stock that can be removed without using tools&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 19(b)(ii)(8.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
** This category of firearms is especially popular for home defence in countries like the Czech Republic.
* '''theater and re-enactment firearms''' (i.e. those firing blanks, irritants, other active substances or pyrotechnic rounds or salute or acoustic weapons) if they originated by conversion from an A category firearm&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 19(b)(ii)(9.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
** Protests against this part of Directive included military re-enactment societies conducting parts of re-enactment battles armed with brooms and bananas instead of blank firing guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.novinky.cz/domaci/438393-proti-regulaci-zbrani-bojovali-milovnici-vojenske-historie-s-kostaty-v-ruce.html|title=Proti regulaci zbraní bojovali milovníci vojenské historie s košťaty v ruce [Reenactors fight against firearms regulation with broomsticks in hands]|date=20 May 2017|publisher=novinky.cz|accessdate=11 June 2017|language=Czech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{col-2}}
The Directive, however, includes several exemptions that Member States ''may'' enact and under which the above mention banned firearms may either remain in possession of existing owners or may be acquired by new owners:
* '''sport shooters''', who may acquire and possess converted semi-automatic firearms and standard capacity magazines (not PDW), subject to:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 6(6.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
** a satisfactory assessment of conditions of authorisation, including relevant medical and psychological information; ''and''
** provision of proof that the target shooter concerned is actively practising for or participating in shooting competitions recognised by an officially recognised shooting sports organisation of the Member State concerned or by an internationally established and officially recognised shooting sport federation; ''and''
** provision of a certificate from an officially recognised shooting sports organisation confirming that (i) the target shooter is a member of a shooting club and has been regularly practising target shooting in it for at least 12 months and (ii) the firearm in question fulfils the specifications required for a shooting discipline recognised by an internationally established and officially recognised shooting sport federation.
* '''Swiss Militiamen''',&lt;ref&gt;The Directive does not refer to Swiss Militiamen per se, it refers to: ''"As regards firearms classified in point 6 of category A, Member States applying a military system based on general conscription and having in place over the last 50 years a system of transfer of military firearms to persons leaving the army after fulfilling their military duties may grant to those persons, in their capacity as a target shooter, an authorisation to keep one firearm used during the mandatory military period. The relevant public authority shall transform those firearms into semi-automatic firearms and shall periodically check that the persons using such firearms do not represent a risk to public security. The provisions set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph shall apply.''" There is no other country with similar system existing in the EU.&lt;/ref&gt; who may keep their service rifles if converted to semi-automatic only (their PDW as well as standard capacity magazines are however not exempt from the ban) and if they fulfill the same conditions as the sport shooters (above)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* '''collectors''', who may gain ''"in individual special cases, exceptionally and in a duly reasoned manner, authorisations to acquire and possess"'' A category firearms;&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 6(3.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''museums'''&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 6(5.)''&lt;/ref&gt; and '''dealers''',&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 6(4.)''&lt;/ref&gt; subject to strict conditions regarding security
* others for '''security purposes''' (i.e. protection of the security of critical infrastructure, commercial shipping, high-value convoys and sensitive premises, as well as for national defence, educational, cultural, research and historical purposes) ''"subject to authorisation given in individual cases, exceptionally and in a duly reasoned manner"''&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 6(2.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''existing owners''' of firearms acquired and registered before 13 June 2017 (converted semi-auto firearms, standard capacity magazines, PDW, ''not'' theatre or re-enactment firearms).&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Art. 7(b)(4a.)''&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

====Deactivated firearms====
European Commission has been tasked to enact rules for proper deactivation of firearms under the Directive No. 2008/51/EC of 21 May 2008&lt;ref&gt;''Directive No. 2008/51/EC'' Annex 1''&lt;/ref&gt; and did so on 19 December 2015 through Regulation No. (EU) 2015/2403.&lt;ref name="deactivation regulation" /&gt; While the Regulation was adopted to ensure that deactivated firearms may not be refurbished to function again, the 2017 Directive set forth that possession of A and B category firearms deactivated under the Regulation shall be subject to same rules as possession of live C category firearms.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Annex 1''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exchange of information====
Under the 2017 Directive, the Commission is tasked to provide a system for exchange of information between Member states on the authorisations granted for the transfer of firearms to another Member State and information with regard to refusals to grant authorisations as provided for in Articles 6 and 7 on grounds of security or relating to the reliability of the person concerned.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Article 14(4)''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitoring of gun owners, authorisation limitation====
Member states shall have in place a monitoring system to ensure that the conditions of authorisation set by national law are met throughout the duration of the authorisation and, inter alia, relevant medical and psychological information is assessed. In case conditions of authorisation are not met, the State shall withdraw the authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Article 5(2)''&lt;/ref&gt;

Authorization for possession of firearms be shall be reviewed periodically in intervals not exceeding 5 years and renewed or prolonged if conditions of its granting are still met.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Article 7(4)''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Directive review====
The Commission shall by 14 September 2020 and then periodically every 5 years submit a report on the Directive and propose further changes.&lt;ref&gt;''Directive (EU) 2017/853, Article 17''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Firearms categorisation====
Firearms categorisation underwent a general overhaul.

====European Court of Justice challenge====

The [[Government of the Czech Republic|Czech Government]] announced that the country will challenge the proposed amendment Directive before the [[European Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/otazky-vaclava-moravce-milan-chovanec-stanislav-polcak-smernice-drzeni-zbrane-1yy-/domaci.aspx?c=A170122_124621_domaci_fer| title=Napadneme evropskou směrnici, která chce lidem vzít zbraně, řekl Chovanec [Chovanec said: We will challenge the European Directive that aims at taking away people's ability to be armed.] |publisher=Euractiv|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 17 August 2017 at the latest due to its impact on legal owners of historical replicas, semi-automatic firearms and standard capacity magazines. According to the Ministry of Interior, the Directive will affect law-abiding owners of hundreds of thousands firearms and well over a million firearm magazines.&lt;ref name="chov1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/docDetail.aspx?docid=22075645&amp;docType=ART| title=ČR podá žalobu proti směrnici EU o zbraních [CR will file suit against the European Firearms Directive] |publisher=Ministry of Interior|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Interior, [[Milan Chovanec]] commented: "Filing the suit gives me no pleasure, but there is no other option left. The Directive violates the principle of proportionality as well as prohibition of discrimination. We shall not allow the EU to use the guise of fight against terrorism in order to disproportionately infringe onto the Member States' scope of authority and citizens' rights. The EU Gun Ban would affect almost all of the 300,000 legal gun owners in the country. This is why we will lodge not only the suit to invalidate the Directive, but also propose postponement of Directive's effectiveness."&lt;ref name="chov1" /&gt; The suit against the 2017 Amending Directive was filed on 9 August 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-guncontrol-czech-idUSKBN1AP1SA| title=Czechs take legal action over EU rules on gun control |agency=Reuters|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the meantime both Hungary and Poland joined the proceedings. The Czech Republic bases the suit on the following reasoning:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/vecne-shrnuti-zaloby.aspx| title=Věcné shrnutí žaloby České Republic proti Evropskému parlamentu a Radě [Summary of Czech Republic suit against the European Parliament and Council of the EU] |publisher=Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''EU legislatory over-reach''': The Directive was adopted based on the Art. 114 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] which authorises the EU to adopt acts aimed at approximation of national laws for the purpose of the establishment and functioning of the internal market. Even though based on the TFEU Art. 114, the Directive aims solely at prevention of crime and terrorism. However, the EU lacks legal basis for adopting harmonisation acts in this field – Article 84 of TFEU explicitly prevents the EU from harmonising Member State laws in this area.
* '''The Directive is disproportionate''': EU failed to consider proportionality of the adopted Directive and intentionally didn't obtain sufficient information on the issue. The failure to obtain sufficient information led to adoption of measures which are not only clearly disproportionate to its aim, but also completely unable to achieve them. The rate of crimes involving use of legal firearms in EU is marginal. The only end the Directive may achieve is curbing rights of law-abiding citizens which has no effect on terrorism. EU should focus on effective fight against illegal firearms, co-operation of police authorities and better exchange of information between Member States.
* '''The Directive is in breach of principle of legal certainty''': A number of Directive's Articles are vague and ambiguous, making it unclear as regards what rights and obligations are set by them. This applies especially to magazine restriction limits and PDW limitations.
* '''Article 6(6) of the Directive is discriminatory''': Specifically, a part of Article 6(6) of the Directive provides a special exemption that may be applied only by Switzerland which makes it discriminatory and should thus be nullified.

====Czech Constitutional Amendment Proposal====
{{Main|Gun laws in the Czech Republic#2016 Constitutional Amendment Proposal}}
On 15 December 2016, Czech Ministry of Interior introduced a proposal to amend [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Act No. 110/1998 Col., on Security of the Czech Republic]] expressly providing the right to be armed as part of citizen's duty of participation in provision of internal order, security and democratic order. The proposal aimed at making use of [[European Union law#Constitutional law|EU Primary Law]] internal security derogation .&lt;ref name="Con am"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose lays at utilisation of already existing specific conditions as regards firearms ownership in the Czech Republic (240.000 people having concealed carry licence, high level of ownership of semi-automatic firearms suitable for self-defense as compared to other EU countries) for security purposes, whereby firearms owners should contribute to [[soft target]]s protection.&lt;ref name="Con am" /&gt;

On 6 February 2017, the proposal was lodged by 36 members of parliament into legislative process. It must gain support of 3/5 of all Members of [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] and 3/5 of [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senators]] present to be passed.
This proposal was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on 28 June 2017 with a solid majority of 139:9

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2017, the proposal was rejected by the Senate. Since the Chamber of Deputies cannot overturn Senate rejection of proposed changes of constitution, this means the end of the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lidovky.cz/senat-rozhodl-neschvalil-legalnim-drzitelum-zbrani-zasahovat-pb6-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A171206_221433_ln_domov_ele|title=Senát neschválil legálním držitelům zbraní zasahovat k zajištění bezpečnosti státu {{!}} Domov|date=6 December 2017|website=Lidové noviny|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possible Swiss referendum====

According to [[Swiss People's Party]] vice-president [[Christoph Blocher]], Switzerland should consider abandoning EU's borderless [[Schengen Area]] if the Swiss people reject the proposed measures in a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swiss-eu-guns-idUSKCN1161KT| title=Swiss tell EU: Hands off veterans' assault rifles |agency=Reuters|accessdate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ex parte Curtis''''', {{ussc|106|371|1882|el=no}}, is an 8-1 ruling by the [[United States Supreme Court]] that the Act of August 15, 1876 was a constitutional exercise of the [[enumerated powers]] of the [[United States Congress]] under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] of the [[United States Constitution]].

The petitioner had been convicted of receiving money for political purposes in violation of the Act. The petitioner asked the Supreme Court for a [[writ of habeas corpus]].

==Majority opinion==
[[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Morrison Waite]] wrote the opinion for the majority. The constitutional grounds under which the petitioner challenged the Act were not discussed by the Court. Waite noted that Congress had a lengthy history of passing laws restricting the rights and privileges of civil servants, and the constitutionality of such laws had never before been challenged. 

Next, Waite affirmed that Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution clearly gave Congress the power to determine for itself what was proper in the realm of reining in political corruption:
:The evident purpose of Congress in all this class of enactments has been to promote efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and to maintain proper discipline in the public service. Clearly such a purpose is within the just scope of legislative power, and it is not easy to see why the act now under consideration does not come fairly within the legitimate means to such an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Ex parte Curtis|link=|volume=106|page=371|pin=373|year=1882}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waite refused to pass judgment on the validity of the writ of habeas corpus, concluding that the Supreme Court's "jurisdiction is limited to the single question of the power of the court to commit the prisoner for the act of which he has been convicted."&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Curtis,'' 106 U.S. at 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissenting opinion==
[[Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court|Associate Justice]] [[Joseph P. Bradley]] dissented. He concluded that the Act impermissibly infringed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association:
:The offices of the government do not belong to the Legislative Department to dispose of on any conditions it may choose to impose.... To deny to a man the privilege of associating and making joint contributions with such other citizens as he may choose, is an unjust restraint of his right to propagate and promote his views on public affairs. The freedom of speech and of the press, and that of assembling together to consult upon and discuss matters of public interest, and to join in petitioning for a redress of grievances, are expressly secured by the Constitution.The spirit of this clause covers and embraces the right of every citizen to engage in such discussions, and to promote the views of himself and his associates freely, without being trammelled by inconvenient restrictions. Such restrictions, in my judgment, are imposed by the law in question.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Curtis,'' 106 U.S. at 376-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Bradley also concluded that the Act was overbroad and that the same positive ends (ending political corruption) could have been achieved by alternative, narrower means.&lt;ref&gt;''Ex parte Curtis,'' 106 U.S. at 377.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
One of the interesting aspects of the majority's decision is that it believed Congress prohibited not civil servants from making political donations on their own but making such donations through their supervisors.&lt;ref name="Rabin"&gt;Rabin, Jack; Vocino, Thomas; Hildreth, W. Bartley; and Miller, Gerald J. ''Handbook of Public Personnel Administration.'' Washington, D.C.: CRC Press, 1994, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Bradley dissented, in part, by arguing that the law banned even voluntary contributions made through superiors (a ban that he felt was unconstitutional).&lt;ref name="Rabin" /&gt;

At least one commentator has concluded that ''Ex parte Curtis'' is still "good law."&lt;ref name="Rabin" /&gt;

'''Fumaric acid''' or '''''trans''-butenedioic acid''' is the [[chemical compound]] with the formula HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CCH=CHCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H. Fumaric acid has a [[fruit]]-like [[taste]] and has been used as a food acidulant since 1946. Its [[E number]] is E297.

==Synopsis==
It is produced in [[eukaryotic]] organisms from [[succinate]] in complex 2 of the electron transport chain via the [[enzyme]] [[succinate dehydrogenase]].  It is one of two [[cis-trans isomerism|isomeric]] unsaturated [[dicarboxylic acid]]s, the other being [[maleic acid]].  In fumaric acid the carboxylic acid groups are ''trans'' (''E'') and in maleic acid they are ''cis'' (''Z'').

The [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ester]]s are known as '''fumarates'''.  Fumarate can also refer to the {{chem|C|4|H|2|O|4|2−}} ion (in solution).

==Uses==

===Food===
Fumaric acid has been used as a food acidulant since 1946. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU,&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; USA&lt;ref&gt;US Food and Drug Administration: {{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/ucm191033.htm#ftnT |title=Listing of Food Additives Status Part II |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code{{cite web |url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2011C00827 |title=Standard 1.2.4 - Labelling of ingredients |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[food additive]], it is used as an [[acidity regulator]] and can be denoted by the [[E number]] E297. It is generally used in beverages and [[baking powder]]s for which requirements are placed on purity. Fumaric acid is used in the making of [[wheat tortilla]]s as a food preservative and as the acid in leavening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thechemco.com/chemical/fumaric-acid/|title=Fumaric Acid - The Chemical Company|work=The Chemical Company|access-date=2018-04-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally used as a substitute for [[tartaric acid]] and occasionally in place of [[citric acid]], at a rate of 1&amp;nbsp;g of fumaric acid to every ~1.5&amp;nbsp;g of citric acid, in order to add [[Taste#Sourness|sourness]], similarly to the way [[malic acid]] is used. As well as being a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as "Salt and Vinegar" flavored potato chips,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/09/the-best-salt-and-vinegar-chips-tasting-brands-most-acidic.html|title=The Science Behind Salt and Vinegar Chips|first=Serious|last=Eats|date=|website=www.seriouseats.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is also used as a [[flocculation|coagulant]] in stove-top pudding mixes.

The European Commission Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, part of [[Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety|DG Health]], found in 2014 that fumaric acid is "practically non-toxic" but high doses are probably [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] after long-term use.&lt;ref name=ecscfa/&gt;

===Medicine===
In patients with relapsing-remitting [[multiple sclerosis]], the [[ester]] [[dimethyl fumarate]] (BG-12, Biogen) significantly reduced relapse and disability progression in a phase 3 trial. It activates the [[Nrf2]] antioxidant response pathway, the primary cellular defense against the cytotoxic effects of oxidative stress.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Study of Oral BG-12 for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis| journal = N Engl J Med | date = September 20, 2012|author1=Gold R. |author2=Kappos L. |author3=Arnold D.L. | volume =367| issue =12| pages =1098–1107| url =http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1114287| doi =10.1056/NEJMoa1114287| pmid =22992073| pmc =| display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psoriasis====
Various fumaric acid esters (FAES) have specific [[homeostasis|immunomodulating]] (respectively moderate [[immunosuppression]]) properties which are responsible for certain effects in the treatment of [[psoriasis]]. In the Netherlands, Germany, Austria and the Benelux countries substances derived from fumaric acid have been used for half a century for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Balak DM, Fallah Arani S, Hajdarbegovic E, Hagemans CA, Bramer WM, Thio HB, Neumann HA|title=Efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of fumaric acid esters in the treatment of psoriasis: a systematic review of randomized and observational studies|journal=Br. J. Dermatol.|volume=|issue=|pages=|year=2016|pmid=26919824|doi=10.1111/bjd.14500|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although it seems that a certain effectiveness exists (and many studies have confirmed the effect), more statistically powerful studies are necessary to provide better evidence of the effectiveness of fumaric acid esters in treatment of psoriasis (e.g. more accurate in terms of the dermatological nosology of this autoimmune disease). Such studies should in the future help specify which psoriasis variants (in terms of the course, the immunological profile of the patient etc.) are suited to be treated with fumaric acid esters.

Fumaric acid is naturally present in the herb called [[Fumaria officinalis]]. The top of this herb is used to treat various skin disorders including psoriasis. Baths with this herb have been used for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Amenta R, Camarda L, Di Stefano V, Lentini F, Venza F|title=Traditional medicine as a source of new therapeutic agents against psoriasis|journal=Fitoterapia|volume=71 Suppl 1|issue=|pages=S13–20|year=2000|pmid=10930708|doi=10.1016/s0367-326x(00)00172-6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At present, these baths (after consultation with a general practitioner or dermatologist) are used as an adjunct therapy to basic treatment.

===Other uses===
Fumaric acid is used in the manufacture of [[polyester]] [[resin]]s and [[polyhydric alcohol]]s and as a [[mordant]] for dyes.
Since the early 21st century, it has been used to synthesize one of the first [[metal-organic framework]]s presenting commercial applications thanks to its remarkable adsorption and mechanical properties, combined with a low toxicity compared to other well-studied MOFs.&lt;ref name="Yot"&gt;{{cite journal| title = Mechanical energy storage performance of an aluminium fumarate metal-organic framework| journal = Chem.

==Safety==
Fumaric acid converts to the irritant [[maleic anhydride]], upon partial combustion.

It is "practically non-toxic" but high doses are probably [[Nephrotoxicity|nephrotoxic]] after long-term use.&lt;ref name=ecscfa&gt;European Commission: {{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scan/out112_en.pdf |title=European Commission Report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition on the Safety of Fumaric Acid |accessdate=2014-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
Fumaric acid was first prepared from [[succinic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Volhard, J. "Darstellung von Maleïnsäureanhydrid" Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie 1892, volume 268, page 255-6. {{doi|10.1002/jlac.18922680108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A traditional synthesis involves oxidation of [[furfural]] (from the processing of [[maize]]) using [[sodium chlorate|chlorate]] in the presence of a [[vanadium]]-based [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;Milas, N. A. "Fumaric Acid" ''Organic Synthesis'' 1943, Collective Volume 2, page 302. [http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/pdfs/CV2P0302.pdf Online version]&lt;/ref&gt;
Currently, industrial synthesis of fumaric acid is mostly based on [[catalyst|catalytic]] [[isomerisation]] of [[maleic acid]]  in aqueous solutions at low p''H''.  Maleic acid is accessible in large volumes as a [[hydrolysis]] product of maleic anhydride, produced by catalytic oxidation of [[benzene]] or [[butane]].&lt;ref&gt;British Patent No. 775,912, published on the May 29, 1957, by Monsanto Chemical Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical properties of fumaric acid can be anticipated from its component [[functional group]]s.  This weak acid forms a di[[ester]], it undergoes additions across the [[alkene|double bond]], and it is an excellent [[dienophile]].

Fumaric acid does not combust in a [[bomb calorimeter]] under conditions where [[maleic acid]] deflagrates smoothly.  For teaching experiments designed to measure the difference in energy between the cis- and trans- isomers, a measured quantity of carbon can be ground with the subject compound and the enthalpy of combustion computed by difference.

==Biology==
Fumaric acid is found in [[fumitory]] (''Fumaria officinalis''), [[bolete]] [[mushroom]]s (specifically ''Boletus fomentarius var. pseudo-igniarius''), [[lichen]], and [[Iceland moss]].

Fumarate is an [[Reaction intermediate|intermediate]] in the [[citric acid cycle]] used by [[cell (biology)|cells]] to produce energy in the form of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) from [[food]].  It is formed by the [[oxidation]] of [[succinate]] by the enzyme [[succinate dehydrogenase]].  Fumarate is then converted by the enzyme [[fumarase]] to [[malic acid|malate]].

Human skin naturally produces fumaric acid when exposed to [[sunlight]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tWJLUWT06BEC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=Human+skin+fumaric+acid&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6eYiVbu5FIKhgwTIlYCgCA&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Human%20skin%20fumaric%20acid&amp;f=false Active Ingredients Used in Cosmetics: Safety Survey], Council of Europe.

Fumarate is also a product of the [[urea cycle]].

'''Gesya Mirokhovna Gelfman''' (''Gesia Gelfman'' or ''Helfmann''); (''Гельфман, Геся Мироховна'' in [[Russian language|Russian]]) (her name is often incorrectly spelled Gesya Mironovna and she sometimes gave an abbreviated "Mirovna"; she is sometimes referred to as Gesia, Hesse,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Wednesday 11 May 1881, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Hessy&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Saturday 26 March 1881, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; or Jessie) (between 1852 and 1855, [[Mazyr]] — 2.1(13).1882, [[Saint Petersburg]]), was a Russian [[revolutionary]] member of [[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]], who was implicated in the assassination of [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]].

==Early life==
Born into a [[Jewish]] family, Gelfman left it at the age of 16 or 17, allegedly to avoid an [[arranged marriage]], and moved to [[Kiev]], where she found employment in a sewing factory.

==Revolutionary activities==
In the early 1870s, she was an active member of several revolutionary clubs in Kiev. In 1877, during the [[Trial of the Fifty]], Gelfman was sentenced to two years in the [[Litovsky Castle]]. On 14 March 1879, she was sent into [[exile]] to the [[province]] of [[Novgorod]], from where she escaped and joined Narodnaya Volya in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1879.

At a personal level, she also practiced then-revolutionary [[free love]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert H. McNeal, "Women in the Russian Radical Movement," ''Journal of Social History'', Vol. 5, No. 2. (Winter, 1971-1972), p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881 she was part of the group that [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|assassinated Alexander II]], along with her then lover, [[Nikolai Sablin]]. When the police raided their apartment, Sablin shot himself.

==Death==
During the [[Pervomartovtsi]] [[trial (law)|trial]] in March 1881, Gelfman refused to admit her guilt,&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Thursday 7 April 1881, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; but she was nevertheless sentenced to death by [[hanging]] for her alleged part in the assassination of the Tsar. However, a few hours after being convicted, she made a statement reading in part that "in view of the ... sentence I have received, I consider it my moral duty to declare that I am in the fourth month of [[pregnancy]]". According to contemporary law execution of pregnant women was banned as the fetus was considered innocent. Therefore, Gelfman's execution was officially postponed until forty days after childbirth, and in the meantime she would stay in the harsh [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] prison. Three months later, thanks to the campaign against her execution by Socialists in Western Europe&lt;ref&gt;Re protests in Belgium, see ''The Times'' (London), Wednesday 11 May 1881, p. 7. There were also demonstrations in Marseilles, which resulted in some of the participants being fined and/or imprisoned - see ''The Times'', Wednesday 1 June 1881, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the foreign press, her sentence was exchanged for an indefinite period of [[katorga]] and she was transferred back to the [[remand prison]] where she had been held before. On 5 July [NS], whilst still in the Peter and Paul Fortress and by permission of the Minister of the Interior, [[Nicholas Pavlovich Ignatiev|Count Ignatiev]], she was granted an interview (which lasted almost an hour and a half) with a journalist from the newspaper ''Golos'' who was accompanied by her defence counsel at her trial, a lawyer named Goerke.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), Thursday 7 July 1881, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of this interview, she complained about the lack of "proper medical and female attendance".

Gelfman gave birth in [[prison|detention]] in October 1881. Upon the request of the Department of Police, her childbirth was assisted by a [[gynaecologist]] who was also employed by the Imperial court, something unprecedented. She had a severe [[childbirth#Maternal complications|maternal complication]], as her [[perineum]] was torn. It was rumoured that the gynaecologist had refused the prison doctor's suggestion to sew the wound together; in any case, it never healed. She remained delirious during some of the [[postnatal|postnatal period]]. By 24 November, she had developed [[peritonitis]], which became acute on 17 January 1882. She nevertheless nursed her daughter from her birth in October until 25 January, when the baby was taken away from her, placed in an orphanage and registered as a child of unknown parents. According to the subsequent medical report, the peritonitis became general and caused [[fever]] on the same day. Six days later, Gelfman died. Her child soon died of an unknown disease as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lechaim.ru/ARHIV/86/kravets.htm Ребенок № А-824. ЛЕХАИМ  ИЮНЬ 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://narovol.narod.ru/Person/gelfman.htm Народная воля: Геся Мировна Гельфман] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051101133227/http://narovol.narod.ru/Person/gelfman.htm |date=2005-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Народная воля: Трубецкой бастион&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
The importance of Gelfman's role in the assassination was undetermined, and her Jewish origins stressed during the [[pogroms]] that followed the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Chronicle, May 6, 1881 quoted in Benjamin Blech, Eyewitness to Jewish History&lt;/ref&gt; Another conspirator, [[Ignacy Hryniewiecki]], was also rumored to be Jewish, though there seems to have been no basis for this.

Mandel enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]], where he served eight years as an intelligence specialist. His first tour was from February to November 2004, during which he was attached to a [[United States Marine Corps Light Armored Reconnaissance|light armored reconnaissance]] [[battalion]]. He left for his second tour in September 2007. Attached to an [[infantry]] battalion, Mandel served in the city of [[Haditha]].&lt;ref name="PD Oct 19, 2010" /&gt;

==Political career==

===Lyndhurst councilman===
Mandel's experience as an elected official began as a [[Lyndhurst, Ohio]] city councilman, where he was elected in 2003. He served three years on the council's finance committee.

On January 24, 2005, Mandel sent a letter to Lyndhurst residents, proposing a one time tax rebate of $400, paying the postage for the letters from his campaign fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lyndhurst-oh.com/prevsite/agendas_and_minutes_q1_2005.html | title = Q1 2005 Agendas &amp; Minutes | publisher = City of [[Lyndhurst, Ohio|Lyndhurst]] | accessdate = June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CPDB&amp;p_theme=cpdb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=ott%20AND%20date(1/27/2005%20to%201/28/2005)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/27/2005%20to%201/28/2005)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(ott)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no  | title = Councilman seeks tax rebate in Lyndhurst: Wants to give every homeowner $400 out of city's large surplus | newspaper = cleveland.com ([[The Plain Dealer]]) | author =  Thomas Ott | date = January 27, 2005 | accessdate = June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with opposition from fellow council members, Mandel introduced and advocated for a 2 [[mill (currency)|mill]] [[property tax in the United States|property tax]] rollback, which would have saved the average homeowner $100 a year on a home valued at $160,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CPDB&amp;p_theme=cpdb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Flournoy%20AND%20date(3/4/2005%20to%203/4/2005)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=3/4/2005%20to%203/4/2005)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Flournoy)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no| title = Lyndhurst backs off tax rebate: Councilman reacts to opposition, proposes rate rollback | newspaper = cleveland.com ([[The Plain Dealer]]) | author =  Tasha Flournoy | date = March 4, 2005 | accessdate = June 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What passed council, on April 4, 2005, was a 1.5 mill rollback, which saved the average homeowner $75 a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lyndhurst-oh.com/prevsite/enews/05242005/index.html | title = Lyndhurst Neighborhood E-News | date = May–June 2005 | author = Joseph M.

He represented Ohio's 17th House district, consisting of 17 communities of various sizes in southeastern [[Cuyahoga County]]. Mandel was re-elected to a second term in 2008.

====Tenure====
Mandel's first piece of legislation as a State Representative, H.B. 151, was an initiative to force the multibillion-dollar Ohio pension funds to divest from companies doing business in [[Iran]]. He joined State Representative Shannon Jones (R) in an attempt to make Ohio the first state in the nation to divest from Iran, but the legislation was never signed into law due to a compromise between state pension executives and Ohio House leadership, agreed to by Mandel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lsc.state.oh.us/coderev/hou127.nsf/House+Bill+Number/0151?OpenDocument "HB 151"], [[Ohio State Legislature]].

In the 127th Assembly, Mandel, along with other members of the Ohio House who served in Iraq, were excused from voting on HB649 in December 2008, which provided payments to military veterans of the Middle East wars and compensation to families who had lost loved ones in the conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=23228&amp;can_id=60051 "Funding Veterans' Bonuses Using the Budget Stabilization Fund"], Project Vote Smart.

====STABLE Accounts====
In summer 2015, Ohio passed legislation granting the Ohio Treasurer's Office the authority to open and administer [[ABLE account]]s; such accounts are a federally-authorized, state-run savings program for eligible people with disabilities. In June 2016, Mandel began offering the nation's first ABLE accounts, called in Ohio "STABLE Accounts".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2016/06/09/putting-away-money-for-disabled-gets-easier-with-state-program.html|title=Putting away money for disabled gets easier with new state program|last=Dispatch|first=Mark Williams, The Columbus|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-08-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ohio Treasurer's Office, in addition to administering Ohio's STABLE Accounts, also jointly administers the ABLE accounts in [[Arizona]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Carolina]], [[Vermont]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ABLE Program Implementation |date=2017-08-23 |publisher=The Arc |url=http://www.thearc.org/what-we-do/public-policy/issues/able-program-implementation |access-date=2017-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Oklahoma STABLE | date = 2018 | publisher = [[Oklahoma State Treasurer]] | url = https://okstable.org/ | accessdate = August 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = WVABLE | date = 2018 | publisher = [[John Perdue]] (West Virginia State Treasurer) | url = https://wvable.com/ | accessdate = August 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Advertising controversy ====
In 2016 and 2017, the Ohio Treasurer's Office under Mandel spent almost $1.7 million in taxpayer-funded [[television ad]]s, featuring him and [[Urban Meyer]], the head coach for the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] team.&lt;ref name="Borchardt"&gt;Jackie Borchardt, [http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/02/ohio_taxpayers_spent_13_millio.html Ohio taxpayers spent $1.7 million on TV ads featuring Josh Mandel, Urban Meyer], ''Plain Dealer'' (February 21, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel's office made each payment for the ads to individual television stations in an amount less than $50,000 per fiscal year, thus circumventing the need for approval by the state Controlling Board, which must sign-off on state payments over this amount.&lt;ref name="Borchardt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BischoffAds"&gt;Laura A. Bischoff, [http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/ohio-treasurer-ran-state-funded-ads-just-before-announcing-senate-run/S7WlOG0bhSkFCgaGN0URvJ/ Ohio treasurer ran state-funded ads just before announcing Senate run], ''Dayton Daily News'' (February 17, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen ad buys were within $1,000 of the $50,000 threshold.&lt;ref name="Borchardt"/&gt; Mandel defended the ads, saying they helped increase awareness of an investment program for disabled Ohioans. Critics questioned the airing of self-promotional ads at a time when Mandel was running for U.S. Senate and said that Mandel's office was trying to avoid scrutiny by structuring the ad buys to avoid Controlling Board approval.&lt;ref name="Borchardt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BischoffAds"/&gt;

In response to the controversy, the Ohio House introduced an amendment to the state's 2017 budget. The amendment would require approval by the Controlling Board for ad buys that in aggregate exceed $50,000. This rule would have prevented Mandel from avoiding oversight by distributing the advertising campaign among individual ad buys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170428/gop-lawmakers-target-mandel-with-budget-amendment|title=GOP lawmakers target Mandel with budget amendment|last=Schladen|first=Marty|date=2017-04-28|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel did not attend an Ohio Senate hearing on the matter.

Mandel's campaign was singled out by the independent fact-checking group [[Politifact]] for its "casual relationship with the truth" and its tendency to "double down" after inaccuracies were pointed out. The fact-checking group wrote: "For all the gifts Mandel has, from his compelling personal narrative as an Iraq war veteran to a well-oiled fundraising machine, whoppers are fast becoming a calling card of his candidacy."&lt;ref name="politifact-age"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Politifact]] | title = Even in an age of fact checking, the whopper lives | first= Henry | last = Gomez | url = http://www.politifact.com/ohio/article/2012/mar/26/even-age-fact-checking-whopper-lives/ | date = March 26, 2012 | accessdate= July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandel had raised $7.2 million through the first quarter of 2012; his $5.3 million cash on hand trailed Brown's $6.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wehrman|first=Jessica|title=Incumbents winning in fundraising|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/election/incumbents-winning-in-fundraising-1360963.html|accessdate=April 30, 2012|newspaper=Dayton Daily News|date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel benefited from massive support from conservative out-of-state [[superPAC]]s, which raise unlimited amounts of money from anonymous donors. These outside groups, including [[Crossroads GPS]], aired $10 million in TV advertising supporting Mandel and attacking Brown as of July 2012, outspending Democratically-aligned outside groups by more than five-to-one.&lt;ref name="npr-ohio"&gt;{{cite news | publisher = [[NPR]] | url = https://www.npr.org/2012/07/05/156268298/ohio-senator-vulnerable-for-health-law-support | title = Ohio Senator Vulnerable For Health Law Support | first = David | last = Welna | date = July 5, 2012 | accessdate = July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel's campaign was aided by over $1 million spent primarily on attack ads by a [[501c4#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4) organization]] called the "Government Integrity Fund".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Justin | last = Elliot | title = Revealed: The Dark Money Group Attacking Sen.

In August 2013, Mandel was accused of violating federal and state campaign laws by using a vehicle owned by his U.S. Senate campaign for personal use unrelated to the campaign. No charges were brought and there was no case made against him. Mandel was involved in a traffic accident with the vehicle on March 5, 2013 near Toledo, Ohio, nearly four months after the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dems, others pounce on questions over Treasurer Josh Mandel's use of a vehicle owned by his Senate campaign|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/08/dems_others_pounce_on_question.html|work=The Plain Dealer|accessdate=August 29, 2013|author=Robert Higgs|date=August 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2018 U.S. Senate election===

In December 2016, Mandel announced that he would seek election to the United States Senate in the 2018 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2016/12/ohio_treasurer_josh_mandel_ann.html|title=Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel announces 2018 U.S. Senate run for Sherrod Brown's seat|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=December 7, 2016|accessdate=December 7, 2016|first=Andrew|last=Tobias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2016, a [[Political action committee#Super PACs|Super PAC]] called Ohio Freedom Fund was created in order to help elect Mandel. The Ohio Freedom Fund's primary contributor is Citizens for a Working America, a nonprofit not subject to campaign finance disclosures. At the time that the Ohio Freedom Fund Super PAC was created, Mandel, in his capacity as state treasurer, was appearing in a series of advertisements promoting a new investment program for families with special needs children. Mandel's office said the ads were taped and aired before Mandel was a candidate for U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/090e452b4bd8479eadadd836596eb5fb/Dark-money-group-backs-super-PAC-pushing-Mandel-Senate-bid|title=Dark money group backs super PAC pushing Mandel Senate bid|last=Carr Smyth|first=Julia|date=2017-04-11|work=AP News|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170413072156/https://apnews.com/090e452b4bd8479eadadd836596eb5fb/Dark-money-group-backs-super-PAC-pushing-Mandel-Senate-bid|archive-date=2017-04-13|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170411/300000-in-dark-money-raised-to-help-josh-mandel-in-2018-us-senate-race|title=$300,000 in 'dark money' raised to help Josh Mandel in 2018 US Senate race|last=Schladen|first=Martin|date=2017-04-12|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Mandel stated his support for [[alt-right]] activists and conspiracy theorists [[Mike Cernovich]] and [[Jack Posobiec]] after Cernovich and Posobiec were criticized in an [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) report. Mandel accused the ADL of being a "partisan witchhunt group" and tweeted "I stand with @Cernovich &amp; @JackPosobiec."&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Resnick, [http://www.thedailybeast.com/josh-mandel-ohio-republican-senate-candidate-i-stand-with-mike-cernovich-and-jack-posobiec Josh Mandel, Ohio Republican Senate Candidate: I Stand With Mike Cernovich and Jack Posobiec], ''Daily Beast'' (July 20, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandel dropped out of the race on January 5, 2018, citing the need to spend more time with his family relating to his wife's health issues.&lt;ref name=politico/&gt;

==Political positions==

===Health care reform===
Mandel has called for the repeal of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.com/Issues/2012/Mar/21/ar_news_032112_story3.asp?d=032112_story3,2012,Mar,21&amp;c=n |title=Mandel blasts new EPA regulations – Wednesday, March 21, 2012 &amp;#124; Courier Electronic Edition – Findlay, Ohio: LOCAL NEWS |publisher=Thecourier.com |accessdate=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a campaign advertisement during his 2012 Senatorial run, Mandel claimed opponent Sherrod Brown "cast the deciding vote on the government takeover of health care". Politifact has labeled as false the claim that Brown cast the deciding vote for the act. The description of the act as a government takeover of health care, by Mandel, has been labeled by [[Politifact]] as "nonsensical" and a "myth".&lt;ref name="politifact-aca"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Politifact]] | url = http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/may/30/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-sherrod-brown-cast-deciding-vote-/ | title = Josh Mandel says Sherrod Brown cast the deciding vote for a government takeover of health care | accessdate= July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keith M. Harper''' is an American attorney and diplomat who was the first [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] to ever receive the rank of a U.S. ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ncai.org/news/articles/2014/06/03/ncai-congratulates-keith-harper-on-his-confirmation-to-serve-as-us-representative-to-the-un-human-rights-council | title=NCAI Congratulates Keith Harper On His Confirmation To Serve as US Representative to the UN Human Rights Council | publisher=[[National Congress of American Indians]] | date=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nno-conf"/&gt;  He is a member of the [[Cherokee Nation]] of Oklahoma&lt;ref name="nyul-int"/&gt; and as a lawyer he is known for working on behalf of Native Americans.  He was, from June 2014 to January 2017, the U.S. representative to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="dos-harper"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://geneva.usmission.gov/2014/06/13/biography-of-ambassador-keith-harper-u-s-representative-to-the-human-rights-council/ | title=Archives: Ambassador Keith Harper, U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN Human Rights Council (June 2014 – January 2017) | publisher=United States Mission to the United Nations and Other International Organizations in Geneva | accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Although a member of the [[Cherokee Nation]] of Oklahoma,&lt;ref name="nyul-int"/&gt; Harper did not grow up in Oklahoma, due to his father being in the military and posted elsewhere. Harper's forebears include David Rowe, an Assistant Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation who was elected as a judge of the Northern Judicial Circuit shortly after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="tw-echohawk"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=65&amp;articleid=20100612_65_A21_AttheN112355 | title=Native American lawyer would be stellar pick as judge | first=John | last=Echohawk | authorlink=John Echohawk | newspaper=[[Tulsa World]] | date=June 12, 2010 | page=A21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he graduated in 1990 with a B.A. in [[sociology]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="lnmh-bio"/&gt; He then went to the [[New York University School of Law]], where he graduated with a J.D. in the class of 1994.&lt;ref name="nyul-int"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/alumni/almo/pastalmos/20062007almos/keithharperapril | title=Alumnus/Alumna of the Month: Keith Harper '94 | publisher=[[New York University School of Law]] | accessdate=June 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he served as an editor on the ''[[New York University Journal of International Law and Politics]]''.  He was admitted to the [[New York bar]] the following year.&lt;ref name="lnmh-bio"/&gt;

==Legal career==
After law school, Harper served as a law clerk to Judge [[Lawrence W. Pierce]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].&lt;ref name="nno-conf"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/cherokee-citizen-keith-harper-named-us-representative-un-human-rights-council/ | title=Cherokee Citizen Keith Harper Named US Representative to UN Human Rights Council | publisher=Native News Online | date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it a formative experience with Pierce becoming one of his role models.&lt;ref name="nyul-int"/&gt; He also worked early in his career for the New York firm of [[Davis, Polk &amp; Wardwell]].&lt;ref name="nno-conf"/&gt;

Harper was a litigator at the [[Native American Rights Fund]] for eleven years spanning from 1995 to 2006.&lt;ref name="ali-bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyul-int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nno-conf"/&gt; He is most known for his work in the ''[[Cobell v. Kempthorne]]'', a large [[class-action]] [[lawsuit]] brought by Native American representatives against two departments of the United States government.&lt;ref name="nyul-int"/&gt;  The case was brought in 1996 on behalf of upwards of 500,000 Native Americans, and was resolved in 2009 with the Obama administration agreeing to a $3.4&amp;nbsp;billion settlement.&lt;ref name="nyul-int"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt;

He also did some teaching: as an adjunct professor at the [[Catholic University of America Columbus School of Law]] from 1998 to 2001, and as a professorial lecturer at the [[American University Washington College of Law]] from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref name="nno-conf"/&gt;

He then became a partner at [[Kilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton]], in Washington, D.C., where he focused his practice on litigation and Native American affairs, representing tribes and individual Indians.&lt;ref name="ali-bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ali.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=about.bio&amp;bio_id=100&amp;fromne=1 |title=Biography: Keith M.

With the new firm, Harper continued his work as a lead attorney on ''Cobell'', and by the 2010s the lawyers on that case had earned over $85&amp;nbsp;million in attorneys' fees.&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt;  The high payments became an issue among some Native Americans, and during 2010–2011 Harper toured [[Indian country]] to defend the settlement terms and the payments to attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nativetimes.com/news/federal/6777-cobell-class-members-question-settlement-attorney-conduct | title=Cobell Class Members question settlement, attorney conduct | first=Dana | last=Attocknie | newspaper=[[Native American Times]] | date=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harper was also accused by some other Native American lawyers of using physical intimidation tactics in several cases in the mid-late 2000s during disagreements over ''Cobell'' matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/20/indian-lawyers-allege-threats-human-rights-nominee-keith-harper-153668?page=0%2C0 | title= Indian Lawyers Allege Threats by Human Rights Nominee Keith Harper | first=Rob | last=Capriccioso | newspaper=[[Indian Country Today]] | date=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper has also served on the bench:  as a justice of the [[Mashantucket Pequot Tribe]]'s Appellate Court from 2001 to 2007,   and following that as a justice of the Supreme Court of the [[Poarch Band of Creek Indians]] from 2007 to 2008.&lt;ref name="nno-conf"/&gt;

==Political involvement==
Harper acted as a key liaison between the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008]], and Indian tribes.&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt; In 2010, Harper was mentioned as a possible pick for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit]].&lt;ref name="tw-echohawk"/&gt; In 2011, President Obama named him to a spot on the [[President's Commission on White House Fellowships]].&lt;ref name="ns-com"/&gt; Harper worked on the re-election [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012]], and helped bring in over $500,000 in donations.&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-taps-top-native-american-fundraiser-for-un-human-rights-post/2013/06/12/c40cab48-d379-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html | title=Obama taps top Native American fundraiser for U.N. human rights post | first=Matea | last=Gold | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wh-nom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/10/president-obama-announces-more-key-administration-posts | title=President Obama Announces More Key Administration Posts | publisher=[[The White House]] | date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He personally helped host a conference and two major fundraisers for the campaign.&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt; As such, Harper was considered a "[[Bundler (campaigning)|mega-bundler]]"&lt;ref name="wapo-conf"/&gt; who played a major role in setting overall record levels of campaign donations for Obama from Native Americans.&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt;

On July 11, 2017, Harper endorsed Debra Haaland for Congress.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/DebforCongress/photos/a.1378589052385689.1073741831.1375618656016062/1911512889093300/?type=3&amp;hc_ref=OTHER&amp;pnref=story&lt;/ref&gt; Haaland is running for New Mexico's first congressional district, and if elected would be the first Native American woman elected to congress.

==U.S. Ambassador==
Harper was nominated by President Obama for the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Council]] on June 10, 2013.&lt;ref name="wh-nom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt;  Many human rights advocates were unfamiliar with Harper, and as such the pick reflected a long-standing practice of presidents rewarding top supporters with ambassadorships and similar postings.&lt;ref name="wapo-nom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ictmn-indig"/&gt;  The  [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] considered his nomination in two rounds of confirmation hearings, in September 2013 and February 2014.&lt;ref name="ictmn-indig"/&gt;

A number of Republicans objected to the nomination, either because of his earnings or tactics during the ''Cobell'' case or because of his role in Obama campaign fundraising.&lt;ref name="huffpo-confirmed"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/04/keith-harper-ambassador_n_5446900.html | title=Senate Confirms First Native American Ambassador | first=David | last=McCabe | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona, who led the arguments against Harper,&lt;ref name="ictmn-indig"/&gt; said, "Mr. Harper is just another example of a campaign bundler wholly ill-suited to serve in the diplomatic post for which he's been nominated."&lt;ref name="huffpo-confirmed"/&gt; Senator [[Jon Tester]] of Montana said, on the other hand, that "As a longtime advocate for the civil rights of Native Americans, Keith will be a great Ambassador for our country."&lt;ref name="nno-conf"/&gt;  While many Native American groups supported Harper's nomination, some [[indigenous rights]] advocates were wary of it, saying that Harper had shown a lack of substantial positions on Indian human rights issues throughout his legal career.&lt;ref name="ictmn-indig"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/14/indigenous-rights-advocates-question-keith-harper-nomination-153567?page=0%2C0 | title=Indigenous Rights Advocates Question Keith Harper Nomination | first=Rob | last=Capriccioso | newspaper=[[Indian Country Today]] | date=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Harper was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on June 3, 2014, nearly a year after his nomination, in a party-line 52–42 vote with Democrats supporting and Republicans opposed.&lt;ref name="huffpo-confirmed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wapo-conf"/&gt; As such he benefited from the "[[nuclear option]]" adopted in the Senate the year before, where  [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|Senate filibusters]] could no longer be used against such appointees.&lt;ref name="ictmn-indig"/&gt; Harper thus became the first person from a [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized Native American tribe]] to achieve the rank of U.S. ambassador.&lt;ref name="wapo-conf"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/06/03/native-american-lawyer-confirmed-to-u-n-human-rights-post/?tid=hpModule_308f7142-9199-11e2-bdea-e32ad90da239 | title=Native American lawyer confirmed to U.N. human rights post | first=Al | last=Kamen | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | date=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper was sworn into his position by June 5, 2014, and immediately flew to Geneva for a Human Rights Council meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indianz.com/News/2014/013932.asp |title=Ambassador Harper heads to United Nations for next session |first= |last= |publisher=Indianz.com |date=June 5, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630052923/http://www.indianz.com/News/2014/013932.asp |archivedate=June 30, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harper's tenure in the position ended with the change of administrations in Washington in January 2017.&lt;ref name="dos-harper"/&gt;

==Return to law practice==
In February 2017, Harper returned to practice as a partner at Kilpatrick Townsend &amp; Stockton.&lt;ref name="kts-return"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/02/02/ambassador-keith-harper-returns-to-kilpatrick.html | title=Ambassador Keith Harper returns to Kilpatrick Townsend | publisher=[[Bizjournals]] | date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He planned to work from the firm's Washington office again and to focus on both public and private sector work regarding both Native American affairs and international matters.&lt;ref name="kts-return"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">'''Land reform in South Vietnam''' refers to reforms proposed by the [[United States]] and implemented by [[South Vietnam]]. Seeking to undermine the popularity of the [[Communism|communist]] [[Việt Minh|Việt Minh's]] policies of land redistribution to poor peasants, the government of South Vietnam implemented their own land-redistribution policies during the [[Vietnam War]]. 

Early reforms enacted by the South Vietnamese government in the 1950s largely failed, as the ordinances prescribed by the government often attempted to directly undo the already-popular land reforms of the Việt Minh, requiring poor peasants to pay to acquire land that the communists had already given to them. During the 1960s, such programs were rendered defunct and unenforceable due to the South Vietnamese army's inability to control farmland territories against the [[Viet Cong]].

In the 1970s, South Vietnam implemented the "Land to the Tiller" reform with the aid of the [[United States]]. This program was more successful than earlier programs, and was almost entirely underwritten by the United States. The reform program was discontinued in 1975 following South Vietnam's defeat in the Vietnam War and the unification of Vietnam.

Following the unification, the government  of [[Vietnam]] attempted to carry out further land reform in the southern part of the country in order to develop its transformation to a [[socialist economy]]. This attempt at reform was met with difficulties, and did not achieve its goals.

== Background ==

Following [[World War II]], the communist [[Việt Minh]] (the predecessor of [[Viet Cong]]) fought against the [[French Indochina|French colonialists]] and their local supporters (mainly [[Landowner|landowners]]) in the [[First Indochina War]]. 
At the time, a large percentage of agricultural land was owned by powerful landowners and the majority of the rural population of Vietnam owned only small plots of land (with little legal assurance) or were simply landless [[Peasant|peasants]].&lt;ref&gt;"Land reform in Vietnam." Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, 22 Mar. 2017. Web. 19 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The early success of the land reform program under the Viet Minh gave the communists a strong base of support among the 80% of the Vietnamese people who lived in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. "Land Reform in South Vietnam A Proposal for Turning the Tables on the Viet Cong". Cornell Law Review. Volume 53 Issue 1 November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the provisional separation of North and South Vietnam, emperor [[Bao Dai]] in 1953 responded to the Viet Minh program of land redistribution and rent reduction with a decree declaring that rents for land should not exceed 15 percent of the crop.  The decree was unenforceable and rendered null by a failing colonial government and, in any case, contained loopholes that could have been exploited by landlords.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman (1967), p. 27-29&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1954 to 1975 land reform in Vietnam was pursued on two separate channels and regions as the country was provisionally divided into two parts: [[South Vietnam]] (The Republic of Vietnam) and [[North Vietnam]] (the Democratic Republic of Vietnam), resembling the current partition of [[Korea]]. 
Communist North Vietnam and its southern supporters, the [[Viet Cong]], adopted a policy of confiscating the land of landlords and rich peasants by force and redistributing it to poor and landless peasants, thus organizing the rural population into collectives.

==Land reform during the Vietnam War==
Capitalist South Vietnam failed in several land reform endeavors before finally achieving some success with the "Land to the Tiller" program in the early 1970s that was almost fully devised and supported by the [[United States]], which considered it to be part of their policy of the [[Vietnamization]] of the war.

=== Early land reform ordinances ===
In 1954, South Vietnam's ally, the United States, advised the new government of South Vietnam, headed by [[Ngo Dinh Diem]], to undertake "indispensable reforms" including land reform. In response on 8 January 1955, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 2, which capped rental of land at 25 percent of production.  In 1956, Diem adopted Ordinance No. 57 which forbade ownership by an individual of more than {{convert|100|ha|acre}} of rice land and prescribed the conditions and terms under which the excess land expropriated from the rich could be transferred to less-wealthy farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Wurfel, David (Jun 1957), "Agrarian Reform in the Republic of Vietnam," ''Far Eastern Survey'', Vol 26, No. 6, p. 82-83. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the program the government acquired {{convert|422000|ha|acre}} from 1958 to 1961 and distributed {{convert|244000|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref&gt;Dacy, Douglas C. (1986), ''Foreign aid, war, and economic development: South Vietnam 1955-1975,'' Austin: University of Texas Press, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; The land redistributed thus comprised less than 10 percent of the 7.5 million acres of cultivated land in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman (1967), p. 35; Tyson, James L. (1973), "Land Reform in Vietnam: A Progress Report," ''Asian Affairs'', Vol. l, No. 1, p. 36. Downloaded from JSTOR.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The land reform program implemented under Ordinance 57 was unpopular in the countryside.  The Viet Minh had already divided up the land -- "fairly," in the words of one official.&lt;ref&gt;Race, Jeffrey (1972), ''War Comes to Long An'', Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; The government's program was less generous to the majority of farmers than had been the Viet Minh redistribution of land in areas which it controlled.  The amount of land that individuals were permitted to retain was large, farmers were required to pay for land they acquired under the program, and the program was riddled with corruption and inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer C., Ed. (1998), ''Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Many rural people believed that the United States army and the government of South Vietnam were on the side of the landlords.  Military operations by the U.S. and South Vietnamese armies to clear communist insurgents from an area would often result in landlords reclaiming land previously abandoned or confiscated and redistributed by the Viet Minh or Viet Cong.

Ordinance 57 resulted in the reverse of what was the objective of land reform advocates: large landowners and landlords increased their influence, especially in the important rice-growing area of the Mekong Delta.&lt;ref&gt;Wurfel, pp. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance remained in effect until 1970, but was largely unutilized after 1960 as the [[Viet Cong]] insurgents took control or disputed government control of most of the rural areas of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Dacy, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Land to the Tiller ===
The Land to the Tiller project carried out in Vietnam from 1970 to 1973 was based on a proposal by [[Roy Prosterman]], a prominent American "land-rights-activist", who the US government of the time recruited within its efforts against [[Viet Cong]] in South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Vora, Shivani. "A Conversation With: Landesa Founder Roy Prosterman" date published SEPTEMBER 25, 2012 - New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on experiences in other countries (particularly in Latin America), Prosterman proposed a "land-to-the-tiller" program to compete with the Viet Cong for the allegiance of the peasants. The plan mimicked the communists' land [[expropriation]] strategy, coupled with monetary compensation to the former landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. Land reform in Latin America: how to have a revolution without a revolution. Seattle: Washington Law Review Association, 1966. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 March 1970, with the war still underway, the government of South Vietnam began implementation of the Land-to-the-Tiller program following Prosterman's model. In total, the United States financed 339 million US dollars of the reform's 441 million dollars of expenses.
&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. "Land Reform in South Vietnam A Proposal for Turning the Tables on the Viet Cong". Cornell Law Review. Volume 53 Issue 1 November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;Individual land holding was limited to 15 hectares. Legal titles were extended to peasants in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom land had previously been distributed by the Viet Cong.&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. "Land-to-the-Tiller in South Vietnam : The Tables Turn". Asian Survey. 10 (8): 751-764. August 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===

[[Bernard B. Fall]] a prominent war correspondent, historian, political scientist, and expert on Indochina during the 1950s and 1960s, claimed that delayed land reform in [[South Vietnam]] had played such a fundamental role in the [[Vietnam War]] that it was as important as "ammunition for howitzers." South Vietnam's ally and financial supporter, the United States, either failed to realise the importance of land reform in a timely fashion or was not able to persuade the South Vietnamese government of its importance.&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, Frances, Noah Rothman, Claire Lehmann, Max Boot, Eric Cohen &amp; Aylana Meisel, Andrew Ferguson, Christine Rosen, Matthew Continetti, Tevi Troy, and Terry Teachout. "Last Reflections on a War, by Bernard B. Fall." Commentary Magazine. N.p., 27 Mar. 2017. Web. 20 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Biggs, at researcher at the [[University of Washington]] argues that the "Land to the Tiller" program of the early 1970s was too little, too late to swing the war in the favour of the US.&lt;ref&gt;Biggs, David. "Quagmire: Nation-Building and Nature in the Mekong Delta". Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of an American official, Robert Samson "The Americans (lost the war because) they offered the peasant a constitution; the Viet Cong offered him his land and with it the right to survive".&lt;ref&gt;Prosterman, Roy L. "Land Reform in South Vietnam A Proposal for Turning the Tables on the Viet Cong". Cornell Law Review. Volume 53 Issue 1 November 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Land reform in southern Vietnam after reunification==
{{One source section|date=July 2018}}
According to Trung Dinh Dang, a scholar at the [[Cornell]] School of Government and Politics Of Asia and The Pacific, the Vietnamese Communist Party struggled to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture in the south of Vietnam following the unification of the country. The contemporary party leaders initially considered land reform initiatives to be a temporary measure toward mass collectivisation.&lt;ref&gt;Dang, Trung Dinh. "Post-1975 Land Reform in Southern Vietnam: How Local Actions and Responses Affected National Land Policy". University of California Press. Journal of Vietnamese Studies, Vol. 5, No. 3 pp. 72-105. Fall 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dang posits that further land reform initiatives set the grounds for conflict between the party and Southern Vietnamese. Land reform initiatives encountered unexpected difficulty in the southern region and its implementation could not be achieved for many years. According to Dang, agrarian reform in the south failed to benefit the majority of villagers, instead perpetuating inequality, sowing discord, and creating unrest. Instead of eliminating land-based exploitation, it created a new strata of exploiters in the form of local officials that abused their power to secure land for themselves and their relatives instead of impoverished peasants.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21288">The '''League of American Writers''' was an association of American [[novelist]]s, [[playwright]]s, [[poet]]s, [[journalist]]s, and [[literary critic]]s launched by the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) in 1935. The group included Communist Party members, and so-called "[[fellow travelers]]" who closely followed the Communist Party's [[political line]] without being formal party members, as well as individuals sympathetic to specific policies being advocated by the organization.

The League's policy objectives changed over time in accord with the shifting party line of the CPUSA. Beginning as an [[anti-fascist]] organization in 1935, the League turned to an [[anti-war]] position following the signing of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] of 1939 and to a pro-war position after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The organization was prominent in the defense of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican Spain]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and in providing financial and moral support to writers in need in the United States and internationally.

The organization was terminated in January 1943.

==Organizational history==
===Formation===
The '''League of American Writers''' was established by the First American Writers Congress, a gathering held from April 26–28, 1935.&lt;ref name="Dies967"&gt;"League of American Writers," in Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX, Communist Front Organizations, Second Section.'' Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 967.&lt;/ref&gt; (According to member [[Myra Page]], it started on May 1, 1935–[[May Day]].&lt;ref name=Looper&gt;

The organization was affiliated with the International Union of Revolutionary Writers (IURW)&lt;ref name="Dies967" /&gt; as well as the International Association of Writers for the Defense of Culture and was the American equivalent of the British League of Writers.&lt;ref name="FF29"&gt;[[Franklin Folsom]], ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937–1942.'' Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994; pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial members included: [[Alexander Trachtenberg]] of [[International Publishers]], [[Frank Folsom]], [[Louis Untermeyer]], Bromfelds, [[I.F. Stone]], [[Millen Brand]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Lillian Hellman]], and [[Dashiell Hammett]], and [[Myra Page]].&lt;ref name=Looper/&gt;

In an article in the magazine of the IURW, ''International Literature,'' League of American Writers member Alan Calmer noted that the new organization sprung from a decision made at the 1934 convention of the Communist Party's [[John Reed Clubs]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The chief malady of the revolutionary culture movement was characterized at the second national conference of the John Reed Clubs in 1934 as the old malady of [[sectarianism]]. ... Pointing to these handicaps, the delegates to the conference instructed their executive committee to take the initiative in sponsoring a broad conference of left-wing authors ... A new organization committee was formed, which gradually involved more and more sympathetic writers into the leadership of the committee which issued the "Call for an American Writers Congress" at the beginning of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Calmer in ''International Literature,'' no. 7, 1935, pp. 73–75; quoted in ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pp. 967–968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convention call for establishing the first Congress of American Writers declared that [[capitalism]] was rapidly crumbling and sought to gather the "hundreds of poets, novelists, dramatists, critics, short story writers and journalists" who recognized "the necessity of personally helping to accelerate the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a workers' government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.gwu.edu/~cuff/wright/organizations/awc-call.html Text of the Call for the American Writers Congress of 1935,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404100113/http://home.gwu.edu/~cuff/wright/organizations/awc-call.html |date=2008-04-04 }} ''The New Masses,'' January 22, 1935, pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding convention of the League was called to order at the [[Mecca Temple]] in New York City, attended by 400 invited "writer-delegates" in front of a total audience of nearly 5,000.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Milton Howard, "5,000 Greet Writers Who Pledge Fight on Fascism, War: 400 Authors Gather in Parley to Discuss Their Role in Fight" ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although later called a "[[front group]]," the Communist Party's role in the League of American Writers was never secret. [[Earl Browder]], General Secretary of the CPUSA, delivered the keynote address to the delegates of the First Congress of the League of American Writers at its opening session.&lt;ref name="Browder"&gt;Earl Browder, "Text of Speech by Browder at American Writers Congress," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Browder acknowledged that writers were typically "skeptical of all political parties, if not contemptuous." He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They find, however, in the new life in which they participate, there is a political party which plays an increasingly influential role, the Communist Party. They find it necessary to define their attitudes towards this Party which actively participates in their chosen world. They see that this Party is a force in fine literature, as well as in strikes, in unemployment struggles, in battling for Negro rights, even in reactionary Congress ... Yes, the Communist Party is a force, in every phase of the life of the masses, even that of poets, dramatists, novelists, and critics.&lt;ref name="Browder" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joining Browder in addressing the delegates to the organization's founding convention was CPUSA political committee member [[Clarence Hathaway]], who greeted the Congress in the name of "the entire staff of ''The Daily Worker,''" the official newspaper of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Dies969"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 969.&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading CPUSA activists addressing the gathering included [[Moissaye Olgin]] of the Yiddish-language ''[[Morning Freiheit]],'' [[Joseph Freeman (writer)|Joseph Freeman]] of ''[[The New Masses]],'' and [[Alexander Trachtenberg]] of [[International Publishers]], part of the CPUSA's publishing arm.&lt;ref name="Bloom400"&gt;Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal Sons: The New York Intellectuals and Their World.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1987; pg. 400, footnote 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group declared itself to be "a voluntary association of writers dedicated to the preservation and extension of a truly democratic culture."

[[Waldo Frank]] was elected the first president of the new organization.&lt;ref name="DaysOfRage"&gt;[[Franklin Folsom]], ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937–1942.'' Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing Executive Council elected by the first Congress included Frank, Freeman, Trachtenberg, [[Michael Gold]], [[Granville Hicks]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Josephine Herbst]], [[Albert Maltz]], [[Kenneth Burke]], [[Harold Clurman]], Hart, Josephson, Lawson, Scheider, Seaver, [[Genevieve Taggard]] and [[Alfred Kreymborg]].&lt;ref name="Bloom400" /&gt;

===Development===

The League of American Writers was a dues based organization, with annual dues set at $5 per year, payable in advance on January 1 of each year.&lt;ref name="Bull3-1"&gt;''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers,'' vol. 3, no. 3 (January 1938), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who were members of local or regional chapters paid dues to that organization, with $2 of the $5 remitted to the National Office; others stood as members at large and paid dues directly to New York.&lt;ref name="Bull3-1" /&gt;

Although the League of American Writers was technically a "mass organization" of the CPUSA in the sense that it sought to unite party members with non-party individuals sharing the general Communist Party orientation, membership in the organization was limited by design to the literary elite. Several months after the April 1935 founding congress, membership in the group was reported as only 125 — far fewer than the 400 who had attended the founding convention as delegates.&lt;ref name="Klehr353"&gt;Harvey Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade.'' New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; "Applications for membership flow in, but the standard is kept high, membership is granted only to creative writers whose published work entitles them to a professional status," noted Isidor Schneider.&lt;ref name="Klehr353" /&gt;

According to the group's formal membership application, membership in the League was "open to all writers whose work has been published  or used with reasonable frequency in channels of communication of more than local scope, including magazines, newspapers, the radio, the stage, and the screen."&lt;ref name="App"&gt;"Application for Membership" in ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers,'' vol. 3, no. 3 (January 1938).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, members had to accept and observe a set of 7 membership aims:

: 1. To enlist writers in all parts of the United States in a national cultural organization for peace and democracy and against fascism and reaction.
: 2. To defend the political and social institutions that guarantee a healthy atmosphere for the perpetuation of culture ... 
: 3. To stimulate the interest of other writers in our program ... 
: 4. To support progressive trade union organization, especially among professionals and in the liberal arts.
: 5. To effect an alliance, in the interest of culture, between American writers and all progressive forces in the nation.
: 6. To support the People's Front in all countries.
: 7. To cooperate with similar organizations of writers in other countries.&lt;ref name="App" /&gt;

The League of American Writers was governed by Congresses held every two years. The organization also had a number of local chapters which conducted various fundraising activities and events designed to raise public awareness about matters of concern to the League. Chapters were maintained in [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="Dies978"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 978.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization published an official newsletter, ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.''&lt;ref name="Dies978" /&gt;

A number of prominent writers were enlisted in the cause over the next several years, including [[Thomas Mann]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[James T. Farrell|James Farrell]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Nathanael West]], [[Elsa Gidlow]] and [[William Carlos Williams]].&lt;ref name="Klehr353" /&gt; The participation of many of these literary luminaries in League affairs was often nominal, limited to signature of an occasional petition.&lt;ref name="Klehr353" /&gt; This effort at gathering prominent figures was assisted by a muting the explicitly revolutionary language and communist tone of the organization by the time of its June 1937 second convention.&lt;ref&gt;Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism,'' pg. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1937 convention was a more subdued affair than the high-profile 1935 launch, with its opening at [[Carnegie Hall]] attended by 50 "writer-delegates."&lt;ref name="WritersSpeak"&gt;"Writers to Open Congress: Rep. Bernard, Stewart Will Speak at Carnegie Hall," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 14, no. 133 (June 4, 1937), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The keynote speech was delivered by Ernest Hemingway, newly returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Hemingway denounced fascism as "a lie told by bullies" and declared that "a writer who will not lie cannot live or work under fascism."&lt;ref name="Klehr355"&gt;Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism,'' pg. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from the film ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'' were shown to the audience.&lt;ref name="WritersSpeak" /&gt;

Communist Party General Secretary Earl Browder again spoke to the 1937 convention, emphasizing the CPUSA's "[[Popular front|Popular Front]]" analysis that the world was divided into "two great warring camps, democracy against fascism" and leaving it to writers to "adjust their own work to the higher discipline of the whole struggle for democracy."&lt;ref name="Browder37"&gt;Earl Browder, "Speech of Earl Browder: Second Congress of American Writers," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 14, no. 135 (June 5, 1937), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gone was talk of the collapse of capitalism and the duty of writers to speed its demise as participants in the class struggle; now the task at hand, in Browder's view, was the building of "broad unity of all democratic and progressive forces ... against the menace of fascist barbarism."&lt;ref name="Browder37" /&gt;

Frank was replaced as President of the League in 1937, owing to his questioning of the evidence and verdicts being rendered at the great [[Moscow Show Trials|"Show Trials" in Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Dies970"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 970.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as President by [[Donald Ogden Stewart]].&lt;ref name="Dies970" /&gt; The professional head of the organization as Executive Secretary from 1937 to 1942 was Communist Party stalwart [[Franklin Folsom]].&lt;ref name="Klehr355" /&gt; The League touted seven prominent Vice-Presidents during the last years of the 1930s, including [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Erskine Caldwell]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Paul DeKruif]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Meridel LeSueur]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="Dies976"&gt;Letterhead from July 1939 in ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Congress of the League of American Writers, held in New York City in June 1939, once again opened with a Friday night public session at Carnegie Hall. Poet [[Langston Hughes]] delivered the keynote address, in which he likened [[African-American history#Jim Crow, disfranchisement and challenges|the situation of American blacks]] to that of [[Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–1939)|the Jewish minority in Germany]], with but one difference: "Here we may speak openly about our problems, write about them, protest, and seek to better our conditions.In Germany the Jews may do none of those things."&lt;ref&gt;Langston Hughes, "'We Want America to Really Be America for Everybody,' Says Langston Hughes," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 16, no. 133 (June 5, 1939), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' speech was broadly democratic and did not include revolutionary sloganeering.

===Publications===

The League of American Writers somewhat irregularly published a mimeographed newsletter for its members, ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.''&lt;ref&gt;A virtually complete run of this publication may be found in the League of American Writers Papers at the University of California, Berkeley. This material has been microfilmed and appears at the start of microfilm reel 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Circulation was small, with a press run of 700 copies cited in an issue from November 1937, and few specimens seem to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;"An Apology to Californians," ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers,'' vol. 3, no. 2 (November 1937), pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the League of American Writers sent out surveys to over 1,000 American writers asking their position on the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Some 418 returned the survey forms, with 410 supporting the Loyalists to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], 7 professing neutrality, and only one — [[Gertrude Atherton]] — supporting General [[Francisco Franco]] and his nationalist forces.&lt;ref name="FF3031"&gt;Folsom, ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope,'' pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; In accord with the CPUSA's political line, no effort was made to contact writers known to be sympathetic to [[Leon Trotsky]]. When [[Max Eastman]], a translator of Trotsky and opponent of [[Joseph Stalin]], was inadvertently mailed a survey form, Eastman's reply was excluded at the insistence of Communist Party newspaper editor [[Moissaye Olgin]].&lt;ref name="FF3031" /&gt; The other replies were distilled into a pamphlet published by the League of American Writers, entitled ''Writers Take Sides.''&lt;ref name="FF3031" /&gt;

===Decline and dissolution===

With the signing of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] in the fall of 1939, the League of American Writers turned its official policy from one of advocacy of [[collective security]] against [[fascism]] in Europe to one of opposition to the so-called "imperialist war," in accord with a change in the political line of the [[Communist International]] and the CPUSA.&lt;ref name="Dies970" /&gt; This abrupt reversal was not cost-free to the organization, however, as series of prominent members of the League of American Writers left the group's ranks. Those exiting during this "[[Yanks Are Not Coming]]" period included [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Thomas Mann]], and [[Granville Hicks]], among others.&lt;ref name="Dies971"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1940, the League formed a ''[[Keep America Out of War Committee]].'' This group's members included: [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Lawrence Treat|Lawrence A. Goldstone]], [[Eleanor Flexner]], [[Ed Lacy|Len Zinberg]], [[Shaemas O'Sheel]], and [[Sonia Raiziss]], among others.&lt;ref name="DaysOfRage" /&gt;

[[Theodore Dreiser]] was honorary president of the League of American Writers in 1941.&lt;ref name="Folsom"&gt;[[Franklin Folsom]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n1_v47/ai_16892067 "Notes on Writergate: Harassment against League of American Writers], ''Monthly Review,'' May 1995. Published online by CBS MoneyWatch.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The League again abruptly shifted its political position, ending its anti-war stance, with the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]] in the summer of 1941.&lt;ref name="DaysOfRage" /&gt; Echoing another abrupt change of the political line of the CPUSA, the League of American Writers became advocates of American entry into [[World War II]] in defense of the Soviet Union.

The League of American Writers was terminated in January 1943.&lt;ref name="FF265"&gt;Folsom, ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope,'' pg. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive of the League of American Writers is housed at the [[Bancroft Library]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The collection has been [[microfilm]]ed, with the master negative held by the Rare Books and Special Collections Department at the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf9w100843;query=;style=oac4;view=admin#odd-1.3.4 Guide to the League of American Writers archives: Scope and Content], Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:MOBNO banner.jpg|thumb|The flag of the 6th Ohrid Battalion of the Macedono-Adrianopolita Volunteer Corps in Bulgarian army during the Balkan wars. It depicts Bulgarian flag and was brought from [[Gary, Indiana]] by immigrants volunteers. The abbreviation MOBNO is readable on it (Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Bulgarian People's Organization).]]
A century of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] maladministration over [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] as well as the [[Ilinden Uprising|Ilinden Uprising of 1903]] caused thousands of Macedonians to emigrate to places of safety and security – mainly in the United States and Canada. By the early 1920s, there were around 35,000 Macedonian immigrants in North America, most of whom have well established themselves in various industries and trades. It is important to note that in those days the majority of the [[Slav]]ic population of Macedonia declared themselves as [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedono-Bulgarians]], and considered themselves to be a part of the [[Bulgarian people]] – as did the majority of early Macedonian immigrants to North America. All of their early churches, schools, benevolent associations and cultural centers were named "Macedono-Bulgarian", emphasizing their strong Macedonian regional and cultural identity.

First Macedonian associations in the United States date back to 1899, with the foundation of the "Macedonian-Bulgarian Society [[Vasil Levski]]". Other associations include "Bulgarian-Macedonian American Committee" founded in 1904, "Nadezhda" founded in 1908, etc. In September 1913, delegates from Macedonian organizations in the United States and Canada gathered in Chicago, Illinois to form a ''Macedonian-Bulgarian National Union''. The union published the newspaper "Svoboda", and had as its objective the autonomy for [[Macedonia (region)#Ottoman Era|Ottoman Macedonia]] and the [[Adrianople Vilayet|Adrianople area]]. Some members of these organizations participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] as volunteers in the [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;Веселин Николов Трайков, Трендафил Митев, Документи за Македония на българската емиграция в САЩ, Канада и Австралия: т. 1, Макед. науч. инст., 1995, {{ISBN|954818723X}}, стр. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War I]], Macedonia was divided by [[Serbia]], [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]]. In the parts conquered by Serbia and Greece, the new administrators forced out most of the Bulgarian priests and teachers, and began implementing a forceful state-sponsored Serbianizatons and Hellenization of Slavic-speaking Macedonians. These harsh policies of political, cultural and religious repression in Serbian and [[Greek Macedonia]] were conducted with the consent of France and Great Britain, in spite of the warning by well-known political experts that the unsolved Macedonian problem would keep the Balkans in constant turmoil. This had a devastating effect on [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedonians]] in the United States and Canada and triggered a wave of apathy and indifference. All attempts to keep the Macedonian groups together met with failure, and eventually lead to the disillusion of the Macedono-Bulgarian National Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macedonian.org/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=82 "MPO History – Founding Fathers Organize MPO in 1922 During Turbulent Years Following First World War" by Christo N. Nizamoff]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation and Ideology===
[[File:MPO 5a Convention.JPG|thumb|Macedonian Patriotic Organization's 5th convention in 1926.]]
The Macedonian Patriotic Organization was formed in these turbulent years following the World War I, when prospect for freedom by many oppressed groups were dashed. The appeals for a renewed struggle first came from [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]]. and [[Steelton, PA]]., which were the bastions of Macedonian immigration, and were followed by Macedonian groups in [[Indianapolis]], [[Gary, Indiana]], [[Lansing]], Detroit, [[Dayton]], [[Springfield, Ohio]], [[Cincinnati]] and New York City. Ft. Wayne was chosen as the site for the first formative convention, which took place on October 2, 1922, with a handful of delegates, most of whom were Ilinden veterans. The first convention charted a framework within which to build the structure of the new organization, and considerable attention was given to find an appropriate name for it. The proposal for Macedonian Patriotic Organizations was rejected because after the defeat of the [[Central Powers]] in the World War I, the word "patriot" had assumed a repulsive meaning. The convention settled for the name of Macedonian Political Organizations – which, in 1956 was changed to the original proposal – '''Macedonian Patriotic Organizations (MPO)'''.
[[File:1924 Lorain, Ohio MPO Alexander the Great.jpg|thumb|Members of the MPO chapter "Alexander the Great" from [[Lorain, Ohio]] in 1924.]]
Throughout the next several annual conventions, the delegates finalized the organization's bylaws. The unchanged fundamentals of this document are still guiding the MPO into the third millennium. The first article of the MPO bylaws states: "The Macedonian Immigrants of the United States and Canada, as well as their descendants, regardless of nationality, religion, sex or convictions, realizing the necessity of joint organized activity for the liberation of Macedonia, formed the Macedonian Patriotic Organization with the slogan 'Macedonia for the Macedonians'." The historic phrase "Macedonia for the Macedonians", which was adopted as an official slogan of the MPO, was a proclamation of [[William Gladstone]], who in 1897 expressed his views on the [[Macedonian Question]].

The bylaws specify in Article 6. eligibility for MPO membership. "A regular member of these organizations can be any person over 18 years of age, born in Macedonia or of Macedonian descent, who accepts and maintains the aim of these by-laws and pledges himself to fulfill its regulations." As written originally, the bylaw's concept of "Macedonians" and "Macedonian emigrants" was equally valid for all [[ethnic groups]] in Macedonia, which in those days included [[Bulgarians]], [[Romanians]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Albanians]], [[Greeks]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Note" to Article 28 in the first chart of MPO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the MPO, as defined in Article 2. of the bylaws, is: "To work for strengthening the feelings of [[loyalty]] and patriotism among the immigrants and their descendants toward the respective countries where they live – The United States and Canada;" and "To strive in a legal manner for the establishment of Macedonia as an independent state unit within her historic and geographic boundaries, which should constitutionally guarantee the ethnic, religious, cultural and political rights and liberties of all citizens."

For the accomplishment of the above purposes, the MPO founders defined in Article 4. of the bylaws very specific means for the Organization: "It publishes newspapers, books and [[brochures]] to disseminate the truth regarding the just cause of Macedonia and informs the [[public opinion]] on the correct solution of the Macedonian problem." and "It presents the Macedonian cause before foreign nations, legislative bodies, international institutes and societies through memorandums, petitions, statements, protests, resolutions, etc."

===Early Activism===
[[File:MPO 5 Convention.JPG|thumb|The 6th annual convention of the MPO in [[Akron, Ohio]], 1927]]
Since its inception, the MPO has advocated to organize and educate the emigrants in civil values, and to prepare them for fighting in favor of Macedonian liberation. Over the next seven decades the MPO directed its activities toward the establishment of an independent and united Macedonian state that would "guarantee constitutional, ethnic, religious, cultural and political rights and freedoms of all of its citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Article 4 in the first chart of MPO.&lt;/ref&gt;

The different phases that the [[Macedonian Question]] went through have put a pressure upon MPO to develop new modern means to achieve its aims. To fulfill the stipulations of the MPO bylaws, the delegates to the 4th annual MPO Convention in 1925 in Indianapolis, decided to establish a newspaper that was to become an official organ of the organization. The newspaper was founded under the name ''Macedonian Tribune'', and under the guidance and leadership of MPO Central Committee Secretary [[Jordan Tchkatroff]] is and began publication on February 10, 1927.

[[File:MPO-petition-UN.jpg|thumb|The official response from the [[United Nations]] to a petition sent by the 32nd Annual MPO convention.]]
After the end of World War II, MPO was openly opposed the communist regimes in [[Belgrade]] and [[Sofia]], as well as the oppressive government in Greece. Throughout the 60s and the 70s, the MPO raised its voice against the historiographic revisionism that was taking place in [[Socialist Yugoslavia]] which aimed at diminishing the Bulgarian cultural and historic heritage in Macedonia. In the 70s, the Macedonian Tribune regularly printed articles and appeals by the last leader of the IMRO, [[Ivan Mihailov]]. His memoirs (written in Bulgarian) were advertised by the paper and were avidly read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/gp2/gp_21.htm South Slavic Immigration in America. George J. Prpic, John Carroll University. Twayne Publishers. A division of G. K. Hall &amp; Co., Boston, p. 249.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the period of the [[Cold War]], the MPO continuously advocated with the United States and Canadian governments, the [[United Nations]], and other relevant international factors for a solution to the Macedonian Question that would involve self-government for Macedonians under a United Nations [[protectorate]]. The organization also worked on raising international awareness regarding violations of [[human rights]] in all three parts of Macedonia&lt;ref&gt;PAGE ONE: Major Events of the 20th Century. Central Committee of the Macedonian Patriotic Organization. Fort Wayne, Indiana. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years a number of the [[United States|Americans]] born of [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonian Bulgarian]] descent began having less and less knowledge of Bulgaria and often identify themselves simply as [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]].&lt;ref&gt;Macedonians in the USA, Politics. Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups, p. 692, edited by Stephan Thernstrom 1980, Belknap Press of Harvard University, Reproduced 2001 with permission of the publisher&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1990s MPO began openly accepting and embracing the [[ethnic Macedonian]] identity, alongside the [[Macedonian Bulgarian|Macedono-Bulgarian]] identity of the organization's founders. On February 22, 1990, the Macedonian Tribune published an article by then President Ivan Lebamoff, where he stated that MPO is responding to change in Macedonia, throughout the world, and in the organization itself by recognizing the reality of ethnic Macedonians, and by inviting them to join the ranks of the MPO as equals.&lt;ref&gt;"Tumbling Walls Revisited" by Ivan Lebamoff. Macedonian Tribune. February 22, 1990 [Page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

MPO approached the third millennium with great enthusiasm connected with the establishment of the independent Macedonian state – the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

===Advocacy for the Republic of Macedonia===
[[File:Bill Clinton's letter to MPO.jpg|thumb|President [[Bill Clinton]]'s official greeting letter to the 76th annual MPO Convention.]]
The MPO played an enormous role for the recognition of the Republic of Macedonia's [[independent state|independence]]. Only days after the parliament of the Republic of Macedonia (until then a [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|federal unit in communist Yugoslavia]]) declared its independence from Yugoslavia, a delegation of the MPO visited Washington, DC in an attempt to [[Lobbying|lobby]] with the [[US government]] to recognize Macedonia as an independent state. The delegation was received by [[US senate|US senators]] from [[Indiana]], [[Dan Coats]] and [[Richard Lugar]], as well as by members of the [[House of Representatives]]&lt;ref&gt;"MPO presses for free Macedonia in D.C." Macedonian Tribune. November 28, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; MPO's activism, in addition to [[diplomacy|diplomatic activities]] by officials from the Republic of Macedonia finally yielded some results, and on April 8, 1992 the country was admitted to the UN.

To exert pressure for Macedonia's international recognition, MPO President Ivan Lebamoff sent a resolution prepared at the Detroit MPO Convention to many heads of state around the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Delovanje makedonskih izseljencev iz ZDA in Kanade za neodvisnost in mednarodno priznanje Makedonije" by Matjaz Klemenčič. Studia Historica Slovenica 5(1–2–3): 585–605. Ljubljana, 2005. [Page 592–593]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1992 the MPO organized the "Forum on Macedonian Unity", which brought together the leaders of the MPO, the [[United Macedonians]] of [[Toronto]] and the representatives from the [[VMRO-DPMNE]]. The delegates agree on a common goal – a free and independent Macedonia, and the result of the forum was a resolution in which they demanded the international recognition of the Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;"Delovanje makedonskih izseljencev iz ZDA in Kanade za neodvisnost in mednarodno priznanje Makedonije" by Matjaz Klemenčič. Studia Historica Slovenica 5(1–2–3): 585–605. Ljubljana, 2005. [Page 597]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, the MPO began coordinating efforts to bring [[humanitarian aid]] to the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Throughout 1992, the [[Greek diaspora]] in the United States and Canada demonstrated against the recognition of Macedonian independence, above all against the name of the new state containing the word "Macedonia." They claimed that Macedonia was an [[ancient Greek]] name and that the newly declared independent state is stealing this name from them&lt;ref&gt;"The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World", by Loring Danforth. Princeton University Press. Princeton. 1995. [Page 30-32]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] also demanded that Republic of Macedonia's independence not to be recognized by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from Archbishop of North and South America to Parishioners". Macedonian Tribune. May 14, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to this, MPO President Ivan Lebamoff sent protest letters against this position to the patriarchs and bishops of [[Orthodox Church]]es worldwide as well as to numerous newspapers. He also demanded from [[Macedonian Americans]] to enhance their propaganda activities towards getting the [[Republic of Macedonia]] internationally recognized as soon as possible. Macedonian Americans responded to his call with a mass campaign of writing numerous articles in American newspapers and making phone calls to [[US Senators]].&lt;ref&gt;"Delovanje makedonskih izseljencev iz ZDA in Kanade za neodvisnost in mednarodno priznanje Makedonije" by Matjaz Klemenčič. Studia Historica Slovenica 5(1–2–3): 585–605. Ljubljana, 2005. [Page 599–600]&lt;/ref&gt;

MPO also used its influence in the US Senate to assist the Republic of Macedonia's stabilization efforts. MPO President Ivan Lebamoff asked [[Indiana]] Senator Lugar to propose that the United States sends US troops to Macedonia. Lebamoff also informed Macedonian President [[Kiro Gligorov]] about his proposal. MPO proposal was also supported by he Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Fascell. In November 1992, the MPO asked Macedonian Americans to call the [[White House]] Hotline directly to ask [[George H. W. Bush|President Bush]] to immediately recognize the Republic of Macedonia immediately.&lt;ref&gt;"Delovanje makedonskih izseljencev iz ZDA in Kanade za neodvisnost in mednarodno priznanje Makedonije" by Matjaz Klemenčič. Studia Historica Slovenica 5(1–2–3): 585–605. Ljubljana, 2005. [Page 603]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, members of the MPO Central Committee visited Washington, DC several times in order to further press the US government to recognize Macedonia. For this reason, MPO decided to have its 76th Convention in 1995 in Washington, DC. The keynote speaker of the 1995 Convention was Jane Kirkpatrick, former US Ambassador to the UN. Furthermore, in July 1996, MPO President Col. Boris Chaleff met with President [[Bill Clinton]] and Vice-President [[Al Gore]], with whom he lobbied for an early NATO admittance of the Republic of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;Macedonian Tribune. July 11, 1996 [Page 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1998, the first Macedonian Ambassador to the US visited the MPO headquarters in Fort Wayne. In 2004, a MPO delegation met President [[George W. Bush]] at the [[White House]] to persuade him to recognize the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name – which his government did in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macedonian.org/joomla/images/stories/conv2012/todorov_conv2012%20speech.pdf "MPO – 90 Years of Struggle for a Macedonian State". Dr. Lubomir Todorov. 91th Annual MPO Convention in Fort Wayne, Indiana. September 2, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identities ==
Regarding the question of MPO's attitude towards [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]'s historic and contemporary identities, in 2015, then president [[Jordan Lebamoff]] wrote an article in the Macedonian Tribune in which he explains that when visited his relatives in [[Kastoria]], [[Florina]], and [[Skopje]], he used to carry with him three letters: one written in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], one in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], and the other in [[Greek language|Greek]]. He explains that regardless of whether his relatives believed that they were Greek, Bulgarian or Macedonian, they were to him family. Further in the article he states the following:&lt;ref&gt;"New Energy, Old Values". Jordan Lebamoff. Macedonian Tribune, January 8, 2015. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fort Wayne, like other cities, has a diverse Macedonian community. Some feel they are [[Macedonian Bulgarians|Macedonian of Bulgarian descent]], some [[Macedonian Greeks|Greek-Macedonian]], and others simply [[ethnic Macedonians|Macedonian]]: I'm friends with all!

The debates as to who is a Macedonian and what our true identity is must be healthy. They cannot become divisive. The MPO is big enough for all of our ideas. This is not to say that we should forget our founding heritage. I was brought up as a Macedonian of Bulgarian descent. But remember our mission statement. We work make "Macedonia a Switzerland of the Balkans." A place that is safe for all: A place that does not trample on any of our human rights.}}

The various ethnic identifications connected to the name [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] have often caused a lot of misunderstandings. For example, in 1992 Sen. [[Alfonse D'Amato]] (R-NY) addressed former MPO president Ivan Lebamoff as a distinguished member of the [[Greek-American]] community. Lebamoff responded that he is not a Greek, and that Macedonians are not Greeks. In his response, Lebamoff stated:&lt;ref&gt;"Ivan A. Lebamoff to US Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato". Macedonian Tribune. May 28, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We are [[Slavs]], who speak a dialect very similar to the Bulgarian language. Our alphabet is [[Cyrillic]]. While some Macedonians consider themselves Bulgarians from Macedonia, there is another group who consider themselves purely Macedonian.}}

With reference to the question of the ethnic character of the organization, in 2012, MPO veteran and former Macedonian Tribune editor Lou Todorov said that the MPO is neither an [[ethnic Macedonian]] nor an [[ethnic Bulgarian]] organization, but that is patriotic organization of all the people from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], who share the ideal of a free, independent and united Macedonia. To better illustrate the subject, he further explained that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://macedonian.org/joomla/images/stories/conv2012/todorov_conv2012%20speech.pdf "MPO – 90 Years of Struggle for a Macedonian State". Dr. Lubomir Todorov. 91th Annual MPO Convention in Fort Wayne, Indiana. September 2, 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|the fact that one declares himself or herself an [[ethnic Macedonian]], an ethnic [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] or an ethnic [[Greeks|Greek]] doesn't mean that he or she is for a free, independent or [[united Macedonia]]. As we know, there were many Yugoslav-Macedonians whose ideal was [[Yugoslavia]], or Bulgarian-Macedonians who ideal was united Bulgaria or Greek-Macedonians whose ideal is united Greece. Obviously, neither group has the same patriotic feelings or aspirations as the members of the MPO...

There are many such ethnic organizations in the world – but there is only one MPO, a patriotic organization of all the people from Macedonia, regardless of their ethnicity, whose ideal is a free, independent and united Macedonia.}}

With regard to MPO's relationship with the Republic of Macedonia, in 2018, MPO Board of Trustees member Nick Stefanoff stated the following:&lt;ref&gt;"The Macedonian Republic's need for stability and the ethnic Albanian issue". Nick Stefanoff. Macedonian Tribune, May 3, 2018. Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I want the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to become our [[Israel]]. What I mean by this is that I want the Republic to be a uniter of all Macedonians within the Republic and throughout the world, a republic that all Macedonians can be proud of regardless of their political and ethnic dispositions and a Macedonia where those who identify as [[ethnic Macedonians]] are willing to recognizes those Macedonians who identify as [[Bulgarian Macedonians]] and vis a versa. However, even before this can happen, it is essential that the Macedonian Republic continues to exist and it can only continue to exist by becoming less fragile and unstable and more sustainable and secure! (Some would say that the mutual acceptance of both ethnic Macedonians and Bulgarian Macedonians will never occur because of an unwillingness from both sides, but I believe that by focusing on our common ground of a Macedonian identity, the day will come when this will and must occur).}}

== Recent scandals in MPO==
In an unofficial interview for a Macedonian newspaper, former MPO President George Lebamoff sharply criticized the lack of democracy in the Republic of Macedonia, as well as the official misinterpretations of Macedonian history, with an emphasis on the [[Bulgarians|Bulgarian]] historic heritage in country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapital.com.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&amp;tabid=0&amp;EditionID=474&amp;ArticleID=9931 Kапитал, број 300, 28.07.2005 – Ексклузивно: Џорџ Лебамов – МПО (Македонска патриотическа организација)Вака немате иднина!] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120906035112/http://www.kapital.com.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&amp;tabid=0&amp;EditionID=474&amp;ArticleID=9931 |date=September 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 MPO Convention, past Central Committee President Andrea Alusheff was said to have illegally expelled the Toronto MPO chapter "Switzerland of the Balkans", because of the latter's alleged pro-Bulgarian bias.&lt;ref&gt;Labro Korolov [http://www.media-bg.net/facebook.php?id_rel=1400 Media BG, October 30, 2009]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once Alusheff's mandate expired, the new Central Committee reinstated the MPO "Switzerland of the Balkans" into the organization.

[[File:Restricted Zones SOXMIS.svg|thumb|240px|Areas permanently out of bounds to Soviet Military Missions to British Zone of Occupation in Germany]]
The '''military liaison missions''' arose from reciprocal agreements formed between the Western allied nations (the US, the UK and France) and the USSR shortly after the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The missions were active from 1946 until 1990.

The agreements between the allied nations and the Soviet Union permitted the deployment of small numbers of [[military intelligence]] personnel – together with associated support staff – in each other's territory in Germany, ostensibly for the purposes of monitoring and furthering better relationships between the Soviet and Western occupation forces. The British, French and American missions matched the size of the counterpart Soviet missions into West Germany (the nominal post-war British, French and American zones of occupations).  The MLMs also played an intelligence-gathering role.  The MLM teams were based in West Berlin but started their "tours" from the national mission houses in [[Potsdam]] in matte-olive-drab heavy cars.  The Mission teams on a tour frequently comprised one officer accompanied by an [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] and a driver.
The missions persisted throughout the Cold War period and ended in 1990 just prior to [[German reunification]]. The missions were
* British Commanders'-in-Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany ([[BRIXMIS]])
* ''La Mission Militaire Francaise de Liaison'' (FMLM, more properly MMFL in French)
* U.S. Military Liaison Mission (USMLM)
and their reciprocal Soviet missions (SOXMIS/SMLM).

The British–Soviet missions were the first to be established (16 September 1946) under the terms of the Robertson–Malinin Agreement (the respective commanders-in-chief). It also had the largest contingent of personnel with 31 accredited team members. Later agreements with the US (Huebner–Malinin, March 1947) and France (Noiret–Malinin, April 1947) had significantly fewer permitted personnel, possibly because those Allied powers did not want large Soviet missions operating in their zones and vice versa.

[[File:Missions_prohibited_sign.jpg|left|260px|thumb|Typical sign intended to prevent Missions from entering prohibited areas in East Germany]]The Allied liaison missions, having quasi [[diplomat|diplomatic status]], were relatively free to roam around [[East Germany]] save for specifically designated permanent and temporary restricted areas.  They were largely 'untouchable' either by the law or military personnel. However a small number of team members were injured or killed in accidents or 'incidents' which gave rise to significant military and political tensions.

Little is publicly documented about the Soviet missions.

Although not widely known to the general public, the MLMs played a significant intelligence-gathering role during the [[Cold War]]. They also had a significant role in confirming that preparations for offensive action were not under way, thus reducing the tension.

Probably the most notable incident involving the American MLM was the death of Major [[Arthur D. Nicholson]], a U.S. MLM Tour Officer.  He was killed on March 23, 1985, shot by Soviet Army Sergeant Aleksandr Ryabtsev, and was considered the last American casualty of the Cold War, and the only U.S. MLM Officer to die in the course of duty, though other British and French tour personnel had died earlier. After the [[Berlin Wall]] fell in 1989, Nicholson's death was honored on the floor of both houses of the [[United States Congress]], with a speech that was read into the official record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/42385d.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moralism''' is a philosophy that arose in the 19th century that concerns itself with imbuing society with a certain set of [[moral]]s, usually traditional behaviour, but also "justice, freedom, and equality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theissen |first1=Gerd |title=The Bible And Contemporary Culture |date=2007 |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=9781451408607 |page=147 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has strongly affected American and British culture, concerning private issues such as the family unit and sexuality, as well as issues that carry over into the public square, such as the [[temperance movement]].&lt;ref name="KingemannFuchsZielonka2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Klingemann |first1=Hans-Dieter |last2=Fuchs |first2=Dieter |last3=Zielonka |first3=Jan |title=Democracy and Political Culture in Eastern Europe |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134170418 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In tracing the origins of moralism, sociologist Malcolm Waters writes that "Moralism emerged from a clash between the unrestrained character of frontier expansionism, a middle-class, Protestant emphasis on respectability cultivated in small-town America and an egalitarian and anti-intellectual evangelism among splinter Protestant groups."&lt;ref name="Walters2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Waters |first1=Malcolm |title=Daniel Bell |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134845576 |page=73 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, the issues of [[Abolitionism|abolition]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] formed the "twin pillars" of moralism, becoming popular through Christian Churches in the United States, both [[Protestant]] and [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name="Welter2011"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Welter |first1=Brian |title=Philosophy professor finds both Christians, secularists lacking |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2011/philosophy-professor-finds-both-christians-secularists-lacking.cfm |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |language=English|date=6 May 2011|quote=In many essays, Taylor shows how this excessive moralism in both the Protestant and Catholic churches from the 17th century onward led to a "polite" Christian society where being polite was more important than being Christian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robins2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robins |first1=R. G. |title=A. J. Tomlinson: Plainfolk Modernist |date=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199883172 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moralism as promoted by some Christian denominations, such as the [[Quakers]], manifested in wide support for [[abolitionism]] and [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=James Emmett |title=Imaginary Friends: Representing Quakers in American Culture, 1650-1950 |date=2009 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |isbn=9780299231743 |pages=51 |language=English|quote=Still operating at the margins of American religious discourse, Quaker civic moralism would see its legitimacy in the public sphere grow as increasing numbers of American citizens grew sympathetic with the Unionist and abolitionist causes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rise of [[postmillennialism]] in the 19th century "encouraged a general culture of Protestant moralism and pushed it toward a series of social reform movements, from antislavery and abolitionism (freedom for the slaves now), to protests against Indian Removal, to antiwar and peace efforts, to women's rights, to temperance work before and after the Civil War."&lt;ref name="BrekusGilpin2011"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brekus |first1=Catherine A. |first2=W. Clark | last2 =Gilpin |title=American Christianities: A History of Dominance and Diversity |date=2011 |publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press |isbn=9780807869147 |page=50 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the campaign for [[women's suffrage]], evidenced by the ethos of organisations such as the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU), was highly driven by the moralism of that era.&lt;ref name="Delany2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delany |first1=Sheila |title=Writing Woman: Sex, Class and Literature, Medieval and Modern |date=2007 |publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers |isbn=9781556354434 |pages=11 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of 20th century, as well as the 21st century, moralists in the United States turned their attention to championing the [[pro-life movement]].&lt;ref name="KingemannFuchsZielonka2006"/&gt; Moralists have also focused their efforts in maintaining [[blue laws]], such as those that discourage [[Sunday shopping]], in accordance with [[first-day Sabbatarian]] beliefs that resonate with the sensibilities of labourers and trade unions.&lt;ref name="Steinfels2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steinfels |first1=Peter |title=The Neoconservatives: The Origins of a Movement: With a New Foreword, From Dissent to Political Power |date=2013 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781476729701 |page=37 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation in Parliament==
Movement For! did not participate in [[Latvian parliamentary election, 2014|Latvian parliamentary election in 2014]], but received representation in the [[Saeima]] when [[Lolita Čigāne]], [[Ints Dālderis]], [[Andrejs Judins]] and [[Aleksejs Loskutovs]] defected from [[Unity (Latvian political party)|Unity party]], with Čigāne suggesting the Latvian political spectrum needed a centrist, pro-European party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/five-mps-leave-unity-party.a243665/ | title=5 MPs leave Unity party| work=[[Latvijas Sabiedriskais medijs|eng.lsm.lv]] | accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, Saeima members Judins and Loskutovs left the "Movement For".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.diena.lv/raksts/latvija/politika/judins-un-loskutovs-pamet-partiju-_kustiba-par_-14191838 |title=Judins un Loskutovs pamet partiju Kustība Par! |newspaper=Diena |date=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dālderis and Čigāne retired from the party in April 2018, depriving it of its remaining members of parliament.&lt;ref name="BNN-April2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Saeima deputy Lolita Čigāne decides to leave «Kustība Par!» political party |url=http://bnn-news.com/saeima-deputy-lolita-cigane-decides-to-leave-kustiba-par-political-party-182738 |accessdate=9 June 2018 |work=Baltic News Network |agency=LETA |date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, member of European Parliament [[Artis Pabriks]] (former foreign minister and minister of defense of Latvia) defected from the "Unity" party to the Movement For, thereby representing the new party in the European Parliament.

'''''Outlook: Canada's Progressive Jewish Magazine ''''' was an independent, secular Jewish periodical published six times a year and based in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=jfed&gt;{{cite web|title=Outlook: Canada's Progressive Jewish Magazine|url=https://www.jewishvancouver.com/community-directory/outlook-canadas-progressive-jewish-magazine|work=Jewish Federation|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1963,&lt;ref name=final&gt;http://www.outlookmagazine.ca/images/Outlook-Summer-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; as ''Canadian Jewish Outlook'', an English supplement to the Yiddish newspaper ''[[Keneder yiddische vochenblat|The Vochenblatt]]'', the publication had a "socialist-humanist" perspective. It received support from the [[United Jewish Peoples Order]] though it was not formally affiliated with it. ''Outlook'' was the only Canadian publication devoted to [[yiddishkeit]], Jewish ethical humanism and Israeli-Palestinian peace and justice issues.

The magazine adopted its shortened name in 1986. In 1988 ''The Canadian Jewish Outlook Anthology'', a collection of articles, editorials and reviews carried in the magazine during its first twenty-five years was published with Henry Rosenthal and Cathy Berson as editors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/cmarchive/vol17no1/canjewishanthology.html Canada Jewish Anthology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's circulation peaked at 3,000 in the 1990s&lt;ref name=final/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/canadas-progressive-jewish-magazine&lt;/ref&gt; but had declined to 500 by 2016. It was based first in Toronto with Joshua Gershman as publisher and de facto editor until his death in 1978 and, since 1979 in Vancouver where it was edited by Hank Rosenthal, Ben Chud,  and Sylvia Friedman, and since 1998 by Carl Rosenberg and Friedman. After a run of 52 years, it ceased publication with its Spring 2016 issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/canadian-jewish-magazine-outlook-publishes-last-issue&lt;/ref&gt;

'''People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals''' ('''PETA''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|iː|t|ə}}; stylized '''PeTA''') is an American [[animal rights]] [[organization]] based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], and led by [[Ingrid Newkirk]], its international president. A nonprofit corporation with nearly 400 employees, it claims that it has 6.5 million members and supporters, in addition to claiming that it is the largest animal rights group in the world. Its slogan is "Animals are not ours to eat, wear, experiment on, use for entertainment, or abuse in any other way."&lt;ref&gt;For its focus and claim to be the largest AR group in the world, see [http://www.peta.org/about/index.asp "PETA's mission statement"], PETA, accessed May 1, 2013

Founded in March 1980 by Newkirk and fellow animal rights activist [[Alex Pacheco (activist)|Alex Pacheco]], the organization first caught the public's attention in the summer of 1981 during what became known as the [[Silver Spring monkeys]] case, a widely publicized dispute about experiments conducted on 17 [[macaque]] monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]]. The case lasted 10 years, involved the only [[police raid]] on an animal laboratory in the United States, triggered an amendment in 1985 to that country's Animal Welfare Act, and established PETA as an internationally known organization.&lt;ref name=SilverSpring&gt;Schwartz, Jeffrey M. and Begley, Sharon.

''In Defense of Animals'', Basil Blackwell 1985, pp. 135–147.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it focuses on four core issues—opposition to [[factory farming]], [[fur farming]], [[animal testing]], and the use of animals in entertainment. It also campaigns for a vegan lifestyle and against eating meat, fishing, the killing of animals regarded as pests, the keeping of chained backyard dogs, [[cock fighting]], [[dog fighting]], and [[bullfighting]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://www.peta.org/about/index.asp "PETA's mission statement"], PETA, accessed July 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has been the focus of [[controversy]], both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading exporters of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor [[Gary Francione]] lists the group among what he calls "the new welfarists," arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of [[Henry Spira]], makes it an [[animal welfare]] group, not an animal rights group.&lt;ref&gt;For Newkirk and Pacheco being the leading exporters of AR, see Garner, Robert. ''Animals, politics, and morality''. Manchester University Press, 1993; this edition 2004, p. 70.
* For Francione's criticism, see Francione, Gary. ''Rain without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement''. Temple University Press, 1996, pp. 67–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Newkirk told ''Salon'' in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives.&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Peter. [http://www.salon.com/people/conv/2001/04/30/newkirk "PETA's Ingrid Newkirk"], ''Salon'', April 30, 2001. The full quote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen."&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's [[anti-fur]] campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, "[I]t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be "press sluts." She argues, "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves."&lt;ref&gt;For the feminist criticism, see Adams, Carole J. ''Neither Man nor Beast: Feminism and the Defense of Animals''.

===Ingrid Newkirk===
{{main|Ingrid Newkirk}}
[[File:Ingrid Newkirk to David Shankbone on thoughts about herself.ogg|thumb|left|Newkirk talking about herself and her legacy (11:27)]]
[[File:Ingrid Newkirk by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Ingrid Newkirk]]
Newkirk was born in [[England]] in 1949, and raised in [[Hertfordshire]] and later [[New Delhi]], [[India]], where her father—a navigational engineer—was stationed. Newkirk, now an atheist, was educated in a convent, the only British girl there. She moved to the [[United States]] as a teenager, first studying to become a stockbroker, but after taking some abandoned kittens to an animal shelter in 1969 and being appalled by the conditions that she found there, she chose a career in animal protection instead.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Norm. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zrncZO5bmAgC&amp;dq=people+for+the+ethical+treatment+of+animals&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The longest struggle: animal advocacy from Pythagoras to PETA"]. Lantern Books, 2007, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; She became an animal-protection officer for [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], and then the [[District of Columbia]]'s first woman poundmaster. By 1976, she was head of the animal disease control division of D.C.'s Commission on Public Health and in 1980, was among those named as "Washingtonians of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;For her education in a convent and her career details, see Specter, Michael. [http://www.michaelspecter.com/2003/04/the-extremist/ "The Extremist: The woman behind the most successful radical group in America"], ''The New Yorker'', April 4, 2003.
* For Washingtonian of the Year, see [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/6414.html "Past Washingtonians of the Year"], ''The Washingtonian'', accessed June 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; She told Michael Specter of ''The New Yorker'' that working for the shelters left her shocked at the way the animals were treated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I went to the front office all the time, and I would say, "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." Or I would say, "They are stepping on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.&lt;ref name=Specter&gt;Specter, Michael. [http://www.michaelspecter.com/2003/04/the-extremist/ "The Extremist: The woman behind the most successful radical group in America"], ''The New Yorker'', April 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Alex Pacheco (PETA).jpg|right|thumb|[[Alex Pacheco (activist)|Alex Pacheco]]]]

In 1980, she divorced Steve Newkirk, whom she had married when she was 19, and the same year met Alex Pacheco, a political science major at George Washington University. Pacheco had studied for the priesthood, then worked as a crew member of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]'s first ship.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; He volunteered at the shelter where she worked, and they fell in love and began living together, although as Kathy Snow Guillermo writes, they were very different—Newkirk was older and more practical, whereas Pacheco could barely look after himself.&lt;ref name=Guillermo18&gt;Guillermo, Kathy Snow. ''Monkey Business''. National Press Books, 1993, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Newkirk read [[Peter Singer]]'s influential book, [[Animal Liberation (book)|''Animal Liberation'']] (1975), and in March 1980, she persuaded Pacheco to join her in forming People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, at that point just "five people in a basement," as Newkirk described it. They were mostly students and members of the local vegetarian society, but the group included a friend of Pacheco's from the U.K., Kim Stallwood, a British activist who went on to become the national organizer of the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]]. Pacheco was reluctant at first. "It just didn't sound great to me," he told ''The Los Angeles Times'' in 1992. "I had been active in Europe ... and I thought there were just too many formalities. I thought we should just do things ourselves. But she made a convincing case that Washington needed a vehicle for animals because the current organizations were too conservative."&lt;ref&gt;For the Pacheco quote and for Pacheco introducing her to Peter Singer's book, see Rosenberg, Howard.

===Silver Spring monkeys===
{{main|Silver Spring monkeys}}
[[File:Silver-Spring-monkey.jpg|thumb|left|upright|PETA distributed images of the monkeys with the caption, "This is [[vivisection]]. Don't let anyone tell you different."&lt;ref&gt;Carbone, Larry (2004). '"What Animal Want: Expertise and Advocacy in Laboratory Animal Welfare Policy''. Oxford University Press, p. 149, see figure 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The group first came to public attention in 1981 during the Silver Spring monkeys case, a dispute about experiments conducted by researcher Edward Taub on 17 macaque monkeys inside the Institute of Behavioral Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. The case led to the first police raid in the United States on an animal laboratory, triggered an amendment in 1985 to the United States Animal Welfare Act, and became the first animal-testing case to be appealed to the United States Supreme Court,&lt;ref name="SilverSpring"/&gt; which upheld a Louisiana State Court ruling that denied PETA's request for custody of the monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p2p0MptGeBkC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Silver+Spring+Monkeys+Supreme+Court&amp;q=Silver%20Spring%20Monkeys%20Supreme%20Court|title=Animals and the Law: A Sourcebook|first=Jordan|last=Curnutt|pages=55–57|accessdate=August 12, 2010|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=1-57607-147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacheco had taken a job in May 1981 inside a primate research laboratory at the Institute, intending to gain firsthand experience of working inside an animal laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;Pacheco, Alex. [http://www.petatv.com/tvpopup/video.asp?video=silver-spring-monkeys&amp;Player=wm "Testimony on the Silver Spring monkeys case], U.S. House Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Technology, PETA, accessed June 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Taub had been cutting [[Dorsal root ganglion|sensory ganglia]] that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, and legs—a process called "deafferentation"—so that the monkeys could not feel them; some of the monkeys had had their entire spinal columns deafferented. He then used restraint, electric shock, and withholding of food and water to force the monkeys to use the deafferented parts of their bodies. The research led in part to the discovery of [[neuroplasticity]] and a new therapy for stroke victims called [[constraint-induced movement therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Doidge, Norman.

Pacheco went to the laboratory at night, taking photographs that showed the monkeys living in what the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research's ''ILAR Journal'' called "filthy conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Sideris, Lisa et al.{{cite web|url=http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml |title="Roots of Concern with Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical Ethics" |accessdate=2008-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901080534/http://dels.nas.edu/ilar_n/ilarjournal/40_1/40_1Roots.shtml |archivedate=2006-09-01 |df= }}, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research, ILAR Journal V40(1), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He passed his photographs to the police, who raided the lab and arrested Taub. Taub was convicted of six counts of cruelty to animals, the first such conviction in the United States of an animal researcher; the conviction, though, was overturned on appeal.&lt;ref name=Schwartz161&gt;Schwartz, Jeffrey M. and Begley, Sharon. ''The Mind and the Brain: Neuroplasticity and the Power of Mental Force'', Regan Books, 2002, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norm Phelps]] writes that the case followed the highly publicized campaign of [[Henry Spira]] in 1976 against experiments on cats being performed at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York and Spira's subsequent campaign in April 1980 against the [[Draize test]]. These and the Silver Spring monkey case jointly put animal rights on the agenda in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Norm.

The 10-year battle for custody of the monkeys—described by ''The Washington Post'' as a vicious mud fight, during which both sides accused the other of lies and distortion—&amp;nbsp;transformed PETA into a national, then international, movement. By February 1991, it claimed over 350,000 members, a paid staff of over 100, and an annual budget of over $7 million.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Peter.

===Campaigns and consumer boycotts===
&lt;!--This section needs a little more criticism.--&gt;
[[File:PETA Lettuce Ladies.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|PETA's trademark "Lettuce ladies" in Columbus, Ohio]]
The organization is known for its aggressive media campaigns, combined with a solid base of celebrity support—in addition to its honorary directors, [[Paul McCartney]], [[Alicia Silverstone]], [[Eva Mendes]], [[Charlize Theron]], [[Ellen DeGeneres]], and many other notable celebrities have appeared in PETA ads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/sns-green-peta-famous-faces-photogallery.html "Pictures: PETA's Famous Faces,"] ''Chicago Tribune'', accessed 22 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Every week, Newkirk holds what ''The New Yorker'' calls a "war council," with two dozen of her top strategists gathered at a square table in the PETA conference room, with no suggestion considered too outrageous.&lt;ref name=Specter/&gt; PETA also gives an annual prize, called the Proggy Award (for "progress"), to individuals or organizations dedicated to animal welfare or who distinguish themselves through their efforts within the area of animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/03/04/09/7-companies-win-petas-proggy-awards|title=7 companies win PETA's 'Proggy Awards'|last=Servando|first=Kristine|date=March 4, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2010|publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the campaigns have focused on large corporations. Fast food companies such as KFC, Wendy's, and Burger King have been targeted. In the animal-testing industry, PETA's consumer boycotts have focused on Avon, Benetton, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Chesebrough-Pond's, Dow Chemical, General Motors, and others. The group's ''modus operandi'' includes buying shares in target companies such as McDonald's and Kraft Foods in order to exert influence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, as shareholders of YUM! Brands, which owns KFC, PETA submitted a shareholders' resolution asking for more humane treatment of the animals KFC processes.

PETA has also objected to the practice of [[mulesing]] (removing strips of wool-bearing skin from around the buttocks of a sheep).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/mulesing.aspx "Mulesing by the Wool Industry" on PETA web site]
::According to PETA: "Australian ranchers perform a barbaric procedure called "mulesing," in which they force live sheep onto their backs, restrain their legs between metal bars, and, often without any painkillers whatsoever, carve huge chunks of skin away from the animals' backsides or attach vise-like clamps to their flesh until it dies and sloughs off. Both procedures are terribly painful."
* See also [http://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/wool-industry.aspx "The Wool Industry" on PETA web site]
&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the Australian wool industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using Australian wool from their stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/uk-retailer-bans-aussie-mulesing-wool-20100621-yrn9.html|title=UK retailer bans Aussie mulesing wool|date= June 21, 2010|accessdate=21 June 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|first=Petrina|last=Berry}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Australian wool industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents [[Myiasis|flystrike]], a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Wesley, ''A Rat Is a Pig Is a Dog Is a Boy: The Human Cost of the Animal Rights Movement'', Encounter Books, 2010, pp 94–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some campaigns have been particularly controversial. Newkirk was criticized in 2003 for sending a letter to PLO leader [[Yasser Arafat]] asking him to keep animals out of the conflict, after a donkey was [[Exploding donkey|blown up]] during an attack in Jerusalem. The group's 2003 "Holocaust on your Plate" exhibition—eight {{convert|60|sqft|m2|adj=on}} panels juxtaposing images of [[Holocaust]] victims with animal carcasses and animals being transported to slaughter—was criticized by the [[Anti-Defamation League]], which said, "the effort by Peta to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent" and "[r]ather than deepen our revulsion against what the Nazis did to the Jews, the project will undermine the struggle to understand the Holocaust and to find a way to make sure such catastrophes never happen again." In July 2010, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws and banned it within Germany as an offense against human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/2.209/germany-rules-animal-rights-group-s-holocaust-ad-offensive-1.272963|title=Germany rules animal rights group's Holocaust ad offensive|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Ha'aretz|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit, however, had been funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist&lt;ref name=Teather&gt;Teather, David.

Prescott said: "The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible—that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior'—is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in factory farms."&lt;ref name=Teather/&gt; And analogies between [[animal rights and the Holocaust]] had been initiated by the prominent Jewish author [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]].&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Charles. ''Eternal Treblinka'', Lantern Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] criticized the "Are Animals the New Slaves?" exhibit, which showed images of African-American slaves, Native Americans, child laborers, and women, alongside chained elephants and slaughtered cows.&lt;ref&gt;For the letter to Arafat, see [http://www.peta.org/feat/arafat/ PETA's letter to Yasser Arafat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128222159/http://www.peta.org/feat/arafat/ |date=2009-11-28 }}, February 3, 2003; Dougherty, Kerry [http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0203/peta_ass.asp "Arafat gets ass-inine plea from PETA on intifada"], ''Jewish World Review'', February 10, 2003.

PETA's "It's still going on" campaign features newspaper ads comparing widely publicized murder-cannibalization cases to the deaths of animals in slaughterhouses. The campaign has attracted significant media attention, controversy and generated angry responses from the victims' family members.

When the mayor of New York, [[Rudy Giuliani]], was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000, PETA ran a photograph of him with a white mustache and the words "Got prostate cancer?" to illustrate their claim that dairy products contribute to cancer, an ad that caused an outcry in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Norm.

In August 2011, it was announced that PETA will be launching a [[soft pornography]] website in the [[.xxx]] domain. PETA spokesperson Lindsay Rajt told the ''Huffington Post'', "We try to use absolutely every outlet to stick up for animals," adding that "We are careful about what we do and wouldn't use nudity or some of our flashier tactics if we didn't know they worked." PETA also used nudity in its "Veggie Love" ad which it prepared for the [[Super Bowl]] only to have it banned by the network. PETA's work has drawn the ire of some feminists who argue that the organization sacrifices women's rights to press its agenda. Lindsay Beyerstein criticized PETA saying "They're the ones drawing disturbing analogies between pornography, misogyny and animal cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Madeline|title=PETA to launch porn website: Is this still about animal rights?|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/peta-to-launch-porn-website-is-this-still-about-animal-rights/article2139025/|accessdate=August 23, 2011|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=August 23, 2011|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other campaigns are less confrontational and more humorous. {{anchor|Sea kitten}} In 2008, it launched the "Save the Sea Kittens" campaign to change the name of fish to "sea kittens" to give them a positive image, and it regularly asks towns to adopt a new name.

PETA sometimes issues isolated statements or press releases, commenting on current events. After [[Lady Gaga]] wore [[Lady Gaga's meat dress|a dress made of meat]] in 2010, PETA issued a statement objecting to the dress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2010/09/13/Lady-Gagas-Meat-Dress.aspx Lady Gaga's Meat Dress], 13 September 2010, Ingrid Newkirk&lt;/ref&gt; After a fisherman in Florida was bitten by a shark in 2011, PETA proposed an advertisement showing a shark biting a human, with the caption "Payback Is Hell, Go Vegan".

If, as has been reported, this dentist and his guides lured Cecil out of the park with food so as to shoot him on private property, because shooting him in the park would have been illegal, he needs to be extradited, charged, and, preferably, hanged."&lt;ref name="Washington Post 30 July 2015"&gt;{{cite news |last= Miller |first= Michael E. |title= PETA calls for Walter Palmer to be 'hanged' for killing Cecil the lion|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/07/30/peta-calls-for-walter-palmer-to-be-hanged-for-killing-cecil-the-lion/| date= 30 July 2015| newspaper= [[The Washington Post]] |location= Washington| accessdate= 30 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undercover work===

Yum Brands, owner of KFC, called the video appalling and threatened to stop purchasing from Pilgrim's Pride if no changes were made.

PETA also goes undercover into circuses. In 2006, it filmed trainers at Carson &amp; Barnes Circus—including Tim Frisco, the animal-care director—striking elephants while shouting at them.

PETA investigated angora rabbit farms in China in 2013. As [[CBS News]] reported of the resulting video footage, "In the video, the rabbits' high-pitched screams can be heard as farmers rip out their wool until the animal is bald. The rabbits are then thrown back into their cage and appear to be stunned and in shock."

Between 2012 and 2014, PETA investigated sheep shearing sheds used by the wool industry in Australia and the U.S., uncovering "evidence of widespread animal abuse." In Australia, the group "sent three undercover investigators to 19 different sheep shearing sheds run by nine different contractors in three states." As [[NBC News]] reported, "PETA charges that in Australia, workers for seven contractors kicked, stomped or stood on animals' heads necks and hind limbs, while workers for eight contractors punched or struck sheep with clippers. One worker allegedly beat a lamb over the head with a hammer. Workers for five contractors allegedly threw sheep and or slammed their heads and bodies against floors." PETA also sent an investigator to "25 ranches in Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Nebraska" and subsequently "asked local authorities in two Colorado counties to file criminal charges against a specific shearer because of alleged acts of abuse witnessed at two ranches." Moffat County Sheriff Tim Jantz called the video evidence "highly concerning" and launched an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Schecter, Anna.

In 2014, PETA conducted an undercover investigation of the horse-racing industry, filming seven hours of footage that, as ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported, "showed mistreatment of the horses to be widespread and cavalier." Noted trainer [[Steve Asmussen]] and his top assistant trainer, Scott Blasi, were accused "of subjecting their horses to cruel and injurious treatments, administering drugs to them for nontherapeutic purposes, and having one of their jockeys use an electrical device to shock horses into running faster." The newspaper noted that this investigation "was PETA's first significant step into advocacy in the horse racing world."&lt;ref&gt;Drape, Joe.

Robert Williams, executive director of the commission, said, "We recognize PETA for playing a role in bringing about changes necessary to make thoroughbred racing safer and fairer for all." By contrast, the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, which also received PETA's allegations, found that Asmussen did not violate any of its rules. Asmussen remains under investigation by the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] for allegedly violating the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;Drape, Joe.

Also in 2014, PETA investigated [[China]]'s dog leather trade in the province of [[Jiangsu]]. As the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported, "PETA has obtained footage showing workers grabbing terrified dogs with a metal noose, clubbing them then slitting their throats. ... The video footage is too graphic to be shown here and is very distressing to watch." The newspaper also noted that "this is the first time that the production of Chinese dog leather has been captured on camera."&lt;ref&gt;Coyle, Haley.

In 2015, as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported, PETA investigated Sweet Stem Farm, a pig farm that supplies meat to [[Whole Foods]]. The resulting video footage "featured images of pigs, some allegedly sick and not given appropriate care, crowded into hot pens and roughly handled by employees," contradicting both the farm's own video self-portrait and Whole Foods' claims about "humane meat" (a term that PETA maintains is an oxymoron). ''The Post'' notes that "[i]n the wake of the PETA investigation, Whole Foods has removed the Sweet Stem video from its Web site."&lt;ref&gt;Moyer, Justin Wm.

[http://fortune.com/2015/09/23/whole-foods-lawsuit-peta/ "Whole Foods hit with another lawsuit"], ''Fortune'', September 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed by a federal magistrate, who ruled that the store's signage "amounted to permissible 'puffery'" and that "the statement that 'no cages' were used to raise broiler chickens was not misleading merely because Whole Foods failed to also disclose that poultry suppliers normally do not use cages in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;Stempel, Jonathan [https://www.reuters.com/article/whole-foods-mrkt-lawsuit/whole-foods-wins-dismissal-of-peta-lawsuit-over-meat-claims-idUSL2N17U11E "Whole Foods wins dismissal of PETA lawsuit over meat claims"], Reuters, April 27, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS News reported in November 2016 that PETA had captured footage from restaurants that serve live octopus, shrimp, and other marine animals. The group's video showed "an octopus writhing as its limbs are severed by a chef at T Equals Fish, a Koreatown sushi restaurant in Los Angeles." PETA noted that octopuses "are considered among the most intelligent invertebrates" and "are capable of feeling pain just as a pig or rabbit would."&lt;ref&gt;CBS News.

In December 2016, PETA released video footage from an investigation at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]'s dog laboratory, which deliberately breeds dogs to contract [[muscular dystrophy]]. PETA claims that for "35 years, dogs have suffered in cruel muscular dystrophy experiments ... which haven't resulted in a cure or treatment for reversing the course of muscular dystrophy in humans." The ''[[Houston Press]]'' noted that "Texas A&amp;M has been less than transparent about the research, and in some cases has denied that the dogs experience pain or discomfort." Among other efforts, PETA placed a billboard to oppose the ineffectual research on animals.&lt;ref&gt;Malisow, Craig.

Bio Corporation, a company that supplies dead animals for study and dissection, was the subject of a November 2017 PETA undercover investigation. It was claimed that video footage showed workers at the company's facility in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]] "drowning fully-conscious pigeons, injecting live crayfish with latex and claiming that they sometimes would freeze turtles to death." PETA brought 25 charges of cruelty to animals against the company. Drowning is not considered an acceptable form of euthanasia, according to the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]], and its standards of humane euthanasia must be followed by companies certified by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] such as Bio Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo, Kristin.

On 1 May 2018, PETA released an investigation of the mohair industry that led more than 80 retailers, including UNIQLO and Zappos, to drop products made with mohair. The video evidence "depicts goats being thrown around wood floors, dunked in poisonous cleaning solution or having their ears mutilated with pliers. … [E]mployees are shown cutting goats' throats, breaking their necks, electrically shocking them and beheading them."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Lindsay.

====Ag-gag laws====
Various states, including [[Arkansas]], [[Idaho]], [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[North Carolina]], [[North Dakota]], and [[Utah]], have passed so-called "[[ag-gag]]" laws in order to prevent PETA and other groups from conducting undercover investigations of operations that use animals. But PETA and a coalition of animal-welfare groups brought a lawsuit, "citing First Amendment protections for free speech," against Idaho that overturned the state's "ag-gag" law in August 2015, setting a precedent that may help overturn these laws in other states. PETA, [[ALDF]], and other groups are also currently suing the states of Utah,&lt;ref&gt;Runyon, Luke.

In July 2017, a federal judge ruled Utah's ag-gag law an unconstitutional violation of the [[First Amendment]], in the case brought against the state by PETA and ALDF.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, Bill.

The ''Boise Weekly'' noted that the panel of judges "upheld sections of the law about obtaining employment under false pretenses, but came down hard against provisions criminalizing videotaping or photographing inside agricultural facilities in Idaho."&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Harrison.

===Euthanizing shelter animals===
&lt;!--This is one of the most controversial aspects of PETA. Please do your hardest to rework this section!--&gt;
PETA opposes the [[no-kill movement]],&lt;ref name=Interlandi&gt;Interlandi, Jeneen.

PETA's operation of an animal shelter has drawn scrutiny from lawmakers and criticism from animal rights activists. In 2015, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed a measure aimed at curtailing the operations of its shelter that makes almost no attempt to save animals. Virginia's Senate Bill 1381, enacted in March 2015, defines an animal shelter as "a facility operated for the purpose of finding permanent adoptive homes for animals."&lt;ref name=hp.shelter/&gt; PETA opposed the legislation and risked losing access to euthanizing drugs if it did not comply with its requirements.&lt;ref name=wp.shelter&gt;{{cite news |last=Weiner |first=Rachel |date=23 February 2015 |title=Virginia measure could put PETA out of the animal shelter business |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/animal-bill-could-put-peta-out-of-the-shelter-business/2015/02/23/2f4f05b6-bb6a-11e4-b274-e5209a3bc9a9_story.html |work= The Washington Post|location=Washington DC |access-date=23 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hp.shelter&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenwood |first=Arin |date=26 March 2015 |title=Animal Advocates Cheer As Bill Aimed At High-Kill PETA Shelter Is Signed Into Law |url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/peta-shelter-virginia-bill-sb-1381_n_6942866.html|work=Huffington Post |access-date=26 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, industry lobby group the [[Center for Consumer Freedom]] (CCF) formally petitioned VDACS, requesting official reclassification of PETA as a [[slaughterhouse]]. The CCF said in a news release that "[a]n official report filed by PETA itself shows that the animal rights group put to death nearly every dog, cat, and other pet it took in for adoption in 2006."&lt;ref name=CCFshelters&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerfreedom.com/2008/01/224-consumer-group-asks-virginia-government-to-reclassify-peta-as-a-slaughterhouse/ |title=Center for Consumer Freedom – Consumer Group Asks Virginia Government to Reclassify PETA as a Slaughterhouse |publisher=Consumerfreedom.com |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the VDACS said that it had considered changing PETA's status from "shelter" to "euthanasia clinic," citing PETA's willingness to handle animals other shelters would not.&lt;ref&gt;Janice Lloyd, "[http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/pets/story/2012-03-01/PETA-says-exploiters-raise-euthanasia-issue/53315476/1 PETA Says 'Exploiters Raise Euthanasia Issue,]" ''USA Today'' 4 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA has promoted legal initiatives to enforce existing euthanasia laws. In 1990, Georgia's Humane Euthanasia Act became one of the first laws in the nation to mandate intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital as the prescribed method for [[Animal euthanasia|euthanizing cats and dogs]] in Georgia animal shelters. Prior to that time, [[gas chambers]] and other means were commonly employed. Georgia Agriculture Commissioner [[Tommy Irvin]] was tasked with licensing the shelters and enforcing the new law, through the department's Animal Protection Division. However, Commissioner Irvin failed to abide by the terms of the law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiftongazette.com/local/x323686581/Wells-I-did-what-I-was-told/print |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130204103300/http://tiftongazette.com/local/x323686581/Wells-I-did-what-I-was-told/print |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-02-04 |title=Wells: 'I did what I was told' |publisher=Tifton Gazette |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wistv.com/story/6225570/georgia-agriculture-commissioner-gassing-of-strays-is-local-issue?clienttype=printable |title=Georgia agriculture commissioner: Gassing of strays is local issue - wistv.com - Columbia, South Carolina &amp;#124; |publisher=wistv.com |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead continued to license gas chambers. PETA contacted the author of the original legislation, and in March 2007, the Georgia Department of Agriculture and Commissioner Irvin were sued by former State Representative [[Chesley V. Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kittyvillage.com/morton_v_irvin.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000320/http://www.kittyvillage.com/morton_v_irvin.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fulton County Superior Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,260743,00.html |title=Judge Orders Georgia to Enforce Law Preventing Use of Animal Shelter Gas Chambers |publisher=Fox News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; validating the terms of the Humane Euthanasia Act, with an injunction prohibiting the department from issuing licenses to shelters using gas chambers in violation of the act.

====Legal proceedings====
Two PETA employees were acquitted in 2007 of cruelty to animals after at least 80 euthanized animals were left in dumpsters in a shopping center in Ahoskie over the course of a month in 2005; the two employees were seen leaving behind 18 dead animals, and 13 more were found inside their van. The animals had been euthanized after being removed from shelters in Northampton and Bertie counties. A Bertie County Deputy Sheriff stated that the two employees assured the Bertie Animal Shelter that "they were picking up the dogs to take them back to Norfolk where they would find them good homes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolntribune.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1420 |title=''PETA Employees Face 31 Felony Animal-Cruelty Charges for Killing, Dumping Dogs'' |accessdate=2006-06-21 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308014113/http://www.lincolntribune.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=1420 |archivedate=2007-03-08 |df= }}, ''Lincoln Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King, Lauren.

She also stated that the dumping of animals did not follow PETA policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roanoke-chowannewsherald.com/2007/01/31/da-probes-into-peta-procedures/ |title=DA probes into PETA procedures |publisher=The Roanoke-Chowan News-Herald |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/06/30/EDGC9DGTNV1.DTL "The Dilemma of the Unwanted"], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', June 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, a resident of Accomack County, Virginia, produced video evidence that two workers in a van marked with a PETA logo had entered his property in a trailer park and taken his dog, who was then euthanized. He reported the incident to the police, who identified and charged two PETA workers, but the charges were later dropped by the commonwealth attorney on the grounds that it was not possible to prove criminal intent.&lt;ref&gt;Deanna leBlanc (12 November 2014) [http://wavy.com/2014/11/12/man-claims-peta-stole-killed-family-pet/ Man claims PETA stole, killed family pet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221231123/http://wavy.com/2014/11/12/man-claims-peta-stole-killed-family-pet/ |date=2015-02-21 }}, retrieved 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer park's manager had contacted PETA after a group of residents moved out, leaving their dogs behind, which is why the workers were on the property. The state later determined that PETA had violated state law by failing to ensure that the Chihuahua, who was not wearing a collar or tag, was properly identified and for failing to keep the dog alive for five days before euthanizing the animal. Citing a "severity of this lapse in judgment," the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services issued PETA a first-ever violation and imposed a $500 fine. The contract worker who had taken the dog was dismissed by PETA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Jonathan|title=Family of euthanized Chihuahua sues PETA|url=http://pilotonline.com/news/family-of-euthanized-chihuahua-sues-peta-for-million/article_6715657f-db21-5630-8a1a-f87ad6471fde.html|website=PilotOnline.com|publisher=The Virginian-Pilot|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, another satirical game was released featuring a skinned [[tanuki]] chasing [[Mario]] to reclaim its fur from him.

===Person of the year===
Each year, PETA selects a "Person of the Year" who has helped advance the cause of animal rights. In 2015, as ''Time'' magazine reported, the group selected [[Pope Francis]], who took his name from the patron saint of animals, [[St. Francis of Assisi]]. Ingrid Newkirk noted, "With more than a billion Catholics worldwide, Pope Francis' animal-friendly teachings have a massive audience." Previous PETA persons of the year include [[Bill Clinton]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Russell Simmons]], and [[Ricky Gervais]].&lt;ref&gt;White, Daniel. [http://time.com/4130961/peta-pope-francis/ "Pope Francis Is PETA's Person of the Year"], ''TIME''&lt;/ref&gt; More recent picks include [[Mary Matalin]] in 2016&lt;ref&gt;Bedard, Paul.

==Positions==

===Direct action and the ALF===
{{further|Animal Liberation Front}}
Newkirk is outspoken in her support of [[direct action]], writing that no movement for social change has ever succeeded without what she calls the militarism component: "Thinkers may prepare revolutions," she wrote of the ALF in 2004, "but bandits must carry them out."&lt;ref name=NewkirkBest341&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid. "The ALF: Who, Why, and What?", ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters? Reflections on the Liberation of Animals''. Best, Steven &amp; Nocella, Anthony J (eds). Lantern 2004, p. 341./&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box |quote =  Not until black demonstrators resorted to violence did the national government work seriously for civil rights legislation ... In 1850 white abolitionists, having given up on peaceful means, began to encourage and engage in actions that disrupted plantation operations and liberated slaves. Was that all wrong?|source= — Ingrid Newkirk, 2004&lt;ref name=NewkirkBest341/&gt;}}

In 2004 ''The Observer'' described what it called a network of relationships between apparently unconnected animal rights groups on both sides of the Atlantic, writing that, with assets of $6.5 million, and with the PETA Foundation holding further assets of $15 million, PETA funds a number of activists and groups—some with links to militant groups, including the ALF, which the FBI has named as a domestic terrorist threat. American writer Don Liddick writes that PETA gave $1,500 to the Earth Liberation Front in 2001—Newkirk said the donation was a mistake, and that the money had been intended for public education about destruction of habitat, but Liddick writes that it went to the legal defense of [[Craig Rosebraugh]], an ELF spokesman. That same year, according to ''The Observer'', PETA gave a $5,000 grant to American animal rights activist Josh Harper, an advocate of arson.&lt;ref&gt;For the material about PETA's assets, the ALF, and the grant to Josh Harper, see Doward, Jamie.

According to Liddick, PETA has substantial links with Native American ALF activist [[Rod Coronado]]. He alleges that two Federal Express packages were sent to an address in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], before and after a 1992 fire at Michigan State University that Coronado was convicted of setting, reportedly as part of "Operation Bite Back", a series of ALF attacks on American animal testing facilities in the 1990s. The first package was picked up by a PETA employee, Maria Blanton, and the second intercepted by the authorities, who identified the handwriting as Coronado's. Liddick writes that the package contained documents removed from the university and a videotape of one of the perpetrators. When they searched Blanton's home, police found some of the paraphernalia of animal liberation raids, including code names for Coronado and Alex Pacheco—PETA's co-founder—burglary tools, two-way radios, and fake identification. Liddick also writes that PETA gave Coronado $45,000 for his legal bills and another $25,000 to his father.&lt;ref name=Liddick52&gt;For details of the Federal Express packages, the other evidence, and the payment to Coronado, see Liddick, Don.

Newkirk is a strong supporter of direct action that removes animals from laboratories and other facilities—she told ''The Los Angeles Times'' in 1992 that when she hears of anyone walking into a lab and walking out with animals, her heart sings.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; Newkirk commented to the Chronicle of Higher Education in 1999, "When you see the resistance to basic humane treatment and to the acknowledgment of animals' social needs, I find it small wonder that the laboratories aren't all burning to the ground. If I had more guts, I'd light a match."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, Alison. "As Threats of Violence Escalate, Primate Researchers Stand Firm", The Chronicle of Higher Education, November 12, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for [[Wikinews]] (a sister project of [[Wikipedia]] which is a news website) in 2007, she said she had been asked by other animal protection groups to condemn illegal acts. "And I won't do it, because if it were my animal I'd be happy." But she added that she does not support arson. "I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, and so I think at some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that, but maybe that's wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing if they hurt anyone ... Why would you preserve [a building] just so someone can make a profit by continuing to hurt and kill individuals who feel every bit as much as we do?"&lt;ref name="Shankbone"&gt;Shankbone, David.

===Neutering, backyard dogs, working animals, and pets===
&lt;!--Needs more criticism.--&gt;
PETA runs several programs though its Community Animal Project for cats and dogs in poorer areas of Virginia, near its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/feat/cap/ "Join PETA's Community Animal Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110154306/http://www.peta.org/feat/cap/ |date=2010-01-10 }}, PETA, accessed June 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the group sterilized 10,950 cats and dogs, including 851 pit bulls and 584 feral cats, at a discounted rate or free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/blog/petas-spay-neuter-clinics-miracles-performed-daily/ "PETA's Spay-Neuter Clinics: Miracles Performed Daily"], PETA.org, accessed October 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; PETA also shelters neglected dogs and cats who are ill and injured, pursues cruelty cases, and sets up doghouses with straw bedding for dogs chained outside all winter. It supplied 340 doghouses, 1,000 bales of straw, and 2,500 dog toys in 2013.&lt;ref name="peta.org"&gt;[http://www.peta.org/blog/house-can-change-life-petas-doghouse-program-action/ "How a House Can Change a Life—PETA's Doghouse Program in Action"], PETA.org, accessed October 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The group urges population control through neutering and adoption from shelters and campaigns against organizations such as the [[American Kennel Club]] that promote the selection of purebred breeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpinganimals.com/about_cap.asp "Helping Animals in Our Region"], PETA's Community Animal Project; [http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animal-issues/companion-animals-factsheets/whats-best-companion-animals/ Doing What's Best for Our Companion Animals], PETA.org, accessed October 6, 2015. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2009-02-09-peta-westminster-kkk-protest_N.htm "PETA dresses in KKK garb outside Westminster Dog Show"], ''USA Today'', February 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA takes the following position on dogs and cats:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a perfect world, animals would be free to live their lives to the fullest, raising their young and following their natural instincts in their native environments. Domesticated dogs and cats, however, cannot live "free" in our concrete jungles, so we are responsible for their care. People with the time, money, love, and patience to make a lifetime commitment to an animal can make an enormous difference by adopting an animal from a shelter or rescuing an animal from a perilous life on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpinganimals.com/about_cap.asp "Helping Animals in Our Region"], PETA's Community Animal Project; [http://www.peta.org/issues/companion-animal-issues/companion-animals-factsheets/whats-best-companion-animals/ Doing What's Best for Our Companion Animals], PETA.org, accessed October 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newkirk has stated that she doesn't use the word "pet," preferring the term "companion animal," and described PETA's vision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For one thing, we would no longer allow breeding. People could not create different breeds. There would be no pet shops. If people had companion animals in their homes, those animals would have to be refugees from the animal shelters and the streets. You would have a protective relationship with them just as you would with an orphaned child. But as the surplus of cats and dogs (artificially engineered by centuries of forced breeding) declined, eventually companion animals would be phased out, and we would return to a more symbiotic relationship—enjoyment at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;"The Rights Of Animals", St. Petersburg Times, Sept. 4, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

PETA writes that millions of dogs spend their lives chained outside in all weather conditions or locked up in chain-link pens and wire cages in puppy mills, and that even in good homes animals are often not well cared for. They would like to see the population of dogs and cats reduced through spaying and neutering and for people never to purchase animals from pet shops or breeders but to adopt them from shelters instead.&lt;ref name=pets&gt;[http://www.peta.org/campaigns/ar-petaonpets.asp Animal Rights Uncompromised: PETA on 'Pets'], PETA, accessed June 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; PETA supports [[hearing dog]] programs in which animals are taken from shelters and placed in appropriate homes but does not endorse [[Guide dog|seeing-eye-dog]] programs because, according to one of the group's vice presidents, "[T]he dogs are bred as if there are no equally intelligent dogs literally dying for homes in shelters."&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Barnett, "[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/unleashed/2009/01/when-we-first-r.html PETA's Vice President: We Don't Want To Take Your Dog Away]", ''Los Angeles Times'' 10 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; PETA also opposes the [[Fishkeeping#Animal welfare|keeping of fish in aquarium tanks]], suggesting that people view computer videos of fish instead.&lt;ref name="no thanks"&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/Companion-Animals/fish-in-tanks-no-thanks.aspx Fish in Tanks: No, Thanks!], PETA, accessed March 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal testing===
{{further|Animal testing}}
PETA opposes animal testing—whether toxicity testing, basic or applied research, or for education and training—on both moral and practical grounds. Newkirk told the ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine in 1989 that even if animal testing resulted in a cure for AIDS, PETA would oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', September 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The group also believes that it is wasteful, unreliable, and irrelevant to human health, because artificially induced diseases in animals are not identical to human diseases. They say that animal experiments are frequently redundant and lack accountability, oversight, and regulation. They promote alternatives, including [[embryonic stem cell]] research and [[in vitro]] cell research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=126 Animal Experiments: Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216163445/http://www.peta.org/mc/factsheet_display.asp?ID=126 |date=2008-02-16 }}, PETA, accessed June 30, 2010.

===Clothing===
&lt;!--Controversial topic in need of criticism.--&gt;
PETA opposes the use of animals for producing clothing made with fur, leather, wool, or silk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-Used-for-Clothing/default.aspx Animals Used for Clothing position statement].&lt;/ref&gt; It also opposes the use of down from birds and the use of silk from silkworms or spiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-Used-for-Clothing/down-and-silk-birds-and-insects-exploited-for-fabric.aspx|title=Down and Silk: Birds and Insects Exploited for Feathers and Fabric|work=PETA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group notes on its website: "Every year, millions of animals are killed for the clothing industry—all in the name of fashion. Whether the clothes come from Chinese fur farms, Indian slaughterhouses, or the Australian outback, an immeasurable amount of suffering goes into every fur-trimmed jacket, leather belt, and wool sweater."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/issues/Animals-Used-for-Clothing/ Animals Used for Clothing], accessed 1 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The group's ongoing campaigns against the use of animals for clothing include "Ink, Not Mink," which highlights images of celebrities with tattoos, including [[Brandon Flowers (American football)|Brandon Flowers]] of the [[San Diego Chargers]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2014/12/10/chargers-brandon-flowers-makes-ad-peta/ Chargers' Flowers Makes Ad for PETA: 'Ink, Not Mink'], ''Times of San Diego'', 10 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism and dairy products controversy===
According to ScienceBasedMedicine.org, PETA has "a history of (as the old saying goes) using science as a drunk uses a lamppost – for support rather than illumination. In that way they are typical of ideological groups. They have an agenda, they are very open about their beliefs, and they marshal whatever arguments they can in order to promote their point of view."&lt;ref name=sciencebasedmedicine1&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|title=PETA Embraces Autism Pseudoscience|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/peta-embraces-autism-pseudoscience/|website=sciencebasedmedicine.org|publisher=Science Based Medicine: Exploring Issues and Controversies in Science and Medicine|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA {{as of|2015|3|20|alt=claims on its website}} that "scientific studies have shown that many [[autistic]] kids improve dramatically when put on a diet free of dairy foods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Got Autism? Learn About the Link Between Dairy Products and the Disorder|url=http://www.peta.org/features/got-autism-learn-link-dairy-products-disease/|website=peta.org|publisher=PETA|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies such as these have been around for decades and are mainly centered around the concept that behavioral differences between people with autism and [[neurotypical]]s may be observed through a [[gluten-free diet]].&lt;ref name=sciencebasedmedicine1/&gt; According to ScienceBasedMedicine.org:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Behavior in children, especially those with the challenge of autism, can be unpredictable. Unpredictable and variable symptoms lend themselves to confirmation bias, with a strong tendency to lead to the anecdotal experience that whatever is being looked for is real. For example, many parents believe that sugar makes their children hyperactive, when this is simply not true. [...] The evidence for any effect on behavior is weak and likely not real. There is also no credible evidence to suggest that casein plays a causal role in autism. The evidence is overwhelming that autism is a genetic disorder. [...] This is clearly, in my opinion, a campaign of fear mongering based upon a gross distortion of the scientific evidence. The purpose is to advocate for a vegan diet, which fits their ideological agenda. They are likely aware that it is easier to spread fears than to reassure with a careful analysis of the scientific evidence.&lt;ref name=sciencebasedmedicine1/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even though the website cites studies, these studies are outdated, vague, relied on a very small [[sample size]] of children, were [[single-blind]] tests (which can be heavily influenced by an [[experimenter's bias]]), and [[Correlation does not imply causation|conflated correlation with causation]]. The billboards put up by PETA promoting this research have also been considered offensive by many autistic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kluger|first1=Jeffrey|title=Got Credibility?

===Wildlife conservation personalities===
[[File:Steve irwin at Australia zoo cropped.jpg|right|thumb|PETA argues that conservation personalities, such as [[Steve Irwin]] (pictured above), place animals under stress.&lt;ref name=Walls/&gt;]]
PETA is critical of television personalities they call self-professed wildlife warriors, arguing that while a conservationist message is getting across, some of the actions are harmful to animals, such as invading animals' homes, netting them, subjecting them to stressful environments, and wrestling with them—often involving young animals the group says should be with their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helpinganimals.com/f-wildlifewarriors.asp "Steve Irwin: Not a True 'Wildlife Warrior'"], A, accessed June 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 when [[Steve Irwin]] died, PETA's vice-president [[Dan Mathews]] said Irwin had made a career out of antagonizing frightened wild animals.&lt;ref name=Walls&gt;Walls, Jeannette (2006).

The group regularly protests the use of animals in entertainment, including circuses.

Four days after an anti-polo PETA editorial ran in Bangkok's English-language newspaper, ''The Nation'', the Thailand Elephant Polo Association announced that it will end polo matches in Thailand.

Inside the items, though, were what appeared to be the gory flesh, sinews, beating hearts, and blood of animals slaughtered for such items. According to the ''Asian Correspondent'', the stunt caused shoppers to jump back and gasp in horror. PETA claims "to have found workers in crocodile farms 'sawing open reptile's necks while the animals are still alive'" and that "snakes and lizards are cruelly 'nailed to trees' or 'decapitated' before being 'skinned alive.'"&lt;ref&gt;Asian Correspondent Staff.

==PETA India==
PETA India, based in [[Mumbai]], was founded in January 2000. According to the group's website, it focuses principally on "investigative work, public education efforts, research, animal rescues, legislative work, special events, celebrity involvement and national media coverage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.petaindia.com/about-peta/|title= About PETA|accessdate = 16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group has launched investigations of [[jallikattu]] events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petaindia.com/blog/new-investigation-exposes-jallikattu-cruelty/|title=New Investigation Exposes Jallikattu Cruelty|accessdate=16 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151113154040/http://www.petaindia.com/blog/new-investigation-exposes-jallikattu-cruelty/|archivedate=13 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; circuses that use animals in performances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.petaindia.com/media/news-releases/victory-following-peta-investigation-animal-welfare-board-stop-use-elephants-circuses/| title=Victory: Following PETA Investigation, Animal Welfare Board To Stop Use Of Elephants By Circuses| accessdate=16 November 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117023413/http://www.petaindia.com/media/news-releases/victory-following-peta-investigation-animal-welfare-board-stop-use-elephants-circuses/| archivedate=17 November 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and filthy horse stables in Mumbai,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.petaindia.com/blog/investigation-exposes-filthy-horse-stables-mumbai/| title=Investigation Exposes Filthy Horse Stables in Mumbai| accessdate=16 November 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102082553/http://www.petaindia.com/blog/investigation-exposes-filthy-horse-stables-mumbai/| archivedate=2 January 2016| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. The investigation of 16 circuses in India over a nine-month period "revealed that animals used in circuses were subjected to chronic confinement, physical abuse, and psychological torment" and also led the [[Animal Welfare Board of India]] to "ban registration of elephants for performance in view of the cruelties and abuse suffered by them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/elephants-still-being-subjected-to-torture-in-indian-circuses-peta-674933|title= Elephants Still Being Subjected to Torture in Indian Circuses: PETA|accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, with support from celebrities such as [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Pamela Anderson]], PETA India rescued a 14-year-old male elephant named Sunder, who had been kept captive in chains "at a temple in the Kolhapur district of Maharashtra for seven years." Sunder was transferred to [[Bannerghatta Biological Park]], a forested sanctuary, where he can roam freely in the company of other elephants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/celebrity/elephant-sunder-amitabh-bachchan-credits-peta-for-giant-babys-free-home_1539235.html|title= Elephant Sunder: Amitabh Bachchan credits PETA for giant baby's free home|accessdate = 16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal Rahat===
PETA India is affiliated with Animal Rahat ("Rahat" means "relief"), a nonprofit organization that "was created to make a difference in the lives of working bullocks, donkeys, ponies, horses, and other animals." It's located in the sugar-mill district of [[Sangli]], India, and is dedicated to providing "free aid to bullocks who work in sugar mills, donkeys who are used in the brick kilns, horses who pull carts, and other working animals" as well as helping "animals' owners, who are often too poor to afford the sustenance necessary to maintain animals' health and strength, pay for veterinary care in times of illness and injury, or give their animals time for rest and recuperation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.animalrahat.com/about-animal-rahat/|title= Animal Rahat: Changing Minds, Changing Practices|publisher=Animal Rahat|accessdate = 16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, which began its work in 2011, "has worked to ensure that over 7,000 bullocks primarily employed in Maharashtra's sugar factories were replaced by mini-tractors."&lt;ref&gt;Basu, Indrani.

==Domain name disputes==

In February 1995, a [[parody]] website calling itself "People Eating Tasty Animals" registered the [[domain name]] "peta.org". PETA sued, claiming [[trademark]] violation, and won the suit in 2001; the domain is currently owned by PETA.&lt;ref&gt;The site contained links to other sites advocating the consumption of meat, the use of leather and animal furs, and promoting the benefits of animal experimentation in medical research. {{cite news | last = Tennant | first = Diane | title = PETA Finds Satiric Web Site to be Tasteless | pages = E1 | publisher = [[The Virginian-Pilot]] | date = March 12, 1996}}

==Position within the animal rights movement==
{{further|Animal rights movement}}
[[File:Ingrid Newkirk to David Shankbone on the Animal Liberation Front.ogg|thumb|right|Newkirk on clashes with other animal rights organizations and her feelings about the Animal Liberation Front (3:31)]]
[[Robert Garner]] of the University of Leicester writes that Newkirk and Pacheco are the leading exporters of animal rights to the more moderate groups in the United States—both members of an animal rights elite that he argues has shaken up the animal rights movement, setting up new groups and radicalizing old ones.&lt;ref name=Garner70&gt;Garner, Robert. ''Animals, politics, and morality''. Manchester University Press, 1993; this edition 2004, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philanthropedia]] says of the group: "A very controversial organization, PETA is known for bringing into public view the plight of animals of many different kinds. They have brought many issues to the front of people's consciousness about inhumane treatment of animals even though many experts find their marketing and communication tactics a bit extreme at times." The site's summary of expert opinion on the organization's strengths is as follows: "PETA is highly visible, consistent, and well organized. According to experts, they are very tightly focused on their mission and they are able to generate media attention to the cause."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/top-nonprofits/national/animal-welfare-rights-protection/2011/peta-people-for-the-ethical-treatment-of-animals#strength_buckets Philanthropedia: Expert Reviews of PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals)], "Expert Reviews" tab, accessed October 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific experts consulted by Philanthropedia, including academics and senior staff members of other nonprofits, made the following observations about the group's position within the animal rights movement:
* "PETA is not afraid to tackle ''any'' kind of animal abuse issue. They often start working on something well in advance of other organizations, take the 'heat' for others for years while educating people about the thing they're exposing. Then eventually, once a critical mass understands about the issue, it becomes 'mainstream'. I've seen this happen on a number of issues over the years, including fur, vegetarianism, animal research, wool, leather, etc."
* "Students name PETA more than any other organization concerning which group influenced them to make positive personal changes and also be activists."
* "PETA regularly convinces companies to replace their animal testing with non-animal alternatives as well as helping animals who are found living in cruel conditions in the pet and other industries. Their high profile campaigns result in many people becoming vegetarian and vegan."
* "They have brought many issues to the front of people's consciousness about inhumane treatment of animals even though sometimes the way it is done is a little overboard. They have moved the bar from what was considered unthinkable 25 years ago (e.g., humane treatment of laboratory animals) to being considered normal and expected."
* "I don't think one can talk about the animal movement without mentioning PETA. They put the issue ON the map. Whether agreeing or disagreeing with their tactics, [there] is no denying that they are probably one of, if not the, most-well known animal group. And if taken outside the animal movement, that they are a well-known 'brand' in general. That is an amazing impact for a so-called 'fringe' issue."
* "Without PETA, the number of people who have even HEARD of animal rights/welfare/protection would be reduced by at least half, in my best guestimate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myphilanthropedia.org/top-nonprofits/national/animal-welfare-rights-protection/2011/peta-people-for-the-ethical-treatment-of-animals#strength_buckets Philanthropedia: Expert Comments: Evidence of Impact], "Expert Reviews" tab, accessed October 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the group's successes, there has been criticism of PETA from both the conservative and radical ends of the animal rights movement. Michael Specter writes that it provides for groups such as the [[Humane Society of the United States]] the same dynamic that [[Malcolm X]] provided for [[Martin Luther King]], or [[Andrea Dworkin]] for [[Gloria Steinem]]—someone radical to alienate the mainstream and make moderate voices more appealing.&lt;ref name=Specter/&gt; The failure to condemn the [[Animal Liberation Front]] triggers complaints from the conservatives, while the more radical activists say the group has lost touch with its grassroots, is soft on the idea of animal rights, and that it should stop the media stunts, the pie-throwing, and the use of nudity. "It's hard enough trying to get people to take animal rights seriously without PETA out there acting like a bunch of jerks," one activist told writer Norm Phelps. However, Phelps continued: "But it's hard to argue with success, and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world, in terms of both membership and spreading the animal rights message to the public at large."&lt;ref name=Phelps242&gt;Phelps, Norm. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zrncZO5bmAgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22It%27s+hard+enough+trying+to+get+people+to+take+animal+rights+seriously+without+PETA+out+there+acting+like+a+bunch+of+jerks,%22+one+activist+told+writer+Norm+Phelps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAWoVChMI4vK02YPhyAIVi9YeCh07Dwnz#v=onepage&amp;q=PETA&amp;f=false ''The longest struggle: animal advocacy from Pythagoras to PETA"]. Lantern Books, 2007, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ads featuring barely clad or naked women have been criticized by some feminist animal rights advocates. When [[Ronald Reagan]]'s daughter [[Patti Davis]] posed naked for ''Playboy'', donating half her $100,000 fee to PETA, the group issued a press release saying Davis "turns the other cheek in an eye-opening spread," then announced she had been photographed naked with [[Hugh Hefner]]'s dog for an anti-fur ad. In 1995, PETA formed a partnership with ''Playboy'' to promote human organ donation, with the caption "Some People Need You Inside Them" on a photograph of Hefner's wife.&lt;ref&gt;For feminist criticism of the Patti Davis ad, see{{cite web

Newkirk has replied to the criticism that no one is being exploited, the women taking part are volunteers, and if sexual attraction advances the cause of animals, she is unapologetic.&lt;ref name=Phelps242/&gt; Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: "Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, and I understand that. Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'"&lt;ref name=Shankbone/&gt;

{{quote box |quote =If anybody wonders 'what's this with all these reforms?', you can hear us clearly.

[[Gary Francione]], professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, argues that PETA is not an animal rights group—and further that there is no animal rights movement in the United States—because of their willingness to work with industries that use animals to achieve incremental change. This makes them an animal welfare group, in Francione's view: what he calls the new welfarists. A proponent of [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]], Francione argues that PETA is trivializing the movement with what he calls the "Three Stooges" theory of animal rights, making the public think progress is underway when the changes are only cosmetic.&lt;ref&gt;For the Three Stooges point, see Rosenberg, Howard. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61591719.html?dids=61591719:61591719&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+22%2C+1992&amp;author=HOWARD+ROSENBERG&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=FIGHTING+TOOTH+%26+CLAW+INGRID+NEWKIRK%27S+COMBATIVE+STYLE+AND+HEADLINE-GRABBING+STUNTS+HAVE+SHAKEN+UP+THE+ANIMAL-RIGHTS+MOVEMENT&amp;pqatl=google "Fighting tooth and claw"], ''The Los Angeles Times'', March 22, 1992.
* For the argument that the changes are cosmetic, see Francione, Gary. ''Rain without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement''. Temple University Press, pp. 67–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, like Francione, PETA describes itself as abolitionist.&lt;ref name=Specter/&gt; Newkirk told an animal rights conference in 2002 that PETA's goal remains animal liberation: "Reforms move a society very importantly from A to B, from B to C, from C to D. It's very hard to take a nation or a world that is built on seeing animals as nothing more than hamburgers, handbags, cheap burglar alarms, tools for research, and move them from A to Z ..."&lt;ref name=Newkirkspeech&gt;Newkirk, Ingrid. [http://vimeo.com/7246561 "PETA president speaks up for animals"], at 25:44 mins, Animal rights convention, June 30, 2002, accessed June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Francione has also criticized PETA for having caused grassroots animal rights groups to close, groups that he argues were essential for the survival of the animal rights movement, which rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione writes that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a top-down, centralized organization, which not only consolidated decision-making power, but centralized donations too. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather than to a local group.&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary. ''Rain without Thunder: The Ideology of the Animal Rights Movement''. Temple University Press, pp. 67–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the animal-rights movement have responded that Francione's position with respect to groups engaged in actual fieldwork is unnecessarily divisive and hurts animal advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;Bockman, Jon.

Before [[Papal conclave, 1939|his election to the papacy]], he served as secretary of the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], [[Apostolic Nuncio to Germany|papal nuncio to Germany]], and [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' with [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joseph Bottum|author2=David G.

While the Vatican was officially neutral during World War II, Pius XII [[Pius XII and the German Resistance|maintained links to the German Resistance]], used diplomacy to aid the victims of the war and lobby for peace, and [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|spoke out against]] race-based murders and other atrocities.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236599 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica : '&amp;#39;Reflections on the Holocaust'&amp;#39; |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Reichskonkordat'' and his leadership of the Catholic Church during the war remain the subject of controversy—including allegations of public silence and inaction about the fate of the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Noel, The Hound of Hitler, p. 3 [http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-5770 Encyclopædia Britannica Online – Reflections on the Holocaust: Further Reading]; web 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he advocated peace and reconciliation, including lenient policies towards former [[Axis powers|Axis]] and Axis-satellite nations. He was also a staunch opponent of [[Communism]] and of the [[Italian Communist Party]].

During his papacy, the Church issued the [[Decree against Communism]], declaring that Catholics who profess [[Communism|Communist]] doctrine are to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] as [[Apostasy|apostates]] from the Christian faith. In turn, [[Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII|the Church experienced severe persecution]] and mass deportations of Catholic clergy in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. He explicitly invoked ''[[ex cathedra]]'' [[papal infallibility]] with the [[Dogma in the Catholic Church|dogma]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]] in his [[Apostolic constitution]] ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Catholicism'' by Frank K.

==Early life==
{{Main article|Early life of Pope Pius XII}}
Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli was born on 2 March 1876 in Rome into a family of intense Catholic piety with a history of ties to the papacy (the "[[Black Nobility]]"). His parents were Filippo Pacelli (1837–1916) and Virginia (née Graziosi) Pacelli (1844–1920). His grandfather, Marcantonio Pacelli, had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, 2005, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; and then Secretary of the Interior under [[Pope Pius IX]] from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican's newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Noel, Pius XII:The Hound of Hitler, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; His cousin, [[Ernesto Pacelli]], was a key financial advisor to [[Pope Leo XIII]]; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a [[Franciscan]] [[Third order|tertiary]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; was the dean of the [[Roman Rota]]; and his brother, [[Francesco Pacelli]], became a [[Laity|lay]] [[canon law]]yer and the legal advisor to [[Pope Pius XI]], in which role he negotiated the [[Lateran Treaty]] in 1929, the pact with [[Benito Mussolini]], bringing an end to the [[Roman Question]].
[[File:Eugenio1882.jpg|upright|thumb|150px|left|Eugenio Pacelli at the age of six in 1882]]

Together with his brother Francesco and his two sisters, Giuseppina and Elisabetta, he grew up in the [[Parione]] district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880 he began school at the convent of the French [[Sisters of Divine Providence]] in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]]. Eugenio and the other children made their [[First Communion]] at this church and Eugenio served there as an [[altar boy]] from 1886. In 1886 too he was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the [[Piazza Venezia]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, A Cross Too Heavy, 2011, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891 Pacelli's father sent Eugenio to the Liceo Ennio Quirino Visconti Institute, a state school situated in what had been the [[Collegio Romano]], the premier Jesuit university in Rome.

In 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome's oldest seminary, the [[Almo Collegio Capranica]],&lt;ref&gt;O'Shea, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit [[Pontifical Gregorian University]] and theology at the [[Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare]]. He was also enrolled at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|State University, La Sapienza]] where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899 he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church career==

===Priest and Monsignor===
[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Pacelli on the day of his ordination: 2 April 1899]]
While all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]],&lt;ref name="Gerard Noel, p.9"&gt;Noel, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Pacelli was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest on [[Easter Sunday]], 2 April 1899 alone in the private chapel of a family friend the [[Vicegerent]] of Rome, [[Francesco di Paola Cassetta|Mgr Paolo Cassetta]]. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant'Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a [[curate]] at [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]].&lt;ref name="marchione193"&gt;Marchione, 2000, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 he entered the [[Section for Relations with States (Roman Curia)|Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs]], a sub-office of the [[Secretariat of State (Vatican)|Vatican Secretariat of State]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Shea, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsignor [[Pietro Gasparri]], the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the "Vatican's equivalent of the Foreign office" by highlighting the "necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe".&lt;ref name="Gerard Noel, p. 10"&gt;Noel, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Pacelli became an ''apprendista'', an apprentice, in Gasparri's department. In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to King [[Edward VII]] of the UK after the death of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="marchione9"&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MarrydelValpacelli.jpg|thumb|left|upright|150px|The Serbian Concordat, 24 June 1914. Present for the Vatican were [[Cardinal Merry del Val]] and next to him, Pacelli.]]
By 1904 Pacelli received his doctorate. The theme of his thesis was the nature of [[concordats]] and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of ''minutante'', he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a [[papal chamberlain]]. In 1905 he received the title [[Domestic Prelate|domestic prelate]].&lt;ref name="marchione193"/&gt; From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs.&lt;ref name="marchione10"&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], "the text, together with the [[Anti-Modernist Oath]], became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, ''Hitler's Pope'', p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the [[International Eucharistic Congress]], accompanying [[Rafael Merry del Val]]&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; to London,&lt;ref name="marchione9"/&gt; where he met [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of King [[George V]].&lt;ref name="marchione10"/&gt;
Pacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under [[Pope Pius X]] and retained under [[Pope Benedict XV]]), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914.&lt;ref name="marchione10"/&gt; On 24 June 1914, just four days before [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated in [[Sarajevo]], Pacelli, together with [[Cardinal Merry del Val]], represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. [[Serbia]]'s success in the [[First Balkan War]] against [[Turkey]] in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging [[Austria-Hungary]]'s sphere of influence throughout the [[Balkans]]. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary.&lt;ref&gt;O'Shea, pp. 86, 88&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican's registry of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to [[Vienna]] to assist Monsignor [[Raffaele Scapinelli di Léguigno|Raffaele Scapinelli]], [[nuncio]] to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] regarding Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 1211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archbishop and Papal nuncio===
{{Main article|Nunciature of Eugenio Pacelli}}
[[File:PioXIIgernamia1917.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Pacelli at the Headquarters of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]]]
Pope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Bavaria|nuncio to Bavaria]] on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as [[titular bishop|titular]] [[See of Sardis|Archbishop of Sardis]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]] on 13 May 1917. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for [[Bavaria]]. As there was no nuncio to [[Prussia]] or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the [[German Empire]].

Once in [[Munich]], he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Fatoni, 1992, pp. 45–85&lt;/ref&gt; He met with [[Ludwig III of Bavaria|King Ludwig III]] on 29 May, and later with [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]&lt;ref name="marchione11"&gt;Marchione, 2004, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann-Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.

Sister Pascalina later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned "deaf ear to all his proposals". She later wrote, "Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the [[Rhine]] with his finger on a map, he said sadly, 'No doubt this will be lost as well.' I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right."&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert (2014), pages 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the remainder of the Great War, Pacelli concentrated on Benedict's humanitarian efforts&lt;ref&gt;Rychlak, 2000, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; especially among Allied POWs in German custody.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert (2014), 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; In the upheaval following the Armistice, a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV's permission to leave Munich, where [[Kurt Eisner]] had formed the [[Free State of Bavaria]], and he left for a while to [[Rorschach, St. Gallen|Rorschach]], and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Monsignor Schioppa, the ''uditore'', was left in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

"His recovery began with a 'rapport{{'"}} with the 24-year-old Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]]—she would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli "pulled strings at the highest level".&lt;ref&gt;Noel, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

When he returned to Munich, following Eisner's assassination by an anti-Semitic extreme nationalist, [[Anton Graf von Arco auf Valley|Count Anton von Arco auf Valley]], he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa's eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of [[Max Levien]], [[Eugen Levine]], and [[Towia Axelrod]] sought power: "the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien's mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorcée [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ..." John Cornwell alleges that a worrying impression of anti-Semitism is discernible in the "catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness" and Pacelli's "constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers" chimed with the "growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Also according to Cornwell, Pacelli informed Gasparri that "the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cornwell|title=Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFHKrYwv87sC&amp;pg=PA78|year=2000|publisher=Penguin|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the Nuncio was repeatedly threatened by emissaries of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Once, in a violation of international law, the Bavarian Revolutionary Government attempted to confiscate the Nunciature's car at gunpoint. Despite their demands, however, Pacelli refused to leave his post.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert (2014), pages 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic|Munich Soviet Republic]] was defeated and toppled by [[Freikorps]] and [[Reichswehr]] troops, the Nuncio focused on, according to Lehnert, "alleviating the distress of the postwar period, consoling, supporting all in word and deed".&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert (2014), page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00535, Bamberg, 900 Jahr-Feier der Stadt.jpg|thumb|left|Nuncio Pacelli in July 1924 at the 900th anniversary of the City of [[Bamberg]]]]
Pacelli was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Germany]] on 23 June 1920, and—after the completion of a Bavarian concordat—his nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli's Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor [[Robert Leiber]] and Sister [[Pascalina Lehnert]]—housekeeper, cook, friend, and adviser for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest [[Ludwig Kaas]], who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], a party he led following [[Wilhelm Marx]]'s resignation in October 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, 1972; Cornwell, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended [[Katholikentag]] (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people.&lt;ref&gt;Kaas, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; In Berlin he lived in the [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]] quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite. [[Paul von Hindenburg]], [[Gustav Stresemann]], and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests.
[[File:PacelliBavaria1922a.JPG|thumb|right|145px|Pacelli in Bavaria, 1922]]

In post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister [[Georgi Chicherin]], who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;Stehle, 1975, pp. 139–41&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until [[Pius XI]] ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Saar region]], supported the appointment of a papal administrator for [[Danzig]] and aided the reintegration of priests expelled from Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Morsey, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929. Following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the beginnings of a world economic slump appeared, and the days of the [[Weimar Republic]] were numbered. Pacelli was summoned back to Rome at this time—the call coming by telegram when he was resting at his favourite retreat, the Rorschach convent sanatorium. He left Berlin on 10 December 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, pp. 103–04&lt;/ref&gt; David Dalin wrote "of the forty-four speeches Pacelli gave in Germany as papal nuncio between 1917 and 1929, forty denounced some aspect of the emerging Nazi ideology".&lt;ref name="The Pius War 2010, p. 17"&gt;''The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII'', David G. Dalin, Joseph Bottum, Lexington Books, 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he wrote a letter to the bishop of Cologne describing the Nazis as "false prophets with the pride of Lucifer". and as "bearers of a new faith and a new Evangile" who were attempting to create "a mendacious antimony between faithfulness to the Church and the Fatherland".&lt;ref&gt;''Controversial Concordats: The Vatican's Relations with Napoleon, Mussolini, and Hitler,'' Ed Frank J. Coppa, Catholic University of America Press, P. 173, {{ISBN|081320920X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later at Notre Dame in Paris he named Germany as "that noble and powerful nation whom bad shepherds would lead astray into an ideology of race".&lt;ref name="The Pius War 2010, p. 17"/&gt;

===Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo===
[[File:PacelliBrasil1934.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Secretary of State Pacelli in Brazil in 1934]]
Pacelli was made a Cardinal-Priest of ''[[Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Rome)|Santi Giovanni e Paolo]]'' on 16 December 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and within a few months, on 7 February 1930, Pius XI appointed him [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], responsible for foreign policy and state relations throughout the world. In 1935, Pacelli was named [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church]].

As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a [[Baden]] Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, [[Conrad Gröber]], the new [[Archbishop of Freiburg]], and the treaty was signed in August
1932.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, 2002, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1935) and Portugal (1940). The [[Lateran treaties]] with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic [[Italian People's Party (1919)|Catholic Popular Party]], in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged [[Catholic Action]], "an anaemic form of clerically dominated religious rally-rousing". It was permitted only so long as it developed "its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of [[Nullity (conflict)|nullity]] in the area of marriage).&lt;ref&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin (ed.). Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (trans.) (2005). ''The Encyclopedia of Christianity''; {{ISBN|0-8028-2416-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic chancellor [[Heinrich Bruning]], who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he "misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Following Bruning's resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, "that would correspond to their principles".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwell, p. 128. Pacelli, quoted in Scholder's ''The Churches and the Third Reich'', p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an [[Eugenio Pacelli's 1936 visit to the United States|extensive visit to the United States in 1936]] where he met President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who appointed a personal envoy—who did not require Senate confirmation—to the [[Holy See]] in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the pope lost [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt;

Pacelli presided as [[Papal Legate]] over the [[International Eucharistic Congress]] in [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]] in 10–14 October 1934, and in [[Budapest]] in 25–30 May 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2002, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary.

W. Klieforth, the American consul to Berlin, that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was 'an untrustworthy scoundrel and fundamentally wicked person', to quote Klieforth, who also wrote that Pacelli 'did not believe Hitler capable of moderation, and ... fully supported the German bishops in their anti-Nazi stand.' This was matched with the discovery of Pacelli's [[anti-Nazi]] report, written the following year for President Roosevelt and filed with Ambassador [[Joseph Kennedy]], which declared that the Church regarded compromise with the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] as 'out of the question'."&lt;ref name="bottum"&gt;Joseph Bottum.

Historian Walter Bussmann argued that Pacelli, as Cardinal Secretary of State, dissuaded Pope Pius XI—who was nearing death at the time&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;—from condemning the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in November 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Bussmann |first1 = Walter |year = 1969 |title = Pius XII an die deutschen Bischöfe |url = |journal = Hochland |volume = 61 |issue = |pages = 61–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was informed of it by the papal nuncio in Berlin.&lt;ref name="gutman1136"&gt;Gutman, Israel, Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, p. 1136&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Reichskonkordat'' and ''Mit brennender Sorge''===
{{See also|Reichskonkordat|Mit brennender Sorge}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R24391, Konkordatsunterzeichnung in Rom.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pacelli ''(seated, center)'' at the signing of the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]'' on 20 July 1933 in Rome with ''(from left to right)'': German prelate Ludwig Kaas, German Vice-Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], Secretary of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs [[Giuseppe Pizzardo]], [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], and Reich minister [[Rudolf Buttmann]]]]

The ''Reichskonkordat'' was an integral part of four [[concordat]]s Pacelli concluded on behalf of the Vatican with German States. The state concordats were necessary because the German [[federalism|federalist]] Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian Nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1925. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany.&lt;ref name="Volk"&gt;Ludwig Volk, Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen Ländern in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Dietrich, p.&amp;nbsp;92, Syracuse University Press, 2003; {{ISBN|0-8156-3029-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prussia showed interest in negotiations only after the Bavarian concordat. However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the Church in the Prussian concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, pp. 539–544&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922–1932.&lt;ref&gt;They included: Latvia 1922, Bavaria 1925, Poland 1925, France I., 1926, France II. 1926, Lithuania 1927, Czechoslovakia 1928, Portugal I 1928, Italy I 1929, Italy II 1929, Portugal II 1929, Romania I 1927, Prussia 1929, Romania II 1932, Baden 1932, Germany 1933, Austria 1933. See P. Joanne M.Restrepo Restrepo SJ. ''Concordata Regnante Sanctissimo Domino Pio PP.XI. Inita'' Pontificia Universita Gregoriana, Roma, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Reichskonkordat'', signed on 20 July 1933, between Germany and the Holy See, while thus a part of an overall Vatican policy, was controversial from its beginning. It remains the most important of Pacelli's concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli's main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the Church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (§31), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Volk, "Die Kirche in den deutschsprachigen Ländern" in: ''Handbuch der Kirchengeschichte, Band VII'', pp. 546–547&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[nuncio]] during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Volk ''Das Reichskonkordat vom 20. Juli 1933'', pp. 34f, 45–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Scholder ''The Churches and the Third Reich'' volume 1: especially Part 1, chapter 10; part 2, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and sought to gain international respectability and to remove internal opposition by representatives of the Church and the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]]. He sent his vice chancellor [[Franz von Papen]], a Catholic nobleman and member of the Centre Party, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, pp. 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Feldkamp, pp. 88–93&lt;/ref&gt; On behalf of Pacelli, Prelate Ludwig Kaas, the outgoing chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated first drafts of the terms with Papen.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, pp. 101, 105&lt;/ref&gt; The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July and ratified on 10 September 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Volk, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; Father Franziscus Stratman, senior Catholic chaplain at Berlin University wrote "The souls of well-disposed people are in a turmoil as a result of the tyranny of the National Socialists, and I am merely stating a fact when I say that the authority of the bishops among innumerable Catholics and non-Catholics has been shaken by the quasi-approval of the National Socialist movement".&lt;ref&gt;Scholder, ''The Churches and the Third Reich, ii, p. 154''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Konrad von Preysing|Bishop Preysing]] cautioned against compromise with the new regime, against those who saw the Nazi persecution of the church as an aberration that Hitler would correct.&lt;ref&gt;Krieg, Robert A., ''Catholic Theologians in Nazi Germany'', p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1933 and 1939, Pacelli issued 55 protests of violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''. Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber]] to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the ''Reichskonkordat''; this was to become Pius XI's 1937 encyclical, ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]''. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual [[Latin]] of official Catholic Church documents. Secretly distributed by an army of motorcyclists and read from every German Catholic Church pulpit on [[Palm Sunday]], it condemned the [[paganism]] of the [[National Socialism]] ideology.&lt;ref name="Vidmar327"&gt;Vidmar, pp. 327–31&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XI credited its creation and writing to Pacelli.&lt;ref name="Pham45"&gt;Pham, p. 45, quote: "When Pius XI was complimented on the publication, in 1937, of his encyclical denouncing Nazism, ''Mit brennender Sorge'', his response was to point to his Secretary of State and say bluntly, 'The credit is his.{{'"}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization and resulted in persecution of the Church by the infuriated Nazis who closed all the participating presses and "took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy".&lt;ref name="Bokenkotter389"&gt;Bokenkotter, pp. 389–92, quote "And when Hitler showed increasing belligerance toward the Church, Pius met the challenge with a decisiveness that astonished the world. His encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' was the 'first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism' and 'one of the greatest such condemnations ever issued by the Vatican'. Smuggled into Germany, it was read from all the Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday in March 1937. It exposed the fallacy and denounced the Nazi myth of blood and soil; it decried its neopaganism, its war of annihilation against the Church, and even described the Führer himself as a 'mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance'. The Nazis were infuriated, and in retaliation closed and sealed all the presses that had printed it and took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy."&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June 1941, the pope commented on the problems of the ''Reichskonkordat'' in a letter to the [[Bishop of Passau]], in Bavaria: "The history of the Reichskonkordat shows, that the other side lacked the most basic prerequisites to accept minimal freedoms and rights of the Church, without which the Church simply cannot live and operate, formal agreements notwithstanding".&lt;ref&gt;74.A l'Eveque de Passau, in "Lettres de Pie XII aux Eveques Allemands 1939–1944, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1967, p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Pius XI died on 10 February 1939. Several historians have interpreted the conclave to choose his successor as facing a choice between a diplomatic or a spiritual candidate, and they view Pacelli's diplomatic experience, especially with Germany, as one of the deciding factors in his election on 2&amp;nbsp;March 1939, his 63rd birthday, after only one day of deliberation and three ballots.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Feldkamp. ''Pius XII und Deutschland''; {{ISBN|3-525-34026-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first cardinal Secretary of State to be elected pope since [[Pope Clement IX|Clement IX]] in 1667.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Forum. [http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0260.htm Pope Pius XII profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060424052820/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/pope0260.htm |date=24 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of only two men known to have served as [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]] immediately prior to being elected as pope (the other being [[Pope Leo XIII]]). According to rumours, he asked for another ballot to be taken to ensure the validity of his election. After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.

His [[Papal Coronation|coronation]] took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]] of Jerusalem, [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]], [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches|prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches]] and [[Congregation for Bishops|prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation]]. There was however a Cardinal-Secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis.

Pacelli took the same papal name as his predecessor, a title used exclusively by [[:Category:Italian popes|Italian Popes]]. He was quoted as saying, "I call myself Pius; my whole life was under Popes with this name, but especially as a sign of gratitude towards [[Pius XI]]."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, quoted in Joseph Brosch, Pius XII, Lehrer der Wahrheit, Kreuzring, Trier,1968, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying "He is in your midst."&lt;ref&gt;"Medius vestrum stetit quem vos nescetis. Everybody knew what the pope meant". Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte Ihm Dienen, Erinnerungen an Papst Pius XII''. Naumann, Würzburg, 1986, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously been quoted as saying: "When today the Pope dies, you'll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one. I pray every day, God may send another one into one of our seminaries, but as of today, there is only one in this world."&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte Ihm Dienen, Erinnerungen an Papst Pius XII''. Naumann, Würzburg, 1986, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointments===
[[File:1983pasca.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Mother [[Pascalina Lehnert]], Pius XII's housekeeper and confidant for 41 years, until his death&lt;ref name="Gerard Noel, p.9"/&gt;]]
After his election, he made [[Luigi Maglione]] his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for many years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Monsignors Montini (later [[Pope Paul VI]]) and [[Domenico Tardini]]. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section.&lt;ref&gt;Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs and Congregation of Ordinary Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals,&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, ''La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953'' in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita Vatican City, 1953, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; an honor which both turned down.&lt;ref&gt;Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana, 1960, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia.&lt;ref&gt;Giulio Nicolini, Il Cardinale Domenico Tardini, Padova, 1980; {{ISBN|88-7026-340-1}}; p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of [[Milan]], after the death of [[Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster]].

Pius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the [[Roman Curia]]; he employed German and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Jesuit]] advisors, Robert Leiber, [[Augustin Bea]], and [[Sebastian Tromp]]. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]] from a minor to a major role in the Church.&lt;ref&gt;In the Secretariat of State he had actively supported "foreigners", for example Francis Spellman, the American monsignor, whom he consecrated himself as the first American Bishop in the Vatican curia. Spellman had organized and accompanied Pacelli's American journey and arranged a meeting with President Roosevelt. Only 30 days after his coronation, on 12 April 1939, Pope Pius XII named Spellman as archbishop of [[New York City|New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, Robert I. ''The Cardinal Spellman Story'', Doubleday Company, New York, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, Pius XII appointed more non-Italians than any Pope before him. American appointees included [[Joseph P. Hurley]] as regent of the nunciature in Belgrade, [[Gerald P. O'Hara]] as nuncio to [[Romania]], and Monsignor [[Aloisius Joseph Muench|Muench]] as nuncio to Germany. For the first time, numerous young Europeans, Asians and "Americans were trained in various congregations and secretariats within the Vatican for eventual service throughout the world."&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace''; p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consistories===
{{further information|Cardinals created by Pius XII}}
Only twice in his pontificate did Pius XII hold a [[papal consistory|consistory]] to create new [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], in contrast to Pius XI, who had done so 17 times in as many years. Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]] of [[Philadelphia]] being the only living U.S. cardinal. The first occasion on 18 February 1946—which has become known as the "Grand Consistory"—yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost 50 percent of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals.&lt;ref&gt;(previously [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]]'s elevation of 31 cardinals in 1517 had held this title). [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] surpassed this number on 21 February 2001, elevating 44 cardinals. By that time, the limit had been suspended and over 120 Cardinals existed.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from [[China]], [[India]], the [[Middle East]] and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.&lt;ref&gt;Oscar Halecki, James Murray, Jr. ''Pius XII, Eugenio Pacelli, Pope of Peace'', p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

In his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs. [[Domenico Tardini]] and Giovanni Montini would be elevated&lt;ref&gt;Levillain, 2002, p. 1136&lt;/ref&gt; and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list,&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, La Allocuzione nel consistorio Segreto del 12 Gennaio 1953 in Pio XII, Discorsi e Radiomessagi di Sua Santita, Vatican City, 1953, p. 455&lt;/ref&gt; but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions.&lt;ref&gt;Tardini later thanked him for not appointing him. The Pope replied with a smile: Monsignore mio, you thank me, for not letting me do what I wanted to do" I replied, yes Holy Father, I thank you for everything you have done for me, but even more, what you have not done for me. The Pope smiled.'' In Domenico Cardinale Tardini, Pio XII, Tipografia Poliglotta Vaticana'', 1960 157&lt;/ref&gt; Both Montini and Tardini would become Cardinals shortly after Pius' death; Montini later became [[Pope Paul VI]]. The two consistories of 1946 and 1953 brought an end to over five hundred years of Italians constituting a majority of the [[College of Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Greg. (2003).

With few exceptions, Italian prelates accepted the changes positively; there was no protest movement or open opposition to the internationalization efforts.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Padellaro: "Church history will memorize with special letters the secret conclave of 1946, and the cosmopolitan Pius XII, who called men of all races into the Senate of the Church", Nazareno Padellaro, Pio XII Torino, 1956, p. 484&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church has, therefore, according to Pius XII, a common aim with Christ himself, teaching all men the truth, and offering to God a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice. This way, the Church re-establishes the unity between the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and his creatures.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1947, ''Mediator Dei'', p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifice of the altar, being Christ's own actions, conveys and dispenses divine grace from Christ to the members of the Mystical Body.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1947, ''Mediator Dei'', p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[Carlos Duarte Costa]], a long-time critic of Pius XII's policies during World War II and an opponent of [[clerical celibacy]] and the [[Sacred language|use of Latin as language of the liturgy]], was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by Pius XII on 2 July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Redmile, Robert David. 2006.

The numerous reforms of Pius XII show two characteristics: renewal and rediscovery of old liturgical traditions, such as the reintroduction of the [[Easter Vigil]], and a more structured atmosphere within the Church buildings.

===Canon Law reforms===
{{Main article|Pope Pius XII reforms of Eastern Canon Law}}
Decentralized authority and increased independence of the Uniate Churches were aimed at in the [[Canon Law]]/Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Mystici corporis]]''.

===Priests and religious===
With the [[Apostolic constitution]] ''Sedis Sapientiae'', Pius XII added [[social sciences]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]] and [[social psychology]], to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the [[psychological]] condition of candidates to the [[priesthood]] to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1956, p. 354 ff&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests. He included a "pastoral year", an introduction into the practice of parish work.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1956, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII wrote in ''[[Menti Nostrae]]'' that the call to constant interior reform and Christian [[heroism]] means to be above average, to be a living example of Christian virtue. The strict norms governing their lives are meant to make them models of Christian perfection for lay people.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1950, p. 657&lt;/ref&gt; Bishops are encouraged to look at model saints like [[Boniface]], and Pope Pius X.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954 p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; Priests were encouraged to be living examples of the love of Christ and his sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1957, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
{{Main article|Theology of Pope Pius XII}}
[[File:Statue of Pope Pius XII in Fatima Portugal.jpg|thumb|[[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]] Statue of Pope Pius XII, who consecrated Russia and the [[World]]: "Just as a few years ago We consecrated the entire human race to the Immaculate Heart of the [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Virgin Mary]], [[Mother of God]], so today We consecrate and in a most special manner We entrust all the peoples of Russia to this Immaculate Heart..."]]
Pius XII explained the Catholic faith in 41 encyclicals and almost 1000 messages and speeches during his long pontificate. [[Mediator Dei]] clarified membership and participation in the Church. The encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, [[Veneration of Mary in the Catholic Church|Mary]], the [[Mother of God]], things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Humani generis]]'' (1950) and ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'' (1943), p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological orientation===
====Biblical research====
{{Main article|Divino afflante Spiritu}}
The encyclical ''Divino afflante Spiritu'', published in 1943,&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1943, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew]]. Noting improvements in [[archaeology]], the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII's encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the [[Latin Vulgate]]. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the Church to initiate [[biblical studies]] for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in [[sermon]]s and religious instruction.&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1943, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of theology====
This theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the Church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the Church generously supports, but in matters of [[morality]] and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the Church, the [[Magisterium]]. "The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; The deposit of faith is authentically interpreted not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;''Humani generis'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mariology and the dogma of the Assumption===
[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|upright|thumb|On 1 November 1950, Pius XII defined the dogma of the Assumption ([[Titian]]'s ''Assunta'' (1516–1518) pictured).]]

====World consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary====
{{Main article|Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary}}
As a young boy and in later life, Pacelli was an ardent follower of the Virgin Mary. He was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917, the very first day of the apparitions of [[Our Lady of Fátima]]. He consecrated the world to the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in 1942. His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter's Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of Fátima, 13 October 1958.

====The dogma of the Assumption of Mary====
{{Main article|Munificentissimus Deus|Assumption of Mary}}
On 1 November 1950, Pius XII defined the dogma of the [[Assumption of Mary]], namely that she "having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory."&lt;ref&gt;AAS, 1950, p. 753&lt;/ref&gt; The dogma was preceded by the 1946 encyclical ''[[Deiparae Virginis Mariae]]'', which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. On 8 September 1953, the encyclical ''[[Fulgens corona]]'' announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1953, p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; In the encyclical [[Ad caeli reginam]] he promulgated the [[Queenship of Mary]] feast.&lt;ref&gt;AAS 1954, p. 625&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mystici corporis]]'' summarizes his [[mariology]].&lt;ref name="EMCC-110"&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Mystici corporis Christi'', p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 1954, the Feast of the Assumption, he initiated the practice of leading the [[Angelus]] every Sunday before address to the crowd assembled at [[Castel Gandolfo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | accessdate = 20 August 2017 | date = 15 August 2017 | work = La Stampa | url = http://www.lastampa.it/2015/08/15/esteri/vatican-insider/en/in-history-the-violence-of-the-arrogant-takes-its-toll-but-god-does-not-leave-us-YkQPgaLUqi8kCDQtE1nWfJ/pagina.html | title = 'In history the violence of the arrogant takes its toll, but God does not leave us' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social teachings===

====Medical theology====
Pius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Pio XII, ''Discorsi Ai Medici'' compiles 700 pages of specific addresses.&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed doctors, nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca. He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in [[terminally ill]] persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM Pope Pius XII, The Moral Limits of Medical Research and Treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821200244/http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius12/P12PSYCH.HTM |date=21 August 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family and sexuality====
Pope Pius XII developed an extensive theology of the family, taking issue with family roles, sharing of household duties, education of children, conflict resolution, financial dilemmas, psychological problems, illness, taking care of older generations, unemployment, marital holiness and virtue, common prayer, religious discussions and more. He accepted the [[calendar-based contraceptive methods|rhythm method]] as a moral form of [[family planning]], although only in limited circumstances, within the context of family.&lt;ref name="midwives"&gt;Two speeches on 29 October 1951, and 26 November 1951: ''Moral Questions Affecting Married Life'': Addresses given to the Italian Catholic Union of Midwives 29 October 1951, and 26 November 1951 to the National Congress of the Family Front and the Association of Large Families, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Washington, D.C..

====Theology and science====
To Pius XII, science and religion were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict each other over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1940, p. 407; Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1942, p. 52; Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1946, p. 89 Discorsi E Radiomessaggi di sua Santita Pio XII, Vatican City, 1951, pp. 28, 221, 413, 574&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding their relation, his advisor Professor Robert Leiber wrote: "Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of [[Galileo]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leiber, p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
{{Main article|Humani generis}}
In 1950, Pius XII promulgated ''Humani generis'' which acknowledged that [[evolution]] might accurately describe the biological origins of human life, but at the same time criticized those who "imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution&amp;nbsp;... explains the origin of all things". Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God. Since the soul is a spiritual substance it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person.&lt;ref&gt;Pius XII, Enc. ''Humani generis'', 36&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, [[Pope John Paul II]], stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. "Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|title=Finding God in human evolution|accessdate=17 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224184314/http://www.blessed-sacrament.org/evolution.doc|archivedate=24 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Capital punishment====
In an address given on September 14, 1952, Pope Pius XII said that the Church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual's right to life. In this case it is reserved to the public power to deprive the condemned person of the enjoyment of life in expiation of his crime when, by his crime, he has already disposed himself of his right to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P12PSYCH.HTM|last=His Holiness Pope Pius XII|title=The Moral Limits of Medical Research Treatment: Address to the First International Congress on the Histopathology of the Nervous System|date=14 September 1952|website=Eternal World Television Network|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Church regards criminal penalties as both "medicinal", preventing the criminal from re-offending, and "vindictive", providing retribution for the offense committed. Pius defended the authority of the State to carry out punishment, up to and including the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=6871&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Craughwell 2007; {{ISBN|1-59474-184-0}}; p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; This 19th-century painting is by [[Pasquale Sarullo]].]]
Pius XII issued 41 [[encyclical]]s during his pontificate—more than all his successors in the past 50 years taken together—along with many other writings and speeches. The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in [[vernacular]] language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in [[Latin]] in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'' since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared [[military occupation|occupation]] of the Vatican by the German [[Wehrmacht]], not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or "walled in",&lt;ref&gt;Communication, Father Robert Graham, SJ, 10 November 1992&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid detection by the advancing German army. Insisting that all publications must be reviewed by him on a prior basis to avoid any misunderstanding, several speeches by Pius XII, who did not find sufficient time, were never published or appeared only once issued in the Vatican daily, ''[[Osservatore Romano]]''.

Several encyclicals addressed the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. ''[[Orientalis Ecclesiae]]'' was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of [[Cyril of Alexandria]], a saint common to [[Eastern Christianity]] and [[Latin]] Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the Churches. ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the [[Ruthenian Church]], threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. ''[[Sempiternus Rex]]'' was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical [[Council of Chalcedon]]. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to [[Miaphysite]] theology to return to the Catholic Church. ''Orientales Ecclesias'' was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued [[Stalinist]] persecution of the Church. Several [[Apostolic Letter]]s were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in ''[[Fulgens corona]]'', as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalis Ecclesiae'', AAS, 1944, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orientales omnes Ecclesias'', AAS, 1946, pp. 33–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sempiternus Rex'', AAS, 1951, pp. 625–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Orientales Ecclesias''. AAS, 1953, pp. 5–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apostolic Letters to the bishops in the East. AAS, 1956, pp. 260–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fulgens corona'', AAS, 1953, pp. 577–93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papal letter to the People of Russia, AAS, 1952, pp. 505–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII made two substantial interventions on the media. His 1955 discourse ''[[The Ideal Movie]]'', originally given in two parts to members of the Italian cinema industry, offered a "sophisticated analysis of the film industry and the role of cinema in modern society".&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Treveri Gennari, ''Post-War Italian Cinema: American Intervention, Vatican Interests'' (New York and London: Routledge, 2009), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to his predecessor's teaching, the encyclical ''[[Miranda Prorsus]]'' (1957) shows a "high regard for the importance of cinema, television, and radio".&lt;ref&gt;Helmuth Rolfes, "Inter Mirifica and What Followed: The Second Vatican Council as the Beginning of a New Era in the Relationship Between the Church and the Media", in Helmuth Rolfes and Angela Ann Zukowski, eds., ''[[Communicatio Socialis]], Challenge of Theology and Ministry in the Church'', Festschrift for Franz-Josef Eilers (Kassel, Germany: Kassel University Press, 2007), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feasts and devotions===
In 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] as [[Shrove Tuesday]] (the Tuesday before [[Ash Wednesday]]) for all Catholics. The first medal of the Holy Face, produced by Sister [[Maria Pierina|Maria Pierina De Micheli]], based on the image on the [[Shroud of Turin]] had been offered to Pius XII who approved the medal and the devotion based on it. The general devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus had been approved by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1885 before the image on the Turin Shroud had been photographed.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Carroll Cruz (OCDS).

==Canonisations and beatifications==
{{Main article|Saints canonized by Pope Pius XII|Beatifications of Pope Pius XII}}
Pope Pius XII [[canonization|canonized]] numerous people, including Pope [[Pius X]]—"both were determined to stamp out, as far as possible, all traces of dangerous [[heterodoxy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Noel, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;—and [[Maria Goretti]]. He beatified [[Pope Innocent XI]]. The first canonizations were two women, the founder of a female order, [[Mary Euphrasia Pelletier]], and a young housekeeper said to have [[stigmata]], [[Gemma Galgani]]. Pelletier had a reputation for opening new ways for Catholic charities, helping people in difficulties with the law, who had been neglected by the system and the Church. Galgani was a woman in her twenties whose virtue became model by her canonization.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Pius XII, Ich durfte ihm dienen'', Würzburg, 1982, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II Pius saw his primary obligation as being to ensure the continuation the "[[Church visible]]" and its divine mission.&lt;ref name=oxf&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayes|first1=Peter|last2=Roth|first2=John K.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Holocaust Studies|date=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191650796|pages=363|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3hUvouXdvYC&amp;pg=PT363|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII lobbied world leaders to prevent the outbreak of World War II and then expressed his dismay that war had come in his October 1939 ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' encyclical. He followed a strict public policy of Vatican neutrality for the duration of the conflict mirroring that of [[Pope Benedict XV]] during World War I, but preached against selfish nationalism and, through the use of diplomacy, sermons and radio broadcasts and the creation of the Vatican Information Service, worked to ameliorate the suffering of the victims of the war. He permitted local churches to assess and formulate responses to the Nazis, and instructed them to provide discreet aid to Jews. However, it is important to note that the Vatican endorsed Mussolini to regain some of its lost power and for money, The Vatican also was the first to sign a treaty with Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party and help Nazis escape after the war.&lt;ref&gt;documentary Legends of the Vatican 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236597 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Pius XII turned the Vatican into a centre of aid which he organized from various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the Pope, an information office for prisoners of war and refugees operated in the Vatican under [[Giovanni Battista Montini]], which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost 10&amp;nbsp;million (9,891,497) information requests and produced over 11&amp;nbsp;million (11,293,511) answers about missing persons.&lt;ref&gt;Corrado Pallenberg, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

McGoldrick (2012) concludes that during the war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Pius XII had genuine affection for Germany, though not the criminal element into whose hands it had fallen; he feared Bolshevism, an ideology dedicated to the annihilation of the church of which he was head, but his sympathies lay with the Allies and the democracies, especially the United States, into whose war economy he had transferred and invested the Vatican's considerable assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = McGoldrick |first1 = Patricia M. |year = 2012 |title = New Perspectives on Pius XII and Vatican Financial Transactions during the Second World War |url = |journal = Historical Journal |volume = 55 |issue = 4|pages = 1029–48 |doi = 10.1017/S0018246X12000416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Outbreak of war===

====Summi Pontificatus====
''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, in October 1939 and established some of the themes of his pontificate. During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the German/Soviet invasion of Catholic Poland—the "dread tempest of war is already raging despite all Our efforts to avert it". The papal letter denounced antisemitism, war, totalitarianism, the attack on Poland and the Nazi persecution of the Church.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title="SUMMI PONTIFICATUS" – Section 106 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following themes addressed in [[Non abbiamo bisogno]] (1931); [[Mit brennender Sorge]] (1937) and [[Divini redemptoris]] (1937), Pius wrote against "anti-Christian movements" and needing to bring back to the Church those who were following "a false standard&amp;nbsp;... misled by error, passion, temptation and prejudice, [who] have strayed away from faith in the true God".&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title="SUMMI PONTIFICATUS" – Section 6 &amp; 7 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pius wrote of "Christians unfortunately more in name than in fact" having shown "cowardice" in the face of persecution by these creeds, and endorsed resistance:&lt;ref name="vatican"/&gt;

Pius wrote of a persecuted Church&lt;ref&gt;108: "In the midst of this world which today presents such a sharp contrast to "The Peace of Christ in the Reign of Christ", the Church and her faithful are in times and in years of trial such as have rarely been known in her history of struggle and suffering".&lt;/ref&gt; and a time requiring "charity" for victims who had a "right" to compassion. Against the invasion of Poland and killing of civilians he wrote:&lt;ref name="vatican.va"/&gt;

{{quote|[This is an] "Hour of Darkness"...&amp;nbsp;in which the spirit of violence and of discord brings indescribable suffering on mankind...

With Italy not yet an ally of Hitler in the war, Italians were called upon to remain faithful to the Church. Pius avoided explicit denunciations of [[Hitlerism]] or [[Stalinism]], establishing the "impartial" public tone which would become controversial in later assessment of his pontificate: "A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title="SUMMI PONTIFICATUS" – Section 28 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Invasion of Poland====
In ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'', Pius expressed dismay at the killing of non-combatants in the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland and expressed hope for the "resurrection" of that country. The Nazis and Soviets commenced a [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland|persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland]]. In April 1940, the Vatican advised the US government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box51/a464o10.html Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum – ''The Vatican Files'']; ''[[Note verbale]]'', 26 April 1940&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Phayer]], a critic of Pius XII, assesses his policy as having been to "refuse to censure" the [[Invasion of Poland|"German" invasion and annexation of Poland]]. This, Phayer wrote, was regarded as a "betrayal" by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of [[Hilarius Breitinger]] as the apostolic administrator for the [[Reichsgau Wartheland|Wartheland]] in May 1942, a "implicit recognition" of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'', mostly German Catholic minorities living in occupied Poland, were more mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer argues that Pius XII—both before and during his papacy—consistently "deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland", and saw Germany—not Poland—as critical to "rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1942, [[Kazimierz Papée]], Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Papée declared, "when something becomes notorious, proof is not required".&lt;ref&gt;Report by the Polish Ambassador to the Holy See on the Situation in German-occupied Poland, Memorandum No. 79, 29 May 1942, Myron Taylor's papers, NARA.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that [[Cardinal Hlond]] had banned German liturgical services in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a well-known case of Jewish Rabbis who, seeking support against the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews in the [[General Government]] (Nazi-occupied Polish zone), complained to the representatives of the Catholic Church. The Church's attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II|Nazi atrocities committed in Poland]] by both officials of the Polish Church and the [[Polish Underground]]. Those intelligence materials were used by Pius XII on March 11, 1940 during a formal audience with [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (Hitler's foreign affairs adviser) when Pope was "listing the date, place, and precise details of each crime" as described by [[Joseph L. Lichten]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/piusdef2.html |title=The Vatican &amp; the Holocaust: A Question of Judgment – Pius XII &amp; the Jews by Dr. Joseph L. Lichten|publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after others.

====Early actions to end conflict====
With Poland overrun, but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Pius continued to hope for a negotiated peace to prevent the spread of the conflict. The similarly minded US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a seventy-year hiatus and dispatched [[Myron C. Taylor]] as his personal representative.&lt;ref name="docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/VATICAN1.HTML |title=Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum – "The Vatican Files" |publisher=Docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pius warmly welcomed Roosevelt's envoy and peace initiative, calling it "an exemplary act of fraternal and hearty solidarity... in defence against the chilling breath of aggressive and deadly godless anti-Christian tendencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box51/a464g02.html |title=Franklin D.

Pius warned the Allies of the planned German invasion of the Low Countries in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236596 Encyclopædia Britannica Online] – ''Reflections on the Holocaust''; web April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In Rome in 1942, US envoy Myron C.

When Mussolini learned of the warnings and the telegrams of sympathy, he took them as a personal affront and had his ambassador to the Vatican file an official protest, charging that Pius XII had taken sides against Italy's ally Germany. Mussolini's foreign minister claimed that Pius XII was "ready to let himself be deported to a concentration camp, rather than do anything against his conscience".&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, David G.

When in 1940, the Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop led the only senior Nazi delegation permitted an audience with Pius XII and asked why the Pope had sided with the Allies, Pius replied with a list of recent Nazi atrocities and religious persecutions committed against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, leading the New York Times to headline its report "Jews Rights Defended" and write of "burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hume |first=Brit |url=http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027155520/http://www.spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/print |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 October 2008 |title=Hitler's Pope? |publisher= The American Spectator|date=18 August 2006 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, Ribbentrop suggested an overall settlement between the Vatican and the Reich government in exchange for Pius XII instructing the German bishops to refrain from political criticism of the German government, but no agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Prof. John S., "The Meeting between Pope Pius XII and Ribbentrop", ''CCHA Study Sessions'', volume 35 (1968), pp. 103–16 [http://www.umanitoba.ca/colleges/st_pauls/ccha/Back%20Issues/CCHA1968/Conway.html archives from papers stored at the University of Manitoba]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernardinonogara.jpg|thumb|upright|The investments of [[Bernardino Nogara]] were critical to the financing of the papacy during World War II.]]

At a special mass at St Peters for the victims of the war, held in November 1940, soon after the commencement of the [[London Blitz]] bombing by the [[Luftwaffe]], Pius preached in his homily: "may the whirlwinds, that in the light of day or the dark of night, scatter terror, fire, destruction, and slaughter on helpless folk cease. May justice and charity on one side and on the other be in perfect balance, so that all injustice be repaired, the reign of right restored".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/PSF/BOX52/a467t01.html |title=Harold Taylor 9/30/42 |publisher=Docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu |date=27 May 2004 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later he appealed to the Allies to spare Rome from aerial bombing, and visited wounded victims of the Allied bombing of 19 July 1943.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

====Widening conflict====
Unsuccessfully, Pius attempted to dissuade the Italian Dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] from joining Hitler in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236596 Encyclopædia Britannica Online – ''Reflections on the Holocaust'']; web April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1941, Pius XII granted a private audience to [[Ante Pavelić]], the leader of the [[Independent State of Croatia|newly proclaimed Croatian state]] (rather than the diplomatic audience Pavelić had wanted).&lt;ref&gt;Minutes of 7 August 1941. British Public Records Office FO 371/30175 57760&lt;/ref&gt; Pius was criticised for his reception of Pavelić: an unattributed British [[Foreign Office]] memo on the subject described Pius as "the greatest moral coward of our age".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Aarons and John Loftus. ''Unholy Trinity'' pp. 71–72&lt;!-- ISBN missing --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican did not officially recognise Pavelić's regime. Pius XII did not publicly condemn the expulsions and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated on Serbs by Pavelić;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Gutman (ed.) ''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'' vol 2, p. 739&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Holy See did expressly repudiate the forced conversions in a memorandum dated 25 January 1942, from the Vatican Secretariat of State to the Yugoslavian Legation.&lt;ref&gt;Rychlak, Ronald. ''Hitler, the War, and the Pope'' pp. 414–15, note 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The pope was well-informed of [[Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše]] regime, even possessing a list of clergymembers who had "joined in the slaughter", but decided against condemning the regime or taking action against the clergy involved, fearing that it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 9–16&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII elevated [[Aloysius Stepinac]]—a Croatian archbishop convicted of collaborating with the [[Ustaše]] by the newly established Yugoslav Communist regime—to the cardinalate.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. 10–15, 147, 150&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer agrees that Stepinac's was a "show trial", but states "the charge that he [Pius XII] supported the Ustaša regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew",&lt;ref name="phayerpav"&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; and that "if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican's support of the [[genocide|genocidal]] Pavelić."&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 1942, the [[Yugoslav government in exile]] sent letters of protest to Pius XII requesting him to use all possible means to stop the massacres against the [[Persecution of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|Serbs]] in the [[NDH]], however Pius XII did nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Paris| first=Edmond| year=1961| pp=220| title=Genocide in Satellite Croatia 1941-1945|publisher=King's|isbn=1258163462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1941, Pius XII interpreted ''[[Divini Redemptoris]]'', an [[encyclical]] of Pope Pius XI, which forbade Catholics to help communists, as not applying to military assistance to the [[Soviet Union]]. This interpretation assuaged American Catholics who had previously opposed [[Lend-Lease]] arrangements with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ball Martinez. 1993, "Pope Pius XII and the Second World War". ''Journal of Historical Review''. pp. v, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1942, Pius XII established diplomatic relations with the [[Japanese Empire]] and received ambassador [[Ken Harada (diplomat)|Ken Harada]], who remained in that position until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777719,00.html|title=Religion: Rising Sun at the Vatican|publisher=Time Magazine|date=6 April 1942|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0E15FE3D5E167B93C5AB1788D85F468485F9|title=Envoy to Vatican named; Tokyo Reports Choice of Harada Under De Facto Relations|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=17 December 2011|date=27 March 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1942, diplomatic relations were established with the [[Nationalist government]] of China. This step was envisaged earlier, but delayed due to Japanese pressure to establish relations with the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei government. The first [[Embassy of the Republic of China to the Holy See|Chinese Minister to the Vatican]], Hsieh Shou-kang, was only able to arrive at the Vatican in January 1943, due to difficulties of travel resulting from the war. He remained in that position until late 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsstudyc.org.hk/en/tripod_en/en_tripod_153_06.html|authors=Chen Fang-Chung, Lou Tseng-Tsiang|title=A Lover of His Church and of His Country|publisher=Hsstudyc.org.hk|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope employed the new technology of [[radio]] and a series of Christmas messages to preach against selfish nationalism and the evils of modern warfare and offer sympathy to the victims of the war.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address]] via [[Vatican Radio]] voiced concern at [[human rights abuses]] and the murder of innocents based on race. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society; at the very end of the speech, Pius XII mentioned "the hundreds of thousands of persons who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rittner, the speech remains a "lightning rod" in debates about Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;Rittner and Roth, 2002, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis themselves responded to the speech by stating that it was "one long attack on everything we stand for.&amp;nbsp;... He is clearly speaking on behalf of the Jews.&amp;nbsp;... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews, and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals." The New York Times wrote that "The voice of Pius XII is a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas.&amp;nbsp;... In calling for a 'real new order' based on 'liberty, justice and love',&amp;nbsp;... the pope put himself squarely against Hitlerism."&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, David G. "[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/504iizii.asp?page=3 Pius XII and the Jews: A defense]", Weekly Standard, Vol. 6, No. 23, 16 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Michael Phayer claims, however, that "it is still not clear ''whose'' genocide or ''which'' genocide he was referring to".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius's death in 2008, the German Pope [[Benedict XVI]] recalled that the Pope's voice had been "broken by emotion" as he "deplored the situation" with a "clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2008/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20081009_50-pio-xii_en.html Vatican Archive – Homily by Pope Benedict XVI]; 9 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have [[Alleged plot to kidnap Pope Pius XII|alleged a plot to kidnap Pius XII]] by the Nazis during their occupation of Rome in 1943 (Vatican City itself was not occupied); British historian [[Owen Chadwick]] and the Jesuit [[Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale|ADSS]] editor [[Robert A.

Robert Graham]] each concluded such claims were an invention of [[Political Warfare Executive|British wartime propagandists]].&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, 1988, pp. 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez and Graham, 1997, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2007, subsequent to those accounts, Dan Kurzman published a work which he maintains establishes that the plot was a fact.&lt;ref name="kix"&gt;Kurzman, 2007, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

====Final stages====
As the war was approaching its end in 1945, Pius advocated a lenient policy by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders in an effort to prevent what he perceived to be the mistakes made at the end of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, 2002, pp. 87–100.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1944, he met British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who was visiting Rome. At their meeting, the Pope acknowledged the justice of punishing war criminals, but expressed a hope that the people of Italy would not be punished, preferring that they be made "full allies" in the remaining war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/nuremberg/documents/index.php?documentdate=29%20August%201944&amp;documentid=C107-10-54&amp;studycollectionid=&amp;pagenumber=1|title=News Release, 28 August 1944|publisher=Trumanlibrary.org|date=29 August 1944|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, after Nazi Germany commenced its mass executions of Jews in occupied Soviet territory, Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid victims of the Holocaust and directed the Church to provide discreet aid to Jews.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; Upon his death in 1958, among many Jewish tributes, the Chief Rabbi of Rome [[Elio Toaff]], said: "Jews will always remember what the Catholic Church did for them by order of the Pope during the Second World War. When the war was raging, Pius spoke out very often to condemn the false race theory."&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea; ''A Cross Too Heavy''; Rosenberg Publishing; 2008; p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; This is disputed by commentator John Cornwell, who in his book, ''[[Hitler's Pope]]'', argues that the pope was weak and vacillating in his approach to Nazism. Cornwell asserts that the pope did little to challenge the progressing holocaust of the Jews out of fear of provoking the Nazis into invading Vatican City.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cornwell (writer)|Cornwell, John]], ''[[Hitler's Pope]]'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1939 ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' first papal encyclical, Pius reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and antisemitism and affirmed the ethical principles of the "[[Ten Commandments|Revelation on Sinai]]". At Christmas 1942, once evidence of mass executions of Jews had emerged, Pius XII [[Pope Pius XII's 1942 Christmas address|voiced concern]] at the murder of "hundreds of thousands" of "faultless" people because of their "nationality or race" and intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. Upon his death in 1958, Pius was praised emphatically by the Israeli Foreign Minister, and other world leaders. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonored his policy of Vatican neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': "Roman Catholicism&amp;nbsp;– the period of the world wars."&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler biographer John Toland, while scathing of Pius's cautious public comments in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, concluded that the Allies' own record of action against the Holocaust was "shameful", while "The Church, under the Pope's guidance, had already saved the lives of more Jews than all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined".&lt;ref name="John Toland p.760"/&gt;

In 1939, the newly elected Pope Pius XII appointed several prominent Jewish scholars to posts at the Vatican after they had been dismissed from Italian universities under [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]]'s racial laws.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, the Pope employed a Jewish cartographer, Roberto Almagia, to work on old maps in the Vatican library. Almagia had been at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] since 1915 but was dismissed after [[Benito Mussolini]]'s antisemitic legislation of 1938. The Pope's appointment of two Jews to the Vatican Academy of Science as well as the hiring of Almagia were reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in the editions of 11 November 1939 and 10 January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, 2001, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius later engineered an agreement—formally approved on 23 June 1939—with Brazilian [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Getúlio Vargas]] to issue 3,000 [[visa (document)|visas]] to "non-[[Aryan]] Catholics". However, over the next 18 months Brazil's Conselho de Imigração e Colonização (CIC) continued to tighten the restrictions on their issuance, including requiring a [[baptism|baptismal certificate]] dated before 1933, a substantial monetary transfer to the [[Banco do Brasil]], and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin. The program was cancelled 14 months later, after fewer than 1,000 visas had been issued, amid suspicions of "improper conduct" (i.e., continuing to practice Judaism) among those who had received visas.&lt;ref name="gutman1136"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesser, Jeffrey. 1995. ''Welcoming the Undesirables: Brazil and the Jewish Question''. University of California Press. pp. 151–68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1939, after the submission of [[Charles Maurras]] and the intervention of the Carmel of [[Lisieux]], Pius XII ended his predecessor's ban on [[Action Française]], a virulently [[antisemitic]] organization.&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer, Saul. ''Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution'', 1997, New York: HarperCollins, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McInerny-p49"&gt;McInerney, 2001, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the German/Soviet invasion of Poland, the Pope's first encyclical, ''Summi Pontificatus'' reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and rejected antisemitism, quoting scripture singling out the "principle of equality"—with specific reference to Jews: "there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision" and direct affirmation of the Jewish ''Revelation on Sinai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title=Pius XII, "Summi Pontificatus"; 7 &amp; 48; October 1939 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The forgetting of solidarity "imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men" was called "pernicious error".&lt;ref name="Pius XII"/&gt; Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer "compassion and help" to the victims of the war.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title=Pius XII, "Summi Pontificatus"; 111; October 1939 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.&lt;ref name="Pius XII 1939"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pius XII |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |title=Pius XII, "Summi Pontificatus"; 106; October 1939 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=11 December 1925 |accessdate=23 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015921/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_20101939_summi-pontificatus_en.html |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cardinal Secretary of State]] Luigi Maglione received a request from [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog|Isaac Herzog]] in the spring of 1940 to intercede on behalf of [[Lithuania]]n Jews about to be deported to Germany.&lt;ref name="gutman1136"/&gt; Pius called [[Joachim von Ribbentrop|Ribbentrop]] on 11 March, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name="McInerny-p49"/&gt; In 1940, Pius asked members of the clergy, on Vatican letterhead, to do whatever they could on behalf of interned Jews.&lt;ref name="us081117"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewers, Justin|title=Sainthood on Hold|publisher=U.S. News and World Report|date=17–24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1941, Cardinal [[Theodor Innitzer]] of [[Vienna]] informed Pius of Jewish deportations in Vienna.&lt;ref name="gutman1137"&gt;Gutman, 1990, p. 1137&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, when asked by French Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] if the Vatican objected to antisemitic laws, Pius responded that the church condemned antisemitism, but would not comment on specific rules.&lt;ref name="gutman1137"/&gt; Similarly, when [[Philippe Pétain]]'s regime adopted the "Jewish statutes", the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] ambassador to the Vatican, [[Léon Bérard]] (a French politician), was told that the legislation did not conflict with Catholic teachings.&lt;ref name="Perl-p200"&gt;Perl, William, The Holocaust Conspiracy, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerio Valeri]], the [[nuncio]] to France was "embarrassed" when he learned of this publicly from Pétain&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2000, p. 5"&gt;Phayer, 2000, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; and personally checked the information with Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Marrus and Robert O. Paxton, 1981, ''Vichy France and the Jews'', New York: Basic Books, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; who confirmed the Vatican's position.&lt;ref&gt;Delpech, ''Les Eglises et la Persécution raciale'', p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1942, Pius XII personally protested against the mass deportations of Jews from France, ordering the papal nuncio to protest to Pétain against "the inhuman arrests and deportations of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1941, Pius XII objected to a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] Jewish Code,&lt;ref&gt;John F. Morley, 1980, ''Vatican Diplomacy and the Jews during the Holocaust, 1939–1943'', New York: KTAV, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; which, unlike the earlier Vichy codes, prohibited intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews.&lt;ref name="Phayer, 2000, p. 5"/&gt; In October 1941, Harold Tittmann, a US delegate to the Vatican, asked the pope to condemn the atrocities against Jews; Pius replied that the Vatican wished to remain "neutral,"&lt;ref&gt;Perl, William, The Holocaust Conspiracy, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating the neutrality policy which Pius invoked as early as September 1940.&lt;ref name="Perl-p200"/&gt;

In 1942, the Slovak [[chargé d'affaires]] told Pius that [[Slovaks|Slovak]] Jews were being sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref name="gutman1137"/&gt; On 11 March 1942, several days before the first transport was due to leave, the chargé d'affaires in [[Bratislava]] reported to the Vatican: "I have been assured that this atrocious plan is the handwork of ... Prime Minister ([[Vojtech Tuka|Tuka]]), who confirmed the plan ... he dared to tell me—he who makes such a show of his Catholicism—that he saw nothing inhuman or un-Christian in it ... the deportation of 80,000 persons to Poland, is equivalent to condemning a great number of them to certain death." The Vatican protested to the Slovak government that it "deplore(s) these... measures which gravely hurt the natural human rights of persons, merely because of their race."&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, 1980, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 1942, Pius XII received a letter from Monsignor Montini (future [[Pope Paul VI]]), saying, "the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms."&lt;ref name="gutman1137"/&gt; Later that month, [[Myron Taylor]], U.S. representative to the Vatican, warned Pius that the Vatican's "moral prestige" was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, [[Uruguay]], Belgium, and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, pp. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the [[Nazi Empire]] were being systematically "butchered". Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information which might "tend to confirm the reports", and if so, what the Pope might be able to do to influence public opinion against the "barbarities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/PSF/BOX52/a467aq01.html Diplomatic Correspondence: US Envoy Myron C. Taylor to Cardinal Maglione]; 26 September 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to "verify their accuracy". Nevertheless, "every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/PSF/BOX52/a467ar01.html Diplomatic Correspondence: US Undersecretary of State Summner Wells to Vatican Envoy Myron C. Taylor]; 21 October 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration "German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race", Maglione replied that the Vatican was "unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities".&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg, Raul, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'', (2003) 3rd edition, pp. 1204–05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland, Pius XII's ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'' called for the sympathy of the whole world towards Poland, where "the blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants" was being spilled.&lt;ref name="Pius XII 1939"/&gt; Pius never publicly condemned the Nazi massacre of 1,800,000–1,900,000 Poles, overwhelmingly Catholic (including 2,935 members of the Catholic clergy),&lt;ref&gt;United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, [http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005473 Polish Victims].

Retrieved 17 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1942, Pius XII advised German and Hungarian bishops to speak out against the massacres on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1942 Christmas Eve message, he expressed concern for "those hundreds of thousands, who ... sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race, are marked down for death or progressive extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1943, Msgr. Tardini, one of Pius XII's closest advisors, advised Pius XII that it would be politically advantageous after the war to take steps to help Slovak Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre mondiale/éd. par Pierre Blet, Angelo Martini, Burkhart Schneider and Robert Graham (7 April 1943).&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1943, Pius XII declined to denounce publicly the Nazi discrimination against the Jews, following requests to do so from [[Władysław Raczkiewicz]], president of the Polish [[government-in-exile]], and Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; According to Toland, in June 1943, Pius XII addressed the issue of mistreatment of Jews at a conference of the [[Sacred College of Cardinals]] and said: "Every word We address to the competent authority on this subject, and all Our public utterances have to be carefully weighed and measured by Us in the interests of the victims themselves, lest, contrary to Our intentions, We make their situation worse and harder to bear".&lt;ref name="John Toland p.760"/&gt;

On 26 September 1943, following the German occupation of northern Italy, Nazi officials gave Jewish leaders in Rome 36 hours to produce {{convert|50|kg|0|abbr=out}} of gold (or the equivalent) threatening to take 300 hostages. Then Chief Rabbi of Rome [[Israel Zolli]] recounts in his memoir that he was selected to go to the Vatican and seek help.&lt;ref&gt;Zolli, Eugenio. ''Before the Dawn''. Reissued in 1997 as ''Why I Became a Catholic''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican offered to loan 15 kilos, but the offer proved unnecessary when the Jews received an extension.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Pocket Library, Holocaust, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, when deportations from Italy were imminent, 477 Jews were hidden in the Vatican itself and another 4,238 were protected in Roman monasteries and convents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/vat_hol12.htm|title=The role of the Roman Catholic Church in the Shoah (Nazi Holocaust)|publisher=Religioustolerance.org|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty percent of Roman Jews were saved from deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 82–85&lt;/ref&gt; Phayer argues that the German diplomats in Rome were the "initiators of the effort to save the city's Jews", but holds that Pius XII "cooperated in this attempt at rescue", while agreeing with Zuccotti that the pope "did not give orders" for any Catholic institution to hide Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 1943, Pius XII wrote to Bishop [[Konrad von Preysing|Graf von Preysing]] of Berlin to say: "We give to the pastors who are working on the local level the duty of determining if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations&amp;nbsp;... ''ad maiora mala vitanda'' (to avoid worse)&amp;nbsp;... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of the reasons, why We impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see.&amp;nbsp;... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants."&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Pius XII of 30 April 1943 to the Bischop of Berlin, Graf von Preysing, published in "Documentation catholique" of 2 February 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 1943, [[Ernst von Weizsäcker]], the German Ambassador to the Vatican, telegraphed Berlin that "the Pope has not yet let himself be persuaded to make an official condemnation of the deportation of the Roman Jews.&amp;nbsp;... Since it is currently thought that the Germans will take no further steps against the Jews in Rome, the question of our relations with the Vatican may be considered closed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Not Enough vs. Plenty: Which did Pius XII do?|last = Lang|first = Berel|date = Fall 2001|journal = Judaism|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = |volume = 50|issue = 4|page = 448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/piusdef.html |title=860,000 Lives Saved—The Truth About Pius XII and the Jews |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1944, through the papal nuncio in [[Budapest]], Angelo Rotta, the pope urged the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] government to moderate its treatment of the Jews.&lt;ref name="gutman1138"&gt;Gutman, Israel, Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, p. 1138&lt;/ref&gt; The pope ordered Rotta and other papal legates to hide and shelter Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, pp. 87–89&lt;/ref&gt; These protests, along with others from the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, and Britain led to the cessation of deportations on 8 July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Martin, ''The Holocaust'', p. 701&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept "emergency passports", although it also took the intervention of the U.S. State Department for those countries to honor the documents.&lt;ref&gt;Perl, William, The Holocaust Conspiracy, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner|Kaltenbrunner]] Report to Hitler, dated 29 November 1944, against the backdrop of the [[20 July plot|20 July 1944 Plot to assassinate Hitler]], states that the Pope was somehow a conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), as being a party in the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=95893&amp;cat=15 ''Pave the Way Foundation Reveals Evidence of Pope Pius XII's Active Opposition to Hitler''] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5jbLZ3NgN?url=http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=95893&amp;cat=15 |date=7 September 2009 }}, 24 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish orphans controversy====
{{Main article|Jewish orphans controversy}}
In 2005, ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in war-time France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision "has been approved by the Holy Father". Nuncio [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] (who became Pope John XXIII, and was recognized by [[Yad Vashem]] as [[Righteous Among the Nations]]) ignored this directive.&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Report, (7 February 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abe Foxman]], the national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had undergone a custody battle afterwards, called for an immediate freeze on Pius's beatification process until the relevant [[Vatican Secret Archives]] and baptismal records were opened.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League. [http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/adl_vatican.asp "ADL to Vatican: 'Open Baptismal Records and Put Pius Beatification on Hold{{'"}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104082209/http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/adl_vatican.asp |date=4 January 2009 }}. 13 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine although the reporting by the ''Corriere della Sera'' was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives who were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli, Dimitri.

==Post-World War II==

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F007416-0008, Bahnhof Bonn, Verabschiedung Apostolischer Nuntius.jpg|thumb|right|Bishop [[Aloisius Joseph Muench]], Pius XII's post-war liaison to the [[Office of Military Government, United States]]]]
After World War II, Pope Pius XII focused on material aid to war-torn Europe, an internal internationalization of the Catholic Church, and the development of its worldwide diplomatic relations. His encyclicals, ''[[Evangelii praecones]]'' and ''[[Fidei donum]]'', issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture.&lt;ref&gt;Audience for the directors of mission activities in 1944 A.A.S., 1944, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Evangelii praecones]]''. p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Though his language retained old conceptions&amp;nbsp;– Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked 'to forward her work among the heathen multitudes' – in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the 'non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence.' &lt;ref&gt;Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.282-283&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the line of his predecessors, Pius XII supported the establishment of local administration in Church affairs: in 1950, the hierarchy of Western Africa became independent; in 1951, Southern Africa; and in 1953, [[British East Africa]]. Finland, [[Burma]] and [[French Africa]] became independent dioceses in 1955.

In the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|elevated a number]] of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops [[Joseph Frings]] of Cologne, [[August von Galen]] of Münster and [[Konrad von Preysing]] of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated [[Greater Germanic Reich|Nazi Empire]] Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop [[Johannes de Jong]]; Hungarian Bishop [[József Mindszenty]]; Polish Archbishop [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]]; and French Archbishop [[Jules-Géraud Saliège]]. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin|Thomas Tien]] of China and [[Valerian Gracias]] of India&amp;nbsp;– the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the [[College of Cardinals]].&lt;ref&gt;Ventresca, p.284&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Papal diplomat [[Angelo Roncalli]] (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop [[Stefan Wyszyński]] were others among those [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1953|elevated in 1953]].

A German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period&amp;nbsp;– the German Jesuits [[Robert Leiber]], Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop [[Aloisius Muench]] wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was 'more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church' and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority – 'its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany's uncertain political future.'&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.240&lt;/ref&gt;

He was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy's [[Catholic Action]] movement, was called to the Vatican as the campaign for the first parliament of Italy's post-fascist republic was underway.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.242&lt;/ref&gt; The Communists and Socialists seemed headed for victory and Pius XII wanted Catholic Action, an organization of Catholic laity, to mobilise the Catholic vote against parties of the Left. In July 1949 he approved a controversial move by the Holy Office to threaten with [[excommunication]] anyone with known Communist affiliations. A group of Jesuits around the journal ''[[La Civilta Cattolica]]'', active in Vatican circles, further spread alarm that ''fifth columns'' of Soviet Communism were active in Western Europe poised to exploit popular discontent to aid Soviet expansionism. He was responsible for giving the appellative title, The Catholic University of the Philippines to the then [[Pontifical]] and Royal [[University of Santo Tomas]].

Pius XII was rather distrustful of [[Alcide de Gasperi]] and [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Italy's Christian Democrats]], considering the party indecisive and fractious&amp;nbsp;– reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left&amp;nbsp;– represented by the Sicilian priest [[Luigi Sturzo]] for example&amp;nbsp;– he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance&amp;nbsp;– an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the [[Italian Social Movement]]. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if "the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ventresca, Soldier of Christ, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; de Gasperi rejected the idea as politically dangerous to the long term fortunes of a centrist Catholic party.

==Later life, illness and death==
===Late years of Pope Pius XII===
{{Main article|Late years of Pope Pius XII}}
The last years of the [[pontificate]] of Pius XII began in late 1954 with a long illness, during which he considered [[abdication]]. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Pius underwent three courses of [[Rejuvenation (aging)|cellular rejuvenation]] treatment administered by [[Paul Niehans]], the most important in 1954 when Pacelli was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. "These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli's blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments."&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Noel, ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as [[Julius Döpfner]] (35 years) and Karol Wojtyla (later [[Pope John Paul II]], 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as "[[worker-priest]]s", who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of [[Thomism]] as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] or [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Humani generis]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
[[File:Tumulo pio xii.jpg|thumb|''The Pope of Mary'': A [[Madonna and Child]], added by John Paul II in 1982, hangs over the tomb of Pius XII.]]
Pope Pius XII had been seriously ill with gastritis intermittently since 1953, when he had offered to resign the papacy. He also underwent cellular rejuvenation treatment, whose side-effects caused hallucinations and nightmares. With frequent absences from work, he had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide [[Domenico Tardini]], his speechwriter [[Robert Leiber]], and his long-serving housekeeper [[Pascalina Lehnert]]. Pope Pius XII still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions, which were addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of Church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. [[Augustin Bea|Cardinal Augustine Bea SJ]] was his personal confessor. [[Pascalina Lehnert|Sister Pasqualina]] was for forty years his "housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion".&lt;ref&gt;Noel, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 1958, at his summer residence [[Castel Gandolfo]], the Pope suffered painful complications, but tried to continue his duties between intervals of rest. Next morning, the doctors came to pump his stomach, apparently with success, but he lost consciousness and was given the last rites. Presently he awoke, and the nuns opened the door to the Papal Chapel so he could see and hear them praying the rosary. The next day, he appeared to improve and received visitors. When they opened the window in the evening, he looked out at the stars and said quietly "Look, how beautiful, how great is our Lord.” On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3.52 a.m. on 9 October, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute [[heart failure]]. Monsignor Domenico Tardini prayed the ''Magnificat Anima mea dominum'', the Virgin Mary's praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: "The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself."&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

===Botched embalming===
Pius XII's physician, [[Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi]], reported that the pontiff's body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Oreste Nuzzi.&lt;ref name=ModernMummies&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Mummies|first=Christine|last=Quigley|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZOqU-9BTZO4C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;lpg=PA204&amp;dq=Galeazzi-Lisi+%22Pius+XII%22+embalming|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|isbn=978-0-7864-0492-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead that it be kept in the same condition "in which God created it".&lt;ref name="AP 11Oct58"/&gt; According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Nuzzi, an embalmer from [[Naples]], used an atypical approach with the embalming procedure.&lt;ref name="AP 11Oct58"/&gt; In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming of the body of the late pontiff. He claimed to have used the same system of oils and resins with which the body of Jesus Christ was preserved.&lt;ref name="AP 11Oct58"&gt;"Pope's Body Embalmed with Special Process", ''[[Associated Press]]'' (AP), Rome, 11 October 1958&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2017}}

Galeazzi-Lisi asserted that the new process would "preserve the body indefinitely in its natural state".&lt;ref name=ModernMummies/&gt; However, whatever chance the new embalming process had of efficaciously preserving the body was obliterated by intense heat in Castel Gandolfo during the embalming process. As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Galeazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation.&lt;ref name="AP 11Oct58"/&gt; Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII's body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.&lt;ref name=ModernMummies/&gt;

===Funeral===
His funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned "their" pope, who was born in their own city, especially as a hero in the time of war.&lt;ref&gt;Lehnert, Pascalina. ''Ich durfte ihm dienen'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later to be [[Pope John XXIII]]) wrote in his diary on 11 October 1958 that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of the late Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Hebblethwaite|Hebblethwaite, Peter]]. ''John XXIII, Pope of the Council'' (revised edition), Harper Collins: Glasgow. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The late pope lay in state on a bier surrounded by four Swiss Guards, and was then placed in the coffin for burial. Pius XII was buried in the grottos beneath St. Peter's Basilica in a simple tomb in a small chapel.

==Cause for canonisation==
{{Main article|Canonization of Pope Pius XII}}
The [[Testament of Pope Pius XII]] was published immediately after his death. Pope Pius XII's [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints|cause of canonization]] was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the [[Second Vatican Council]]. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared [[Venerable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20070612181832/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702592.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 June 2007|title=CNS STORY: Sainthood congregation recommends Pope Pius XII be named venerable|publisher=Catholicnews.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Benedict XVI]] did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref name="Pitel"/&gt;

For Venerable status The Congregation for the Causes of Saints certifies the "heroic virtues" of the candidate. Making Pius XII Venerable met with various responses, most centred on the papal words and actions during World War II. Benedict's signature on the Decree of Heroic Virtue was regarded by some as a public relations blunder, though acceptance of Pius XII as a saviour of Europe's Jews is regarded as 'proof of fidelity to the Church, the ''pope'' and the Tradition' by neoconservative Catholic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea, A Cross too Heavy, Palgrave Macmillan, 2011, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Rabbi [[Marvin Hier]], founder and dean at the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] said, "...there would be a great distortion of history" if Pius XII were canonized.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;AFP. 22 December 2009. "[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkzlifIdlOmb9wKRtm48d4OADI4g Wiesenthal Center shocked at pope Pius sainthood moves] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122135058/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hkzlifIdlOmb9wKRtm48d4OADI4g |date=22 November 2011 }}".&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence, the head of [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Sydney's Great Synagogue]], said: "How can one venerate a man who ... seemed to give his passive permission to the Nazis as the Jews were prised from his doorstep in Rome?"&lt;ref name="maley"&gt;Jacqueline Maley. 24 December 2009. "[http://www.smh.com.au/national/rabbi-hits-out-at-popes-veneration-of-pius-xii-20091222-lbsy.html Rabbi hits out at Pope's Veneration of Pius XII]". ''Sydney Morning Herald''.&lt;/ref&gt; A counterpoint to such comments is the case of [[Israel Zolli]], the Chief Rabbi in Rome from 1939 to 1945, who became a Catholic and took the name of Eugenio in honor of Pius XII.

Father [[Peter Gumpel]], the relator of the Pius XII's cause for canonization, claims that there are already several miracles attributable to Pius XII, including "one quite extraordinary one".

On 1 August 2013, an anonymous "source who works for the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]]" said [[Pope Francis]] is considering canonization without a miracle, "us[ing] the formula of ''scientia certa''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Gagliarducci|first = Andrea|title = St. Pius XII?

Pope Francis also announced his intention in January 2014 to open the [[Vatican Secret Archives]] to scholars so that an evaluation of the late pontiff's role in the war can be determined before canonization. This has been met with praise by the Jewish community. However, it was said that it could take up to a year to gather all the documents and then analyze them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Ben-zvi|first = Gidon|title = Pope May Open Holocaust Era Vatican Archives, Possibly Shedding Light On Pope Pius XII's Role|url = http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/01/19/pope-may-open-holocaust-era-vatican-archives-possibly-shedding-light-on-pope-pius-xii%e2%80%99s-role/|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = |first = |title = Report: Pope Francis to examine Pius' wartime record before deciding on sainthood|url = http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/Report-Pope-Francis-to-examine-Pius-wartime-conduct-before-deciding-on-sainthood-338649|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = |first = |title = Report: Pope Secret Vatican archives on Pius not ready to be opened|url = http://www.jta.org/2014/01/20/news-opinion/world/report-secret-vatican-archives-on-pius-pontificate-not-ready-to-be-opened|accessdate = 22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 May 2014 on his way back from the [[Holy Land]] to [[Vatican City]], Pope Francis stated that the late pope would not be beatified because the cause has stalled. The pope said that he checked the progress of the cause for the controversial pope and said that there were no miracles attributed to his intercession, which was the main reason that the cause had halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = |first = |title = Pope Francis: 'Pius XII's Cause for beatification has stalled'|url = http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2014/05/27/pope-francis-pius-xiis-beatification-has-stalled/|date= 27 May 2014|accessdate = 28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Peter Gumpel stated, on a 12 January 2016 documentary on the late pope, that there was consultation of the Vatican Secret Archives which were carried out in secret; in short it means that there are no controversies surrounding the late pontiff that could impede the potential beatification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papapioxii.it/dalla-teche-rai-un-pio-xii-inatteso/|title=Dalla Teche Rai un Pio XII inatteso|publisher=Papa Pio XII|date=8 January 2016|accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that same documentary, the cause's vice-postulator Marc Lindeijer stated that several miracles attributed to the late pope are reported to the postulation every year but the individuals' related to the healings do not come forward to enact diocesan proceedings of investigation. Lindeijer explained that this was the reason that the cause has stalled in the past as none have come forward to assist the postulation in their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papapioxii.it/pio-xii-come-papa-francesco-amava-incontrare-la-gente/|title=Pio XII come Papa Francesco amava incontrare la gente|date=13 January 2016|publisher=Papa Pio XII|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential miracle===
Reports from 2014 indicate a potential miracle from the [[United States]] attributed to the intercession of the late pope that was reported to the postulation. The miracle pertains to a male plagued with severe influenza and pneumonia that could have proven to be fatal; the individual was said to have been healed in full after a novena to Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.romancatholicman.com/amazing-miracle-story-for-pope-pius-xii-canonization/#.VUvCoWeT6dd.mailto|title=Amazing Miracle Story for Pope Pius XII Canonization?|publisher=Roman Catholic Man|date=5 May 2015|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papapioxii.it/questa-malattia-non-e-per-la-morte/|title=Questa malattia non è per la morte|publisher=Papa Pio XII|date=|accessdate=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views, interpretations and scholarship==

===Contemporary===
{{POV section|date=April 2015}}
During the war, ''Time'' magazine credited Pius XII and the Catholic Church for "fighting [[totalitarianism]] more knowingly, devoutly and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organised power".&lt;ref&gt;Time. 16 August 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; During the war he was also praised editorially by ''[[The New York Times]]'' for opposing Nazi anti-Semitism and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/pius.php?id=21|title=New York Times 25 December 1941 and 25 December 1942|publisher=Catholicleague.org|accessdate=12 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731121713/http://www.catholicleague.org/pius.php?id=21 &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Paul O'Shea, "The Nazis demonised the Pope as the agent of international Jewry; the Americans and British were continually frustrated because he would not condemn Nazi aggression; and the Russians accused him of being an agent of Fascism and the Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea; ''A Cross Too Heavy''; Rosenberg Publishing; 2008; pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1945, the general secretary of the World Jewish Council, Leon Kubowitzky, presented an amount of money to the pope, "in recognition of the work of the Holy See in rescuing Jews from Fascist and Nazi persecutions."&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, 2001, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, in the autumn of 1945, Harry Greenstein from [[Baltimore]], a close friend of Chief Rabbi Herzog of [[Jerusalem]], told Pius XII how grateful Jews were for all he had done for them. "My only regret", the pope replied, "is not to have been able to save a greater number of Jews."&lt;ref&gt;McInerney, Ralph, ''The Defamation of Pius XII'', 2001.&lt;!-- ISBN missing --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pius XII was also criticised during his lifetime. [[Leon Poliakov]] wrote in 1950 that Pius XII had been a tacit supporter of [[Vichy France]]'s anti-Semitic laws, calling him "less forthright" than [[Pope Pius XI]] either out of "Germanophilia" or the hope that Hitler would defeat communist Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Poliakov |first1 = Leon |last2 = November |year = 1950 |title = The Vatican and the 'Jewish Question': The Record of the Hitler Period—and After |url = |journal = Commentary |volume = 10 |pages = 439–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Pius XII's death on 9 October 1958 many Jewish organisations and newspapers around the world paid tribute to his legacy. At the [[United Nations]], Golda Meir, Israel's Foreign Minister, said, "When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict."&lt;ref name="ewtn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/issues/pius12gs.htm|title=The Good Samaritan. Jewish Praise for Pope Pius XII by Dimitri Cavalli|publisher=Ewtn.com|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jewish Chronicle'' (London) stated on 10 October that "Adherents of all creeds and parties will recall how Pius XII faced the responsibilities of his exalted office with courage and devotion. Before, during, and after the Second World War, he constantly preached the message of peace. Confronted by the monstrous cruelties of Nazism, [[Fascism]] and [[Communism]], he repeatedly proclaimed the virtues of humanity and compassion".&lt;ref name="ewtn"/&gt; In the Canadian Jewish Chronicle (17 October), Rabbi J. Stern stated that Pius XII "made it possible for thousands of Jewish victims of Nazism and Fascism to be hidden away..."&lt;ref name="ewtn"/&gt; In the 6 November edition of the Jewish Post in [[Winnipeg]], William Zukerman, the former American Hebrew columnist, wrote that no other leader "did more to help the Jews in their hour of greatest tragedy, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, than the late Pope".&lt;ref name="ewtn"/&gt; Other prominent Jewish figures, such as Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett and Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog expressed their public gratitude to Pius XII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicleague.org/a-righteous-gentile-pope-pius-xii-and-the-jews/|title=A Righteous Gentile: Pope Pius XII and the Jews|author=Rabbi David Dalin|date=26 February 2001|publisher=Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights|accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early historical accounts===
Some early works echoed the favourable sentiments of the war period, including Polish historian [[Oskar Halecki]]'s ''Pius XII: Eugenio Pacelli: Pope of peace'' (1954) and Nazareno Padellaro's ''Portrait of Pius XII'' (1949).

[[Pinchas Lapide]], a Jewish theologian and [[Israel]]i diplomat to [[Milan]] in the 1960s, estimated controversially in ''[[Three Popes and the Jews]]'' that Pius "was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands."&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, Pinchas. ''Three Popes and the Jews'', 1967, quoted in Dalin, 2005, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have questioned this&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Gilbert, Martin. ''The Holocaust'', p. 623&lt;/ref&gt; often cited number, which Lapide reached by "deducting all reasonable claims of rescue" by non-Catholics from the total number of European Jews surviving the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Lapide, 1967, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; A Catholic scholar, Kevin Madigan, has interpreted this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including [[Golda Meir]], as less than sincere, an attempt to secure Vatican [[International recognition of Israel|recognition of the State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;"Lapide was in the 1960s an Israeli consul in Milan and was attempting, at the time he made his inflated estimates, to secure Vatican recognition for the state of Israel. Similar motives explain statements made in the immediate postwar period by Golda Meir and Moshe Sharett, foreign ministers of the new state of Israel. Had these statements been accurate within even an order of magnitude, Pius would perhaps deserve to be honored by [[Yad Vashem]] and celebrated by Rabbi Dalin as a righteous gentile. They were not. Whatever was thus gained diplomatically by these statements—in the short run, precious little—was purchased at the cost of considerable historical untruth." in ''Christian Century'', "Judging Pius XII" by Kevin Madigan. 14 March 2001, pp. 6–7; see also ''The Pius war: responses to the critics of Pius XII'' by [[Joseph Bottum (author)|Joseph Bottum]] &amp; David Dalin, 2004, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Deputy''===
{{Main article|The Deputy}}
[[File:1899eugenio.jpg|thumb|right|A rare 1899 handwriting of Eugenio Pacelli with text in [[Latin]]]]

In 1963, [[Rolf Hochhuth]]'s controversial drama ''[[The Deputy|Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel]]'' (''The Deputy, a Christian tragedy'', released in English in 1964) portrayed Pope Pius XII as a hypocrite who remained silent about the Holocaust. The depiction is described as lacking "credible substantiation" by the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/462400/Pius-XII/236598/After-World-War-II ''Pius XII'']; web 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Books such as Joseph Lichten's ''A Question of Judgment'' (1963), written in response to ''The Deputy'', defended Pius XII's actions during the war. Lichten labelled any criticism of the pope's actions during World War II as "a stupefying paradox" and said, "no one who reads the record of Pius XII's actions on behalf of Jews can subscribe to Hochhuth's accusation."&lt;ref&gt;Lichten, 1963, ''[http://www.catholicleague.org/piusxii_and_the_holocaust/quesjud5.htm A Question of Judgement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060725005932/http://www.catholicleague.org/piusxii_and_the_holocaust/quesjud5.htm |date=25 July 2006 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical scholarly works like [[Guenter Lewy]]'s controversial ''The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany'' (1964) also followed the publication of ''The Deputy''. Lewy's conclusion was that "the Pope and his advisers—influenced by the long tradition of moderate anti-Semitism so widely accepted in Vatican circles—did not view the plight of the Jews with a real sense of urgency and moral outrage. For this assertion no documentation is possible, but it is a conclusion difficult to avoid".&lt;ref&gt;Marchione, 2000, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 the play was adapted into the film, ''[[Amen.]]''. An article on ''[[La Civilità Cattolica]]'' in March 2009 indicated that the accusations that Hochhuth's play made widely known originated not among Jews but in the Communist bloc. It was on Moscow Radio, on 2 June 1945, that the first accusation directly against Pius XII of refusing to speak out against the exterminations in Nazi concentration camps. It was also the first medium to call him "Hitler's Pope".&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Sale, ''Il Novecento tra genocidi, paure e speranze'', Jaca Book, Milan 2006, p. 214, quoted in ''[[La Civiltà Cattolica]]'', 2009, I 540&lt;/ref&gt;

The former high-ranking [[Securitate]] General [[Ion Mihai Pacepa]] alleged in 2007 that Hochhuth's play and numerous publications attacking Pius XII as a Nazi sympathizer were fabrications that were part of a [[KGB]] and [[Eastern bloc]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] secret services [[disinformation]] campaign, named [[Seat 12]], to discredit the [[moral authority]] of the Church and Christianity in the west.&lt;ref name="article.nationalreview.com"&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTUzYmJhMGQ5Y2UxOWUzNDUyNWUwODJiOTEzYjY4NzI= "Moscow's Assault on the Vatican"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205011340/http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTUzYmJhMGQ5Y2UxOWUzNDUyNWUwODJiOTEzYjY4NzI%3D |date=5 February 2007 }}, ''[[National Review Online]]'', 25 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Pacepa indicated that he was involved in contacting eastern bloc agents close the Vatican in order to fabricate the story to be used for the attack against the wartime pope.&lt;ref name="article.nationalreview.com"/&gt;

===''Actes''===
{{Main article|Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale}}
In the aftermath of the controversy surrounding ''The Deputy'', in 1964, [[Pope Paul VI]] authorized Jesuit scholars to access the Vatican State Department Archives, which are normally not opened for seventy-five years. Original documents in French and Italian, ''[[Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale]]'', were published in eleven volumes between 1965 and 1981. The volumes were edited by Four Jesuits: Angelo Martini, Burkhart Schneider, Robert Graham and Pierre Blet. Blet also published a summary of the eleven volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Blet, Pierre.

===''Hitler's Pope'' and ''The Myth of Hitler's Pope''===
{{Main article|Hitler's Pope|The Myth of Hitler's Pope}}
In 1999, British author [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]]'s ''Hitler's Pope'' criticised Pius XII for his actions and inactions during the Holocaust. Cornwell argued that Pius XII subordinated opposition to the Nazis to his goal of increasing and centralising the power of the Papacy. Further, Cornwell accused Pius XII of anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2000, pp. xii–xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopædia Britannica described Cornwell's depiction of Pius XII as anti-Semitic as lacking "credible substantiation".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-236599 Encyclopædia Britannica Online – ''Reflections on the Holocaust'']; web 26 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth L. Woodward stated in his review in ''Newsweek'' that "errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page."&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth L. Woodward. ''[http://www.newsweek.com/id/89597 The Case Against Pius Xii]'', ''Newsweek''. 27 September 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul O'Shea summarized the work by saying it was "disappointing because of its many inaccuracies, selective use of sources, and claims that do not bear any scrutiny. However, [Cornwell] has rendered a service by insisting Pacelli be re-examined thoroughly and placed firmly within the context of his times".&lt;ref&gt;Paul O'Shea; A Cross Too Heavy; Rosenberg Publishing; 2008; p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the publication of ''Hitler's Pope'', Cornwell stated: "I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following ''Hitler's Pope'', that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany".&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 9 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/books/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3471137 "For God's sake"]. ''The Economist''. 9 December 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Cornwell, ''The Pontiff in Winter'' (2004), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornwell's work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius XII's [[beatification]] process as well as to many documents from Pacelli's nunciature which had just been opened under the 75-year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives.&lt;ref&gt;Sanchez, 2002, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Zuccotti]]'s ''[[Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy]]'' (2000) and [[Michael Phayer]]'s ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965'' (2000) and ''[[Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War]]'' (2008) provided further critical, though more scholarly analysis of Pius's legacy.&lt;ref name="britannica2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/holocaust/article-5770 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica's Reflections on the Holocaust |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel Goldhagen]]'s ''A Moral Reckoning'' and [[David Kerzer]]'s ''The Pope Against the Jews'' denounced Pius, while Ralph McInery and José Sanchez wrote more nuanced critical assessments of Pius XII's pontificate.&lt;ref name="The Pope was wrong"&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/839276/the-pope-was-wrong/ ''The Pope was wrong'']; by Andrew Roberts; [[The Spectator]]; 16 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In specific riposte to Cornwell's criticism, American Rabbi and historian [[David Dalin]] published ''[[The Myth of Hitler's Pope|The Myth of Hitler's Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis]]'' in 2005. He reaffirmed previous accounts of Pius having been a saviour of thousands of Europe's Jews. In a review of the book, another Jewish scholar—Churchill biographer, [[Martin Gilbert]]—wrote that Dalin's work was "an essential contribution to our understanding of the reality of Pope Pius XII's support for Jews at their time of greatest danger. Hopefully, his account will replace the divisively harmful version of papal neglect, and even collaboration, that has held the field for far too long".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/ ''Hitler's Pope?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509114728/http://spectator.org/archives/2006/08/18/hitlers-pope/ |date=9 May 2013 }} by Sir [[Martin Gilbert]]; The [[American Spectator]]; 18/8/06&lt;/ref&gt; Dalin's book also argued that Cornwell and others were liberal Catholics and ex-Catholics who "exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today" and that Pius XII was responsible for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Dalin, 2005, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other scholars replied with favourable accounts of Pius XII, including [[Margherita Marchione]]'s ''[[Yours Is a Precious Witness]]: Memoirs of Jews and Catholics in Wartime Italy'' (1997), ''Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace'' (2000) and ''Consensus and Controversy: Defending Pope Pius XII'' (2002); [[Pierre Blet]]'s ''Pius XII and the Second World War, According to the Archives of the Vatican'' (1999); and [[Ronald J. Rychlak]]'s ''[[Hitler, the War and the Pope]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name="britannica2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rychlak, Ronald J. ''Hitler, the War and the Pope'' Genesis Press, Columbus, MS: 2000, pp. 401 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecclesiastical historian William Doino (author of ''The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII''), concluded that Pius was "emphatically ''not'' silent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2012/11/23/sparks-fly-at-pius-xii-debate-in-london/ ''Sparks fly at Pius XII debate in London'']; Catholic Herald; 23 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Other important works challenging the negative characterization of Pius's legacy were written by [[Eamon Duffy]], [[Clifford Longley]], [[Cardinal Winning]], [[Michael Burleigh]], Paul Johnson, and [[Denis Mack Smith]].&lt;ref name="The Pope was wrong"/&gt;

In his 2003 book, ''[[A Moral Reckoning]]'', [[Daniel Goldhagen]], asserted that Pius XII "chose again and again not to mention the Jews publicly.... [In] public statements by Pius XII ... any mention of the Jews is conspicuously absent." In a review of Goldhagen's book, [[Mark Riebling]] counters that Pius used the word "Jew" in his first encyclical, ''[[Summi Pontificatus]]'', published on 20 October 1939. "There Pius insisted that all human beings be treated charitably—for, as [[Saint Paul|Paul]] had written to the [[Colossians]], in God's eyes "there is neither Gentile nor Jew." In saying this, the Pope affirmed that Jews were full members of the human community—which is Goldhagen's own criterion for establishing 'dissent from the anti-Semitic creed.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markriebling.blogs.com/files/jesus-jews-shoah.pdf|title=Mark Riebling, "Jesus, Jews, and the Shoah", '&amp;#39;National Review'&amp;#39;, 27 January 2003|format=PDF|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Pius XII, The Hound of Hitler'', Catholic journalist [[Gerard Noel (author)|Gerard Noel]] dismissed accusations that Pius was "anti-semitic" or "pro-Nazi", but accused him of "silence" based on fear of retaliation and wrote that " Hitler played the Pope with consummate expertise".&lt;ref name="The Pope was wrong"/&gt; [[Gerald Steinacher]]'s ''Nazis on the Run'' accused Pius of turning a blind eye to the activities of Vatican priests assisting "denazification through conversion" – which, he said, helped ex-Nazi anticommunists to escape justice.&lt;ref&gt;"brief phases of reassurance about the role of the Pope were followed by waves of critical literature[-] and counteracted the process of exoneration that had been underway for some years. The focus of recent analyses by John Cornwell via Michael Phayer, Susan Zucotti, Daniel J. Goldhagen, and Giovanni Miccoli, as well as works by authors Matteo Napolitano and Andrea Torniello, is once again about the Pope's silence about the murder of Jews in Europe -the papal archives could provide information about Vatican diplomacy between 1933 and 1945; however, the Vatican remains the only European state that withholds free access to its archives from contemporary historians. The archives of these years are crucial if many questions about the Holocaust and the Second World War are to be answered and if the many uncertainties concerning Nazi refugee assistance by the Vatican are to be removed." (Gerald Steinacher:Nazis on the Run, p. 105)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/24/nazis-run-gerald-steinacher-review '' Nazis on the Run by Gerald Steinacher—review'']; by [[Richard J Evans]]; [[The Guardian]]; 24 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A Berlin Jewish couple, Mr. and Mrs. Wolfsson, argued in defense of the pope: "None of us wanted the Pope to take an open stand. We were all fugitives, and fugitives do not wish to be pointed at. The Gestapo would have become more excited and would have intensified its inquisitions. If the Pope had protested, Rome would have become the center of attention. It was better that the Pope said nothing. We all shared this opinion at the time, and this is still our conviction today." There were examples when Church reaction to Nazi brutality only intensified SS persecutions of both Jews and the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichten|first1=Joseph L.|title=The Vatican &amp; the Holocaust: A Question of Judgment – Pius XII &amp; the Jews|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/piusdef2.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission===
{{Main article|International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission}}
In 1999, in an attempt to address some of this controversy, the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission (Historical Commission), a group of three Catholic and three Jewish scholars was appointed, respectively, by the [[Holy See]]'s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews (Holy See's Commission) and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC), to whom a preliminary report was issued in October 2000.&lt;ref name="ICJHC"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Vatican and the Holocaust: A Preliminary Report|author=International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission|year=2000|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/vatrep.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission did not discover any documents, but had the agreed-upon task to review the existing Vatican volumes, that make up the ''Actes et Documents du Saint Siege (ADSS)''&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was internally divided over the question of access to additional documents from the Holy See, access to the news media by individual commission members, and, questions to be raised in the preliminary report. It was agreed to include all 47 individual questions by the six members, and use them as Preliminary Report.&lt;ref name="Gerard P Fogarty, Vatican/Holocaust"&gt;Fogarty, Gerard P., ''The Vatican and the Holocaust, Presentation to the Dominican House of Studies, Washington, D.C.'', 9 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 47 questions, the commission issued no findings of its own. It stated that it was not their task to sit in judgment of the Pope and his advisors but to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the papacy during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The 47 questions by the six scholars were grouped into three parts: (a) 27 specific questions on existing documents,&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, pp. 5–10&lt;/ref&gt; mostly asking for background and additional information such as drafts of the encyclical ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', which was largely written by Eugenio Pacelli.&lt;ref&gt;Question One&lt;/ref&gt; (b) Fourteen questions dealt with themes of individual volumes,&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, pp. 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; such as the question how Pius viewed the role of the Church during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Question 28&lt;/ref&gt; (c) Six general questions,&lt;ref&gt;Preliminary Report, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; such as the absence of any anti-communist sentiments in the documents.&lt;ref&gt;Question 42&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement between members over additional documents locked up under the Holy See's 70 year rule resulted in a discontinuation of the Commission in 2001 on friendly terms.&lt;ref name="Gerard P Fogarty, Vatican/Holocaust"/&gt; Unsatisfied with the findings, Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the Commission, said the commission "ran up against a brick wall .... It would have been really helpful to have had support from the Holy See on this issue."&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Radler. "Vatican Blocks Panel's Access to Holocaust Archives." ''The Jerusalem Post''. 24 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Stanford]], a Catholic journalist and writer, wrote, regarding ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'' (written by Robert Katz; {{ISBN|0-297-84661-2}}; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2003):

{{Quote|[The Vatican] still refuses to open all its files from the period—which seems to me to be a conclusive admission of guilt—but Katz has winkled various papers out of God's business address on earth to add to the stash of new information he has uncovered in America in the archives of the Office of Strategic Services. From this we learn that, although Pius's defenders still say that he paid a golden ransom in a vain effort to save Rome's Jews from transportation to the death camps, the most he did was indicate a willingness to chip in if the Jews could not raise the sum demanded. He also shows that no individual Jews were spared, as is often claimed, after Pius personally intervened with the Nazis. Moreover, Katz reveals that those who did escape the Nazi round-up and found sanctuary in church buildings in Rome did so in the face of explicit opposition from the Vatican. The real heroes and heroines were the priests and nuns who refused to bow to Pius's officials and hand over the desperate people whom they were hiding. The main problem with writing about Pius's wartime is that in effect, he did nothing. Facing the murders of six million people, he remained silent. As Jews were taken away from the ghetto that sat right alongside St Peter's, he may have agonised, but he did not intervene. When he did raise his voice with the German occupiers, it was either to ensure that the Vatican City state would not be compromised—that is to say, he would be safe—or to emphasise his own neutrality in a conflict which, for many, became a battle between good and evil. His unrealistic hope was that the Catholic Church could emerge as the peacemaker across Europe. Instead, both the American and British leaderships, as Katz shows, regarded the papacy as tainted by its association with Nazism and irrelevant in the post-1945 reshaping of the continent. Both had urged Pius to speak up against the Holocaust and so drew their own conclusions about him. Far from being a saint, then, he was at best a fool, perhaps an anti-Semite and probably a coward.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Peter J. "Catholic guilt", 13 October 2003, {{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904222456/http://www.newstatesman.com/200310130045 |archivedate=4 September 2008}} in review of ''Fatal Silence: the pope, the resistance and the German occupation of Rome'', written by Robert Katz; {{ISBN|0-297-84661-2}}. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Katz's book also discusses how the Pope's view of the anti-Nazi resistance—as harbingers of Communism—meant he chose not to intervene in the [[Ardeatine massacre|Ardeatine Caves Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Katz |first= Robert |authorlink= Robert Katz |year= 2003 |title= The Battle for Rome: The Germans, the Allies, the Partisans, and the Pope, September 1943–June 1944 |location= New York,&amp;nbsp;NY |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |page= 249ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments===
In ''The Real Odessa. How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina'' (2002), the Argentine journalist, [[Uki Goñi]] described how the Argentinean government dealt with war criminals that entered Argentina. However, during his research Goñi accidentally stumbled on documents of the British Foreign Office about the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called [[Ratlines (history)|post-war "ratlines"]]. Goñi found out that the British Envoy [[D'Arcy Osborne, 12th Duke of Leeds|D'Arcy Osborne]] had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered "that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators".&lt;ref&gt;Goñi, afterword to the revised 2003 edition, pp. 327–348.&lt;/ref&gt; Suzanne Brown-Fleming's ''The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience. Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany'' (2006) underlines Goñi's findings. In her remarkable study, Brown-Fleming clearly demonstrated how Pius XII intervened on behalf of rather vicious German war criminals (e.g. [[Otto Ohlendorf]]). Brown-Fleming's main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII's representative in post-war Germany, [[Aloisius Joseph Muench|Cardinal Aloisius Muench]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Fleming, 2006, Chapter 4: ''Granting Absolution. Muench and the Catholic Clemency Campaign''.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, Phayer's ''[[Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War]]'' (2008) makes use of many documents that have recently come to light thanks to [[Bill Clinton]]'s 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the [[US National Archives]] and [[Holocaust Memorial Museum]]. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and even decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the [[Argentine government]] and the British Foreign Office and other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop [[Joseph Patrick Hurley|Hurley]]. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII's actions regarding the [[Ustaše]] regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, pp. xi–xvi&lt;/ref&gt; According to Phayer, "the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions".&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, 2008, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September 2008, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2008/september/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20080918_pave-the-way_en.html|title=Address at the conclusion of the symposium organized by the "Pave the Way Foundation"|publisher=Vatican.va|date=19 September 2008|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second conference was held from 6–8 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=12968|title=Vatican recalls life and teachings of Pius XII 50 years after his death|publisher=Catholicnewsagency.com|accessdate=6 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII's death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory. Shortly before and after the Mass, dialectics continued between the Jewish hierarchy and the Vatican as Rabbi Shear Yeshuv Cohen of [[Haifa]] addressed the Synod of Bishops and expressed his disappointment towards Pius XII's "silence" during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Donadio|first=Rachel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/world/europe/10briefs-POPEDEFENDSP_BRF.html?ref=world|title=Synod Controversy|location=Italy|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=9 October 2008|accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2009, the Pave the Way Foundation announced that it would release of 2,300 pages of documents in [[Avellino, Italy]], dating from 1940 to 1945, which the organisation claims show that Pius XII "worked diligently to save Jews from Nazi tyranny"; the organisation's founder, Krupp has accused historians of harbouring "private agendas" and having "let down" the public.&lt;ref&gt;''Jerusalem Post''. 2009, 17 June
[https://web.archive.org/web/20110624130904/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1245184852508&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull "Foundation says documents will show Pius helped Jews"].&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's research led to the publication of the book ''Pope Pius XII and World War II: the documented truth'', authored by Krupp; the book reproduces 225 pages of the new documents produced by the foundation's research.

[[Mark Riebling]] argued in his 2015 book ''Church of Spies'' that Pius XII was involved in plots to overthrow Hitler since mid-October 1939 and was prepared to mediate a peace between the Allies and the Axis in the event of a regime change in Germany. The courier between the resistance group under [[Wilhelm Canaris|Admiral Canaris]] and the Pope was the Bavarian lawyer and Catholic politician [[Josef Müller (CSU politician)|Joseph Müller]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Riebling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3969">The '''Proportional Representation Society of Ireland''' was the principle [[electoral reform]] organisation in [[Ireland]] until the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922. It was closely associated with the [[Irish Home Rule movement]].

The Proportional Representation Society of Ireland was founded on 20 April 1911 in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;James Creed Meredith, 'Proportional Representation', ''The Irish Review (Dublin)'', Vol. 2, No. 18 (Aug., 1912), pp. 281-286.&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment came about following a visit to Ireland by [[Leonard Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith]], who advocated [[proportional representation]] as an answer to the political problems faced in Ireland at the time. The Society was initially a branch of its sister organisation in [[Great Britain]], the [[Electoral Reform Society|Proportional Representation Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', 'PR in Ireland' articles (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Society's foundation was welcomed by several notable Irish politicians, including [[Arthur Griffith]], who saw proportional representation as a way of ensuring that both the [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] and [[Irish nationalism|Nationalist]] communities were fairly represented in Ireland once it had Home Rule.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McLaren Carstairs, ''A Short History of Electoral Systems in Western Europe'' (Routledge, 15 Apr 2013), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral system endorsed by the Society was the [[single transferable vote]] (STV), combined with the quota counting method and multi-member constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', 'PR in Ireland' articles (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society's president was the moderate unionist [[Thomas Spring Rice, 2nd Baron Monteagle of Brandon]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Spectator'' (14 February 1920), page 10 http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/14th-february-1920/10/the-arrest-of-sinn-feiners&lt;/ref&gt; He helped to encourage support for the STV system among southern unionists as Home Rule began to look more likely, while Griffith used his considerable influence to ensure [[Sinn Féin]] adopted STV as official policy. Largely as a result of the work done by the Proportional Representation Society of Ireland, the system was embodied in the Third Home Rule Bill (1912), subsequently the ill-fated [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule Act of 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew McLaren Carstairs, ''A Short History of Electoral Systems in Western Europe'' (Routledge, 15 Apr 2013), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society maintained its activity and proportional representation was first introduced in 1918 for a local election to the [[Sligo Corporation]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;John Coakley and Michael Gallagher, ''Politics in the Republic of Ireland'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Proportional representation was introduced to the whole of Ireland in all elections, parliamentary and municipal, in the following two years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', 'PR in Ireland' articles (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; Proportional representation was enshrined in the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;John Coakley and Michael Gallagher, ''Politics in the Republic of Ireland'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 2010), 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the Society resulted in its disestablishment in the 1920s. The two attempts of [[Fianna Fáil]] to alter the voting system ([[Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1958|1959]] and [[Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1968|1968]]) were campaigned against by the British [[Electoral Reform Society]], led by [[Enid Lakeman]]. The single transferable vote electoral system continues to be used in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

{{History of Ethiopia}}
'''Qey Shibir''' (also '''Key Shibbir'''; [[Amharic language|Amharic]]: ቀይ ሽብር ''ḳäy šəbbər''; 1977–1978) or the '''Ethiopian Red Terror''', was a violent political campaign against  competing [[Marxist-Leninist]] groups in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]] that most visibly took place after [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] achieved control of the [[Derg]], the [[military junta]], on 3 February 1977. In December 2006, Mengistu was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for his role in the Red Terror while leader of Ethiopia. It is estimated that 30,000&lt;ref&gt;Harff, Barbara &amp; Gurr, Ted Robert: "Toward an Empirical Theory of Genocides and Politicides", ''International Studies Quarterly'' '''32'''(3), p. 364 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; to 500,000&lt;ref name="US admits helping Mengistu escape"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/575405.stm US admits helping Mengistu escape] [[BBC]], 22 December 1999&lt;/ref&gt; or 750,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genocides, Politicides, and Other Mass Murder Since 1945, With Stages in 2008|url=http://www.gpanet.org/content/genocides-politicides-and-other-mass-murder-1945-stages-2008|website=Genocide Prevention Advisory Network|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were killed over the course of the Qey Shibir.

== Background ==
{{see also|Derg}}
Following the deposition of Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] on 12 September 1974, the Derg was faced with a number of civilian groups competing for control of Ethiopia, most notably the [[Communist party|communist]] [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party]] (EPRP). In September 1976, EPRP militants were arrested and executed, at the same time as the EPRP carried out an assassination campaign against ideologues and supporters of the Derg. Although an unsuccessful attempt to kill Mengistu on 23 September was attributed to the EPRP, the first prominent victim of the EPRP's terror was Dr. [[Feqre Mar'ed]], a member of the [[Political Bureau (Ethiopia)|Political Bureau]] and [[All-Ethiopia Socialist Movement]] (MEISON), another [[Marxist-Leninist]] party.&lt;ref&gt;Marina and David Ottaway, ''Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution'' (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Derg was split by a rivalry between Mengistu and a faction allied against him, which limited his control. This rivalry was resolved at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Derg on 3 February 1977, at which fifty-eight top Derg officers were killed in an hour-long shootout. Seven of these officers were opponents of Mengistu, including chairman and Lieutenant General [[Tafari Benti]], Captain [[Almayahu Haile]], Captain [[Mogas Wolde Mikael]] and Lt. Colonel [[Asrat Desta]], the latter being an avowed [[Marxist-Leninist]]: "We are doing what Lenin did. You cannot build [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] without [[Red Terror]]."&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]], ''The Mitrokhin Archive II: The KGB and the World'', Penguin, 2006, pp. 467–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AM&gt;[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]]. ''The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World.'' Basic Books, 2005. {{ISBN|0-465-00311-7}} ch. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Although two rivals to Mengistu were still alive—Colonel [[Berhanu Bayeh]] and Lt. Colonel [[Atnafu Abate]]—Col. Berhanu had sided with Mengistu, and Lt. Colonel Atnafu quickly sided with the victor of the bloodbath, leaving Mengistu as the undisputed head of the Derg, and ruler of Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Ottaways, ''Ethiopia'', 1978, pp. 142ff&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Mengistu turned his attention to his rivals outside of the Derg, foremost being the EPRP.

== Attacks on the EPRP ==
{{see also|1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|"Red Terror" Martyrs' Memorial Museum}}
Mengistu officially began his campaign with a speech in Revolution Square (formerly and currently [[Meskel Square|Mesqel Square]]) in the heart of [[Addis Ababa]], which included the words "Death to [[counterrevolutionaries]]! Death to the EPRP!" When he delivered these words, he produced three bottles of what appeared to be blood and smashed them to the ground to show what the revolution would do to its enemies.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/1999/11/29/ethiop5495.htm Backgrounders: Ethiopian Dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam] [[Human Rights Watch]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign involved organized groups of civilians, or ''[[kebele]]s'', which within a month's time began to receive arms from the Derg. "Contrary to expectations," note researcher Marina Ottaway and then Washington Post correspondent David Ottaway in their account, "these squads did not all side with the ''Derg'' or heed its call to track down 'reactionaries' and 'anarchists'. Rather, many followed their own whim and law, in accordance to the political faction that controlled each ''kebele'' or factory. Not only had numerous defense squads been infiltrated by the EPRP, but also those controlled by the Political Bureau were often bent on furthering the interests of MEISON rather than the ''Derg''."&lt;ref&gt;Ottaways, ''Ethiopia'', p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottaways date the height of the Red Terror in Addis Ababa to 22 March, when the Derg felt that they had armed enough civilian groups to permit a house-by-house search for EPRP members, arms, and other paraphernalia. However the search was anything but systematic, the Ottways note, with "each squad a law unto itself. Some looked only for arms, but others confiscated food supplies, building materials, and gasoline; some considered cameras espionage equipment, and others regarded typewriters as highly dangerous."&lt;ref&gt;Ottaways, ''Ethiopia'', p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Despite many being taken from their homes in the middle of the night, some never to return home, few of the top leaders of the EPRP were among the dead.

A number of distinctly ugly incidents followed. One was at the Berhanena Selam Printing Press, where three days later a dozen workers were arrested for being EPRP members, then afterwards released for lack of evidence; on the morning of 26 March, nine of them were found murdered, including a woman in an advanced stage of pregnancy, which shocked the city. The deaths were found to be the responsibility of a certain Girma Kebede, and who was later found to be "the Political Bureau's chief executioner; he had already murdered twenty-four persons and had a list of over two hundred others he was supposed to liquidate." Embarrassed, the Derg had him and five associates executed as counterrevolutionaries on 2 April.&lt;ref&gt;Ottaways, ''Ethiopia'', pp. 146ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this brutality, the EPRP continued to strike back, best as it could. As one contemporary report describes:
: In and around the capital, the main opposition group is the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.) .... E.P.R.P. has given the Dergue good reason to be nervous: it has assassinated more than 20 government officials, mounted at least one daring raid on Dergue headquarters, and even wounded Mengistu in an ambush. One rebel sympathizer accosted Correspondent Griggs on a busy downtown street and boasted: "We have 700 marksmen, and some of them are Mengistu's own soldiers. It will take time, but we will clean out the pseudo-Marxist military leaders eventually."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911969,00.html "A Despot at War On All Fronts"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' 23 May 1977 (accessed 14 May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Events like this led to tension between the Derg junta (and presumably Mengistu) and the civilian Political Bureau. Concern over the threat of the EPRP kept this tension from becoming a definite break until the eve of [[May Day]], when the Political Bureau, on the pretext that an anti-government protest was in the offing, ordered the ''kebeles'' to arrest any young person suspected of being an EPRP member. According to the Ottaways, "Hundreds were arrested, taken to three different sites on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, and executed en masse. Scores of others were gunned down in the streets by the Derg's 'permanent secretaries', the jeeps mounted with machine guns constantly patrolling the streets of Addis Ababa. The death toll may have been as high as one thousand." Afterwards, the Derg disavowed this outrage and put the blame for the slaughter on the Political Bureau in a proclamation on 14 July. The Bureau's leader [[Haile Fide]] and a group of his followers attempted to flee the capital the following August, but were caught.&lt;ref&gt;Ottaways, ''Ethiopia'', pp. 147ff&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the Red Terror made MEISON its next target. "Sensing danger," writes Bahru Zewde, "the leaders of the organization hastily tried to go underground. But almost all of them were either captured or killed in August 1977 as they tried to retreat into the countryside in several detachments."&lt;ref&gt;Bahru Zewde, ''A History of Modern Ethiopia'', 2002, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

Thousands of men and women were rounded up and executed in the following two years.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6251095.stm Mengistu is handed life sentence] [[BBC]], 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the death toll could be as high as 500,000.&lt;ref name="US admits helping Mengistu escape"/&gt; Groups of people were herded into churches that were then burned down, and women were subjected to systematic rape by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephane Courtois]], et al. ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression''. [[Harvard University Press]], 1999. p. 692&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Save the Children Fund]] reported that the victims of the Red Terror included not only adults, but 1,000 or more children, mostly aged between eleven and thirteen, whose corpses were left in the streets of Addis Ababa.&lt;ref name=AM/&gt;

The victims' lives are immortalized in the [["Red Terror" Martyrs' Memorial Museum]] in Addis Ababa.

Mengistu was found guilty of [[genocide]] ''in absentia'' and was sentenced to life in prison in January 2007. After his conviction, [[Zimbabwe]], where he received sanctuary due to friendship with [[Robert Mugabe]], said it would not extradite him.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  On 26 May 2008, the Ethiopian Supreme Court sentenced Mengistu ''in absentia'' to [[capital punishment|death]]. Eighteen associates of Mengistu, two of whom live in the Italian embassy in Addis Ababa and 16 in Ethiopian prisons, also are under a death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7420212.stm Court Sentences Mengistu to Death] [[BBC]], 26 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Another individual who was found guilty ''in absentia ''in May 2002, [[Kelbessa Negewo]], was returned from his exile in the United States several years later to serve a life sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Rice|title=The Long Interrogation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/magazine/04torturer.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f88ce4083b9ca61d&amp;ex=1307073600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=4 June 2006|accessdate=3 February 2011}}

}}'''''R v Neil''''', [2002] 3 S.C.R. 631, 2002 SCC 70, is a leading decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] on [[conflict of interest]]s among lawyers. The Court held that both firms and lawyers have a fiduciary duty of loyalty to their clients and so lawyer or firm cannot represent a client whose interests may be adverse to the interests of another client unless there is consent and a reasonable belief that the interests will not be adverse. This greatly expanded the old rules of conflict of interest which required actual knowledge of confidential information before a lawyer was in conflict.

==Background==
David Lloyd Neil was accused of a series of criminal charges. In his prior job he retained the legal services of a [[solicitor]] from an Edmonton law firm. Neil's assistant, Helen Lambert, had hired Gregory Lazin from the same firm to represent her in the relation to the charges. Lazin sat in on an interview with Neil's lawyer in order to gain advantage for his client. In a second incident, Lazin was approached by an old client of Neil named Doblanko who believed that Neil had fabricated a divorce document. Lazin referred him to the same police officer who was investigating Neil's other charges.

The issue was whether Lazin created a conflict of interest by assisting in establishing the charges against Neil, when he was a past client. 

==Ruling of the Court==
Justice Binnie, writing for the Court, dismissed the appeal. He held that the firm owed a duty of loyalty to Neil and should not have communicated with the other parties. 

Binnie used the case as an opportunity to survey the meaning of a lawyer's duty of loyalty. He takes a strong stance, arguing that the duty is an essential to the integrity of the profession and the administration of justice. Loyalty promotes effective legal representation.

==Impact==

While the "[[bright-line rule]]" stated in ''Neil'' was ''[[obiter dictum|obiter]]'' to the case at hand, in 2007 it became the ''[[ratio decidendi|ratio]]'' for determining the later SCC case of ''Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Strother v. 3464920 Canada Inc.|link=|year=2007|court=scc|num=24|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[2007] 2 SCR 177|date=2007-06-01|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Alice Woolley|title = The Italics that Rocked the Decade (for Canadian Lawyers)|url = http://ablawg.ca/2010/02/01/the-italics-that-rocked-the-decade-for-canadian-lawyers/|publisher = ABlawg.ca|date = February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Strother'' was decided in part by a divided Court, the later case of ''[[Canadian National Railway Co. v.

The '''Reform Party''' ({{lang-af|Reformiste Party}}) was an [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] political party that existed for just five months in 1975 and is one of the predecessor parties to the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]]. The Reform Party was created on 11 February by a group of four Members of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] (MPs) who left the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] under the guidance of the leader of the United Party in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], [[Harry Schwarz]], who became the party's leader. Schwarz and others were staunchly opposed to [[apartheid]] and called for a much more rigorous opposition to the National Party. They said that they no longer felt the UP was "the vehicle in which we can travel the path of verligtheid". The party had four MPs, two senators, ten members of the [[Transvaal Provincial Council]], 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors and four Randburg City Councillors. This made it the official opposition in the Transvaal Provincial Council.

==Formation==
[[File:HarrySchwarz1976.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Harry Schwarz]] Leader of the Reform Party]]
There was much division in the United party, between [[liberalism|liberals]] and [[conservatism|conservatives]] in the 1960s and early 1970s. Divisions came to a head in 1972 when Harry Schwarz, leader of the liberal "Young Turks" within the party, wrestled the leadership of the party in the Transvaal from Marais Steyn. His victory was a visible sign of strength from the liberals within the party. In 1975 Harry Schwarz broke away from the party with four other MPs, two senators, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors, four Randburg City Councillors formed the Reform Party.

At the Reform Party's first meeting it mapped out the party's objectives. Among the main ones were:

1. The Reform Party believes in [[equality of opportunity]] and must create the conditions in which equality of opportunity can be exercised.

2. The Reform Party stands for the removal of [[discrimination]] based on colour. It must get together with the people of other races to evolve a way in which discrimination will be removed.

==Merger with Progressive Party==
Although closer to the Progressives' agenda, the new Reform Party made no immediate move to merge the two parties. Eventually the party merged with the [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] on 25 July 1975 to form the [[Progressive Reform Party (South Africa)|Progressive Reform Party]] with [[Colin Eglin]] as the new leader and Schwarz as Chairman of the National Executive. This proved to realign the opposition in South Africa, as the PRP became the official opposition party following the demise of the UP. In 1977 another group of United Party members left the Party to form the Committee for a United Opposition, which then joined the Progressive Reform Party to form the [[Progressive Federal Party]].

A '''retirement annuity plan''' (RAP) is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Pensions|pension plan]] designed to build a lump sum for retirement.  Part of the lump sum must be used to buy an annuity and part can be taken a tax free lump sum.

The plans were introduced under ''section 226'' of the ''[[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970]]'' and are often referred to as ''section 226'' contracts.  However they are currently legislated under ''section 620'' of the ''[[Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988]]'' and are therefore also known as ''section 620'' contracts.

==Tax treatment==

Contributions receive basic tax relief claimed at source (although this was only introduced in 2001).  The income and gains in the plan are free from tax (with the exception of the non-reclaimable 10% tax credit).  At maturity the tax free cash can be taken.  The tax free cash lump sum is calculated with reference to the initial annual income.  The formula is often described as: ''the tax free cash is equal to three times the residual income''.

This tax regime is being abolished under [[pension simplification]] introduced on [[A-day]].

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Röell cabinet''' was the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]] from 9 May 1894 until 27 July 1897. The cabinet was formed by [[Independent politician|Independent Liberals]] (I) after the [[Dutch general election, 1894|election of 1894]]. The [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] cabinet was a [[minority government]] in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] but was [[Confidence and supply|supported]] by the [[Liberal Union (Netherlands)|Liberal Union]] (LU) and [[Independent politician|Independent Catholics]] (I) for a majority. [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|Independent Conservative Liberal]] [[Joan Röell]] was [[Prime Minister of the Netherlands|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn2/roellj|title=Röell, jhr.

With it, an aggressor can influence and eventually dominate a landscape, typically [[politics|political]], piece by piece. In this fashion, the opposition is eliminated "slice by slice" until one realizes (too late) that it is gone in its entirety. In some cases it includes the creation of several [[Political faction|factions]] within the opposing [[political party]] and then dismantling that party from the inside, without causing the 'sliced' sides to protest. Salami tactics are most likely to succeed when the perpetrators keep their true long-term motives hidden and maintain a posture of cooperativeness and helpfulness while engaged in the intended gradual subversion.

The term ''salami tactics'' ({{lang-hu|szalámitaktika}}) was coined in the late 1940s by the [[Anti-revisionism|orthodox communist leader]] [[Mátyás Rákosi]] to describe the actions of the [[Hungarian Communist Party]] in its ultimately successful drive for complete power in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Bullock, Alan, edited by Alan Bullock and Oliver Stallybrass [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWVmAAAAMAAJ The Harper dictionary of modern thought], Harper &amp; Row, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; Rákosi claimed he destroyed the non-Communist parties by "cutting them off like slices of salami."&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;Time Magazine. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,857130,00.html "Hungary: Salami Tactics"] ''[[Time Magazine]]'' (April 14, 1952). Retrieved March 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; By portraying his opponents as [[Fascism|fascists]] (or at the very least fascist sympathizers), he was able to get the opposition to slice off its [[Right-wing politics|right wing]], then its [[Centrism|centrists]], then the more courageous [[Left-wing politics|left wingers]], until only those [[Fellow traveller]]s willing to collaborate with the Communists remained in power.&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC Safire's Political Dictionary], Oxford University Press, 2008 (revised), p.639, {{ISBN|0-19-534334-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-534334-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Piecemeal strategy===
The term is also known as a "piecemealy strategy". It was used by the [[Nazi Party]] (which used the term ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'') to achieve absolute power in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], beginning in the early months of 1933. The [[Reichstag fire]] of February 27 rattled the German population and led to the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], leading to the suspension of many [[civil liberties]] and outlawing of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] parties. An estimated 10,000 people were arrested in two weeks. An [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] soon followed on March 24. The act gave Hitler [[plenary power]], which allowed him to bypass the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and consolidate power. Hitler and the Nazis then eliminated such potential opposition as [[trade union]]s and rival political parties. They established organizations with mandatory membership, such as the [[Hitler Youth]], the [[League of German Girls]] and the [[Reich Labour Service]]. The Enabling Act was renewed in 1937 and 1941. 

On April 26, 1942, the Reichstag passed a law making Hitler the ''oberster Gerichtsherr'' or the supreme judge of the land, giving him the power of life and death over every citizen, which effectively extended the Enabling Act for the rest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;William Shirer, ''[[The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich]]''. Touchstone Edition, Simon &amp; Schuster, New York (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
===In television===
Salami tactics are discussed by the British Chief Scientific Adviser in the ''[[Yes Minister|Yes, Prime Minister]]'' episode, "[[The Grand Design (Yes, Prime Minister)|The Grand Design]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHP_LOtx6Ik&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=7m50s|title=Yes, Prime Minister - The Grand Design|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In film===
In the 2016 film ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', Agent Halpern mentions a Hungarian word meaning to eliminate your enemies one by one.  It is thought that this alludes to ''szalámitaktika.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dailynewshungary.com/hungarian-expression-mentioned-arrival-sci-fi-movie-year/|title=A Hungarian expression is mentioned in Arrival, the sci-fi movie of the year|last=Béni|first=Alexandra|date=20 November 2016|website=Daily News Hungary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/trivia|title=Arrival - Trivia|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, this is cited in Amazon Prime X-Ray (1:07:50).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17765">In law, '''sex characteristics''' refers to an attribute defined for the purposes of protecting individuals from discrimination due to their sexual features. The attribute of sex characteristics was first defined in national law in Malta, in 2015. The legal term has since been adopted by United Nations,&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"/&gt; European,&lt;ref name="eu" /&gt; and Asia-Pacific institutions,&lt;ref name="afp2016" /&gt; and in a 2017 update to the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] on the application of international human rights law in relation to [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[gender expression]] and sex characteristics.&lt;ref name="ypplus10" /&gt;

== Physical attributes ==
Physical sex characteristics include [[primary sex characteristics]] and [[secondary sex characteristics]]. A primary sexual characteristic, as narrowly defined, is any anatomical part of the body involved in [[sexual reproduction]] and constituting the [[reproductive system]] in a complex organism, especially the external [[sex]] organs; the external sex organs are also commonly referred to as the genitalia or genitals.&lt;ref name="Sex organ1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex organ (sɛks ˈɔːɡən)|publisher=''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''|accessdate=September 14, 2013|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sex-organ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193350/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sex-organ|archivedate=October 29, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashalatha"&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

Sex characteristics is a term used in law and in human rights frameworks. The term was first used in Malta in 2015, when the country enacted legal protections from discrimination and forced medical procedures on grounds of sex characteristics. The Gender Identity, Gender Expression and Sex Characteristics Act defined sex characteristics as:

{{quotation|"sex characteristics" refers to the chromosomal, gondal and anatomical features of a person, which include primary characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia and/or in chromosomal structures and hormones; and secondary characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breasts and/or structure.}}

In November 2017, the [[Yogyakarta Principles]] were expanded to include new principles and new attributes of sex characteristics and gender identity. The supplement noted that the new "explicit ground for protection from violations of human rights has evolved in international jurisprudence".&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043532/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ |date=2017-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex characteristics is defined as:

{{quotation|UNDERSTANDING ‘sex characteristics’ as each person’s physical features relating to sex, including genitalia and other sexual and reproductive anatomy, chromosomes, hormones, and secondary physical features emerging from puberty.&lt;ref name="ypplus10" /&gt;}}

In 2015, the [[European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights|Fundamental Rights Agency]] published a comparative legal analysis on protection against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in the EU.&lt;ref name="eu"&gt;{{Cite conference| last = European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights| author-link = European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights| title = Protection against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics in the EU – Comparative legal analysis – Update 2015| date = December 2015| url = http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2015/lgbti-comparative-legal-update-2015| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170903235722/http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2015/lgbti-comparative-legal-update-2015| archivedate = 2017-09-03| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Asia Pacific Forum]] of [[National Human Rights Institutions]] (AFP) manual on Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to [[Sexual Orientation]], [[Gender Identity]] and Sex Characteristics.&lt;ref name="afp2016"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = [[Asia Pacific Forum|Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions]]| isbn = 978-0-9942513-7-4| last = Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions| title = Promoting and Protecting Human Rights in relation to Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Sex Characteristics| date = June 2016| url = http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170115144950/http://www.asiapacificforum.net/resources/manual-sogi-and-sex-charactersitics/| archivedate = 2017-01-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The document provides an analysis of human rights issues, including the rights to physical integrity, non-discrimination, effective remedies and redress, and recognition before the law.

=== Intersex people ===

The Maltese Act that introduced the term was widely welcomed internationally by civil society organizations as it offered protections to intersex people for the first time.&lt;ref name="gate-malta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://transactivists.org/2015/04/08/making-depathologization-a-matter-of-law-a-comment-from-gate-on-the-maltese-act-on-gender-identity-gender-expression-and-sex-characteristics/ |title=Making depathologization a matter of law.

(page 9)&lt;ref name="coe" /&gt;}}

In 2015, the United Nations published a fact sheet using the term sex characteristics to define intersex:

{{quotation|Intersex people are born with sex characteristics (including genitals, gonads and chromosome patterns) that do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies.&lt;ref name="unfe-fact"&gt;{{Cite web | author = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | publisher = United Nations [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] | title = Free &amp; Equal Campaign Fact Sheet: Intersex | date = 2015 | url = https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | access-date = 28 March 2016 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071043/https://unfe.org/system/unfe-65-Intersex_Factsheet_ENGLISH.pdf | archivedate = 4 March 2016 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2017, [[Amnesty International]] published a report condemning "non-emergency, invasive and irreversible medical treatment with harmful effects" on children born with variations of sex characteristics in [[Intersex rights in Germany|Germany]] and Denmark. It found that surgeries take place with limited psychosocial support, based on gender stereotypes, but without firm evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Signal crime''' is a concept coined by Professor Martin Innes and Professor Nigel Fielding, aiming "to capture the social semiotic processes by which particular types of criminal and disorderly conduct have a disproportionate impact upon fear of crime." &lt;ref&gt;Innes and Fielding (2002), abstract - http://www.socresonline.org.uk/7/2/innes.html&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was created to aid a policing approach being trialled in the early 2000s by Surrey Police called [[reassurance policing]] - the ascendent to the current 'neighbourhood policing' approach in England and Wales. This approach was developed in order to close the 'reassurance gap' - the paradoxical situation in which the public's 'fear of crime' (as measured by the British Crime Survey/[[Crime Survey for England and Wales]]) does not change in tandem with the overall crime rate.&lt;ref&gt;Tuffin et al (2006), p2-3 - https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/115825/hors296.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Signal Crimes Perspective''' contended that fear of crime and people's risk perceptions - the perceived likelihood of being victimised - were linked to certain crimes, deviant behaviours or the residual signs of these activities:

:"In effect, the crime or incident is 'read' as a warning signal by its audience(s) that something is wrong or lacking, as a result of which they might be induced to take some form of protective action. In addition, the presence of this signal will shape how the person or groups concerned construct beliefs concerning other potential dangers and beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Innes and Fielding (2002), para 5.2 - http://www.socresonline.org.uk/7/2/innes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Signal crimes vary in strength or ''value''; strong signals are borne out of serious events with high public awareness, whilst weak signals may emanate from minor disorderly behaviours. However, the effect of many weak signal events over time can be just as damaging to people's feelings of security. Furthermore, different people and communities will interpret events in different ways, attaching different signal values to crimes and events based on a range of factors - e.g. lived experiences, age, or social class. An example may be that women are more likely to attach higher signal values to sexual assault, whereas young men may not be affected in the same way.

== Application to Policing ==

The '''Signal Crimes Perspective''' is useful to local policing styles that are based on the philosophy of [[community policing]], as it underlines the need for engaging with communities - through local beat meetings or the 'Neighbourhood Security Interview'&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Cran et al (2012) - http://www.sipr.ac.uk/downloads/I-NSI_2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; -  to understand the local problems that create insecurity. With this understanding, local policing teams can attempt to prioritise the issues that appear to have the highest signal values and consequently improve local security.

'''Socialist League Vpered''' ("Forward", {{lang-ru|Социалистическое движение "Вперёд"}}) was a radical left-wing political organisation in [[Russia]]. It was the Russian section of the [[reunified Fourth International]].

== History and activity ==
It was founded in 2005 as the split from [[Sotsialisticheskoye Soprotivleniye|Socialist Resistance]], a Russian group affiliated with the [[Committee for a Workers' International]]. In February 2008, it obtained permanent observer status in the [[reunified Fourth International]]. In February 2010 it become the Russian section of the reunified Fourth International.

VPERED had groups in a few of the country's cities: [[Moscow]], [[Nizhny Novgorod]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[Saratov]], [[Tyumen]], [[Yaroslavl]] and others. VPERED was actively involved in campaigns against governmental reform of education. The organisation was active inside some "alternative" trade unions, including the [[All-Russian Confederation of Labour]] and ''Defence of Labour''.

VPERED published a paper under the same name. It participated in publishing trade-union magazine ''Svobodny Profsoyuz'' (''Free Trade-Union'') along with the All-Russian Confederation of Labour and left magazine ''Levaya Politika'' (''Left politics'') along with [[Boris Kagarlitsky]] and his [[Institute of Globalization and Social Movements]].

==Merger into the RSM==
In 2011, Socialist League Vpered fused with two Russian left organizations, Socialist Resistance and the Revolutionary Workers' Party. The new organization is named the [[Russian Socialist Movement]] (RSM). Within RSM was formed a ''Group of members of the Fourth International'', which has become the new Russian section of the Fourth International.

'''''The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course''''' is a 2002 Australian-American [[adventure film|adventure]] [[comedy film]] based on the [[nature documentary]] television series ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''. It stars [[Steve Irwin]] and his wife [[Terri Irwin]] and was directed by frequent Irwin collaborator [[John Stainton]]. The film was released in between the fourth and fifth seasons of the series. The film follows Steve and Terri who attempt to save a [[crocodile]] from "poachers" not knowing that the two men are actually American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) agents who are after them because the crocodile in the Irwins' possession has accidentally swallowed an important satellite tracking beacon.

The film was theatrically released on 12 July 2002 in the U.S. by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which used a crocodile in place of the usual [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] for its title credit logo sequence. The film earned $33.4 million on a $12 million budget.

==Plot==
In outer space, a United States-owned [[satellite]] blows up and one of the last remaining pieces, a beacon, is sent hurdling towards Earth where it lands in Australia, only to be swallowed by a crocodile. Back at the CIA, Agent Buckwhiler and Deputy Director Reynolds reveal that, in the wrong hands, the beacon can change the axis of power in the world, so they send two agents, Robert Wheeler and Vaughn Barcher, down to Australia to retrieve the beacon. Department Director Ansell also secretly hires an operative of his own, Jo Buckley, to go and retrieve the beacon before Wheeler and Archer, so Ansell can take Reynolds' job.

In Australia, the crocodile that swallowed the beacon lives in a river next to the house of Brozzie Drewitt, an obnoxious [[cattle station]] owner who is taking it in her own hands to kill the crocodile for preying on her cattle. Because of this, the Department of Fauna and Fisheries send one of its workers, Sam Flynn, to Drewitt's house. Sam attempts to convince Brozzie to hire some professionals to relocate the animal, instead of having her kill it, which is illegal. Despite Flynn's words, Brozzie attempts to kill the crocodile later that night, only to fail.

Meanwhile, the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin and his wife Terri are filming a [[documentary]] about the "less-lovable of Australia's [[wildlife]]" when they are hired by Flynn to relocate the crocodile that has been bothering Brozzie. Steve successfully gets the crocodile in his boat. Wheeler and Barcher are nearby using GPS technology to track the beacon. When the two agents see Steve and Terri zoom past them in their boat with the crocodile who swallowed the beacon on board, they are convinced that the Irwins have the beacon. They call up the CIA, who believe the Irwins plan to use the beacon to pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion to [[Australia Zoo]]. Steve and Terri board up the crocodile in a crate and put it in the back of the truck to drive to a new river system. Wheeler and Barcher follow them from behind in a Land Rover, and when Wheeler hops on the top of the Irwins' truck, Steve believes them to be [[poacher]]s who are after the crocodile. Steve climbs up on the roof and, after a brief fistfight, manages to knock Wheeler off the truck. When the Irwins reach the river, Steve opens the crocodile's crate and discovers that the crocodile had defecated. In the poop, Steve sees a shiny metal object (the beacon) which he mistakes to be a misproperly discarded children's spinning top toy. Steve and Terri successfully get the crocodile in the river, but Wheeler and Barcher show up again in a boat, determined to get the beacon. Jo Buckley shows up in an [[ultralight]] and throws sticks of [[dynamite]] down on Wheeler and BArcher's boat, destroying it and knocking the two agents in the river. Steve believes that he and Terri are caught up in the middle of a "poacher war" and, not wanting the dynamite to hurt the newly relocated crocodile, gets a rope out of the boat and lassoes the aircraft, causing it to crash in the river and seemingly kill Buckley. It turns out Buckley did survive and she swims to shore to inform Ansell via a phone call that she failed to retrieve the beacon. Ansell informs Buckley that he is on the run from the CIA and the police for hiring her for the mission. He is found by police and is arrested for his crimes, ending the phone call.

Due to Wheeler and Barcher's failure to retrieve the beacon, the CIA decides that it is time for drastic measures and they call up U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] in the [[White House]] to request permission to use military helicopters to fly to Australia and get the beacon.

Steve is ending his documentary by throwing the beacon in the air, when the military helicopters arrive. Steve hands them the beacon revealing that the whole predicament was a misunderstanding, and, in return, the CIA send Wheeler and Barcher to work at the zoo as volunteers. Brozzie becomes a volunteer for the Department of Fauna and Fisheries.

==Production==
Due to the series' immense popularity, director/producer Stainton had developed an idea for a feature-length ''Crocodile Hunter'' film in 1999 while shooting a documentary in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.com/articles/1167/crocodile-hunter-collision-course-the-production-notes.phtml Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course, The: Production Notes] retrieved: 31 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to make a good film, but, at the same time, make it easy for Steve who was not used to acting, believing that Irwin should only play himself. It was Stainton's idea to film Steve and Terri doing a traditional nature documentary in the [[Australian Outback]] and film these scenes in a 1:85 screen ratio. In fact, nothing for the "documentary" scenes were ever scripted, and when the actors (from the scripted dramatic scenes that use a 2:40 screen ratio) entered the Irwins' world for a few brief scenes, Steve (who did not know anything about the script or plot) was informed by Stainton what was about to happen so Irwin could prepare and ad-lib as much as he wanted or needed. [[Cheyenne Enterprises]], a film and television production company owned by  [[Bruce Willis]] and producer Arnold Rifkin showed interest in producing and helping finance the project. MGM then showed interest in distributing the film worldwide and principal photography began in November 2001, after having filmed the non-scripted documentary segments for well over a year. The Irwins came across hundreds of animals for the filming of the documentary scenes, but only a few, the kangaroo, the perentie, the bird eating spider, and two snakes made it into the film. The animals they encountered were re-written into the script by Holly Goldberg-Sloan for the dramatic scenes when Wheeler and Archer encounter the Irwins' truck.

==Film aspect ratios==
''Collision Course'' was shot in two film [[Aspect ratio (image)#Cinema terminology|aspect ratios]], 1.85:1 for the scenes with Steve and Terri and 2.35:1 for the plot about the Australian farmer and the CIA and their efforts to find the tracking drone. In theaters and on DVD, the 1.85:1 image appears with [[Pillar box (film)|pillar boxing]], a format usually reserved for 1.33:1 ratio content appearing within 1.85:1 or 2.35:1 frames.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} On the Fullscreen versions, the windowboxing (mostly in the scenes with Steve and Terri and the finale) is not present due to the fullscreen process cropping the widescreen image to the 1.33:1 ratio, causing the windowboxing borders not to be shown, even when shown on a widescreen television if the image is stretched as per fullscreen programs usually are.

==Reception==

=== Critical reaction ===
The film holds a 53% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 88 reviews.&lt;ref name=RottenTomatoesCollision&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_crocodile_hunter_collision_course_2002/?search=the%20crocodile%20hunter|title=The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course|date=12 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars, stating "You see a couple of likable people journeying through the outback, encountering dangerous critters and getting too close for comfort, while lecturing us on their habits and dangers and almost being killed by them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-crocodile-hunter-collision-course-2002|title=The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course|author=Roger Ebert|date=12 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert K. Elder of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said, "Irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free."&lt;ref name="movies.yahoo.com"&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hv&amp;id=1807879064&amp;cf=critic Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course – Movie Reviews – Yahoo Movies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Youth unemployment in Spain''' is the [[Youth unemployment|unemployment of youth]] (generally ages 15–24) and is different from the general unemployment of [[Spain]].  [[Unemployment]] describes those who actively search for work but that are without jobs.  In Spain, youth unemployment has increasingly become alarming{{To whom?|date=February 2018}}, especially in recent decades, given that the rate of youth unemployment has risen to such high levels.  Youth unemployment in Spain rose very much during and following the [[Financial Crisis of 2008]], and among [[OCDE]] nations Spain experienced the largest increase of job losses among young people.&lt;ref&gt;Scarpetta, S., A. Sonnet and T. Manfredi (2010), "Rising Youth Unemployment During The Crisis: How to Prevent Negative Long-term Consequences on a Generation?", ''OECD Social, Employment and Migration Working Papers'', No. 106, OECD Publishing, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in segmentation of the [[labor market]], the lack of effective employment policies and deficiencies in the education system have been cited as some of the principal reasons behind the significant level of youth unemployment in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, J. R. (2011). ''Desempleo juvenil en España: causas y soluciones.'' Madrid: BBVA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current statistics ==
In 2014, 57.9% of young people in Spain were unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS|title=Unemployment, youth total (% of total labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 2008 to 2014, workers younger than 35 had an average loss of [[purchasing power]] of 25.7%, more than a quarter of their income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://economia.elpais.com/economia/2017/03/08/actualidad/1488967162_939301.html|title=Tribuna {{!}} No es país para jóvenes|last=Leal|first=José Luis|date=2017-03-12|work=EL PAÍS|access-date=2017-07-16|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Spain had the highest rate of long-term youth unemployment (more than 40%) of the countries in the [[euro zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/morsy.htm|title=Finance and Development|website=Finance and Development {{!}} F&amp;D|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of 2016, the rate of unemployment among young people was 42.91%, 3.3% lower than the previous year (46.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2017-01-26/paro-juvenil-encuesta-poblacion-activa2016_1321944/|title=La tasa de paro juvenil baja 3 puntos en 2016, hasta el 42,9%, según la EPA. Noticias de Economía|work=El Confidencial|access-date=2017-07-16|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though this may been seen as a sign of improvement, it is still concerning that of the 4.23 million unemployed counted at the end of 2016, 14.5% were youth younger than 25, of which almost 46% were long-term unemployed (more than a year unemployed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/economia/2017-01-26/paro-juvenil-encuesta-poblacion-activa2016_1321944/|title=La tasa de paro juvenil baja 3 puntos en 2016, hasta el 42,9%, según la EPA. Noticias de Economía|work=El Confidencial|access-date=2017-07-16|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even though the rate of long-term youth unemployment has lowered recently, the fact that it remains high is cause for concern, since the more unemployed youth that exist, the greater the potential effects not only on themselves but on the [[Spanish economy]] as a whole.

== Causes ==
Among the general causes of why young people experience higher unemployment rates than their seniors is the fact that they generally have less work experience, less knowledge about how to find a job and fewer contacts to get jobs. Furthermore, some young people do not have the exact skills that some jobs require of them, resulting in a difficult transition from school to the [[workforce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/morsy.htm|title=Finance and Development|website=Finance and Development {{!}} F&amp;D|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are some labor practices, especially in [[Europe]], which specifically contribute to the problem of youth unemployment in the long term. Young people are more likely to work under [[Temporary work|temporary contracts]]. The benefit for companies to use such contracts is that they do not have to follow regulations that make it hard to fire full time workers. About one third of young people employed in [[advanced economies]] had temporary employment contracts before the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/morsy.htm|title=Finance and Development|website=Finance and Development {{!}} F&amp;D|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Half of the young people employed in Spain were using temporary contracts before the crisis and were among the first workers to be fired. This had the double effect of not only leaving young people out of work, but also leaving them without some of the social benefits their jobs provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/morsy.htm|title=Finance and Development|website=Finance and Development {{!}} F&amp;D|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes of the high rate of youth unemployment include leaving school early and the mismatch of [[supply and demand]] between work and education level.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, J. R. (2011). ''Desempleo juvenil en España: causas y soluciones.'' Madrid: BBVA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain suffers from a high rate of [[School dropout|school drop outs]], which is the percentage of the population between 18 and 24 years old who has not completed [[secondary education]] and who has not taken part in any technical training.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, J. R. (2011). ''Desempleo juvenil en España: causas y soluciones.'' Madrid: BBVA.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2010, Spain recorded a dropout rate of 30.6%; Only [[Malta]] (38.0%) and [[Portugal]] (34.3%) had higher rates among [[European Union]] members. In Spain, there is more concern not just for the number of dropouts, but for the fact that the rate persists and has shown little to do with the economy over the past 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, J. R. (2011). ''Desempleo juvenil en España: causas y soluciones.'' Madrid: BBVA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences and effects ==
Youth unemployment affects not only young people, but also the economy on a broader scale, specifically [[income inequality]]. As the rate of youth unemployment increased, the gap between the rich and poor in Spain widened. It is estimated that Spain has experienced the widest expansion of [[income distribution]] in Europe, as it experienced an increase in income inequality of 18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/03/morsy.htm|title=Finance and Development|website=Finance and Development {{!}} F&amp;D|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not finding work has been linked to cause other problems, such as [[social problems]] typically linked to youth. The lack of work can lead to a vicious circle of [[poverty]] and social problems among young people. On top of that, unemployment can force young people to move away or to start engaging in violence and [[juvenile delinquency]], as well as having low [[self-esteem]] and discouragement that can lead to [[addiction]] and other health problems in the future. If young people are out of work for too long, they may begin to lose their skills or stop looking for a job altogether - which means that the unemployment rate may not really be indicative of the unemployment picture in Spain.

== Recommendations ==
In order to target the high school dropout rate, some have suggested greater control and support for at-risk students. In addition, some have thought that an early warning strategy, along with mandatory participation in classes where individualized support can be provided, may possibly help students stay in school longer.

On the other hand, the measures approved by the [[Council of Ministers (Spain)|Council of Ministers]] in 2011 to lower the age of participation in the Initial Professional Qualification Programs (PCPI) to 15 years old, the greater accessibility of facilities and the extension of the programs for up to two years should encourage certain students to remain in the education system longer.

Some in Spain believe that it is necessary to encourage students to stay in the [[education system]] through policies that make their studies more attractive (both for the students themselves and for their parents). Moreover, there are attempts to reincorporate students who have left the education system.

With regard to the [[workforce]], it is believed{{By whom|date=February 2018}} that reducing segmentation, activating, and including young people with greater success will be key objectives in the future. There has also been a call to ensure that the skills of future workers remain intact while in school, in order to avoid the mismatch that exists today. Some have even suggested that the government encourage employers to help solve the problem of youth unemployment by reducing employers' [[Social security in Spain|social security]] contributions for new hires or by subsidizing firms which hire long-term unemployed youth.

In addition, in order to correct the disparity between regular and temporary workers, the government has been advised by some to reduce regulations in [[fixed-term contracts]], while increasing regulations in temporary contracts. In doing so, there would be a smaller gap between the two and employers would theoretically be less encouraged to take advantage of temporary contracts, which has been shown to have negative effects on young people.
