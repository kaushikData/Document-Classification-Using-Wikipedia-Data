'''Shri Swami Paramhans Advaitanand Ji Maharaj''' , also known as '''Shri Paramhans Dayal Ji'''(born Shri '''Ram Yaad'''), son of Shri Tulsi Das Ji Pathak, was born in Chapra, [[Bihar]], India. Shri Paramhans Dayal Ji is also known as the "First Spiritual Master" of the [[Advait Mat|Shri Paramhans Advait Mat]] lineage or Parampara. He initiated the "Second Master", [[Swarupanand|Shri Swami Swarupanand Ji Maharaj]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Swami Sar Shabdanand Ji, ''Shri Swarup Darshan'' (1998), pp. 17–59. New Delhi: Sar Shabd Mission.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born on the day of [[Rama Navami|Ram navami]] and was therefore named as "Ram Yaad ". His father was famous scholar Pandit Tulsi Pathak. His mother died a few months after his birth and he was brought up by his father's disciple Lala Narhari Prasad. Shri Narhari Prasad arranged for his education. Shri Ramyaad gained good knowledge of Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic and Pharisee which were the prominent languages of that time. At the age of five, his father Shri Tulsiram ji died.&lt;ref&gt;''Shri Paramhansa Advait Mat: A life sketch of the Illustrious Master of the Mat'' (1975), Shri Anandpur Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

Shri Ramyaad attended satsangs which used to happen at his house and which created a great impact on his mind. Paramhans Swamiji gave diksha to him and taught him about Brahma Vidya. When he was 11 years old, Narhari Prasad died and after some years wife of narhari prasad also died. He was the only rightful successor of the both families but at the age of 16, he left his home and went to the forests of Bihar for meditation. He was in Jaipur in 1883, where he met the 90 years old Swami [[Anandpuri]] ji, who taught him the [[Kriyā|Kriya]] of [[Pranayama|Pranayaam]] and [[Yoga]]. He reportedly wrote in Urdu on a paper: "Accept Paramhans Ram Yaad". He named him as his spiritual succcessor to his seat but Shri Paramhans Dayal Ji renounced the seat too. In his view, fame for a fakir was a fall from grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brahmavidyalayaashram.in/ancestry/adwaitanandji/|title=Shri Shri 1008 Shri Swami Adwaitanandji Maharaj Paramhans|last=|first=|date=|website=Brahma Vidyalaya &amp; Ashram|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shri Paramahans Dyal Ji travelled from place to place and carried the message of Sahaj Yoga, Bhakti and service unto humanity to one and all. Shri Paramhansa Dayal Ji stayed at Jaipur for a considerable time and started the work of spiritual preachings and of uplifting the people there. The number of followers there was quite large. Being a wandering monk, He covered Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, etc. to teach 'Sahajyoga' and 'Bhakti' to the people there .

The ashrams (temples) founded by Shri Paramahans Dyal Ji were called '''''Krishana Dwaras'''''. The ashrams in [[India]] with the name Advait-Swarup Ashram, Paramhans Satyarthi Dham, Shri Anandpur Satsang Ashram are also related to him and [[Advait Mat|Shri Paramhans Advait Mat]]. 

Shri Paramahans Dyal Ji attained [[Nirvana]] in July, 1919 after transferring succession of the seat to [[Swarupanand|Swami Swarupanand ji]]. He had promised to his devotee Seth Amirchand, living in Karachi that he would sacrifice his body and take Samadhi at his place. The samadhi temple of Paramhans Dyal ji is now in [[Pakistan]].The temple was damaged by extremists in 1997. The Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the provincial government to reconstruct the damaged Hindu Temple on April 4, 2015.  The Samadhi Temple of Shri Paramhans Dyal Ji has been re-constructed by Shri Anandpur Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/bihar/patna/news/BIH-PAT-HMU-gurudev-shri-paramhans-dayal-ji-maharaj-news-hindi-5379694-PHO.html|title=इस संत को पूजता था पूरा पाकिस्तान, पर अपने शहर में ही हैं अनजान|last=|first=|date=Jul 24, 2016|work=Dainik Bhaskar|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://naidunia.jagran.com/national-indian-sant-gets-his-due-respect-in-pakistan-355646|title=Indian saint wins respect in Pakistan|last=|first=|date=24 Apr 2015|work=Naidunia Jagran|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shrianandpur.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''''' is a work by [[John Locke]] concerning the foundation of human knowledge and understanding. It first appeared in 1689 (although dated 1690) with the printed title '''''An Essay Concerning Humane Understanding'''''. He describes the mind at birth as a blank slate (''[[tabula rasa]]'', although he did not use those actual words) filled later through [[experience]]. The essay was one of the principal sources of [[empiricism]] in modern philosophy, and influenced many enlightenment philosophers, such as [[David Hume]] and [[George Berkeley]].

Book I of the ''Essay'' is Locke's attempt to refute the [[rationalist]] notion of [[innate ideas]]. Book II sets out Locke's theory of ideas, including his distinction between passively acquired ''simple ideas'', such as "red," "sweet," "round," etc., and actively built ''complex ideas'', such as numbers, causes and effects, abstract ideas, ideas of substances, identity, and diversity. Locke also distinguishes between the truly existing ''primary qualities'' of bodies, like shape, motion and the arrangement of minute particles, and the ''secondary qualities'' that are "powers to produce various sensations in us"&lt;ref&gt;''Essay'', II, viii, 10&lt;/ref&gt; such as "red" and "sweet." These ''secondary qualities'', Locke claims, are dependent on the ''primary qualities''. He also offers a theory of [[personal identity]], offering a largely psychological criterion. Book III is concerned with language, and Book IV with knowledge, including [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], mathematics, [[moral philosophy]], [[natural philosophy]] ("science"), [[faith]], and [[opinion]].

==Book I==
 The main thesis is that there are "No Innate Principles", by this reasoning: &lt;blockquote&gt;If we will attentively consider new born children, we shall have little reason to think that they bring many ideas into the world with them&lt;/blockquote&gt;
and that "by degrees afterward, ideas come into their minds."&lt;ref&gt;''Essay'', I, iii, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Book I of the ''Essay'' is devoted to an attack on [[Psychological nativism|nativism]] or the doctrine of innate ideas; Locke indeed sought to rebut a prevalent view, of innate ideas, that was vehemently held by philosophers of his time. Locke allowed that some ideas are in the mind from an early age, but argued that such ideas are furnished by the senses starting in the womb: for instance, differences between colours or tastes. If we have a universal understanding of a concept like sweetness, it is not because this is an innate idea, but because we are all exposed to sweet tastes at an early age.&lt;ref&gt;''Essay'', I, ii, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Locke's fundamental arguments against innate ideas is the very fact that there is no truth to which all people attest. He took the time to argue against a number of propositions that rationalists offer as universally accepted truth, for instance the principle of [[identity (social science)|identity]], pointing out that at the very least children and idiots are often unaware of these propositions.&lt;ref&gt;''Essay'', I, iv, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipating a counter-argument, namely the use of reason to comprehend already existent innate ideas, Locke states, "by this means there will be no Difference between the Maxims of the Mathematicians, and Theorems they deduce from them: All must equally allow’d innate, they being all Discoveries made by the use of reason."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ8GPf-efLsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=All+must+equally+allow%E2%80%99d+innate,+they+being+all+Discoveries+made+by+the+use+of+reason&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjH4en5ypDdAhVRgK0KHRTTClsQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=All%20must%20equally%20allow%E2%80%99d%20innate,%20they%20being%20all%20Discoveries%20made%20by%20the%20use%20of%20reason&amp;f=false|title=An Essay concerning Human Understanding ... The fourteenth edition. [With a portrait.]|last=Locke|first=John|date=1753|publisher=S. Birt|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book II==
Whereas Book I is intended to reject the doctrine of innate ideas proposed by [[Descartes]] and the rationalists, Book II explains that every idea is derived from experience either by sensation&amp;nbsp;– direct sensory information&amp;nbsp;– or [[Human self-reflection|reflection]]&amp;nbsp;– "the perception of the operations of our own mind within us, as it is employed about the ideas it has got".

Furthermore, Book II is also a systematic argument for the existence of an intelligent being: "Thus, from the consideration of ourselves, and what we infallibly find in our own constitutions, our reason leads us to the knowledge of this certain and evident truth, that there is an eternal, most powerful, and most knowing being; which whether any one will please to call God, it matters not!"

==Book III==
Book 3 focuses on words. Locke connects words to the ideas they signify, claiming that man is unique in being able to frame sounds into distinct words and to signify ideas by those words, and then that these words are built into language.

Chapter ten in this book focuses on "Abuse of Words."  Here, Locke criticizes metaphysicians for making up new words that have no clear meaning.  He also criticizes the use of words which are not linked to clear ideas, and to those who change the criteria or meaning underlying a term.

Thus he uses a discussion of language to demonstrate sloppy thinking.  Locke followed the [[Port-Royal Logic|''Port-Royal Logique'' (1662)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnauld|first1=Antoine|last2=Nicole|first2=Pierre|title=La logique ou l'Art de penser|date=1662|publisher=Jean Guignart, Charles Savreux, &amp; Jean de Lavnay|location=Paris}}. See part 1, chapter 13, Observations importantes touchant la définition des noms.&lt;/ref&gt; in numbering among the abuses of language those that he calls "affected obscurity" in chapter 10. Locke complains that such obscurity is caused by, for example, philosophers who, to confuse their readers, invoke old terms and give them unexpected meanings or who construct new terms without clearly defining their intent. Writers may also invent such obfuscation to make themselves appear more educated or their ideas more complicated and nuanced or erudite than they actually are.

==Book IV==
This book focuses on knowledge in general – that it can be thought of as the sum of ideas and perceptions.  Locke discusses the limit of human knowledge, and whether knowledge can be said to be accurate or truthful.

Thus there is a distinction between what an individual might claim to "know", as part of a system of knowledge, and whether or not that claimed knowledge is actual.  Locke writes at the beginning of the fourth chapter, Of the Reality of Knowledge): "I doubt not my Reader by this Time may be apt to think that I have been all this while only building a Castle in the Air; and be ready to say to me, To what purpose all of this stir?  Knowledge, say you, is only the Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of our own Ideas: but who knows what those Ideas may be? ...  But of what use is all this fine Knowledge of Man's own Imaginations, to a Man that enquires after the reality of things?  It matters now that Mens Fancies are, 'tis the Knowledge of Things that is only to be priz'd; 'tis this alone gives a Value to our Reasonings, and Preference to one Man's Knowledge over another's, that is of Things as they really are, and of Dreams and Fancies."

In the last chapter of the book, Locke introduces the major classification of sciences into [[physics]], [[semiotics]], and [[ethics]].

==Reaction, response, and influence==

Many of Locke's views were sharply criticized by rationalists and empiricists alike. In 1704 the rationalist [[Gottfried Leibniz]] wrote a response to Locke's work in the form of a chapter-by-chapter rebuttal, the ''[[Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement humain]]'' ("New Essays on Human Understanding"). Leibniz was critical of a number of Locke's views in the ''Essay'', including his rejection of innate ideas, his skepticism about species classification, and the possibility that matter might think, among other things. Leibniz thought that Locke's commitment to ideas of reflection in the ''Essay'' ultimately made him incapable of escaping the nativist position or being consistent in his empiricist doctrines of the mind's passivity. The empiricist [[George Berkeley]] was equally critical of Locke's views in the ''Essay''. Berkeley's most notable criticisms of Locke were first published in ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]''. Berkeley held that Locke's conception of abstract ideas was incoherent and led to severe contradictions. He also argued that Locke's conception of material substance was unintelligible, a view which he also later advanced in the ''[[Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous]]''. At the same time, Locke's work provided crucial groundwork for future empiricists such as [[David Hume]]. [[John Wynne (bishop)|John Wynne]] published ''An Abridgment of Mr. Locke's Essay concerning the Human Understanding'', with Locke's approval, in 1696. [[Louisa Capper]] wrote ''An Abridgment of Locke's Essay concerning the Human Understanding'', published in 1811.

[[File:Ant on a rubber rope 1.5 left aligned.svg|thumb|125px|An ant steps .25 cm a second, after which the rope is stretched 1 cm.]]

The '''ant on a rubber rope''' is a [[mathematical puzzle]] with a solution that appears [[counterintuitive]] or paradoxical. It is sometimes given as a worm, or inchworm, on a rubber or elastic band, but the principles of the puzzle remain the same.

The details of the puzzle can vary,&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gardner | first = Martin | authorlink = Martin Gardner | author2 = | title = aha! Gotcha: paradoxes to puzzle and delight | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company | year = 1982 | location = | pages =  145–146 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-7167-1361-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tps"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theproblemsite.com/problems/mathhs/2002/Oct_1.asp |title=The long walk |accessdate=6 April 2008 |author=Graeme |date=1 October 2002 |work=The Problem Site | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080424121032/http://www.theproblemsite.com/problems/mathhs/2002/Oct_1.asp| archivedate= 24 April 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but a typical form is as follows:

: An ant starts to crawl along a taut rubber rope 1 km long at a speed of 1 cm per second (relative to the rubber it is crawling on). At the same time, the rope starts to stretch uniformly by 1 km per second, so that after 1 second it is 2 km long, after 2 seconds it is 3 km long, etc. Will the ant ever reach the end of the rope?

At first consideration it seems that the ant will never reach the end of the rope, but in fact it does. (In the form stated above, it would take 8.9{{e|43421}} years.) Whatever the length of the rope and the relative speeds of the ant and the stretching, providing the ant's speed and the stretching remain steady the ant will always be able to reach the end given sufficient time. Once the ant has begun moving, the rubber rope is stretching both in front of and behind the ant, conserving the proportion of the rope already walked by the ant and enabling the ant to make continual progress. This is similar to [[Zeno's_paradoxes#Achilles_and_the_tortoise|the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise]].

== A formal statement of the problem ==

The problem as stated above requires some assumptions to be made. The following fuller statement of the problem attempts to make most of those assumptions explicit.

: Consider a thin and infinitely stretchable rubber rope held taut along an &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis with a starting point marked at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and a target point marked at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

: At time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; the rope starts to stretch uniformly and smoothly in such a way that the starting point remains stationary at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; while the target point moves away from the starting point with constant speed &lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

: A small ant leaves the starting point at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; and walks steadily and smoothly along the rope towards the target point at a constant speed &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; relative to the point on the rope where the ant is at each moment.

: Will the ant reach the target point?

== Solutions of the problem ==

=== An informal reasoned solution ===

If the speed at which the target-point is receding from the starting-point is less than the speed of the ant on the rope, then it seems clear that the ant will reach the target-point (because it would eventually reach the target-point by walking along the axis, and walking along the rope can only carry it further forward).

However, though it does not seem clear at first, the ant will always reach the end of the rope, no matter the ant's speed or the speed of the rope's expansion.  This can be reasoned by the following: Assuming the typical form of the puzzle mentioned above, let the ant move at 1 cm/s. As a figurative example, let the ant cover 1/1000 of the rope after one second. In the second second, the ant moves the same distance, but the distance is smaller compared to the size of the rope (let the ratio be, for example, 1/2000). This will continue for a long time, with the ant's distance covered in a second decreasing relative to the length of the rope. That means our fraction will continue getting smaller.  However, if we add all these fractions, we will get a part of the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]], which diverges. This means that in the end, the ant will get to the end of the rope, even though it will take an exceedingly long time.

=== A discrete mathematics solution ===

Although solving the problem appears to require analytical techniques, it can actually be answered by a combinatorial argument by considering a variation in which the rope stretches suddenly and instantaneously each second rather than stretching continuously. Indeed, the problem is sometimes stated in these terms, and the following argument is a generalisation of one set out by [[Martin Gardner]], originally in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and later reprinted.&lt;ref name='aha' /&gt;

Consider a variation in which the rope stretches suddenly and instantaneously before each second, so that the target-point moves from &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=c+v&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt;, and from &lt;math&gt;x=c+v&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x=c+2v&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;, etc. Many versions of the problem have the rope stretch at the ''end'' of each second, but by having the rope stretch before each second we have disadvantaged the ant in its goal, so we can be sure that if the ant can reach the target-point in this variation then it certainly can in the original problem or indeed in variants where the rope stretches at the end of each second.

Let &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; be the proportion of the distance from the starting-point to the target-point which the ant has covered at time ''t''. So &lt;math&gt;\theta(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;. In the first second the ant travels distance &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{c+v}&lt;/math&gt; of the distance from the starting-point to the target-point (which is &lt;math&gt;c+v&lt;/math&gt; throughout the first second). When the rope stretches suddenly and instantaneously, &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; remains unchanged, because the ant moves along with the rubber where it is at that moment. So &lt;math&gt;\theta(1)=\frac{\alpha}{c+v}&lt;/math&gt;. In the next second the ant travels distance &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; again, which is &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{c+2v}&lt;/math&gt; of the distance from the starting-point to the target-point (which is &lt;math&gt;c+2v&lt;/math&gt; throughout that second). So &lt;math&gt;\theta(2)=\frac{\alpha}{c+v}+\frac{\alpha}{c+2v}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, for any &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta(n)=\frac{\alpha}{c+v}+\frac{\alpha}{c+2v}+\cdots+\frac{\alpha}{c+nv}&lt;/math&gt;.

Notice that for any &lt;math&gt;k\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{c+kv}\geqslant\frac{\alpha}{kc+kv}=\left(\frac{\alpha}{c+v}\right)\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
so we can write 
:&lt;math&gt;\theta(n)\geqslant\left(\frac{\alpha}{c+v}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. 

The term &lt;math&gt;\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a partial [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|Harmonic series]], which [[Divergent series|diverges]], so we can find &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1+\frac{1}{2}+\cdots+\frac{1}{N}\geqslant\frac{c+v}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, which means that &lt;math&gt;\theta(N)\geqslant1&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, given sufficient time, the ant will complete the journey to the target-point. This solution could be used to obtain an upper-bound for the time required, but does not give an exact answer for the time it will take.

=== An analytical solution ===

{{technical|date=September 2014}}

A key observation is that the speed of the ant at a given time &lt;math&gt;t&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is its speed relative to the rope, i.e. &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, plus the speed of the rope at the point where the ant is. The target-point moves with speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, so at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; it is at &lt;math&gt;x=c+vt&lt;/math&gt;. Other points along the rope move with proportional speed, so at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; the point on the rope at &lt;math&gt;x=X&lt;/math&gt; is moving with speed &lt;math&gt;\frac{vX}{c+vt}&lt;/math&gt;. So if we write the position of the ant at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and the speed of the ant at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;y'(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;y'(t)=\alpha+\frac{v\,y(t)}{c+vt}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a [[Linear differential equation#First order equation|first order linear differential equation]], and it can be solved with standard methods. However, to do so requires some moderately advanced calculus. A much simpler approach considers the ant's position as a proportion of the distance from the starting-point to the target-point.&lt;ref name="tps" /&gt;

Consider coordinates &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; measured along the rope with the starting-point at &lt;math&gt;\psi=0&lt;/math&gt; and the target-point at &lt;math&gt;\psi=1&lt;/math&gt;. In these coordinates, all points on the rope remain at a fixed position (in terms of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;) as the rope stretches. At time &lt;math&gt;t\geqslant0&lt;/math&gt;, a point at &lt;math&gt;x=X&lt;/math&gt; is at &lt;math&gt;\psi=\frac{X}{c+vt}&lt;/math&gt;, and a speed of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; relative to the rope in terms of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, is equivalent to a speed &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{c+vt}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;. So if we write the position of the ant in terms of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and the speed of the ant in terms of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\phi'(t)&lt;/math&gt;, we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi'(t)=\frac{\alpha}{c+vt}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\therefore\phi(t)=\int{\frac{\alpha}{c+vt}\,dt}=\frac{\alpha}{v}\ln(c+vt)+\kappa&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of integration.

Now, &lt;math&gt;\phi(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; which gives &lt;math&gt;\kappa=-\frac{\alpha}{v}\ln{c}&lt;/math&gt;,
so &lt;math&gt;\phi(t)=\frac{\alpha}{v}\ln{\left(\frac{c+vt}{c}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the ant reaches the target-point (which is at &lt;math&gt;\psi=1&lt;/math&gt;) at time &lt;math&gt;t=T&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;\phi(T)=1&lt;/math&gt; which gives us:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{v}\ln{\left(\frac{c+vT}{c}\right)}=1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\therefore T=\frac{c}{v}\left(e^{v/\alpha}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

(For the simple case of v=0, we can consider the limit &lt;math&gt; \lim_{v \rightarrow 0} T(v) &lt;/math&gt; and obtain the simple solution &lt;math&gt; T= \tfrac{c}{\alpha} &lt;/math&gt; ) As this gives a finite value &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; for all finite &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;v&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;), this means that, given sufficient time, the ant will complete the journey to the target-point. This formula can be used to find out how much time is required.

For the problem as originally stated, &lt;math&gt;c=1\,\mathrm{km}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v=1\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1\,\mathrm{cm}/\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;, which gives &lt;math&gt;T=(e^{100,000}-1)\,\mathrm{s}\,\!\approx2.8\times10^{43,429}\,\mathrm{s}&lt;/math&gt;. This is a vast timespan, even compared to the estimated [[age of the universe]], which is only about {{val|4|e=17}}s. Furthermore, the length of the rope after such a time is similarly huge, so it is only in a mathematical sense that the ant can ever reach the end of this particular rope.

==Intuition==
Regardless of the speed of the endpoint of the rope, we can always make marks on the rope so that the relative speed of any two adjacent marks is arbitrarily slow. If the rope initially is 1 km long and is stretched by 1 km per second, we can make marks that are initially 5 mm apart along the whole rope. The relative speed of any two marks is then 5 mm per second. It is obvious that an ant crawling at 1 cm per second always can get from one mark to the next, and then to the next again and so on, until it eventually reaches the end of the rope. The same reasoning works for any constant stretching speeds, ant speeds and rope lengths.

The key fact is that the ant moves together with the points of the rope when the rope is being stretched. At any given point of time we can find the proportion of the distance from the starting-point to the target-point which the ant has covered. Even if the ant stops and the rope continues to be stretched, this proportion will not decrease and will in fact remain constant as the ant travels together with the point on the rope where the ant stopped (because the rope is stretched uniformly). Therefore, if the ant moves forward this proportion is only going to increase.

If the rope is stretched with constant speed, these increments in proportion get smaller over time, but form a converging arithmetic series. If the rope is stretched with increasing speed the series is not guaranteed to be converging.{{Examples|date=December 2017}}

==Metric expansion of space==
This puzzle has a bearing on the question of whether light from distant galaxies can ever reach us given the [[metric expansion of space]]. The universe is expanding, which leads to increasing distances to other galaxies, and galaxies that are far enough away from us will have an apparent relative motion greater than the speed of light. It might seem that light leaving such a distant galaxy could never reach us.

By thinking of photons of light as ants crawling along the rubber rope of space between the galaxy and us, we can see that just as the ant can eventually reach the end of the rope, so light from distant galaxies, even some that appear to be receding at a speed greater than the speed of light, can eventually reach Earth, given sufficient time.

However, the metric expansion of space is [[Accelerated expansion|accelerating]]. An ant on a rubber rope whose expansion increases with time is not guaranteed to reach the endpoint.&lt;ref name="Scotty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/beam_me_farthest_scotty-99845|title=Beam Me The Farthest, Scotty! |accessdate=26 December 2012 |last=Koelman |first=Johannes |date=2012 | deadurl= no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406212637/http://www.science20.com/hammock_physicist/beam_me_farthest_scotty-99845 |archivedate=6 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The light from sufficiently distant galaxies may still therefore never reach Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1622">A '''Basic Limiting Principle''' ('''B.L.P.''') is a general principle that limits our explanations [[Metaphysics|metaphysically]] or [[Epistemology|epistemologically]], and which normally goes unquestioned or even unnoticed in our everyday or scientific thinking. The term was introduced by the [[philosopher]] [[C. D. Broad]] in his 1949 paper "The Relevance of Psychical research to Philosophy":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are certain limiting principles which we unhesitatingly take for granted as the framework within which all our practical activities and our scientific theories are confined.  Some of these seem to be self-evident. Others are so overwhelmingly supported by all the empirical facts which fall within the range of ordinary experience and the scientific elaborations of it (including under this heading orthodox psychology) that it hardly enters our heads to question them. Let us call these Basic Limiting Principles."&lt;ref&gt;Broad (1949)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Broad offers nine examples of B.L.P.s, including the principle that there can be no backward causation, that there can be no action at a distance, and that one cannot perceive physical events or material things directly, unmediated by sensations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2719">The '''Bierville Elegies''' ({{lang-ca|Les elegies de Bierville}}) is the most outstanding work by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] poet [[Carles Riba]]. Once Riba and his family embarked on the path of exile in [[France]] at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]], they settled first in the castle of [[Bierville (Essonne)|Bierville]] ([[Boissy-la-Rivière]]) and there, between March and July 1939, began to be created what were later to become the ''Elegies''. The work was continued between July 1939 and June 1940 in [[L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise|L'Isle-Adam]], then for eight months in [[Bordeaux]] and given final shape in [[Montpellier]], where he settled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lletra.uoc.edu/ca/obra/elegies-de-bierville-1943] Lletra, Jordi Cornudella&lt;/ref&gt; Along with ''Nabí'' by [[Josep Carner]] and ''Antigone'' by [[Salvador Espriu]], ''The Elegies of Bierville'' constitute one of the great works of modern [[Catalan literature]] and the prime postwar pieces marked by the political situation.

Written between 1939 and 1942, the ''Elegies'' were published in [[Barcelona]] after a year in an edition that bore the imprint of [[Buenos Aires]] and dated as 1942; this edition was shortened, however. In 1949 in [[Santiago, Chile]] the first complete edition of the work was published, but the distance meant that this work was unknown to the Catalan public. Finally, the complete edition came out in 1951 in Barcelona and quickly made a big impact.

In the ''Elegies'' the poet melts three very different realities, which are fostered by loneliness and lack of history of the landscape of Bierville and become almost legendary: the poet's [[Self (psychology)|self]], that of his people, and a common homeland of [[Greece]], to which the poet is now traveling, now that he is not in his own homeland. It is, in fact, a spiritual adventure, represented through a journey into the past powered by the memory, preferably with an image of the sea, which ends in the penultimate elegy in the collection, which has been considered a kind of a spiritual song, with the rediscovery of own identity and personal divinity of God and of the collectivity. This religious dimension, which until then was not present in Riba's poetry, penetrated deeply throughout his thinking, including the conception of literature. That dimension appeared again in the later poetic works as ''Savage Heart'' (''Salvatge cor'') and ''Sketch of Three Oratorios'' (''Esbós de tres oratoris'').

[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|320px|[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1786 painting ''[[Oath of the Horatii|The Oath of the Horatii]]'', illustrating a dramatic moment from [[Livy]]'s history of Rome, embodies eighteenth century ideas about '''civic virtue'''.]]
'''Civic virtue''' is the cultivation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]] important for the success of the community. Closely linked to the concept of [[citizenship]], civic [[virtue]] is often conceived as the dedication of citizens to the common welfare of their community even at the cost of their individual interests. The identification of the character traits that constitute civic virtue has been a major concern of [[political philosophy]]. The term ''civility'' refers to [[behavior]] between persons and groups that conforms to a [[society|social]] mode (that is, in accordance with the [[civil society]]), as itself being a foundational [[principle]] of society and [[law]].

==In republics==
Civic virtues have historically taught as a matter of chief concern in nations under [[republic]]an forms of government, and societies with [[cities]]. When final decisions on public matters are made by a [[monarch]], it is the ''monarch's'' virtues which influence those decisions. When a broader class of people become the decision-makers, it is then their virtues which characterize the types of decisions made. This form of decision-making is considered superior in determining what best protects the interests of the majority. [[Aristocracy|Aristocratic]] [[oligarchies]] may also develop traditions of public lists of virtues they believe appropriate in the governing class, but these virtues differ significantly from those who are generally identified under the category of civic virtue, stressing [[war|martial]] [[courage]] over [[commerce|commercial]] [[honesty]]. [[Constitution]]s became important in defining the public virtue of republics and constitutional monarchies. The earliest forms of constitutional development can be seen in late medieval Germany (see [[Communalism before 1800]]) and in the Dutch and English revolts of the 16th and 17th centuries.

===In ancient Greece and Rome===
{{Republicanism sidebar}}
{{See also|Arete (moral virtue)|Virtus (virtue)}}
In the [[classical antiquity|classical]] culture of [[Western Europe]] and those places that follow its political tradition, concern for civic virtue starts with the oldest republics of which we have extensive records, [[Athens]] and [[Rome]]. Attempting to define the virtues needed to successfully govern the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' was a matter of significant concern for [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]; a difference in civic vision ultimately was one of the [[wikt:factor|factor]]s that led to the [[trial of Socrates]] and his conflict with the Athenian [[democracy]]. The '' [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' of [[Aristotle]] viewed [[citizenship]] as consisting, not of political [[rights]], but rather of political [[duties]]. Citizens were expected to put their private lives and interests aside and serve the [[State (polity)|state]] in accordance with duties defined by law.

Rome, even more than [[ancient Greece|Greece]], produced a number of moralistic philosophers such as [[Cicero]], and moralistic [[historiography|historians]] such as [[Tacitus]], [[Sallust]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Livy]]. Many of these figures were either personally involved in power struggles that took place in the late [[Roman Republic]], or wrote elegies to [[liberty]] which was lost during their transition to the [[Roman Empire]]. They tended to blame this loss of liberty on the perceived lack of civic virtue in their contemporaries, contrasting them with idealistic examples of virtue drawn from Roman history, and even non-Roman "[[barbarian]]s".

===During the Medieval Age and the Renaissance===
Texts of antiquity became very popular by the [[Renaissance]]. Scholars tried to gather as many of them as they could find, especially in monasteries, from Constantinople, and from the Muslim world. Aided by the rediscovery of the [[virtue ethics]] and [[metaphysics]] of [[Aristotle]] by [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]], [[Thomas Aquinas]] fused [[Aristotle]]'s [[cardinal virtue]]s with [[Christianity]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' (1273).

[[Humanism|Humanists]] wanted to reinstate the ancient ideal of civic virtue through education. Instead of punishing sinners, it was believed that sin could be prevented by raising virtuous children. Living in the city became important for the elite, because people in the city are forced to behave themselves when communicating with others. A problem was that the [[Proletariat|proletarianization]] of peasants created an environment in cities where such workers were hard to control. Cities tried to keep the proletarians out or tried to civilize them by forcing them to work in poor houses. Important aspects of civic virtue were: civic conversation (listening to others, trying to reach an agreement, keeping yourself informed so you can have a relevant contribution), civilized behavior (decent clothing, accent, containing feelings and needs), work (people had to make a useful contribution to the society). Religion changed. It became more focused on individual behavior instead of a communion of people. The people who believed in civic virtue belonged to a small majority surrounded by "barbarity". Parental authority was popular, especially the authority of the monarch and the state.&lt;ref&gt;John Hale, ''The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance'' (London 1993){{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Enlightenment ===
Civic virtue was very popular during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] but it had changed dramatically. Parental authority began to wane. Freedom became popular. But people can only be free by containing their emotions in order to keep some space for others. Trying to keep proletarians out or putting them in a poor house was not done anymore. The focus was now on educating. Work was an important virtue during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the people who worked were treated with contempt by the non-working elite. The 18th century brought an end to this. The advancing rich merchants class emphasized the importance of work and contributing to society for all people including the elite. Science was popular. The government and the elites tried to change the world and humanity positively by expanding the bureaucracy. Leading thinkers thought that education and the breach of barriers would liberate everybody from stupidity and oppression. Civic conversations were held in societies and scientific journals.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Roche, ''La France des Lumières'' (Paris 1993){{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the republican revolutions of the 18th century===
Civic virtue also became a matter of public interest and discussion during the 18th century, in part because of the [[American Revolutionary War]]. An [[anecdote]] first published in 1906 has [[Benjamin Franklin]] answer a woman who asked him, "Well, Doctor, what have we got&amp;nbsp;– a Republic or a Monarchy?" He responded: "A Republic, if you can keep it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/73/1593.html 1593. Benjamin Franklin (1706–90). Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations. 1989&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current use for this quotation is to bolster with Franklin's authority the opinion that republics require the cultivation of specific political beliefs, interests, and habits among their citizens, and that if those habits are not cultivated, they are in danger of falling back into some sort of authoritarian rule, such as a monarchy.

American historian [[Gordon S. Wood]] called it a universal 18th-century assumption that, while no form of government was more beautiful than a republic, monarchies had various advantages: the pomp and circumstances surrounding them cultivated a sense that the rulers were in fact superior to the ruled and entitled to their obedience, and maintained order by their presence. By contrast, in a republic, the rulers were the servants of the public, and there could therefore be no sustained coercion from them. Laws had to be obeyed for the sake of conscience, rather than fear of the ruler's wrath.  In a monarchy, people might be restrained by force to submit their own interest to their government's. In a republic, by contrast, people must be ''persuaded'' to submit their own interests to the government, and this voluntary submission constituted the 18th century's notion of civic virtue. In the absence of such persuasion, the authority of the government would collapse, and [[tyranny]] or [[Anomie|anarchy]] were imminent.

Authority for this ideal was found once more among the classical, and especially the Roman, political authors and historians. But since the Roman writers wrote during a time when the Roman republican ideal was fading away, its forms but not its spirit or substance being preserved in the Roman Empire, the 18th-century American and [[French Revolution|French revolutionaries]] read them with a spirit to determine how the Roman republic failed, and how to avoid repeating that failure. In his ''Reflections on the Rise and Fall of the Antient Republicks'', the [[England|English]] [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Whig history|historian]] [[Edward Wortley Montagu (traveller)|Edward Wortley Montagu]] sought to describe "the principal causes of that degeneracy of manners, which reduc'd those once brave and free people into the most abject slavery." Following this reading of Roman ideals, the American revolutionary [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] envisioned a [[Sparta]]n, [[egalitarian]] society where every man was a [[soldier]] and master of his own land, and where people were "instructed from early infancy to deem themselves property of the State.... (and) were ever ready to sacrifice their concerns to her interests." The [[agrarianism]] of [[Thomas Jefferson]] represents a similar belief system; Jefferson believed that the ideal republic was composed of independent, [[rural]] [[agriculturalists]] rather than [[city|urban]] [[Tradesman|tradesmen]].

[[File:MacMonnies' Civic Virtue 1922.JPG|thumb|[[Civic Virtue (sculpture)|Civic Virtue]], 1919]]
These widely held ideals led American revolutionaries to found institutions such as the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], named after the Roman [[farmer]] and [[dictator]] [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus|Cincinnatus]], who according to Livy left his farm to lead the army of the Roman republic during a crisis, and voluntarily returned to his plow once the crisis had passed. About Cincinnatus, Livy writes:
{{quote|''Operae pretium est audire qui omnia prae diuitiis humana spernunt neque honori magno locum neque uirtuti putant esse, nisi ubi effuse afluant opes....''&lt;br&gt;(It is worth while for those who disdain all human things for money, and who suppose that there is no room either for great honor or virtue, except where wealth is found, to listen to his story.)|Livy|''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', book III.}}

===19th to mid-20th century===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2008}}
Civic virtues were especially important during the 19th and 20th century.{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} Class and profession greatly affected the virtues of the individual, and there was a general division about what the best civic virtues were. Additionally several major [[ideologies]] came into being, each with their own ideas about civic virtues.

[[Conservatism]] emphasized family values and obedience to the father and the state. [[Nationalism]] carried by masses of people made [[patriotism]] an important civic virtue. [[Liberalism]] combined republicanism with a belief in progress and liberalization based on [[capitalism]]. Civic virtues focused on individual behavior and responsibility were very important. Many liberals turned into socialists or conservatives in the end of the 19th century and early 20th century.{{According to whom|date=February 2010}} Others became social liberals, valuing capitalism with a strong government to protect the poor. A focus on agriculture and [[landed nobility]] was supplanted by a focus on industry and civil society.

An important civic virtue for [[socialist]]s was that people be conscious of oppression within society and the forces which uphold the status quo. This consciousness should result in action to change the world for the good, so that everybody can become respectful citizens in a modern society.

[[National Socialism]], the German variant of twentieth century fascism whose precepts were laid out in [[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]] [[Mein Kampf]], classified inhabitants of the ideal nation into three main hierarchical categories, each of which had different rights and duties in relation to the state: citizens, subjects, and aliens. The first category, citizens, were to possess full civic rights and responsibilities. Citizenship would be conferred only on those males of pure racial stock who had completed military service, and could be revoked at any time by the state. Only women who worked independently or who married a citizen could obtain citizenship for themselves. The second category, subjects, referred to all others who were born within the nation's boundaries who did not fit the racial criteria for citizenship. Subjects would have no voting rights, could not hold any position within the state, and possessed none of the other rights and civic responsibilities conferred on citizens. The final category, aliens, referred to those who were citizens of another state, who also had no rights:

{{Quote|text=''"The People's State will classify its population in three groups: Citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens.

The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country.

[...]The citizen has privileges which are not accorded to the alien. He is the master in the Reich. But this high honour has also its obligations. Those who show themselves without personal honour or character, or common criminals, or traitors to the fatherland, can at any time be deprived of the rights of citizenship. Therewith they become merely subjects of the State."''|sign=[[Adolf Hitler]]|source=[[Mein Kampf]] Volume II: The National Socialist Movement, Chapter III: Subjects and Citizens}}

===In later times===
[[File:Cover of McGuffey's First Eclectic Reader.jpeg|right|thumb|180px|The cover of an ''[[McGuffey Readers|Eclectic First Reader]]'' [[book]].]]
A number of institutions and organizations promote the idea of civic virtue in the older democracies. Among such organizations are the [[Boy Scouts of America]], and [[Civil Air Patrol]] whose U.S. [[oath]], Cadet Oath and Cadet Honor Code reflect a goal to foster habits aimed at serving a larger community:

Boy Scouts of America Scout Oath:
{{quote|''On my honor I will do my best&lt;br&gt;To do my duty to God and my country&lt;br&gt;and to obey the Scout Law;&lt;br&gt;To help other people at all times;&lt;br&gt;To keep myself physically strong,&lt;br&gt;mentally awake, and morally straight.''}}


Boy Scouts of America Scout Law:
{{quote|''A Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent.''}}

Cadet Oath:
{{quote|''I pledge that I will serve faithfully in the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program, and that I will attend meetings regularly, participate actively in unit activities, obey my officers, wear my uniform properly, and advance my education and training rapidly to prepare myself to be of service to my community, state and nation.''}}

Air Force Academy Cadet Honor Code:
{{quote|''We will not lie, steal, or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and live honorably (so help me God).''}}

Institutions that might be said to encourage civic virtue include the [[school]], particularly with [[social studies]] courses, and the [[prison]], namely in its [[Penology|rehabilitative]] function.

Other, later phenomena associated with the concept of civic virtue include ''[[McGuffey Readers|McGuffey's Eclectic Readers]]'', a series of [[primary education|primary school]] [[textbook]]s whose compiler, [[William Holmes McGuffey]], deliberately sought out patriotic and religious sentiments to instill these values in the children who read them. [[William Bennett]], a [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration cabinet member turned [[conservatism|conservative]] commentator, produced ''[[The Book of Virtues: A Treasury of Great Moral Stories]]'' in 1993, another [[anthology]] of literary materials that might be considered an attempt to update McGuffey's concept.

==Comparable ideas in non-Western societies==
[[Confucianism]], which specifies cultural virtues and traditions which all members of society are to observe, in particular the heads of households and those who govern, was the basis of Chinese society for more than 2000 years and is still influential in modern China. Its related concepts can be compared to the Western idea of civic virtue.

==Related concepts==
;Friendliness
:Friendliness is a [[pro-social]] set of behaviors seen in people who are pleasant, agreeable, interested in others, genial, empathetic, considerate, and helpful.  Not all civil behaviors are friendly.  For example, [[duelling]] in response to an intolerable insult has been considered a civil behavior in many cultures, but it is not a friendly action.
;[[Politeness]]
:Politeness focuses on the application of good manners or [[etiquette]].  Because politeness is informed by cultural values, there is substantial overlap between what is polite and what is civil.  However, if the action in question is not related to civic virtues, then it may be polite or rude, without strictly being considered civil or incivil.
;[[Social graces]]
:The social graces include [[deportment]], [[Gracefulness|poise]], and [[fashion]], which are unrelated to civility.
;[[Incivility]]
:Incivility is a general term for social behavior lacking in civic virtue or good [[manners]], on a scale from [[rude]]ness or lack of [[respect]] for elders, to [[vandalism]] and [[hooliganism]], through [[public intoxication|public drunkenness]] and threatening behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=incivility&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact |work=[[AskOxford]] |title=Definition of 'Incivility{{'-}} |accessdate=2006-11-25}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''incivility'' is derived from the Latin ''incivilis'', meaning "not of a citizen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Soanes |editor-first=Catherine |editor2-last=Stevenson |editor2-first=Angus |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English (revised edition) |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of "civility" as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of civic virtue or civil society. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |url=http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |work=[InDC Journal] |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5356">The '''Committee on Publication Ethics''' ('''COPE''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] whose [[mission statement|mission]] is to define best practice in the [[ethics]] of [[academic publishing|scholarly publishing]] and to assist [[editing|editor]]s, [[publishing|publishers]], etc. to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicationethics.org/resources/code-conduct COPE Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==

COPE provides advice to [[editing|editor]]s and [[publishing|publisher]]s on all aspects of publication ethics and, in particular, how to handle cases of research and publication [[misconduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521050439/http://www.medico-legalsociety.org.uk/articles/dishonesty_in_medical_research.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides a forum for its members to discuss individual cases (meeting four times a year in the UK and once a year in North America). COPE does not investigate individual cases but encourages editors to ensure that cases are investigated by the appropriate authorities (usually a [[research institute|research institution]] or [[employment|employer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wager E, Barbour V, Yentis S, Kleinert S, COPE Council.

COPE also funds [[scientific method|research]] on publication ethics, publishes a quarterly newsletter and organises annual seminars in the United Kingdom and the United States. Besides, COPE has created an [[audit]] tool for members to measure compliance with its ''Code of Conduct and Best Practice Guidelines''.

== History ==
COPE was established in 1997 by a small group of [[public health journal|medical journal]] editors in the [[United Kingdom]]. Now it has over 6000 members worldwide, from all [[list of academic disciplines|academic field]]s. Paid membership is open to editors of [[academic journal]]s and others interested in publication [[ethics]], and varies from £50 to £42,028 per year depending on the membership type.&lt;ref name="Fees"&gt;{{cite web

COPE's first guidelines were developed after discussion at the COPE meeting in April 1999 and were published as ''Guidelines on Good Publication Practice'' in the Annual Report in 1999. On their basis, in 2004, the first edition of ''Code of Conduct for Editors'' was drafted. The draft underwent wide consultation with COPE Council as well as editors and publishers. The Code was published on the first COPE website in November 2004, with an Editorial in the [[BMJ]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicationethics.org/resources/code-conduct COPE Resources: Code of Conduct]&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was later revised and improved, and other guidance was also issued to aid editors and publishers in the fight against research and publication misconduct ([[scientific misconduct]]).

== Structure ==

COPE is run by a governing Council whose members are trustees of the charity. COPE has an independent [[Ombudsman]] to adjudicate disputes between COPE members or between them and the organisation. The day-to-day running of COPE is handled by the Operations Manager and Administrator.

== Links with other organizations ==
It also has links with the [[Council of Science Editors]], the [[European Association of Science Editors]], the  [[International Society of Managing and Technical Editors]] and the World Association of Medical Editors.

The '''Committee on Standards in Public Life''' (CSPL) is an advisory [[non-departmental public body]] of the United Kingdom Government, established in 1994 to advise the Prime Minister on ethical standards of public life.

==Organisation==

The Committee on Standards in Public Life is an independent advisory [[non-departmental public body]], with a secretariat and budget provided by the [[Cabinet Office]]. It is responsible for:&lt;ref name="About the committee"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about | title=Committee on Standards in Public Life/About | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* advising the Prime Minister on ethical issues relating to standards in public life
* conducting broad inquiries into standards of conduct
* making recommendations as to changes in present arrangements
* promoting the [[#The Seven Principles of Public life|7 principles of public life]].

The Committee does not investigate individual allegations of misconduct, that being the role of the relevant regulator.
 
The Committee is made up of the chair, five independent members appointed by the Prime Minister following open competition, and three political members appointed by the Prime Minister on the recommendation of the leaders of the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party.&lt;ref name="Membership"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/membership | title=Membership | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the Committee members were [[Paul Bew|Lord Bew]] (Chair), The [[Lord Alderdice]], The Rt Hon [[Dame Margaret Beckett]] DBE MP, [[Sheila Drew Smith]] OBE, [[Patricia Moberly]], [[Richard Thomas (lawyer)|Richard Thomas]] CBE, and [[Dame Angela Watkinson]] DBE MP.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/the-committee-on-standards-in-public-life/about/membership | title=Members | accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Committee was initially established in October 1994 by the Prime Minister, [[John Major]], in response to concerns that conduct by some politicians was unethical—-for example, during the [[cash-for-questions affair]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold (2004). p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994 terms of reference===
The Committee's original terms of reference were:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-04888.pdf House of Commons Library, ''Committee on Standards in Public Life'', SN/PC/04888, 11 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|To examine current concerns about standards of conduct of all holders of [[public office]], including arrangements relating to financial and commercial activities, and make recommendations as to any changes in present arrangements which might be required to ensure the highest standards of propriety in public life.}}

The term "public office" was defined to include [[minister (government)|ministers]], civil servants and advisers; [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] and UK Members of the [[European Parliament]];&lt;ref&gt;See {{it}} [https://www.academia.edu/31457667/Libero_mandato_e_compravendita_di_parlamentari_garanzie_e_patologia_delle_immunit%C3%A0 Giampiero Buonomo, ''Libero mandato e “compravendita” di parlamentari: garanzie e patologia delle immunità'', Questione giustizia, 16 febbraio 2017, p. 4/12].&lt;/ref&gt; Members and senior officers of all non-departmental public bodies and of national health service bodies; non-ministerial office holders; members and other senior officers of other bodies discharging publicly funded functions; and elected members and senior officers of [[local authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Leopold (2004). pp. 417–418.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First report, 1995 ===
The Committee's First Report&lt;ref name="firstreport"&gt;First Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life (1995). p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1995 established ''The Seven Principles of Public Life'', also known as the "Nolan principles". They were:&lt;ref name="firstreport"/&gt;

[[Image:Daruma doll, cut out, 03.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Daruma doll]]

A {{nihongo|'''Daruma doll'''|達磨|daruma}} is a hollow, round, [[Japanese traditional dolls|Japanese traditional doll]] modeled after [[Bodhidharma]], the founder of the [[Zen]] tradition of [[Buddhism]]. These dolls, though typically red and depicting a bearded man (Bodhidharma), vary greatly in color and design depending on region and artist. Though considered a toy by some, Daruma has a design that is rich in symbolism and is regarded more as a talisman of good luck to the Japanese. Daruma dolls are seen as a symbol of perseverance and good luck, making them a popular gift of encouragement. The doll has also been commercialized by many Buddhist temples to use alongside the setting of goals.

==Use== 
{{Expand section|date=February 2018}}
When purchased, the figure's eyes are both blank white. A user will then select a goal or wish and paint in one of the figure's two eyes. Once the desired goal is achieved, the second eye is filled in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.welovedaruma.com/en/about_daruma.html|title=WE LOVE DARUMA - About Daruma Dolls|website=www.welovedaruma.com|accessdate=24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bodhidharma==
[[Image:BodhidharmaYoshitoshi1887.jpg|thumb|[[Bodhidharma]], [[Woodblock printing|woodblock]] print by [[Yoshitoshi]], 1887]]
[[Bodhidharma]] was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]] who lived during the 5th/6th century AD. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of [[Ch'an]] ([[Zen]]) to [[China]]. Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend.&lt;ref name="McRae 2003"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one tradition, Bodhidharma gained a reputation for, among other things, his practice of wall-gazing. Legend claims that he sat facing a wall in [[meditation]] for a period of nine years without moving, which caused his legs and arms to fall off from [[atrophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idChapin1946|Chapin, Helen B. "Three Early Portraits of Bodhidharma".]] p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular legend is that after falling asleep during his nine-year meditation he became angry with himself and cut off his eyelids to avoid ever falling asleep again.

==History and commercialization==
[[File:Maneki-Neko and Okiagari-Koboshi Daruma Edo Period.jpg|left|thumb|A wooden mold for a papier-mâché Maneki-Neko and Okiagari-Koboshi Daruma figure from the Edo Period, 18th century. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]
The current popular symbolism associated with Daruma as a good luck charm in part originated with the ''Daruma-dera'' (Temple of Daruma) in the city of [[Takasaki]] (Gunma Prefecture, north of Tokyo). Josef Kyburz, author of ''"Omocha": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with'', explained that the founder of Daruma-Dera would draw New Year’s charms depicting Bodhidharma. The parishioners would keep these charms to "bring happiness and prosperity and ward off accidents and misfortune".&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"&gt;[[#Reference-idKyburz1994|"Omocha": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with]] p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the Daruma figurine then originated from this region when the ninth priest, Togaku, found a solution to handle the constant requests of the parishioners for new charms. The charms were always given with an effectiveness of one year, so the people required new ones every year. He solved this by entrusting them with the making of their own Daruma charms near the beginning of the [[Meiwa]] period (1764–72). The temple made wooden block molds for the people to use. The peasants then used these molds to make three-dimensional papier-mâché charms.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKyburz1994|"Omocha": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with]] p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyburz notes that though it is unknown when the Daruma figurine combined with the [[Roly-poly toy|tumbler doll]]; the two were well recognized as synonymous by the mid-19th century. The doll quickly grew in popularity, becoming a mascot of the region. This was due greatly in part to fact that the majority of the families were silk farmers, a crop which requires a great deal of luck for success.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;

There is an annual {{nihongo|Daruma Doll Festival|達磨市|daruma-ichi}} held by the city of Takasaki in celebration of being the proclaimed birthplace of the Daruma doll. The celebration is held at the Shorinzan, the name of Takasaki's "Daruma-Dera". According to the Takasaki city website, "Over 400,000 people from all over the Kanto Plain come to buy new good-luck dolls for the year. Takasaki produces 80% of Japan's Daruma dolls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.takasaki.gunma.jp/English/TakasakiEvents.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619043922/http://www.city.takasaki.gunma.jp/English/TakasakiEvents.html|title=The City of Takasaki|archivedate=19 June 2007|website=city.takasaki.gunma.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival also features a 24-hour reading of sutras by the Shorinzan monks for world peace.

==Physical features and symbolism==
[[Image:Daruma dolls.jpg|thumb|Daruma dolls at Shōrinzan Daruma-ji, [[Takasaki, Gunma|Takasaki]], [[Japan]]]]
Daruma’s design, particularly the shape, color, eyes and facial hair, each have its own history and symbolic meaning.

===Shape===
Darumas are still usually made of papier-mâché, have a round shape, are hollow and weighted at the bottom so that they will always return to an upright position when tilted over. In Japanese, a [[roly-poly toy]] is called ''okiagari'', meaning to get up (oki) and arise (agari). This characteristic has come to symbolize the ability to have success, overcome adversity, and recover from misfortune.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt;  In Japanese popular culture on cards, banners and books, Daruma is often illustrated alongside the phrase "Nanakorobi Yaoki", translated to mean "seven times down, eight times up".

The tumbler doll style is similar to an earlier toy called the [[Okiagari Koboshi]], a little self-righting monk which was popular in the [[Kinki]] region during the mid-17th century. The original okiagari toy, however, is said to have been introduced from [[Ming China]] around 1368-1644.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idKyburz1994|"Omocha": Things to Play (Or Not to Play) with]] p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color===
[[File:Neonpink-daruma-ibaraki-japan-sept22-2015.jpg|thumb|Non-traditional neon pink Daruma dolls in [[Ibaraki prefecture|Ibaraki]].]]
Though it is not certain, the origins of Daruma's traditional red coloring probably came from the color of priest's robes. Reliable sources in English are hard to find, but one Japan-based website cites this red as being the "color of the robe of a high-ranking priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amie.or.jp/daruma/Mini%20Daruma.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230182620/http://www.amie.or.jp/daruma/Mini%20Daruma.html|title=MINI Daruma and a Tiny Encyclopedia about Daruma      ミニミニ辞典—知識散歩|archivedate=30 December 2009|website=amie.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author then concludes that "since Daruma was the founder of the Zen Sect, he must have worn a red robe." The art historian James T. Ulak has documented a history of depictions of the Bodhidharma wearing lavish red robes, prior to representations of him as a doll, in an article entitled "Japanese Works in The Art Institute of Chicago."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idUlak1993|Japanese Works in The Art Institute of Chicago: Five Recent Acquisitions]] p.178&lt;/ref&gt;

By virtue of his red robes, Daruma has come to play a role in recovering from sickness. During the late [[Edo period]] (1600s to 1868), red was believed to have a strong association to [[smallpox]]. Hartmut O. Rotermond, author of ''Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease?'', describes that in Edo and surrounding cities, there were many outbreaks of measles and smallpox. In present-day Japan, there are many red shrines dedicated to a God of Smallpox, which had a particular liking for red. These shrines were built in response to those outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idRotermund2001|Rotermund, Hartmut O. "Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease? Changing Perceptions of Smallpox in the Late Edo Period."]] p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the God of smallpox, if pleased, would spare the inflicted child, the Japanese would often stretch out ropes around the house strung with red paper strips, have the child wear a red robe, and make a small altar for the God to put talisman-like Daruma figurines on.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idRotermund2001|Rotermund, Hartmut O. "Demonic Affliction or Contagious Disease? Changing Perceptions of Smallpox in the Late Edo Period"]]. p.374&lt;/ref&gt; These precautions were also used to warn others that sickness was in the house, and to encourage cleanliness around the sick. The red of Daruma, however, was used to pacify the God, while the image of okiagari was to encourage the patient to recover as quickly as they fell ill.&lt;ref name="autogenerated15"/&gt; Daruma are also sold as a set of five colors - blue, yellow, red, white and black - called ''Goshiki Daruma''. These days, daruma can also be found in colors other than red, including gold, which is meant to bring luck in financial matters.

===Eyes===
[[Image:Daruma doll.jpg|thumb|200px|A daruma doll with one eye filled in for wishing]]
The eyes of Daruma are often blank when sold. Monte A. Greer, author of ''Daruma Eyes'', described the "oversized symmetrical round blank white eyes" as a means to keep track of goals or big tasks and motivate them to work to the finish. The recipient of the doll fills in one eye upon setting the goal, then the other upon fulfilling it. In this way, every time they see the one-eyed Daruma, they recall the goal. One explanation how this custom started says that in order to motivate Daruma-san to grant your wish, you promise to give him full sight once the goal is accomplished. This practice might also have something to do with the "enlightenment", the ideal attainment of Buddhism. This custom has led to a phrase in Japanese translated as "Both Eyes Open". Referring to "opening" the second eye, it expresses the realization of a goal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[[#Reference-idGreer2002|Greer, Monte A. "Daruma Eyes: The Sixth Century Founder of Zen Buddhism and Kung Fu Had the Earliest Recorded Graves]] p.1&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, the Daruma was purchased as a household, and that only the head of the household would paint in the eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idPunsmann1962|Punsmann, Henry. "Daruma, a Symbol of Luck"]]. p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of this are politicians during election time. Political parties have often been shown at their headquarters with large Daruma dolls and amulets purchased from local temples as a prayer for victory. This practice was highlighted in a 1967 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine: "Last week, in the Tokyo headquarters of Japan's ruling [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], Premier [[Eisaku Satō]] dipped a sumi brush into an ink stone and with swift strokes daubed in the dark right eye of his Daruma. 'The eyes,' he remarked when he had finished, 'are as big as my own.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idTime1967|"Japan: The Right Eye of Daruma". ''Time'']]. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, several groups of [[human rights]] activists described the practice of making Daruma without eyes (and the practices associated with them) as discriminatory against the blind. Some media organizations and politicians stopped showing eyeless daruma altogether to avoid negative publicity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mainichi Shimbun]], "だるまの目入れを与野党に中止申し入れ−視覚障害者団", Culture section, January 25, 2003. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facial hair===
Daruma's facial hair is a symbolic representation of the animals well known in Asian culture to embody longevity: the crane and the tortoise. The eyebrows are in the shape of a crane, while the cheek hair resembles the shell of the tortoise. A Japanese-based website states that originally, there was a snake or dragon depicted across the moustache and cheeks, but was changed to tortoise to emphasize the desire for longevity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amie.or.jp/daruma/Tsurukame.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113182313/http://www.amie.or.jp/daruma/Tsurukame.html|title=Tsurukame - Crane, Tortoise and Daruma for Good Luck   鶴亀とだるま—縁起物散歩|archivedate=13 January 2010|website=amie.or.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, Daruma was designed to match the Japanese proverb "The crane lives 1000 years, the tortoise 10,000 years".

==Daruma burning==
[[Image:Dairyuji-Gifu D01.JPG|thumb|right|Burning of the ''daruma'']]
At the end of the year, all the Daruma are brought back to the temple they were purchased from for a traditional burning ceremony.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; This ceremony, called the {{Nihongo||だるま供養|daruma kuyō}}, is held once a year, usually right after New Year's Day. The most renowned of these events are held at the [[Adachi, Tokyo#Nishiarai Daishi|Nishi-Arai Daishi Temple]] (Tokyo), and the [[Dairyū-ji (Gifu)|Dairyū-ji]] Temple (Gifu). At these events, people bring the Daruma figures they had used that year to the temple. After expressing gratitude to them, they turn it over to the temple and buy new ones for the next year. All of the old Daruma figures are burnt together in the temple. After a solemn display of the monks' entry, reading of the sutras and blowing of horns, the tens of thousands of figurines are then set aflame.

==Feminine representations==
Daruma dolls also come in the form of {{Nihongo|''Princess Daruma''|姫だるま |hime daruma}}  and {{Nihongo|''Lady Daruma''|女だるま |onna daruma}}. This contrasts greatly with traditional representations of Dharma, who, accredited as the father of many martial arts, has traditionally been depicted as very masculine with rough facial hair.&lt;ref name="mcfarland170"&gt;[[#Reference-idMcFarland1986|McFarland, H. Neill. "Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan"]] p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; H. Neill McFarland, Professor of Theology, discusses the feminine representations of Bodhidharma in his article ''Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan''. The answer to this anomaly lies in the social changes at the time, developing in the Edo Period. The class distinctions placed the merchants at the bottom, who in turn developed their own culture focusing on humor and poking fun at what those of higher class held sacred. This is evident in the depiction of Dharma as a prostitute since prostitutes displayed the same "okiagari" resilience. Famous pieces of art depicting Bodhidharma were also redrawn with a woman in his place.&lt;ref name="mcfarland170"/&gt;

With the inception of the Daruma doll, the Onna Daruma doll quickly followed. Though the aforementioned examples of feminine motifs of Daruma were satirical, the doll forms maintain the same wholesome image of a bringer of good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idMcFarland1986|McFarland, H. Neill. "Feminine Motifs in Bodhidharma Symbology in Japan"]] p. 172&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's games==
[[Image:Darumaotoshi.JPG|thumb|upright|Daruma Otoshi. The Daruma character, hammer and rainbow-colored pieces.]]
Many children's games make mention of Daruma. The Japanese equivalent of a [[snowman]] is a {{nihongo|''yukidaruma''|[[:ja:雪だるま|雪だるま]]}}, literally ''snow daruma''. [[Statues (game)#Other names|Darumasan ga Koronda]] is an equivalent to the American [[Statues (game)#Variations|Red light/Green light]] game. ''Daruma Otoshi'' is a traditional game played with a daruma doll in five pieces, usually in the colors of the rainbow, from top to bottom: head — a man's face, blue, green, yellow, red. The game is played by using a small hammer to hit each of the colored pieces, from bottom to the top, without letting the pieces fall during the game.

==Biography==
Edward Charles Francis Publius de Bono was born in [[Malta]] on 19 May 1933. Educated at [[St. Edward's College, Malta]] he then gained a medical degree from the [[University of Malta]]. Following this, he proceeded as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he gained an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in psychology and physiology. He represented Oxford in polo and set two canoeing records. He also has a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in medicine from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], an honorary DDes (Doctor of Design) from the [[RMIT University|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.rmit.edu.au/browse;ID=zbr0xu4qig8j|title=Honorary Degree Recipients|work=RMIT University|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an honorary [[Doctor of Laws|LLD]] from the [[University of Dundee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/governance/university-calendar/honorary-degrees/|title=Honorary Degrees : Academic &amp; Corporate Governance|first=University of|last=Dundee|website=University of Dundee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Bono has held faculty appointments at the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, London and Harvard.&lt;ref name=Penguin/&gt; He is a professor at [[University of Malta|Malta]], [[University of Pretoria|Pretoria]], [[University of Central England|Central England]] and [[Dublin City University]]. De Bono holds the Da Vinci Professor of Thinking chair at [[University of Advancing Technology]] in Tempe, Arizona, US.&lt;ref name="About Edward de Bono"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the 27 Ambassadors for the European Year of Creativity and Innovation 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://create2009.europa.eu/ambassadors.html European Year of Creativity and Innovation 2009 – Europa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220163726/http://create2009.europa.eu/ambassadors.html |date=20 February 2009 }}, [[Europa.eu]]. Accessed 2009-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Bono has written 57 books with translations into 34 languages.&lt;ref name=Penguin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000003100,00.html|title=Bio at Penguin books|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has taught his thinking methods to government agencies, corporate clients, organizations and individuals, privately or publicly in group sessions. He promoted the World Center for New Thinking(2004-2011), based in Malta, which applied Thinking Tools to solution and policy design on the geo-political level.

In 1976 de Bono took part in a radio debate for the BBC with British philosopher A.J. Ayer, on the subject of effective democracy.

In May 1994 he gave a half-hour ''[[Opinions (TV series)|Opinions]]'' lecture televised on [[Channel 4]] and subsequently published in ''[[The Independent]]'' as "Thinking Hats On".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/thinking-hats-on-please-in-the-first-of-three-essays-this-week-on-improving-democracy-edward-de-bono-1433203.html|title=Thinking hats on, please: In the first of three essays this week on|date=2 May 1994|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, he created the futuristic documentary film, ''[[2040: Possibilities by Edward de Bono]]'', depicting a lecture to an audience of viewers released from a [[Cryonics|cryogenic freeze]] for contemporary society in the year 2040.&lt;ref name=Penguin/&gt;

In 2005 he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Economics.

Schools from over 20 countries have included de Bono's thinking tools into their curriculum,&lt;ref name="About Edward de Bono"/&gt; and he has advised and lectured at board level at many of the world's leading corporations.

Convinced that a key way forward for humanity is better language, he published ''The Edward de Bono Code Book'' in 2000. In this book, he proposed a suite of new words based on numbers, where each number combination represents a useful idea or situation that currently does not have a single-word representation. For example, de Bono code 6/2 means "Give me my point of view and I will give you your point of view."  Such a code might be used in situations where one or both of two parties in a dispute are making insufficient effort to understand the other's perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=de Bono| first= Edward| year=2000|title=The de Bono Code Book| pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asteroid [[2541 Edebono]] discovered by [[Luboš Kohoutek]] is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_2542|title=(2541) Edebono In: Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |ISBN=978-3-540-29925-7 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_2542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ideas==
{{essay-like|section|date=September 2012}}

In 2000, de Bono advised a UK [[Foreign Office]] committee that the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] might be due, in part, to low levels of [[zinc]] found in people who eat [[unleavened bread]] (e.g. [[pita]] [[flatbread]]). De Bono argues that [[Zinc deficiency|low zinc levels]] leads to heightened aggression. He suggested shipping out jars of [[Marmite]] to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lloyd (producer)|Lloyd, J]] &amp; [[John Mitchinson (researcher)|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber &amp; Faber, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="independent-marmite"&gt;Louise Jury [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/de-bonos-marmite-plan-for-peace-in-middle-yeast-1133338.html De Bono's Marmite plan for peace in Middle Yeast], The Independent, 19 December 1999, retrieved 11 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward de Bono argued that companies could raise money just as governments now do – by printing it. He put forward the idea of private currency as a claim on products or services produced by the issuer. So IBM might issue "IBM Dollars" – theoretically redeemable for IBM equipment, but also practically tradable for other vouchers or cash. To make such a scheme work, IBM would have to learn to manage the supply of money to ensure that—with too many vouchers chasing too few goods—inflation does not destroy the value of their creations. But companies should be able to manage that trick at least as easily as governments do, particularly as they don’t have voters to cope with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yoz.com/wired/2.05/abacus.html|title=WIRED 2.05: DIY Cash|website=yoz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
The following two published critiques of de Bono's work emphasize the lack of evidence to support his proposals.
# In the ''Handbook of Creativity'', [[Robert Sternberg|Robert J. Sternberg]] writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Equally damaging to the scientific study of creativity, in our view, has been the takeover of the field, in the popular mind, by those who follow what might be referred to as a pragmatic approach. Those taking this approach have been concerned primarily with developing creativity, secondarily with understanding it, but almost not at all with testing the validity of their ideas about it. [...] Perhaps the foremost proponent of this approach is Edward De Bono, whose work on lateral thinking and other aspects of creativity has had what appears to be considerable commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J. &amp; Lubart, T. L. (1999). "The Concept of Creativity", in ed. Sternberg, R. J.: Handbook of Creativity. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
# ''Frameworks For Thinking'' is an evaluation of 42 popular thinking-frameworks conducted by a team of researchers. Regarding Edward de Bono they write, &lt;blockquote&gt;[he] is more interested in the usefulness of developing ideas than proving the reliability or efficacy of his approach. There is sparse research evidence to show that generalised improvements in thinking performance can be attributed to training in the use of CoRT [Cognitive Research Trust] or Thinking Hats tools. An early evaluation of CoRT reported significant benefits for Special Educational Needs (SEN) pupils.... However, in a more recent study with Australian aboriginal children (Ritchie and Edwards, 1996), little evidence of generalisation was found other than in the area of creative thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, D., Baumfield, V., Elliott, J., Gregson, M., Higgins, S., Miller, J., Newton, D. (2005). "De Bono's lateral and parallel thinking tools", in ed. Moseley, David: Frameworks for Thinking. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The views of de Bono on language have been challenged by some philologists (Marco Ferri, 1994) who regard his view of language as the biggest barrier to human progress as superficial. Ferri argues that a lack of human critical judgement should be held responsible for the transmission of out-of-date ideas.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Summarising de Bono's 1985 work in ''Conflicts: A Better Way to Resolve them'', M. Afzalur Rahim states: "De Bono's approach to total elimination of [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] is no different from the approaches of the classicists. This approach to dealing with conflict is completely out of tune with modern thinking and, therefore, unsatisfactory."&lt;ref&gt;

The term '''euromyth''' is used to refer to [[Half-truth|exaggerated]] or [[Disinformation|invented stories]] about the European Union and the activities of its institutions, such as purportedly nonsensical EU legislation.&lt;ref name="Stanyer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanyer |first=James |title=Modern Political Communication: Mediated Politics in Uncertain Times |url= |edition=revised |year=2007 |publisher=Polity |location= |isbn=978-0-7456-2797-7 |pages= |quote=The right-wing press regularly ridicules the EU for constructing silly and petty rules.

It also states that bananas shall be free from deformation or abnormal curvature.&lt;ref name="Consolidated text"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1994R2257:20060217:EN:PDF Consolidated text of regulation (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the provisions relating to shape apply fully only to bananas sold as ''Extra'' class; slight defects of shape (but not size) are permitted in ''Class I'' and ''Class II'' bananas.  However, a proposal banning straight bananas and other misshapen fruits was brought before the European Parliament in 2008 and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8587496.stm|title=Attempt at EU-wide 'wonky fruit and veg' ban fails|author=BBC|date=25 March 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2008, the European Commission held a preliminary vote towards repealing certain regulations relating to other fruit and vegetables (but not bananas).  According to the Commission's press release, "In this era of high prices and growing demand, it makes no sense to throw these products away or destroy them [...] It shouldn't be the EU's job to regulate these things. It is far better to leave it to market operators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEX/08/0723&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title = Outcome of Commission meeting of 23 July 2008 | accessdate=2009-10-06|author=European Commission|quote=European Union Member States yesterday held a preliminary vote on Commission proposals to repeal specific marketing standards for 26 types of fruit and vegetables. While not binding, the vote gives a strong indication that these standards will be repealed when the formal vote is taken later in the year. The Member States did not reach a qualified majority either for or against the proposal. If, after allowing time for appropriate scrutiny by our trading partners, this vote were repeated later in the year, the rules would be repealed under the Commission's responsibility. The Commission's initiative to get rid of these standards followed a declaration made last year during the reform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. It is a major element in the Commission's ongoing efforts to streamline and simplify the rules and cut red tape. The proposal would also allow Member States to exempt fruit and vegetables from specific marketing standards if they are sold with a label "products intended for processing" or equivalent wording. Such products could be either misshapen or under-sized and could for example be used by consumers for cooking or salads etc. In this era of high prices and growing demand, it makes no sense to throw these products away or destroy them. "This is a concrete example of our drive to cut red tape and I will continue to push until it goes through," said Mariann Fischer Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development. "It shouldn't be the EU's job to regulate these things. It is far better to leave it to market operators. It will also cut down on unnecessary waste and benefit consumers." The proposals would maintain specific marketing standards for 10 products which account for 75 percent of the value of EU trade: apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, lettuces, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, table grapes, tomatoes. Member States could exempt even these from the standards if they were sold in the shops with an appropriate label. They would abolish specific standards for 26 products: apricots, artichokes, asparagus, aubergines, avocadoes, beans, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflowers, cherries, courgettes, cucumbers, cultivated mushrooms, garlic, hazelnuts in shell, headed cabbage, leeks, melons, onions, peas, plums, ribbed celery, spinach, walnuts in shell, water melons, witloof/chicory, while setting new general minimum standards for the marketing of fruit and vegetables. For practical reasons, all of these changes would be implemented from 1 July 2009.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Eurosceptic sources have claimed this to be an admission that the original regulations did indeed ban undersized or misshapen fruit and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/5705717/Bent_bananas_not_a_Euromyth_after_all/|title = Bent bananas not a Euromyth after all|accessdate=2009-09-22|author=Daniel Hannan MEP|date=12 November 2008|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/euromyths/myth05_en.htm |title=Euromyths: Curved bananas |accessdate=2009-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321161425/http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/euromyths/myth05_en.htm |archivedate=21 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March 2010, a BBC article stated that there were EU shape standardisation regulations in force on: "apples, citrus fruit, kiwi fruit, lettuces, peaches and nectarines, pears, strawberries, sweet peppers, table grapes and tomatoes," and "Marketing standards for 26 types of produce had been scrapped in November 2008, following information that a fifth of produce had been rejected by shops across the EU for failing to meet the requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8587496.stm|title=Attempt at EU-wide 'wonky fruit and veg' ban fails|author=BBC|date=25 March 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Straight cucumbers ===
"The Sun" has claimed that "''Cucumbers have to be straight and must not arch more than 10mm for every 10mm of their length"''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/straight-cucumbers/|title=Straight cucumbers - European Commission|website=blogs.ec.europa.eu|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1340170/the-barmy-eu-rules-we-can-now-free-ourselves-from/|title=The barmy EU rules we can now free ourselves from|date=2016-06-25|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an accusation which is false. The EU writes: "Cucumbers do not have to be straight. There are grading rules, which were called for by representatives from the industry to enable buyers in one country to know what quality and quantity they would get when purchasing a box, unseen, from another country. Nothing is banned under these rules: they simply help to inform traders of particular specifications. The EU Single Market rules are identical to pre-existing standards set down both by the UN/OECD and the UK."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/straight-cucumbers/|title=Straight cucumbers - European Commission|website=blogs.ec.europa.eu|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurosausage===
The story of the "eurosausage" and the Commission wanting to rename the [[British banger]] an "emulsified high fat offal tube", has entered folk consciousness, despite being part of the satirical television programme ''[[Yes Prime Minister]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6481969.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eva Feder Kittay''' is an American [[philosopher]]. She is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy ([[Emeritus|Emerita]]) at [[SUNY Stony Brook]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Stony Brook University Eva feder Kittay|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/faculty_pages/kittay.html|publisher=Stony Brook University|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her primary interests include [[feminist philosophy]], [[ethics]], social and political theory, [[metaphor]], and the application of these disciplines to disability studies.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; Kittay has also attempted to bring philosophical concerns into the public spotlight, including leading [[The Women's Committee of One Hundred]] in 1995, an organization that opposed the perceived punitive nature of the social welfare reforms taking place in the United States at the time.&lt;ref name=cddc&gt;{{cite web|last=SWITALA|first=KRISTIN|title=Eva Feder Kittay|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/kittay.html|publisher=Center for Digital Discourse and Culture at Virginia Tech University|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education and career==
Kittay received her bachelor's degree from [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in 1967, and went on to receive her doctoral degree from the [[Graduate Center of the City University of New York]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/philosophy/people/faculty_pages/Eva.pdf|publisher=Stony Brook University|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After receiving her doctorate, she accepted a position as Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] for the 1978-9 year, before accepting a permanent position at [[SUNY Stony Brook]] in 1979 as Assistant Professor.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Kittay was promoted to Associate Professor in 1986, and full Professor in 1993.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  Kittay received a Distinguished Professorship from Stony Brook in 2009.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; Kittay is also a Senior Fellow at the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care, and Bioethics at Stony Brook, and a Women's Studies Associate.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In addition to these permanent positions, Kittay has accepted a  variety of temporary appointments, including ones at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and [[Newcastle University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;  She has received numerous awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship, and NEH Fellowship, and the Lebowitz Prize for philosophical achievement and contribution from the [[American Philosophical Association]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa]].  She has also been recognized for her writing on disability by the Institute Mensch, Ethiks, und Wissenshaft, The Center for Discovery and IncludeNYC. She was named Women of the Year by the [[Society for Women in Philosophy]] 2003-2004. She served as the President of the American Philosophical Association, Eastern Division, 2016-2017.

== Research areas ==
Kittay's research has focused on [[feminist philosophy]], [[ethics]], social and political theory, the philosophy of disability, [[metaphor]], and the application of these disciplines to disability studies.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;  Her viewpoints on the [[ethics of care]] are quite similar to those of [[Virginia Held]] and [[Sara Ruddick]] - namely that human interactions occur between people who are unequal yet interdependent, and that practical ethics should be fitted to life as most people experience it.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite web|last=Nancy Williams|first=Rosemarie Tong,|title=Feminist Ethics/|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kittay has also extended the work of [[John Rawls]] to address the concerns of women and the cognitively disabled.&lt;ref name=sep2&gt;{{cite web|last=McAfee|first=Noëlle|title=Feminist Political Philosophy|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-political/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developing the ethics of care, her most significant contribution has been the emphasis on the inevitable fact of human dependency and the need to incorporate such dependency and dependency work into ethical and political theories.  She has been one of the major voices in the emergent field of philosophy of disability, focusing in particular on cognitive disability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">'''Friedrich Groos''' (23 April 1768 &amp;ndash; 15 June 1852) was a German physician and [[philosopher]] born in [[Karlsruhe]].

Initially a student of law in [[Tübingen]] and [[Stuttgart]], his interest later turned to medicine. From 1792 studied medicine in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] and [[Pavia]], and following graduation became ''Stadtphysikus'' in Karlsruhe. From 1805 to 1813 he worked as a doctor in several locations, and in 1814 became a senior physician at the asylum and ''Siechenanstalt'' in [[Pforzheim]]. With the 1826 relocation of the Pforzheim mental asylum to [[Heidelberg]], he moved to the latter city, where he also gave lectures in [[psychiatry]] at the university.

Groos was the author of works in several subjects, such as [[philosophy]], [[forensic medicine]], psychiatry, et al. During a period of severe illness, he became deeply interested in [[Stoic philosophy]]. As a psychiatrist he believed that [[mental illness]] was due to spiritual as well as mental causes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4615">'''Gnosiology''' ("study of knowledge"), a term of 18th-century aesthetics, is "the philosophy of knowledge and cognition".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/gnosiology&lt;/ref&gt; The term is currently used mainly in regard to [[Eastern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;John Meyendorff ''Christ in Eastern Christian thought'' 1975 p. 77: "The classical book on Eastern Christian gnosiology is by V. Lossky, ''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church'' (London: James Clarke, 1957)".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''[[gnosis]]'' ("knowledge", γνῶσις) and ''logos'' ("word" or "discourse", λόγος). Linguistically, one might compare it to [[epistemology]], which is derived from the Greek words ''[[episteme]]'' ("certain knowledge") and ''[[logos]]''.

==Aesthetics==
[[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] (1714–1762) introduced the term "gnosiology" in conjunction with his efforts in the field of aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;''On actions, products and other topics in philosophy'' 1999 p. 183 (ed. Kazimierz Twardowski, Johannes Brandl, Jan Woleński).&lt;/ref&gt; The term "gnosiology" is not well known today, although found in Baldwin's (1906) ''Dictionary of Psychology and Philosophy.''&lt;ref&gt;William Warren ''Philosophical dimensions of personal construct psychology'' 1998 p24 "This term, gnosiology, is less well known today and a likely source for the description is Baldwin's (1906/1960) Dictionary of Psychology and Philosophy."&lt;/ref&gt; The Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) remarks that "The term Gnosiology has not, however, come into general use. (See Philosophy.)".

==Eastern Orthodox theology==
The term "gnosiology" ([[Modern Greek]]: γνωσιολογία) is used more commonly in Greek than in English. As a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept, gnosiology broadly means the theory of knowledge, which in ancient Greek philosophy was perceived as a combination of [[senses|sensory]] [[perception]] and [[intellect]] and then made into memory (called the [[mnemonic]] system). When considered in the context of [[science]], gnosiology takes on a different meaning: the study of knowledge, its origin, processes, and validity. Gnosiology being the study of types of knowledge i.e. memory (abstract knowledge derived from experimentation being "[[episteme]]" or teachable knowledge), experience [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] (or [[empiricism]]), [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] (or [[rationalism]]), scientific [[abductive reasoning]], [[contemplation]] ([[theoria]]), [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] and instinctual or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] knowledge. Gnosiology is focused on the study of the [[noesis]] and [[Nous|noetic]] components of human [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Illness and Cure of the Soul" by Metropolitan [[Hierotheos (Vlachos)|Hierotheos of Nafpaktos]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Theology's academic classification among the theoretical sciences or arts began in the 12th century in the west and is due to the shift of theology into metaphysics. Therefore, those in the East who condemn our own theology, demonstrate their Westernization, since they, essentially, condemn and reject a disfigured caricature of what they regard as theology. But what is the [[Nous|noetic]] function? In the Holy Scriptures there is, already, the distinction between the spirit of man (his ''[[nous]]'') and the intellect (the ''logos'' or mind). The spirit of man in patristics is called '''[[nous]]''' to distinguish it from the Holy Spirit. The spirit, the '''nous''', is the eye of the soul (see Matt. 6:226)." [http://www.romanity.org/mir/me01en.htm Rev. Prof. George Metallinos at University of Athens Greece]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within gnosiology, gnosis is derived by [[noesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Nicodemus the Hagiorite, The [[Philokalia]], Macmillan, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ViqQ6qYSjIC&amp;pg=PA362 p. 432]: "intellection (''noīsis''): not an abstract concept or a visual image, but the act or function of the intellect. whereby it apprehends spiritual realities in a direct manner."&lt;/ref&gt; Noesis refers to the experiences or activities of the nous. This makes the study and origin of gnosis and gnosiology the study of the intuitive and or instinctual.

Derived from an idealized traditional role for women, the [[yojijukugo|four-character phrase]] '''Good Wife, Wise Mother''' or {{Nihongo|'''Wise Wife, Good Mother'''|良妻賢母|ryōsai kenbo|{{zh|c=賢妻良母/賢母良妻|p=xián qī liáng mù/xián mù liáng qī}}|lead=yes}} was coined by [[Nakamura Masanao]] in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;See Sharon Sievers, ''Flowers in Salt: The Beginnings of a Feminist Consciousness in Modern Japan'', 1983, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

It represented the [[Ideal womanhood|ideal for womanhood]] in the [[East Asia]]n area like [[Japan]], [[China]] and [[Korea]] in the late 1800s and early 1900s and its effects continue to the modern day. Women were expected to master domestic skills such as [[sewing]] and [[cooking]], as well as develop the moral and intellectual skills to raise strong, intelligent sons for the sake of the nation.

[[Childbearing]] was considered a "[[patriotic duty]]", and although in Japan this philosophy declined after [[World War II]], feminist historians have argued it existed in Japan even as recently as the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= McLelland |first1=Mark |date=January 2010 |title= Constructing the 'Modern Couple' in Occupied Japan |journal=Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific |volume= |issue=23 |url=http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue23/mclelland.htm |issn=1440-9151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional view was similarly shared in Chinese society throughout the early 1900s, and on numerous occasions was criticized by Chinese academics such as [[Lu Xun]] and [[Zhu Ziqing]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

== China ==
Traditionally in Chinese [[Feudalism in China|feudal society]], a wife must consider her husband’s family more important than her own. This sentiment is prevalent to this day, particularly in the rural areas. The relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and the relationship between father and son is more important than the relationship between husband and wife. A wife must always be submissive to her husband, and she can never be neither offensive nor jealous. The husband has duties outside of the home and the wife has duties inside, and they do not interfere with the tasks of each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} To fulfill the role of “good wife, wise mother,” the woman must educate her children accordingly. Since Chinese families puts emphasis on prosperity, a wife should also not only be fertile, she need to produce sons and educate them so that they can succeed in the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fengxian | first1 = Wang | year = 2012 | title = The "Good Wife And Wise Mother" As A Social Discourse Of Gender | url = | journal = Chinese Studies In History | volume = 45 | issue = 4| pages = 58–70 | doi=10.2753/csh0009-4633450404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
The phrase “good wife, wise mother” appeared in the latter part of the [[Meiji period]] in the late 19th century. During World War II it was taught to promote conservative, nationalistic, and militaristic state policies and to help a developing capitalistic economy.&lt;ref&gt;Fujimura-Fanselow, Kumiko. "The Japanese Ideology of ‘Good Wives and Wise Mothers’: Trends in Contemporary Research." Gender and History 3.3 (1991): 345-349. 2 Apr 2007. Web. 21 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1890s to the end of World War II, the phrase became increasingly prevalent in mass media and higher levels of public and private girl’s schools. During the 1890s, “good wife and wise mother” was taught only in the higher levels where elite, upper-class girls attended. It was introduced to elementary schools’ curriculum when the 1911 revision of the ethics textbooks came out.&lt;ref name=Nocedo&gt;Nocedo, Ana Micaela Araújo. "The "Good Wife and Wise Mother" Pattern: Gender Differences in Today‘s Japanese Society." Crítica Contemporánea. Revista De Teoría Politica 2 (Nov 2012): 1-14. Web. 19 Nov. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were taught to fulfill this role because of [[nationalism]]. [[Empire of Japan|The Empire]] wanted to prevent Western invasion. When Western countries were making improvements in women’s social rights, such as suffrage, Japan was just beginning to confront women’s movements. Japan tried to establish the woman’s role and control new social movements through regularized education and prohibiting social and political rights.&lt;ref name=Nocedo /&gt;

== Concept ==
[[File:HabitRPG gameplay screenshot as of December 2013.png|300px|thumb|alt=Four sections on a screen, with items below each: Habits, Dailies, To-Dos, and Rewards. There is a health bar above.|A screenshot of the gameplay of Habitica as of December 16, 2013.]]
Habitica is a self-improvement web application with [[game mechanics]] overlaid to help the player keep track of and remain motivated to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifehacker.com/5976476/habitrpg-turns-better-behavior-into-a-game-of-survival|title=HabitRPG Turns Better Behavior into a Game of Survival|publisher=Lifehacker|date=January 16, 2013|author=Dachis, Adam|accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Behrens|first=Andre|title=Gamification Done Right|url=https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/gamification-done-right/|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is laid out in the form of an [[Role-playing video game|RPG]], in which the player collects items such as gold and armor to become more powerful. Rewards are achieved through maintaining real-life goals, in the form of ''Habits'', ''Dailies'' and ''To-Dos''.

=== Habits ===
In Habitica, ''Habits'' are long-term goals which are utilized to change a person's [[habit]]s.&lt;ref name="makeuseof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g33kpron"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g33kpron.com/habitrpg-gamify-your-life-because-irl-is-boring/#.UplgdWTwJ0Q|title=HabitRPG: Gamify Your Life – Because IRL Is Boring.|author=Iaccino, Laura|accessdate=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idealog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idealog.co.nz/blog/2013/10/review-habitrpg | title=App review: HabitRPG rewards your good habits | publisher=Idealog.co.nz | date=9 October 2013 | accessdate=17 December 2013 | author=Sachtleben, Amanda}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "Habits" can be set to either 'positive' or 'negative', or both. For example:
* a predefined Habit is "1h productive work". This is a positive Habit: if a user has an hour of productive work, they will gain [[experience point|experience]] and gold.
* a predefined Habit is "Eat junk food". This is a negative Habit: if a user eats junk food, they will lose [[health (gaming)|health]].
* a predefined Habit is "Take the stairs". This is a positive ''and'' a negative Habit: if a user ''does'' take the stairs, they will gain experience and gold. If they ''don't'' take the stairs, they will lose health.

If a user completes a positive Habit often, it will turn green. This signifies that they are doing a good job following their Habit. On the other hand, if a user performs a negative Habit often, it will start to turn red and do increasing damage to their health.  When players accrue enough experience points, they gain a level, which restores their health.

=== Dailies ===
Habitica uses ''Dailies'' to track habits that the user wants to complete in a known, scheduled, and repeatable fashion.&lt;ref name="makeuseof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g33kpron" /&gt; Dailies are completed by ticking a check box: the user sets their Dailies in advance, and checks off what they have completed during their day. Completed Dailies give the user experience and gold; Dailies that fail to be completed by the end of the day result in a loss of health.

=== To-Dos ===
''To-Dos'' are one-time tasks that can be added or deleted.&lt;ref name="makeuseof" /&gt;&lt;ref name="g33kpron" /&gt;&lt;ref name="idealog" /&gt; When a user completes a To-Do, they gain experience. The To-Do then disappears (it can later be found under the 'Complete' To-Dos tab). Unlike Habits and Dailies, To-Dos will never cause the user to lose health: the To-Do just becomes more valuable over time (it gives more experience and gold once completed).

== Role-playing aspect ==
A major part of Habitica is the role-playing aspect. A role-playing game is one in which a player takes on the role of another person or character. In Habitica, the user takes control of a character that they design themselves. The user can level up and unlock new features. However, upon death, various items and a level are lost.

=== Character ===
The player can customize their own character (also known as an avatar) using various customization options such as hair, skin color and shirts. The armor and swords that a player buys when equipped also provide an attribute bonus. Some of the art in Habitica is sourced from [[BrowserQuest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.habitrpg.com/post/55019151292/browserquest-hangout-thurs-7-11-7p-est |title=HabitRPG - BrowserQuest Hangout Thurs 7/11 @7p EST |first=Tyler |last=Renelle |publisher=Blog.habitrpg.com |date=2013-07-09 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Character class|class system]] is another feature adding complexity to the role-playing aspect of Habitica. Players can choose from one of four classes, each of which have different armor available, as well as different primary and secondary character attributes that affect gameplay.

=== Levels ===
Depending on how well a player completes their Habits, Dailies, and To-Dos, they either gain ''experience'' or lose "health". When a player obtains enough experience, they gain a level, but losing all their health will cause their character to die, and be set back a level. The higher the level the player is, the more features they have access to.

=== Currency ===
When a player completes a Habit, Daily, or To-Do, they gain Gold with the amount depending on the difficulty of the task. Gold can be used to buy ''rewards'' - which can either be user-defined, [[real life]] rewards, or equipment that can give boosts in-game.&lt;ref name="CustomRewards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.habitrpg.com/post/61637853952/dont-forget-custom-rewards |title=HabitRPG - Don’t Forget Custom Rewards |first=Tyler |last=Renelle |publisher=Blog.habitrpg.com |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold used to be split into Gold and Silver, with hundred Silver making up one Gold

=== Pets and mounts ===
When checking off items, sometimes the player will receive an item.  The items that can be found are eggs, color potions, and food.  The player can combine these to collect a set of 90 pets, which they can display beside their avatar, and 90 mounts, which their avatar can ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tyler |last=Renelle |url=http://vimeo.com/79172253 |title=HabitRPG Tutorial #2: Pets &amp; Mounts on Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |date=2013-11-12 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional pets and mounts can be obtained during special events and by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]].

=== Social accountability ===
Players can band together in [[Party (role-playing games)|parties]] to complete quests.  Players can also join [[Clan (video gaming)|guilds]] and participate in challenges made by other players, where the person with the most consistency in performing a task wins an [[Achievement (video gaming)|achievement]].  Players can compete with friends and strangers, as well as collaborate and focus on accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://topmobiletrends.com/habitrpg-app-turn-tasks-game/|title=HabitRPG: Turn your tasks into a game!|author=Top Mobile Trends | publisher=Top Mobile  Trends|date=18 November 2014| access-date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In parties and guilds, as well as in the community-wide Tavern, players can communicate with one another via chat.

=== Seasonal events ===
There are four seasonal events called Grand Galas that happen each year in Habitica. Past Galas have involved new quests, special items such as limited edition equipment and avatar customization options, and [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]] for the whole community to fight together. Other [[holiday]]s, such as Valentine's Day and April Fools’ Day, are also celebrated.

== Mobile application ==
[[File:Habitica Android Screenshot.png|150px|thumb|A screenshot of the Habitica Android mobile app.]]
An official [[mobile app]]lication named Habitica is available for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] operating systems. These mobile applications are replacements for the deprecated mobile apps named HabitRPG, which were released as promised after the $25,000 [[Kickstarter]] fund goal was reached.&lt;ref name="phandroid" /&gt;

== Reception ==
In reviewing the site, Alan Henry wrote for [[Lifehacker]] that "while it doesn’t offer the advanced features that many other to-do apps have, it’s certainly a blast to use, and really addictive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Alan|title=Five Best To-Do List Managers|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2014/03/five-best-to-do-list-managers-3/|publisher=[[Lifehacker]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kelsey Adams wrote for [[CNET]] that Habitica (then known as HabitRPG) 'had [her] at RPG', and describes 'how much more compelling a game can be than reality to those of us whose brains are bent that way'.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Kelsey (16 July 2014).

== History ==
Tyler Renelle originally created HabitRPG to help with his own habits, having been inspired by the self-help books ''[[The Power of Habit]]'' and ''The Now Habit''.&lt;ref name="CustomRewards"/&gt;  The earliest version of HabitRPG was a [[Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and Forms|Google Docs]] spreadsheet with color-coded cell formulae.&lt;ref&gt;Orin, Andy (29 January 2015).  [http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/01/behind-the-app-the-story-of-habitrpg/ "Behind the App:  The Story of HabitRPG."]  ''LifeHacker.com''.  Retrieved 31 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the community of HabitRPG users grew, Renelle reached out to Siena Leslie and Vicky Hsu. Leslie and Hsu became cofounders of HabitRPG, Inc., which was formally incorporated as a company in 2014.

On July 31, 2015, the website and apps were renamed to Habitica, after the land where players’ adventures take place. The change was made because some users found the name HabitRPG confusing or difficult to remember. The company name remained HabitRPG, Inc.

== Community ==
In addition to participating in the website and apps’ social aspects, the community has been involved in helping with and improving Habitica.

=== Contributors ===
Community volunteers contribute to Habitica in various ways, such as by creating pixel art, translating text, creating music and sound effects, writing blog posts to promote Habitica, editing the wiki, resolving bugs, implementing new features, and answering new users’ questions.

=== Kickstarter ===
Starting on January 11, 2013, Renelle  started a campaign on fund-raising site [[Kickstarter]] to improve development of the application with a goal of $25,000. The goal was surpassed: $41,191 was raised by a total of 2,817 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tyler |last=Renelle |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lefnire/habitrpg-mobile |title=HabitRPG by Tyler Renelle — Kickstarter |publisher=Kickstarter.com |date=|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Attachment theory]]''', originating in the work of [[John Bowlby]], is a [[psychological]], [[Adaptation|evolutionary]] and [[Ethology|ethological]] theory that provides a descriptive and explanatory framework for understanding [[interpersonal relationship]]s between human beings.

In order to formulate a comprehensive theory of the nature of early attachments, Bowlby explored a range of fields including [[evolution]] by natural selection, [[object relations theory]] ([[psychoanalysis]]), [[systems theory|control systems theory]], [[evolutionary biology]] and the fields of [[ethology]] and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="simpson"&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia|author=Simpson JA|title=Attachment Theory in Modern Evolutionary Perspective|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year = 1999|pages=115–140|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-087-6|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were some preliminary papers from 1958 onwards but the full theory is published in the trilogy ''Attachment and Loss'', 1969-&amp;nbsp;82. Although in the early days Bowlby was criticised by academic psychologists and ostracised by the psychoanalytic community,&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"&gt;{{cite journal|author = Rutter M|year=1995|title=Clinical Implications of attachment Concepts: Retrospect and Prospect|journal=Journal of Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|volume=36|pages=549–571 |pmid=7650083|issue = 4|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; attachment theory has become the dominant approach to understanding early social development and given rise to a great surge of empirical research into the formation of children's close relationships.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Schaffer R|year=2007|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher= Blackwell|isbn=0-631-21628-6 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief description of theory==
In infants, behavior associated with attachment is primarily a process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, for the purpose of survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in [[social interaction]]s with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a ''secure base'' to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships.&lt;ref name="Bretherton/Mul"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Bretherton I, Munholland KA |title= Internal Working Models in Attachment Relationships: A Construct Revisited|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|year=1999|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher= Guilford press|isbn= 1-57230-087-6|pages=89–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.

The human infant is considered by attachment theorists to have a need for a secure relationship with adult caregivers, without which normal social and emotional development will not occur. However, different relationship experiences can lead to different developmental outcomes. [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed a theory of a number of [[Attachment in children|attachment patterns]] or "styles" in infants in which distinct characteristics were identified; these were secure attachment, avoidant attachment, anxious attachment and, later, disorganized attachment. In addition to care-seeking by children, peer relationships of all ages, romantic and sexual attraction, and responses to the care needs of infants or sick or elderly adults may be construed as including some components of attachment behavior.

===Earlier theories===
A theory of attachment is a framework of ideas that attempt to explain attachment, the almost universal human tendency to prefer certain familiar companions over other people, especially when ill, injured, or distressed.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, certain social preferences, like those of parents for their children, were explained by reference to instinct, or the moral worth of the individual.&lt;ref name="fildes"&gt;{{cite book|author= Fildes V| year=1988|title=Wet nursing|location= New York|publisher= Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Aboriginer.gif|thumb|left|Father and child]] The concept of infants' emotional attachment to caregivers has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years. Most early observers focused on the anxiety displayed by infants and toddlers when threatened with separation from a familiar caregiver.&lt;ref name="fildes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deS"&gt;{{cite journal|author= de Saussure RA|year=1940|title= JB Felix Descuret|journal=Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume=2|pages=417–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories about attachment were suggested from the late nineteenth century onward.&lt;ref name="Bretherton"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|page=759|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freud]]ian theory attempted a systematic consideration of infant attachment and attributed the infant's attempts to stay near the familiar person to motivation learned through feeding experiences and gratification of [[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|libidinal drives]]. In the 1930s, the British developmentalist [[Ian Dishart Suttie|Ian Suttie]] put forward the suggestion that the child's need for affection was a primary one, not based on hunger or other physical gratifications.&lt;ref name="Suttie"&gt;{{cite book|author= Suttie I |year=1935 |title= The origins of love and hate |location= London |isbn=978-0-415-21042-3|publisher= Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory prevalent at the time of Bowlby's development of attachment theory was "dependency". This approach posited that infants were dependent on adult caregivers but that dependency was, or should be outgrown as the individual matured. Such an approach perceived attachment behaviour in older children as [[Regression (psychology)|regressive]] whereas within attachment theory older children and adults remain attached and indeed a secure attachment is associated with independent exploratory behaviour rather than dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Prior and Glaser p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Blatz]], a Canadian psychologist and teacher of Bowlby's colleague Mary Ainsworth, was among the first to stress the need for security as a normal part of personality at all ages, as well as normality of the use of others as a secure base and the importance of social relationships for other aspects of development.&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Wright M |year=1996|title= William Emet Blatz|editors=Kimble GA, Wertheimer M, Boneau CA|encyclopedia= Portraits of pioneers in psychology|volume= II|pages=199–212|location= Mahwah, NJ|publisher= Erlbaum|isbn=978-0-8058-2198-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current attachment theory focuses on social experiences in early childhood as the source of attachment in childhood and in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory was developed by Bowlby as a consequence of his dissatisfaction with existing theories of early relationships.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Cassidy J|title=The Nature of a Childs Ties|encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment:Theory, Research and Clinical Applications|veditors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |year = 1999|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1-57230-087-6|location=New York|pages=3–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early developments===
{{see also|Maternal deprivation}}
Bowlby was influenced by the beginnings of the [[Object relations theory|object relations school]] of [[psychoanalysis]] and in particular, [[Melanie Klein]], although he profoundly disagreed with the psychoanalytic belief then prevalent that saw infants' responses as relating to their internal fantasy life rather than to real life events. As Bowlby began to formulate his concept of attachment, he was influenced by case studies by Levy, Powdermaker, Lowrey, Bender and Goldfarb.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 51 quote"&gt;{{cite book|title= Maternal Care and Mental Health|year=1951|location=Geneva|publisher=World Health Organisation|quote=With monotonous regularity each put his finger on the child's inability to make relationships as being the central feature from which all other disturbances sprang, and on the history of institutionalisation or, as in the case quoted, of the child's being shifted about from one foster-mother to another as being its cause|author=Bowlby J|isbn= 1-56821-757-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the one by David Levy that associated an adopted child's lack of social emotion to her early emotional deprivation.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Levy, D| year=1935|title= American Journal of Psychiatry|volume= 94|pages=643–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby himself was interested in the role played in delinquency by poor early relationships, and explored this in a study of young thieves.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 44"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bowlby J|year=1944|title=Forty-four juvenile thieves: Their characters and home life|journal= [[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]|volume=25 |issue=19–52 |pages=107–127|quote= sometimes referred to by Bowlby's colleagues as "Ali Bowlby and the Forty Thieves"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby's contemporary [[René Spitz]] proposed that "psychotoxic" results were brought about by inappropriate experiences of early care.&lt;ref name="spitz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Spitz RA|year=1951|title=The psychogenic diseases in infancy|journal= Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 6|pages= 255–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong influence was the work of [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] who filmed the effects of separation on children in hospital. He and Bowlby collaborated in making the 1952 documentary film ''A Two-Year Old Goes to the Hospital'' illustrating the impact of loss and suffering experienced by young children separated from their primary caretakers. This film was instrumental in a campaign to alter hospital restrictions on visiting by parents.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book | author= Schwartz J | title= Cassandra's Daughter: A History of Psychoanalysis | year=1999 | page=225 |publisher= Viking/Allen Lane |isbn= 0-670-88623-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1951 monograph for the [[World Health Organization]], [[Maternal deprivation|''Maternal Care and Mental Health'']], Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that "the infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment" and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This proposition was both influential in terms of the effect on the institutional care of children, and highly controversial.&lt;ref name="WHO 62"&gt;{{cite book|contribution= Preface|title=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|series= Public Health Papers|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was limited empirical data at the time and no comprehensive theory to account for such a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1988) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{main article|Attachment theory}}
Following the publication of ''Maternal Care and Mental Health'', Bowlby sought new understanding from such fields as evolutionary biology, ethology, developmental psychology, cognitive science and control systems theory and drew upon them to formulate the innovative proposition that the mechanisms underlying an infants tie emerged as a result of evolutionary pressure.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt; He realised that he had to develop a new theory of motivation and behaviour control, built on up-to-date science rather than the outdated psychic energy model espoused by Freud.&lt;ref name="Bretherton"/&gt; Bowlby expressed himself as having made good the "deficiencies of the data and the lack of theory to link alleged cause and effect" in "Maternal Care and Mental Health" in his later work "Attachment and Loss" published between 1969 and 1980.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 86"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bowlby J|date=December 1986 |title= Citation Classic, ''Maternal Care and Mental Health''|url= http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1986/A1986F063100001.pdf|volume=50|issue= 18|publisher=Current Contents|series=Citation Classics|accessdate = 2008-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby's first official representations were carried out for the relationship theory in three very controversial lectures in 1957 by the [[British Psychoanalytical Society]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bretherton, Inge: Developmental Psychology (1992), 28, S. 759-775&lt;/ref&gt; The formal origin of attachment theory can be traced to the publication of two 1958 papers, one being Bowlby's ''The Nature of the Child's Tie to his Mother'', in which the precursory concepts of "attachment" were introduced, and [[Harry Harlow]]'s ''The Nature of Love'', based on the results of experiments which showed, approximately, that infant [[rhesus monkeys]] spent more time with soft mother-like dummies that offered no food than they did with dummies that provided a food source but were less pleasant to the touch.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 58"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | title = The nature of the child's tie to his mother | journal = Int J Psychoanal | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 350–73 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13610508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby 05"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bowlby J | title= The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds| publisher=Routledge Classics | year=2005 | isbn= 0-415-35481-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HH"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Harlow/love.htm|title= The Nature of Love| year=1958|author=Harlow H|journal=American Psychologist|volume= 13|pages= 573–685|doi=10.1037/h0047884|issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VderH"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Van der Horst FC, LeRoy HA, Van der Veer R | year = 2008 | title = "When strangers meet": John Bowlby and Harry Harlow on attachment behavior | journal = Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science | issn = 1936-3567 | volume = 42 | issue = 4 | pages = 370–388 | doi = 10.1007/s12124-008-9079-2 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/47012q360531r664/fulltext.pdf | accessdate = 2008-09-11| pmid = 18766423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby followed this up with two more papers, ''Separation Anxiety'' (1960a), and ''Grief and Mourning in Infancy and Early Childhood'' (1960b).&lt;ref name="Bowlby 60"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowlby J | title = Separation anxiety | journal = Int J Psychoanal | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 89–113 | year = 1960 | pmid = 13803480 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby 60b"&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1960|author=Bowlby J |title=Grief and mourning in infancy and early childhood |journal= The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child |volume=15 |pages=9–52|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, Bowlby's former colleague, [[Mary Ainsworth]] was completing extensive observational studies on the nature of infant attachments in [[Uganda]] with Bowlby's ethological theories in mind. Mary Ainsworth's innovative methodology and comprehensive observational studies informed much of the theory, expanded its concepts and enabled some of its tenets to be empirically tested.&lt;ref name="Bretherton2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bretherton I|title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth|year=1992|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=28|pages= 759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory was finally presented in 1969 in ''Attachment'' the first volume of the ''Attachment and Loss'' trilogy.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J|year=1969|title=Attachment|series=Attachment and loss.

====Ethology====
Bowlby's attention was first drawn to ethology when he read [[Konrad Lorenz|Lorenz]]'s 1952 publication in draft form although Lorenz had published much earlier work.&lt;ref name="lorenz 37"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lorenz KZ | year = 1937 | title = The companion in the bird's world | journal = The Auk | volume = 54 | pages = 245–273 | doi=10.2307/4078077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this he encountered the work of [[Tinbergen]],&lt;ref name="tinbergen"&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen N | title=The study of instinct |isbn=978-0-19-857722-5| year=1951 | publisher=Oxford University Press|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began to collaborate with [[Robert Hinde]].&lt;ref name="3 vans"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Van der Horst FC, Van der Veer R, Van IJzendoorn MH | year = 2007 | title = John Bowlby and ethology: An annotated interview with Robert Hinde | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development | issn = 1469-2988 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–335 | doi = 10.1080/14616730601149809 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773405215 | accessdate = 2007-11-30 | pmid = 17852051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmes p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 he stated "the time is ripe for a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests".&lt;ref name="bowlby 53"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bowlby J |title=Critical phases in the development of social responses in man and other animals |year=1953 |series=New Biology|location=London|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Lorenz and Tinbergen1.jpg|thumb|right|Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen]]

Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of "[[imprinting (psychology)#Filial imprinting|imprinting]]" and felt that it might have some parallels to human attachment. Imprinting, a behavior characteristic of some birds and a very few mammals, involves rapid learning of recognition by a young bird or animal exposed to a conspecific or an object or organism that behaves suitably. The learning is possible only within a limited age period, known as a critical period. This rapid learning and development of familiarity with an animate or inanimate object is accompanied by a tendency to stay close to the object and to follow when it moves; the young creature is said to have been imprinted on the object when this occurs. As the imprinted bird or animal reaches reproductive maturity, its courtship behavior is directed toward objects that resemble the imprinting object. Bowlby's attachment concepts later included the ideas that attachment involves learning from experience during a limited age period, and that the learning that occurs during that time influences adult behavior. However, he did not apply the imprinting concept in its entirety to human attachment, nor assume that human development was as simple as that of birds. He did, however, consider that attachment behavior was best explained as instinctive in nature, an approach that does not rule out the effect of experience, but that stresses the readiness the young child brings to social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby (1969) 2nd ed. pp. 220–223&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Lorenz's work had been done years before Bowlby formulated his ideas, and indeed some ideas characteristic of ethology were already discussed among psychoanalysts some time before the presentation of attachment theory.&lt;ref name="hartman"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hartmann H |year=1950 |title= Psychoanalysis and developmental psychology|journal= Psychoanalytic Study of the Child|volume= 5|pages= 7–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
Bowlby's view of attachment was also influenced by psychoanalytical concepts and the earlier work of psychoanalysts. In particular he was influenced by observations of young children separated from familiar caregivers, as provided during World War II by [[Anna Freud]] and her colleague Dorothy Burlingham.&lt;ref name="anna"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Freud A, Burlingham DT | title=War and children | year=1943 |isbn=978-0-8371-6942-2 | publisher=Medical War Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Es sci 1937 spainish-civil-war 02 Evacuation.jpg|thumb|left|Evacuee children in 1937]] Observations of separated children's grief by [[René Spitz]] were another important factor in the development of attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Spitz R | year=1945 | title=Hospitalism: An Inquiry into the Genesis of Psychiatric Conditions in Early Childhood}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bowlby rejected psychoanalytical explanations for early infant bonds. He rejected both Freudian "[[Drive theory (psychoanalysis)|drive-theory]]", which he called the [[Cupboard Love]] theory of relationships, and early object-relations theory as both in his view failed to see the attachment as a psychological bond in its own right rather than an instinct derived from feeding or sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes pp. 62–3&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking in terms of primary attachment and neo-darwinism, Bowlby identified as what he saw as fundamental flaws in psychoanalysis, namely the overemphasis of internal dangers at the expense of external threat, and the picture of the development of personality via linear "phases" with "[[regression (psychology)|regression]]" to fixed points accounting for psychological illness. Instead he posited that several lines of development were possible, the outcome of which depended on the interaction between the organism and the environment. In attachment this would mean that although a developing child has a propensity to form attachments, the nature of those attachments depends on the environment to which the child is exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internal working model====
The important concept of the internal working model of social relationships was adopted by Bowlby from the work of the philosopher [[Kenneth Craik]],&lt;ref name="Craik"&gt;{{cite book|author= Craik K |year=1943|title= The Nature of Explanation|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-09445-0|publisher= Cambridge University Press |issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had noted the adaptiveness of the ability of thought to predict events, and stressed the survival value of and natural selection for this ability. According to Craik, prediction occurs when a "small-scale model" consisting of brain events is used to represent not only the external environment, but the individual's own possible actions. This model allows a person to mentally try out alternatives and to use knowledge of the past in responding to the present and future. At about the same time that Bowlby was applying Craik's ideas to the study of attachment, other psychologists were using these concepts in discussion of adult perception and cognition.&lt;ref name="JLaird"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson-Laird PN |year=1983|isbn=0-674-56881-8 
|title= Mental models|location= Cambridge, MA |publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cybernetics====
The theory of control systems (cybernetics), developing during the 1930s and '40s, influenced Bowlby's thinking.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robbins P, Zacks JM | title = Attachment theory and cognitive science: commentary on Fonagy and Target | journal = J Am Psychoanal Assoc | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 457–67; discussion 493–501 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17601100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The young child's need for proximity to the attachment figure was seen as balancing [[wikt:homeostasis|homeostatically]] with the need for exploration. The actual distance maintained would be greater or less as the balance of needs changed; for example, the approach of a stranger, or an injury, would cause the child to seek proximity when a moment before he had been exploring at a distance.

===Behavioural development and attachment===
[[Behavior analysis of child development|Behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment. Such models are based on the importance of contingent relationships. Behaviour analytic models have received support from research.&lt;ref name="kassow"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kassow DZ, Dunst CJ |year=2004|title= Relationship between parental contingent-responsiveness and attachment outcomes|journal= Bridges|volume= 2|issue= 4|pages= 1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meta-analytic reviews.&lt;ref name="dunst"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dunst CJ, Kassow DZ|year=2008|title=Caregiver Sensitivity, Contingent Social Responsiveness, and Secure Infant Attachment|journal=Journal of Early and Intensive Behavioral Intervention|volume=5|issue=1|pages=40–56|url=http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org BAO|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309131808/http://www.behavior-analyst-online.org/|archivedate=2008-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments===
Although research on attachment behaviors continued after Bowlby's death in 1990, there was a period of time when attachment theory was considered to have run its course. Some authors argued that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organizing principle with varying behaviors resulting from contextual factors.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sroufe LA, Waters E |year=1977|title= Attachment as an organizational construct|journal= Child Development|volume= 48 |pages=1184–1199|doi=10.2307/1128475|jstor=1128475|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption  that attachment is expressed identically in all humans.&lt;ref name="Tronick"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Tronick EZ, Morelli GA, Ivey PK |year=1992|title=The Efe forager infant and toddler's pattern of social relationships: Multiple and simultaneous|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 28|pages=568–577|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.4.568|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent study conducted in [[Sapporo]], Behrens, et al., 2007 found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behrens KY, Hesse E, Main M | title = Mothers' attachment status as determined by the Adult Attachment Interview predicts their 6-year-olds' reunion responses: a study conducted in Japan | journal = Dev Psychol | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1553–67 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 18020832 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/43/6/1553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MainCass"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Main M, Cassidy J |year=1988|title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period|journal=  Developmental Psychology|volume= 24|pages= 415–426|doi= 10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in attachment theory continued, and the theory was later extended to adult romantic relationships by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver.&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1987"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR | title = Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | pages = 511–24 |date=March 1987 | pmid = 3572722 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511| url = http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1990|title= Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 59|pages= 270–280|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan, Shaver,1994"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hazan C, Shaver PR |year=1994|title= Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships|journal= Psychological Inquiry|volume= 5|pages= 1–22|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Fonagy]] and Mary Target have attempted to bring attachment theory and psychoanalysis into a closer relationship by way of such aspects of cognitive science as mentalization, the ability to estimate what the beliefs or intentions of another person may be.&lt;ref name="Robbins"/&gt; A "natural experiment" has permitted extensive study of attachment issues, as researchers have followed the thousands of Romanian orphans who were adopted into Western families after the end of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]'s regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by [[Michael Rutter]], has followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption and new relationships, and the physical and medical problems associated with their early lives. Studies on the Romanian adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, have in fact yielded reason for optimism. Many of the children have developed quite well, and the researchers have noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Rutter M|date=Jan–Feb 2002| title = Nature, nurture, and development: From evangelism through science toward policy and practice| journal = Child Development| issn = 0009-3920| volume = 73| issue = 1| pages = 1–21| pmid = 14717240
| doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientific studies are examining the physiological underpinnings of observable attachment style, such as vagal tone which influences capacities for intimacy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Porges S|date=2011| title = The polyvagal theory: Neurophysiological foundations of emotions, attachment, communication, self-regulation|publisher = Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt; stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar &amp; Heim, 2009),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Lupien SJ, McEwan BS, Gunnar MR, Heim C|date=2009| title = Effects of stress throughout the lifespan on the brain, behaviour and cognition| journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 10| issue = 6| pages = 434–445| doi = 10.1038/nrn2639}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as neuroendocrinology such as oxytocin,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Carter CS |date=1998| title = Neuroendocrine perspectives on social attachment and love| journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 23| issue = 8| pages = 779–818| doi=10.1016/s0306-4530(98)00055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Uvnas-Moberg K |date=1996| title = Neuroendocrinology of the mother-child interaction| journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism| volume = 7|  pages = 126–131| doi=10.1016/1043-2760(96)00036-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one.

===Effects of changing times and approaches===
Some authors have noted the connection of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The implication of this connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work.[[File:The trinity of life.png|Parents and baby|thumb|right]] This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also made it more difficult for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 152–56&lt;/ref&gt;

One focus of attachment research has been on the difficulties of children whose attachment history was poor, including those with extensive non-parental child care experiences. Concern with the effects of child care was intense during the so-called "day care wars" of the late 20th century, during which the deleterious effects of day care were stressed.&lt;ref name="belsky"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belsky J, Rovine MJ | title = Nonmaternal care in the first year of life and the security of infant-parent attachment | journal = Child Dev | volume = 59 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–67 |date=February 1988 | pmid = 3342709 | doi = 10.2307/1130397 | jstor = 1130397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a beneficial result of this controversy, training of child care professionals has come to stress attachment issues and the need for relationship-building through techniques such as assignment of a child to a specific care provider. Although only high-quality child care settings are likely to follow through on these considerations, nevertheless a larger number of infants in child care receive attachment-friendly care than was the case in the past, and emotional development of children in nonparental care may be different today than it was in the 1980s or in Bowlby's time.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 160–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, any critique of attachment theory needs to consider how the theory has connected with changes in other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to [[behaviour genetics]] and to the study of [[temperament]] (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of [[mentalization]] or [[Theory of Mind]], the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement.&lt;ref name="Fonagy et al."&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Fonagy P, Gergely G, Jurist EL, Target M |year=2002 |title=Affect regulation, mentalization, and the development of the self|location= New York|publisher=Other Press|isbn=1-59051-161-1 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.&lt;ref&gt;Mercer pp. 165–68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===1950s to the 1970s===
The [[maternal deprivation]] hypothesis, attachment theory's precursor, was enormously controversial. Ten years after the publication of the hypothesis, Ainsworth listed nine concerns that she felt were the chief points of controversy.&lt;ref name="WHO 62quote"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Ainsworth MD|year=1962|title= The effects of maternal deprivation: A review of findings and controversy in the context of research strategy|encyclopedia=Deprivation of Maternal Care: A Reassessment of its Effects|location=Geneva|publisher= World Health Organization|quote=1) The vagueness of the term "maternal deprivation" used in the description of a child's history of attachment experiences. 2) The lack of clarity of the theory's implications for experiences with multiple caregivers. 3) The implications for the theory of the degree of variability following "deprivation". 4) The question of what specific effects result from "deprivation". 5) The question of individual differences in children's reactions to separation or loss. 6) The question of the degree of permanence of specific effects of "deprivation". 7) The question of delinquency as an infrequent outcome of separation and loss. 8) The question of specifics of deprivation and whether these have to do with the caregiver or the more general environment. 9) Controversies having to do with the effects of genetic defects or of brain damage on the developmental outcome.|series= Public Health Papers|issue= No. 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ainsworth separated the three dimensions of maternal deprivation into lack of maternal care, distortion of maternal care and discontinuity of maternal care. She analysed the dozens of studies undertaken in the field and concluded that the basic assertions of the maternal deprivation hypothesis were sound although the controversy continued.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 123–24&lt;/ref&gt; As the formulation of attachment theory progressed, critics commented on empirical support for the theory and for the possible alternative explanations for results of empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 115–18&lt;/ref&gt; Wootton questioned the suggestion that early attachment history (as it would now be called) had a lifelong impact.&lt;ref name="Wootton"&gt;{{cite book|author= Wootton B|isbn=978-0-313-20339-8 
|year=1959|title=Social science and social pathology|location= London|publisher= Allen and Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 found the young relationship theory in the DDR ([[East Germany]]) by an essay of [[James Robertson (psychoanalyst)|James Robertson]] in the ''Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung'' (magazine for a medical further education) and [[Eva Schmidt-Kolmer]] carried out some journal extracts from Bowlby's essay ''Maternal Care and mental Health'' for WHO.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, J.: ''Über den Verlust mütterlicher Fürsorge in früher Kindheit.'' In: ''Zeitschrift für ärztliche Fortbildung'' 1957, 21/22&lt;/ref&gt; In the following period it came to extensive comparative development psychological in the DDR at the end of the fifties. Examinations between family-bound babies and small children, day and week hayracks-as well as Institution children. The findings could do with regard to the morbidity for the family-bound children, the physical and emotional development as well as adaption disturbances at change of environment. After the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] 1961 it didn't come to any additional publications in the DDR Relationship theory and comparative investigations with family-bound children. The previous ones Research results weren't published further and got like the relationship theory into oblivion in the DDR in the subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fhpotsdam/frontdoor/index/index/docId/226 Plückhahn, Jens: ''Dauerheime für Säuglinge und Kleinkinder in der DDR aus dem Blickwinkel der Bindungstheorie''.

In the 1970s, problems with the emphasis on attachment as a trait (a stable characteristic of an individual) rather than as a type of behaviour with important organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to consider that "attachment (as implying anything but infant-adult interaction) [may be said to have] outlived its usefulness as a developmental construct..." and that attachment behaviours were best understood in terms of their functions in the child's life.&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"/&gt; Children may achieve a given function, such as a sense of security, in many different ways and the various but functionally comparable behaviours should be categorized as related to each other. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept (the organisation of exploration of an unfamiliar situation around returns to a familiar person) as "central to the logic and coherence of attachment theory and to its status as an organizational construct."&lt;ref name="WatCum"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Cummings EM | title = A secure base from which to explore close relationships | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 164–72 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836570 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00130| url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0009-3920&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Thompson pointed out that "other features of early parent-child relationships that develop concurrently with attachment security, including negotiating conflict and establishing cooperation, also must be considered in understanding the legacy of early attachments."&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson RA | title = The legacy of early attachments | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 145–52 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10836568 |url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0009-3920&amp;date=2000&amp;volume=71&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=145 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific disciplines===

====Psychoanalysis====
From an early point in the development of attachment theory, there was criticism of the theory's lack of congruence with the various branches of psychoanalysis. Like other members of the [[Object relations theory|British object-relations]] group, Bowlby rejected [[Melanie Klein]]'s views that considered the infant to have certain mental capacities at birth and to continue to develop emotionally on the basis of fantasy rather than of real experiences. But Bowlby also withdrew from the object-relations approach (exemplified, for example, by Anna Freud), as he abandoned the "drive theory" assumptions in favor of a set of automatic, instinctual behaviour systems that included attachment. Bowlby's decisions left him open to criticism from well-established thinkers working on problems similar to those he addressed.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year=1998|title= Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 92–119|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cass 98"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Cassidy J|year=1998|title=Commentary on Steele and Steele: Attachment and object relations theories and the concept of independent behavioral systems|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages= 120–26|doi= 10.1111/1467-9507.00054}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele 98"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Steele H, Steele M |year= 1998|title= Debate: Attachment and psychoanalysis: Time for a reunion|journal= Social Development|volume= 7|issue=1|pages=92–119 |doi=10.1111/1467-9507.00053}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowlby was effectively ostracized from the psychoanalytic community.&lt;ref name="Rutter 95"/&gt; More recently some psychoanalysts have sought to reconcile the two theories in the form of [[attachment-based psychotherapy]], a therapeutic approach.

====Ethology====
Ethologists expressed concern about the adequacy of some of the research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalisation to humans from animal studies.&lt;ref name="crnic"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Crnic LS, Reite ML, Shucard DW |year=1982|title= Animal models of human behavior: Their application to the study of attachment|veditors=Emde RN, Harmon RJ |isbn=978-0-306-40849-6 |encyclopedia= The development of attachment and affiliative systems|pages=31–42|location= New york|publisher= Plenum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brann"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Brannigan CR, Humphries DA |year=1972|title= Human non-verbal behaviour: A means of communication|editor=Blurton-Jones N|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages= 37–64|publisher= Cambridge University Press|quote=...it must be emphasized that data derived from species other than man can be used only to ''suggest'' hypotheses that may be worth applying to man for testing by critical observations. In the absence of critical evidence derived from observing man such hypotheses are no more than intelligent guesses. There is a danger in human ethology... that interesting, but untested, hypotheses may gain the status of accepted theory. [One author] has coined the term 'ethologism' as a label for the present vogue [in 1970]... for uncritically invoking the findings from ethological studies of other species as necessary and sufficient explanations... Theory based on superficial analogies between species has always impeded biological understanding... We conclude that a valid ethology of man must be based primarily on data derived from man, and not on data obtained from fish, birds, or other primates}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that these concepts as used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself.&lt;ref name="schur"&gt;{{cite journal |quote=Bowlby...assumes the fully innate, unlearned character of most complex behavior patterns...(whereas recent animal studies showed)...both the early impact of learning and the great intricacy of the interaction between mother and litter"...(and applies)..."to human behavior an instinct concept which neglects the factor of development and learning far beyond even the position taken by Lorenz [the ethological theorist] in his early propositions| author = Schur M | title = Discussion of Dr. John Bowlby's paper | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 15 |pages = 63–84 | year = 1960 | pmid = 13749000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Szymon i Krystian 003.JPG|thumb|right|Ready to explore]]
Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment, and offered alternative approaches. For example, crying on separation from a familiar person was suggested as an index of attachment.&lt;ref name="SchafEm"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schaffer HR, Emerson PE |year=1964|title= The development of social attachment in infancy|journal= Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, serial no. 94|volume=29|issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observational studies of young children in natural settings also provided behaviours that might be considered to indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects and bringing them to the mother, but usually not other adults.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author= Anderson JW|year=1972|title= Attachment behaviour out of doors|editor= Blurton-Jones N|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages=199–216|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ethological work tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, work like that just described led to the conclusion that "[w]e appear to disagree with Bowlby and Ainsworth on some of the details of the child's interactions with its mother and other people". Some ethologists pressed for further observational data, arguing that psychologists "are still writing as if there is a real entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures."&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|vauthors=Jones NB, Leach GM |year=1972|title= Behaviour of children and their mothers at separation and greeting|isbn=978-0-521-09855-7 |editor=Blurton-Jones N |encyclopedia= Ethological studies of child behaviour|pages= 217–48|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Hinde]] expressed concern with the use of the word "attachment" to imply that it was an intervening variable or a hypothesised internal mechanism rather than a data term. He suggested that confusion about the meaning of attachment theory terms "could lead to the 'instinct fallacy' of postulating a mechanism [[Wikt:isomorphisms|isomorphous]] with the behaviours, and then using that as an explanation for the behaviour". However, Hinde considered "attachment behaviour system" to be an appropriate term of theory language which did not offer the same problems "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour."&lt;ref name="Hinde 82"&gt;{{cite book|author= Hinde R|year=1982|isbn=978-0-00-686034-1|title= Ethology|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive development====
Bowlby's reliance on [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s theory of cognitive development gave rise to questions about object permanence (the ability to remember an object that is temporarily absent) and its connection to early attachment behaviours, and about the fact that the infant's ability to discriminate strangers and react to the mother's absence seems to occur some months earlier than Piaget suggested would be cognitively possible.&lt;ref name="fraiberg"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fraiberg S | title = Libidinal object constancy and mental representation | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 24 |pages = 9–47 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5353377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, it has been noted that the understanding of mental representation has advanced so much since Bowlby's day that present views can be far more specific than those of Bowlby's time.&lt;ref name="waters2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters HS, Waters E | title = The attachment working models concept: among other things, we build script-like representations of secure base experiences | journal = Attachment &amp; Human Development | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 185–97 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16938702 | doi = 10.1080/14616730600856016 | url = http://www.informaworld.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;doi=10.1080/14616730600856016&amp;magic=pubmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Behaviourism====
In 1969, Gerwitz discussed how mother and child could provide each other with [[positive reinforcement]] experiences through their mutual attention and therefore learn to stay close together; this explanation would make it unnecessary to posit innate human characteristics fostering attachment.&lt;ref name="Gewirtz"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Gewirtz N|year=1969|title=Potency of a social reinforcer as a function of satiation and recovery|journal= Developmental Psychology|volume= 1|pages= 2–13|doi= 10.1037/h0026802}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behaviourism|Learning theory]] saw attachment as a remnant of dependency and the quality of attachment as merely a response to the caregivers cues. [[Behaviourism|Behaviourists]] saw behaviours such as crying as a random activity that meant nothing until reinforced by a caregivers response therefore frequent responses would result in more crying. To attachment theorists, crying is an inborn attachment behaviour to which the caregiver must respond if the infant is to develop emotional security. Conscientious responses produce security which enhances autonomy and results in less crying. Ainsworth's research in Baltimore supported the attachment theorists view.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 166–73&lt;/ref&gt; In the last decade, [[Behavior analysis of child development|behaviour analysts]] have constructed models of attachment based on the importance of contingent relationships. These behaviour analytic models have received some support from research&lt;ref name="kassow"/&gt; and meta-analytic reviews.&lt;ref name="dunst"/&gt;

===Methodology===
There has been critical discussion of conclusions drawn from clinical and observational work, and whether or not they actually support tenets of attachment theory. For example, Skuse based criticism of a basic tenet of attachment theory on the work of Anna Freud with children from Theresienstadt, who apparently developed relatively normally in spite of serious deprivation during their early years. This discussion concluded from Freud's case and from some other studies of extreme deprivation that there is an excellent prognosis for children with this background, unless there are biological or genetic risk factors.&lt;ref name="Skuse"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Skuse D | title = Extreme deprivation in early childhood--II. Theoretical issues and a comparative review | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = 543–72 |date=October 1984 | pmid = 6480730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.1984.tb00172.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalyst Margaret Mahler interpreted ambivalent or aggressive behaviour of toddlers toward their mothers as a normal part of development, not as evidence of poor attachment history.&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mahler MS | title = A study of the separation-individuation process and its possible application to borderline phenomena in the psychoanalytic situation | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 403–24 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5163236 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:ParentsDaughterAug1931.jpg|thumb|left|Parents and child]]

Some of Bowlby's interpretations of the data reported by James Robertson were eventually rejected by the researcher, who reported data from 13 young children who were cared for in ideal circumstances during separation from their mothers. Robertson noted, "...Bowlby acknowledges that he draws mainly upon James Robertson's institutional data. But in developing his grief and mourning theory, Bowlby, without adducing non-institutional data, has generalized Robertson's concept of protest, despair and denial beyond the context from which it was derived. He asserts that these are the usual responses of young children to separation from the mother regardless of circumstance..."; however, of the 13 separated children who received good care, none showed protest and despair, but "coped with separation from the mother when cared for in conditions from which the adverse factors which complicate institutional studies were absent".&lt;ref name="robertson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robertson J, Robertson J | title = Young children in brief separation. A fresh look | journal = Psychoanalytic Study of the Child | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 264–315 | year = 1971 | pmid = 5163230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second volume of the trilogy, ''Separation'', published two years later, Bowlby acknowledged that Robertsons foster study had caused him to modify his views on the traumatic consequences of separation in which insufficient weight was given to the influence of skilled care from a familiar substitute.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have questioned the idea of attachment patterns, thought to be measured by techniques like the Strange Situation Protocol. Such techniques yield a taxonomy of categories considered to represent qualitative difference in attachment relationships (for example, secure attachment versus avoidant). However, a categorical model is not necessarily the best representation of individual difference in attachment. An examination of data from 1139 15-month-olds showed that variation was continuous rather than falling into natural groupings.&lt;ref name="FraSpe2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fraley RC, Spieker SJ | title = Are infant attachment patterns continuously or categorically distributed? A taxometric analysis of strange situation behavior | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 387–404 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12760508| url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/39/3/387 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.39.3.387}}&lt;/ref&gt; This criticism introduces important questions for attachment typologies and the mechanisms behind apparent types, but in fact has relatively little relevance for attachment theory itself, which "neither requires nor predicts discrete patterns of attachment."&lt;ref name="WatBea"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Waters E, Beauchaine TP | title = Are there really patterns of attachment? Comment on Fraley and Spieker (2003) | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–22; discussion 423–9 |date=May 2003 | pmid = 12760512 |url = http://content.apa.org/journals/dev/39/3/417 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.39.3.417}}&lt;/ref&gt; As was noted above, ethologists have suggested other behavioural measures that may be of greater importance than Strange Situation behaviour.[[File:Khmerchildren.jpg|thumb|right|Children]]

===1980s on===
Following the argument made in the 1970s that attachment should not be seen as a trait (lasting characteristic of the individual), but instead should be regarded as an organising principle with varying behaviours resulting from contextual factors,&lt;ref name="Sroufe, Waters, 1977"/&gt; later research looked at cross-cultural differences in attachment, and concluded that there should be re-evaluation of the assumption  that attachment is expressed identically in all humans.&lt;ref name="Tronick"/&gt; Various studies appeared to show cultural differences but a 2007 study conducted in [[Sapporo]] in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Behrens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MainCass"/&gt;

Recent critics such as [[Judith Rich Harris|J. R. Harris]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Jerome Kagan]] are generally concerned with the concept of infant determinism ([[Nature versus nurture]]) and stress the possible effects of later experience on personality.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Nurture Assumption]]: Why Children Turn Out the Way They Do|isbn=978-0-684-84409-1 |author=Harris JR|year=1998|location=New York|publisher=Free press |authorlink=Judith Rich Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-14-027605-3 
|author=Pinker S|title=[[The Blank Slate]]: The Modern Denial of Human Nature| publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|year=2002 |authorlink=Steven Pinker}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kagan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kagan J|year=1994|isbn=978-0-674-89033-6 |title=Three Seductive Ideas|location= Cambridge, MA|publisher= Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building on the earlier work on [[temperament]] of [[Stella Chess]], Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory [[etiology]] was based, arguing that heredity was far more important than the transient effects of early environment, for example a child with an inherent difficult temperament would not illicit sensitive behavioural responses from their care giver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Karen pp. 248–64&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has not bourne out  Kagan's argument and broadly demonstrates that it is the caregivers' behaviours that form the child's attachment style although how this style is expressed may differ with temperament.&lt;ref name="Pearce,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pearce R|year=2009|title= Attachment Theory Predicts the Formation of Romantic Relationships|journal= Griffith University Undergraduate Psychology Journal|url= http://www104.griffith.edu.au/index.php/psyche/article/viewFile/137/286|format=PDF|volume= 1|pages= 25–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris and Pinker have put forward the notion that the influence of parents has been much exaggerated and that socialisation takes place primarily in peer groups, although H. Rudolph Schaffer concludes that parents and peers fulfill different functions and have distinctive roles in children's development.&lt;ref name="schaffer"&gt;{{cite book|author =Schaffer HR|title=Introducing Child Psychology|publisher=Blackwell|year = 2004|isbn=978-0-631-21627-8|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Concern about attachment theory has been raised with regard to the fact that infants often have multiple relationships, within the family as well as in child care settings, and that the [[wikt:dyadic|dyadic]] model characteristic of attachment theory cannot address the complexity of real-life social experiences.&lt;ref name="McHale"&gt;{{cite journal|author= McHale JP|year=2007|title=When infants grow up in multiperson relationship systems|journal= Infant Mental Health Journal|volume= 28|pages= 370–92|doi= 10.1002/imhj.20142|issue= 4|pmc= 3079566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hylomorphism''' (or '''hylemorphism''') is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] theory developed by [[Aristotle]], which conceives [[wiktionary:being|being]] ([[ousia]]) as a compound of [[matter]] and [[Substantial form|form]]. The word is a 19th-century term formed from the Greek words ὕλη ''hyle'', "wood, matter", and μορφή, ''morphē'', "form".

==Matter and form==
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle defines X's matter as "that out of which" X is made.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 194b23-24&lt;/ref&gt; For example, letters are the matter of syllables.&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 195a16&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, "matter" is a relative term:&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 194b9&lt;/ref&gt; an object counts as matter relative to something else. For example, clay is matter relative to a brick because a brick is made of clay, whereas bricks are matter relative to a brick house.

Change is analyzed as a material transformation: matter is what undergoes a change of form.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; For example, consider a lump of bronze that's shaped into a statue. Bronze is the matter, and this matter loses one form (that of a lump) and gains a new form (that of a statue).&lt;ref&gt;''Physics'' 195a6-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' 1045a26-29&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle's theory of [[perception]], we perceive an object by receiving its form with our sense organs.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 424a19&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, forms include complex ''[[qualia]]'' such as colors, textures, and flavors, not just shapes.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 418a11–12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substantial form, accidental form, and prime matter==
{{See also|Substantial form}}
Medieval philosophers who used Aristotelian concepts frequently distinguished between [[substantial form]]s and accidental forms. A substance necessarily possesses at least one substantial form. It may also possess a variety of accidental forms. For Aristotle, a "substance" (''ousia'') is an individual thing—for example, an individual man or an individual horse.&lt;ref&gt;''Categories'' 2a12-14&lt;/ref&gt; The substantial form of substance S consists of S's essential properties,&lt;ref&gt;Cross 34&lt;/ref&gt; the properties that S's matter needs in order to be the kind of substance that S is.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 24&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, S's accidental forms are S's non-essential properties,&lt;ref&gt;Cross 94&lt;/ref&gt; properties that S can lose or gain without changing into a different kind of substance.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, a substance's matter will itself be a substance. If substance A is made out of substance B, then substance B is the matter of substance A. However, what is the matter of a substance that is not made out of any other substance? According to Aristotelians, such a substance has only "prime matter" as its matter. Prime matter is matter with no substantial form of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Leftow 136-37&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it can change into various kinds of substances without remaining any kind of substance all the time.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body–soul hylomorphism==
===Basic theory===
{{See also|On the Soul|Aristotle's biology}}

Aristotle applies his theory of hylomorphism [[Aristotle's biology|to living things]]. He defines a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as that which makes a living thing alive.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 413a20-21&lt;/ref&gt; Life is a property of living things, just as knowledge and health are.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 414a3-9&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a living thing.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412a20, 414a15-18&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412b5-7, 413a1-3, 414a15-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, Aristotle argues, there is no problem in explaining the unity of body and soul, just as there is no problem in explaining the unity of wax and its shape.&lt;ref&gt;412b5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Just as a wax object consists of wax with a certain shape, so a living organism consists of  a body with the property of life, which is its soul. On the basis of his hylomorphic theory, Aristotle rejects the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] doctrine of [[reincarnation]], ridiculing the notion that just any soul could inhabit just any body.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 407b20-24, 414a22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Timothy Robinson, it is unclear whether Aristotle identifies the soul with the body's structure.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 45-47&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of Aristotle, a properly organized body is already alive simply by virtue of its structure.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to another interpretation, the property of life—that is, the soul—is something in addition to the body's structure. Robinson uses the analogy of a car to explain this second interpretation. A running car is running not only because of its structure but also because of the activity in its engine.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 46&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to this second interpretation, a living body is alive not only because of its structure but also because of an additional property: the soul, which a properly organized body needs in order to be alive.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 47&lt;/ref&gt; John Vella uses [[Frankenstein]]'s monster to illustrate the second interpretation:&lt;ref&gt;Vella 92&lt;/ref&gt; the corpse lying on Frankenstein's table is already a fully organized human body, but it is not yet alive; when Frankenstein activates his machine, the corpse gains a new property, the property of life, which Aristotle would call the soul.

===Living bodies===
Some scholars have pointed out a problem facing Aristotle's theory of soul-body hylomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 290-93&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, a living thing's matter is its body, which needs a soul in order to be alive. Similarly, a bronze sphere's matter is bronze, which needs roundness in order to be a sphere. Now, bronze remains the same bronze after ceasing to be a sphere. Therefore, it seems that a body should remain the same body after death.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 291&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle implies that a body is no longer the same body after death.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 412b19-24&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Aristotle says that a body that has lost its soul is no longer potentially alive.&lt;ref&gt;412b15&lt;/ref&gt; But if a living thing's matter is its body, then that body should be potentially alive by definition.

One approach to resolving this problem&lt;ref&gt;Shields, ''Aristotle'' 293&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the fact that a living body is constantly replacing old matter with new. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old and the seventy-year-old bodies share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot identify what collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.

Another approach to resolving the problem&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "A Fundamental Problem"&lt;/ref&gt; relies on a distinction between "proximate" and "non-proximate" matter. When Aristotle says that the body is matter for a living thing, he may be using the word "body" to refer to the matter that makes up the fully organized body, rather than the fully organized body itself. Unlike the fully organized body, this "body" remains the same thing even after death. In contrast, when he says that the body is no longer the same after its death, he is using the word "body" to refer to the fully organized body.

===Intellect===
{{See also|Nous|Active intellect|Passive intellect}}
Aristotle says that the intellect (''[[nous]]''), the ability to think, has no bodily organ (in contrast with other psychological abilities, such as sense-perception and imagination).&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 429a26-27&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he says that it is not mixed with the body&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 429a24-25&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that it can exist apart from the body.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 413b24-26, 429b6&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to contradict Aristotle's claim that the soul is a form or property of the body. To complicate matters further, Aristotle distinguishes between two kinds, or two parts, of intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Soul'' 15-25''&lt;/ref&gt; These two intellectual powers are traditionally called the "[[passive intellect]]" and the "[[active intellect|active (or agent) intellect]]".&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 50&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, interpreters of Aristotle have faced the problem of explaining how the intellect fits into Aristotle's hylomorphic theory of the soul.

According to one interpretation, a person's ability to think (unlike his other psychological abilities) belongs to some incorporeal organ distinct from his body.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 337&lt;/ref&gt; This would amount to a form of dualism.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 337&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to some scholars, it would not be a full-fledged [[Mind-body dualism#Substance dualism|Cartesian dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Some Recent Approaches" 165&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation creates what Robert Pasnau has called the "mind-soul problem": if the intellect belongs to an entity distinct from the body, and the soul is the form of the body, then how is the intellect part of the soul?&lt;ref&gt;Pasnau 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation rests on the distinction between the passive intellect and the agent intellect. According to this interpretation, the passive intellect is a property of the body, while the agent intellect is a substance distinct from the body.&lt;ref&gt;McEvilley 534&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella 110&lt;/ref&gt; Some proponents of this interpretation think that each person has his own agent intellect, which presumably separates from the body at death.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Two Intellects" 207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella 110&lt;/ref&gt; Others interpret the agent intellect as a single divine being, perhaps the [[unmoved mover]], Aristotle's God.&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Psychology" 339&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Caston, "Aristotle's Two Intellects" 199&lt;/ref&gt;

A third interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject"&lt;/ref&gt; relies on the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject" 142&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to think is a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, "Soul as Subject" 145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universal hylomorphism==
The [[neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol|Avicebron (''a.k.a.''Solomon Ibn Gabirol)]] proposed a Neoplatonic version of this Aristotelian concept, according to which all things, including soul and intellect, are composed of matter and form.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==Medieval modifications==
[[Medieval]] [[theology|theologians]], newly exposed to Aristotle's philosophy, applied hylomorphism to Christian doctrines such as the [[transubstantiation]] of the Eucharist's bread and wine into the body and blood of [[Jesus]]. Theologians such as [[Duns Scotus]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed Christian applications of hylomorphism.

===Plurality vs. unity of substantial form===
Many medieval theologians and philosophers followed Aristotle in seeing a living being's soul as that being's form—specifically, its substantial form. However, they disagreed about whether X's soul is X's ''only'' substantial form. Some medieval thinkers argued that X's soul is X's only substantial form, responsible for all of the features of X's body.&lt;ref&gt;Kenny 26&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other medieval thinkers argued that a living being contains at least two substantial forms—(1) the shape and structure of its body, and (2) its soul, which makes its body alive.&lt;ref&gt;Cross 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomistic hylomorphism===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] claimed that X’s soul was X’s only [[substantial form]], although X also had numerous accidental forms that accounted for X’s nonessential features.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 161&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas defined a substantial form as that which makes X's matter constitute X, which in the case of a human being is [[reason|rational capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;Leftow, "Soul, Mind, and Brain" 397&lt;/ref&gt; He attributed all other features of a human being to accidental forms.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 165&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aquinas did not claim that the soul was identical to the person.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 340&lt;/ref&gt; He held that a proper human being is a composite of form and matter, specifically prime matter. Form and matter taken separately may retain some of the attributes of a human being but are nonetheless not identical to that person.&lt;ref&gt;Eberl 341&lt;/ref&gt; So a dead body is not actually or potentially a human being.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Resurrection, Reassembly, and Reconstitution: Aquinas on the Soul" 161&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eleonore Stump]] describes Aquinas' theory of the soul in terms of "configuration". The body is matter that is "configured", i.e. structured, while the soul is a "configured configurer". In other words, the soul is itself a configured thing, but it also configures the body.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 514&lt;/ref&gt;  A dead body is merely matter that was once configured by the soul. It does not possess the configuring capacity of a human being.

Aquinas believed that rational capacity was a property of the soul alone, not of any bodily organ.&lt;ref&gt;Stump,"Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 512&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did believe that the brain had some basic cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 512&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas’ attribution of rational capacity to the soul allowed him to claim that disembodied souls could retain their rational capacity, although he was adamant that such a state was unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Stump, "Non-Cartesian Substance Dualism and Materialism without Reductionism" 519&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teleology and ethics==
{{See also|Nicomachean Ethics}}
Aristotle holds a [[teleology|teleological]] worldview: he sees the universe as inherently purposeful. Basically, Aristotle claims that potentiality exists for the sake of actuality.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 237&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, matter exists for the sake of receiving its form,&lt;ref&gt;''Metaphysics'' 1050a15&lt;/ref&gt; and an organism has sight for the sake of seeing.&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 237&lt;/ref&gt; Now, each thing has certain potentialities as a result of its form. Because of its form, a snake has the potential to slither; we can say that the snake ''ought to'' slither. The more a thing achieves its potential, the more it succeeds in achieving its purpose.

Aristotle bases his [[ethics|ethical]] theory on this teleological worldview. Because of his form, a human being has certain abilities. Hence, his purpose in life is to exercise those abilities as well and as fully as possible.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a16-18&lt;/ref&gt; Now, the most characteristic human ability, which is not included in the form of any other organism, is the ability to think.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a1-5&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the best human life is a life lived rationally.&lt;ref&gt;''Nichomachean Ethics'' 1098a7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern physics==
The idea of hylomorphism can be said to have been reintroduced to the world when [[Werner Heisenberg]] invented his duplex world of quantum mechanics. In his 1958 text ''Physics and Philosophy'', Heisenberg states:

{{quote|In the experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But atoms and the elementary particles themselves are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts ... The probability wave ... mean[s] tendency for something. It's a quantitative version of the old concept of potentia from Aristotle's philosophy. It introduces something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=W.|title=Physics and Philosophy|year=1958|publisher=Allen and Unwin|location=London|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14637">'''Interactional expertise''' is part of a more complex classification of [[expertise]] developed by [[Harry Collins]] and Robert Evans (both based at [[Cardiff University]]).&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H.M. and Evans, R.J. (2002) ‘The Third Wave of Science Studies: Studies of Expertise and Experience’, ''Social Studies of Sciences'', Vol. 32, No. 2, (April), pp.&amp;nbsp;235–296&lt;/ref&gt; In this initial formulation interactional expertise was part of a threefold classification of substantive expertise that also included ‘no expertise’ and ‘contributory expertise’, by which they meant the expertise needed to contribute fully to all aspects of a domain of activity.

==Classification==
The distinction between these three different types of expertise can be illustrated by imagining the experience of a [[social science]] [[researcher]] approaching a topic for the first time. It is easy to see that, whether the research project is to be about [[plumbing]] or [[physics]], most researchers will start from a position of ‘no expertise’ in that area. As the research project proceeds and the [[social interactions]] between the researcher and the plumbers or physicists continue, the social researcher will become increasingly knowledgeable about that topic. For example, they will find that they can talk more interestingly about plumbing or physics and ask more pertinent questions about how it works. Eventually, the researcher may even get to the point where they can answer questions about plumbing or physics as though they were a plumber or physicist even though they can’t do plumbing or physics. It is this kind of expertise that Collins and Evans call interactional expertise.

The important thing to note about interactional expertise is that the only thing the social researcher can’t do that a practicing plumber or physicist can do is the practical work of actually installing [[central heating]] or conducting [[experiment]]s. It is this difference – the difference between being able to talk like a plumber/physicist and actually do plumbing/physics – that is the difference between interactional expertise (what the researcher has) and contributory expertise (what the plumbers and physicists have). Of course, plumbers and physicists who can talk fluently about their work will have both kinds of expertise.

In identifying this separate and distinctive kind of linguistic expertise, the idea of interactional expertise makes a clear break with other theories of expertise, particularly those developed in [[Science and Technology Studies]], which tend to see expertise as a [[social status]] granted by others rather than a property of the individual. As discussed in more detail below, the idea of interactional expertise also differs from more traditional [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenological]] theories of expertise, in which the [[wikt:embodiment|embodied]] expertise of the contributory expert is well-recognised but the distinctively linguistic expertise of the interactional expert appears to have been overlooked.  In this context, it must be emphasised that interactional expertise is a tacit knowledge-laden ability and thus similar in kind to the more embodied contributory expertise. This means that, like contributory expertise, interactional expertise cannot be acquired from books alone and it cannot be encoded in computerised expert systems. It is a specialised [[natural language]] and, as such; it can only be acquired by linguistic interaction with experts. The difference between interactional and contributory expertise is that, in the case of interactional expertise, the tacit knowledge pertains to the language of the domain but not its practice. In the case of contributory expertise, tacit knowledge relating to both the language and practice must be acquired.

==Why does it matter?==

The concept of interactional expertise 
# provides a new way of engaging with traditional problems in the [[philosophy of knowledge]]
# appears to be implicated in a wide range of social activities, ranging from some styles of [[management]] in large organisations to high level specialist [[journalism]] to the [[peer review]] that is at the centre of [[science]].

===Interactional Expertise and Philosophy===

In standard philosophy of knowledge the key distinction is between knowledge that is [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] and knowledge that is formally and explicitly articulated. In this dichotomous formulation, knowledge exists either as codified rules and facts or as some intangible property of the body that performs the task. This distinction forms the basis of the key debate about [[Artificial Intelligence]] research in which [[Hubert Dreyfus]], starting from [[Heidegger]] argued that because computers don’t have bodies they can’t do what humans do and will not, therefore, succeed in becoming [[intelligent]], no matter how sophisticated and detailed the knowledge base and rules with which they are programmed (see Dreyfus 1972).

In 1990, Harry Collins developed an alternative critique of AI which, although similar to Dreyfus’s in that it suggested fundamental limits to what AI could achieve, grounded this explanation in an understanding of [[socialisation]] rather than embodiment.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H.M. (1990) Artificial Experts: Social Knowledge and Intelligent Machines, Cambridge, Mass: MIT press&lt;/ref&gt; Collins’s argument was that because computers are asocial objects that cannot be socialised into the life of a community, then they cannot be intelligent. In this sense, Collins is taking the alternative to the '[[Artificial_intelligence|thinking machine]]' first proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in 1950 (and now known as the [[Turing Test]]) in which so-called intelligence in a machine is defined as the ability to hold a conversation. In the [[Turing Test]], the conversation is conducted via keyboards and the challenge for the AI community is to produce a computer that can give answers that are indistinguishable from those produced by a real human. Given that such interactions are by their very nature open-ended and context-dependent Collins argues that only a fully socialised intelligence will be able to respond appropriately to any of the new and potentially unknown sentences directed to it.

Although the argument was not made in these terms at the time, the concept of interactional expertise is important here. In the original critique of AI research, Collins distinguished between behaviour-specific action (capable of being encoded and reproduced by machines) and natural action (what humans do the rest of the time and which machines cannot reproduce). In a later work with Martin Kusch,&lt;ref&gt;Collins, H. M., &amp; Kusch, M., (1998) ''The Shape of Actions: What Humans and Machines Can Do'', Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; this same distinction was re-cast as the distinction as [[mimeomorphic]] action (action performed in the same way each time and thus amenable to mechanical reproduction) and polimorphic action (actions that depend on context and local convention for their correct interpretation and continuation and thus not reproducible by machines, however sophisticated).

The link between these arguments, the embodiment debate and the idea of interactional expertise is the importance of [[natural language]]. If interactional expertise exists then it suggests that people who cannot perform a particular task or skill – and who therefore cannot have the embodied expertise associated with it – can still talk about that skill as if they did possess the embodied skills. Interactional expertise thus raises a key question about the “amount” of embodiment that is needed for expertise to be transferred. For proponents of the embodiment thesis, quite a lot of embodiment is needed as the expertise resides in the relative position, movement and feel of the body. From the perspective of interactional expertise much less embodiment is needed and, taken to its logical minimum, perhaps only the ability to hear and speak are needed.

===Interactional Expertise and Practical Action===

The idea of interactional expertise also has many practical applications and accounts for many everyday practices and activities. The implication of interactional expertise is to legitimate commentary and opinion from individuals outside a group of contributory expertise without necessarily saying that all opinions and views are equally valid. Examples of circumstances in which some degree of interactional expertise would be important include:

====The role of peer review in science====

Scientific papers and research are subject to peer review but, in most cases, the reviewers will be drawn from cognate or related fields. This is particularly common in research funding decisions, where the likelihood of an application being reviewed by non-specialists increases with the amount of money involved. Even in the case of smaller awards, and of peer reviewed papers, it is still often the case that reviewers will have contributory expertise in a different narrowly defined specialism to that of the author being reviewed. If interactional expertise did not exist, then justifying peer review would be difficult. If, however, reviewers can have expertise by virtue of their interaction with a range of cognate scientists, then the process of peer review seems reasonable.

====The management of large organisations====

Whilst there may be some skills that are more or less generic in the management of large organisations – presumably  the kinds of skills that are taught on [[MBA]] schemes around the world – we can also ask if managers do better if they understand particularities of the business they are in charge of. Intuitively it seems reasonable to suggest that the manager of a [[newspaper]] should know something about how a [[journalist]] works or that a manager of a [[car]] [[factory]] should know something about how a [[Production-line]] works. Whilst this kind of thinking is formally included in many training schemes, the idea of interactional expertise allows us to ask about the kind of experience that is needed in order for managers who lack the embodied experience of writing copy or working on a production line to understand what this is like for those that do fulfil these roles. One implication of interactional expertise is that direct experience – working one’s way up through the ranks – may be less important than previously thought even though lots of interaction with those who do these tasks could still be important.  Certainly in the management of large science projects, managers will work hard to acquire interactional expertise quickly.

====Interdisciplinary trading zones====

In art, design, science, [[technology]], [[medicine]] and [[public policy]] many activities are undertaken by [[interdisciplinary]] teams. In science and technology, these take the form of scientists and engineers from many different disciplines working together on a single project. It is this situation, in which different groups of specialists with different, mutually incompatible and sometimes incomprehensible ideas nonetheless manage to find a way of communicating with each other and working together that inspired [[Peter Galison]] to develop the original [[trading zones]] metaphor. Similar teams are often found in public health settings, where cases are decided by multi-disciplinary teams comprising [[social workers]], [[psychologists]], [[psychiatrists]], [[lawyers]] and so on. In the trading zone case, these teams work by developing a new composite language, called a [[pidgin]] or [[creole language]], which the group shares and uses to communicate. The idea of trading zones has been developed by Mike Gorman, who has identified different types of trading zones, and examined their operation in a range of settings, including [[nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, M.E., Groves, J.F., &amp; Catalano, R.K. (2004) ‘Societal dimensions of nanotechnology,’ ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine'', Vol. 29, No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–64.
&lt;/ref&gt; Interactional expertise offers an alternative to this approach. Instead of a new language emerging, some members of the group learn the language of the others and shift back and forth between the two worlds. This is more akin to translation between two cultures rather than the creation of a new, shared, culture.

====Journalism and the mass media====

Most [[journalists]] cover many different topics in their career but some focus on a specific area, becoming specialist journalists, covering particular beats like politics, medicine, science, environment, security and so on. In the case of science, but in other areas too, the job of journalists is to render the specialist expertise of some esoteric group intelligible and relevant to ordinary folk. In doing so, they interpret events and place them in a broader context. In many cases, journalists do this by presenting ‘both sides of the argument’ in order to provide a balanced story and prevent accusations of bias. This is fine in principle but difficult in practice, particularly for science, as it requires the journalist to make a judgement about how credible a scientific claim is and thus how it should be reported. For example, should it be reported in a balanced way, in which two more or less equal sides get to make contrasting claims, as a story about a fringe, maverick or otherwise highly uncertain claim being made but not widely supported, or simply ignored as nonsense and not reported at all? In the UK, the reporting of the [[MMR vaccine|MMR]] controversy arguably adopted the ‘balanced approach’ for too long, thus lending greater credibility to the claims that MMR was dangerous than they deserved according to most members of the scientific community. In the latter stages of the debate these stories were often produced by the general news journalists and not the specialist health or science journalists who, by virtue of what we might call their interactional expertise, no longer saw the claims as credible.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, T. (2007) 'Journalism and Expertise', ''Journalism Studies'', Vol. 8, No. 2, (April).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Robert Jones''' (4 September [[1911 in Wales|1911]] &amp;ndash; 3 June [[1970 in Wales|1970]]), was a [[Wales|Welsh]] philosopher.

He was born in [[Pwllheli]], and went to school there before going on to study philosophy at [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]].  He went on to take his D.Phil. at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].  He returned to Aberystwyth to lecture in philosophy, and in 1952 was appointed Professor of Philosophy at [[University of Wales, Swansea]].  In 1961 he was visiting professor at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|Chapel Hill University]], [[North Carolina]].  On his return to Wales, he became more politically active, speaking out against the investiture of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], in 1969, resigning from the [[Gorsedd]] of Bards in protest.

As a philosopher, he was influenced by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] and [[Simone Weil]].  His writings dealt mainly with three problems: the nature of the self, the nature of perception, and the nature of universals.

'''Joseph Marie, baron de Gérando''', born ''Joseph Marie Degérando'' (29 February 1772 in [[Lyon]], [[France]] – 10 November 1842 in [[Paris]]), was a [[France|French]] jurist, [[philanthropist]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Italy|Italian]] descent.

He is most remembered for his 1804 book ''Histoire comparée des systèmes de philosophie, considérés relativement aux principes des connaissances humaines'' (''Comparative History of philosophical systems, considered in relation to the principles of human knowledge'') as well as his 1820 study of benevolent activity,  ''Le visiteur du pauvre'' (''The visitor to the poor'').  He influenced [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Margaret Fuller]], and especially [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who used his philosophical framework extensively in support of his own first book ''Nature''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7631">[[File:Ken Schenck.jpg|right]]'''Ken Schenck''' (born 1966) is a [[New Testament]] scholar whose primary focus has been the [[Epistle to the Hebrews|book of Hebrews]], although he has also published on [[Apostle Paul|Paul]] and [[Philo]].  His New Testament Survey (Triangle Publishing) has sold nearly 10,000 copies, and his “brief guide” to Philo (Westminster John Knox) has been translated into both Russian and Korean.  His [http://kenschenck.blogspot.com blog] also engages heavily with issues in [[hermeneutics]], [[ecclesiology]], and [[philosophy]] on both a popular and scholarly level.  After serving as Dean of [[Wesley Seminary|Wesley Seminary at Indiana Wesleyan University]] for six years, he returned to be Professor of New Testament and Ancient Languages in Indiana Wesleyan University's School of Theology and Ministry.

==Education==
Schenck was awarded a Ph.D. degree in 1996 from the [[University of durham|University of Durham]], England, where he studied under [[James Dunn (theologian)|James D. G. Dunn]], holds an M.A. in Classical Languages and Literature from the [[University of Kentucky]], an M.Div from [[Asbury Theological Seminary]], and an A.B. from [[Southern Wesleyan University]].  He is an ordained minister in the [[Wesleyan Church]] since 1991 and a Professor of Bible at [[Indiana Wesleyan University]] since 1997.  He has also taught for the [[University of Notre Dame]] and [[Asbury Theological Seminary]].

==Scholarship==
His work on Hebrews was the first to engage the book extensively from the standpoint of its narrative substructure, and is part of a recent wave that sees the sermon more as a response to the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction]] of the [[Jerusalem temple]] than a polemic against the Levitical cultus per se.&lt;ref name="Cosmology"&gt;Cosmology and Eschatology in Hebrews: The Settings of the Sacrifice, Westminster John Knox, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hermeneutics]], Schenck has argued consistently that the traditionally [[Sola scriptura|Protestant approach to Scripture]], which places the locus of the Bible’s authority solely on the historical meaning, deconstructs itself not only because it leads to an atomization of biblical meaning but also because the Bible itself—the putative authority—does not employ this method.&lt;ref name="Decides"&gt;Who Decides What the Bible Means?, CafeTutor Publishing, 1998, and extensively at [http://kenschenck.blogspot.com].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ironic result is a trajectory toward [[Liberal Christianity|theological liberalism]] and away from [[First seven Ecumenical Councils|Christian orthodoxy]], as well as the fragmentation of [[Protestantism]].  Schenck maintains that only a balance between the trajectory of the historical meaning and the Spirit-led consensus of Christendom can sustain both orthodox Christian faith and an understanding of the Bible as Christian Scripture.

'''Kendall Lewis Walton''' (born 1939) is an American [[philosopher]], the Emeritus Charles Stevenson Collegiate Professor of [[Philosophy]] and Professor of Art and Design at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/philosophy/people/professoremeritus Philosophy faculty listing], Univ. of Michigan, retrieved 2010-03-06.&lt;/ref&gt; His work mainly deals with theoretical questions about the arts and issues of philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and philosophy of language. His book ''Mimesis as Make Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts'' develops a theory of make-believe and uses it to understand the nature and varieties of representation in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; He has also developed an account of photography as transparent, defending the idea that we see through photographs, much as we see through telescopes or mirrors,&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures: On the Nature of Photographic Realism' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 79-116&lt;/ref&gt; and written extensively on pictorial representation, fiction and the emotions, the ontological status of fictional entities, the aesthetics of music, metaphor, and aesthetic value.

==Education and career==
Walton studied as an undergraduate at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], originally pursuing a major in music, having been a serious musician, probably headed towards music theory. 
However, a philosophy course in his sophomore year convinced him to change his major, tentatively, from music to philosophy. After a few more courses, he became convinced he had found his calling, stating that he had always been “more or less hooked” on philosophy, despite not knowing it by that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his background in music, Walton expected that he would have an interest in aesthetics and philosophy of art, but was unmoved by his contacts with these fields at Berkeley. After graduating in 1961, he pursued postgraduate studies at [[Cornell University]] where he attended a seminar with the British philosopher and aesthetician [[Frank Sibley (philosopher)|Frank Sibley]] that he discovered “how exciting aesthetics can be, how serious, rigorous philosophical thought can connect with real, real-world interests in the arts.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his dissertation, 'Conceptual Schemes: A Study of Linguistic Relativity and Related Philosophical Problems', with Sydney Shoemaker on philosophy of language, mind and metaphysics, and graduated in 1967 with a Ph.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/klwalton/files/cv-24jan10.docx Curriculum vitae] from Walton's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

After having been invited to teach a course on aesthetics that he was not fully prepared for (having only had the one seminar with Sibley), he stayed up nearly all night brainstorming topics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt; which led to his paper 'Categories of Art'.&lt;ref&gt;'Categories of Art' reprinted in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing that the [[Analytic Philosophy|analytic tradition]] had not explored aesthetics at the time, he was drawn to the idea of being a pioneer, staying “That is more fun, for me, than fine tuning ideas others have worked on for decades or centuries. And I don’t have to leave behind my interests in music and the other arts”&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/2010/06/walton-on-makebelieve.html Interview at ''Only a Game'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1965, and became Charles L. Stevenson Collegiate Professor in 1999. He was elected as a [[Fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1998, and received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Nottingham]] in 2005. He was president of the American Society for Aesthetics from 2003 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/klwalton/files/cv-24jan10.docx Curriculum vitae] from Walton's web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==
===Make-believe theory===
Walton's major contribution to philosophy is his theory of representation, known as the make-believe theory. In the context of ontology, the same theory is usually referred to as pretence theory, and in the context of representational arts, prop theory. Walton has been working on this philosophical theory since 1973,&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Pictures and Make-Believe', The Philosophical Review (July 1973), pp.  
283-319.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is expounded in his 1990 magnum opus ''Mimesis as Make -Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts''.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. "Mimesis as Make-Believe: On the Foundations of the Representational Arts". Harvard University Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is a development of Ernst Gombrich's sketched ideas concerning the relationship between toys and art, presented in his famous essay 'Meditations on a Hobby Horse', which Walton has described as having been “largely ignored” by most of philosophy of art.&lt;ref&gt;'Pictures and Hobby Horses' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walton's theory, representational art can be understood as props that prescribe specific imaginings, analogous to the way children's toys such as dolls and teddy bears function as props in children's games of make-believe, albeit with greater sophistication.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Via certain principles of generation, any such prop generates fictional truths, which collectively constitute fictional worlds.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Walton identifies two kinds of such worlds: the game world of each participant and the work world, which can be thought of as containing only such content as is true in any well-formed game world.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 58-61&lt;/ref&gt; Props are divided into two forms: sensory depictions (such as paintings, sculpture and certain kinds of music), and verbal representations (such as novels and the spoken component of theater).&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 293-384&lt;/ref&gt;

A key clarification that the make-believe theory offers is the idea that the term 'fictional' can be taken to mean “true in the appropriate game of make-believe” or, equivalently, true in the fictional world of the representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Walton states that “Imagining aims at the fictional as belief aims at the true. What is true is to be believed; what is fictional is to be imagined.”&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; He develops this concept into an ontology of fictional objects that eliminates any “voodoo metaphysics”&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', p. 385&lt;/ref&gt; by recognising that people sometimes refer to fictional entities ''as if'' they were referring to real entities. Walton identifies a pretence construal whereby a person ''pretends'' to describe the real world, when actually describing a fictional world.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 390-392&lt;/ref&gt;

The genesis of the make-believe theory can be found in Walton's 1978 paper 'Fearing Fictions',&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Fearing Fictions', Journal of Philosophy, vol. 75, no. 1, 1978, pp. 5-27.&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses the [[Paradox of fiction]] i.e. how can we be moved by things that do not exist in the case of fiction?&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/ 'Paradox of Fiction', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, accessed 4 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Walton's solution is to accept that our responses to fiction are genuine emotions, but to deny that they correspond to the conventional feelings that we refer to – rather, it is ''fictional'' that they are the conventional emotions. So, for instance, when a person who has watched a horror movie declares that they felt afraid, it is true that they were emotionally moved, but fictional that what they were moved to was ''fear''. Walton refers to these fictional emotions as quasi emotions.&lt;ref&gt;''Mimesis'', pp. 241-249&lt;/ref&gt;

In later papers, Walton has expanded his theory to recognize a distinction between ''content oriented make-believe'', which describes a participant's relationship to the fictional worlds of novels, films, paintings etc. and ''prop oriented make-believe'', in which the participant's interest is in the nature of the prop itself, not in the fictional world that attaches to it.&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Metaphor and Prop Oriented Make-Believe', European Journal of Philosophy, no. 1, 1993, pp. 39–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphors are a classic example of prop oriented make-believe: the phrase “we are in the same boat” is not intended to elicit imaginings about the fictional boat we are in, but to communicate by drawing our attention to a specific prop (the boat).&lt;ref&gt;Walton, Kendall L. 'Existence as Metaphor?' in A. Everett and T. Hofweber (eds.), Empty Names, Fiction and the Puzzles of Non-Existence, Stanford, CA, CSLI Publications, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Yablo has developed Walton's concept of prop oriented make-believe in connection with numbers and concluded that our understanding of cardinality is essentially based upon fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. 'Does Ontology Rest on a Mistake?', Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary vol. 72, no. 1, 1998, pp. 229–262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yablo, Stephen. 'Go Figure: A Path through Fictionalism', Midwest Studies in Philosophy, vol. 25, 2002, pp. 72-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses===
The make-believe theory has been described by [[Jerrold Levinson]] as “the most significant event in Anglo-American aesthetics in many a year”, and compares it to [[Nelson Goodman|Nelson Goodman's]] ''[[Languages of Art]]'' (1968), [[Richard Wollheim|Richard Wollheim's]] ''[[Art and Its Objects]]'' and [[Arthur Danto|Arthur Danto's]] ''[[Transfiguration of the Commonplace]]''  by suggesting that it “joins a small pantheon of landmark books”.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Jerrold. 'Making Believe', Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review, vol. 32, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simo Säätelä compared Walton's approach with the make-believe theory to that of [[Gilbert Ryle]] in ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), albeit far wider in scope.&lt;ref&gt;Säätelä, Simo. 'Fiction, Make-Believe and Quasi Emotions',  
British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 34, no. 1, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Patrick Maynard]] has praised Walton's achievement, saying: "he has worked out a theory of representation relevant to the arts. In an age of aesthetics glib about theory, I wonder if it will be appreciated how significant an accomplishment this is."&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, Patrick. 'Real Imaginings, Walton Symposium in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, vol. 51, no. 2, June 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game designer and philosopher [[Chris Bateman]] has adapted the make-believe theory to games and videogames.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.ihobo.com/2010/05/game-design-as-makebelieve.html "Game Design as Make-Believe] 27 May 2010. Retrieved 23 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlyagame.typepad.com/only_a_game/imaginary-games.html "Imaginary Games"], 22 February 2011. Retrieved 22 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later theories===
Walton has developed several additional philosophical theories pertaining to art. He has developed the groundwork for a theory of aesthetic value in which aesthetic pleasure is understood as being partly constituted by the admiration a participant feels for an artwork,&lt;ref&gt;'“How Marvelous!”: Toward a Theory of Aesthetic Value'' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 3-19&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that styles in art can be understood by comparison to the adjective qualities we attach to the actions that artists apparently took in making a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;'Style and the Products and Processes of Art' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 221-248&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, he has developed a transparency thesis of photography,&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures: On the Nature of Photographic Realism' in Walton, Kendall L., ''Marvelous Images: On Values and the Arts”, Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 79-116&lt;/ref&gt; which is summarized in the following claim: “Photographs are ''transparent''. We see the world ''through'' them.”&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Walton recognizes that this use of 'see' may differ from its conventional usage, but considers it parallel to the way we talk about 'seeing' through a telescope or other such tool.&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt; In viewing a photograph, we thus have ''two'' related experiences: we see through the photograph to the circumstances it was originally taken, and we have a fictional experience using the photograph as a prop e.g. if one looks at a photograph of Aunt Mabel grimacing one may say “Aunt Mabel is grimacing” - it is fictional that one sees her grimacing, but in addition one actually sees through the photograph an actual grimace that she had on her face in the past.&lt;ref&gt;'Transparent Pictures', p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mateo Aimerich''' (1715–1799) was a [[philologist]] born in [[Bordils]], [[Province of Girona]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Díaz1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Díaz Díaz|first=Gonzalo|title=Hombres y documentos de la filosofía española|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suUuM4-yirQC&amp;pg=PA438|accessdate=27 September 2014|year=1980|publisher=Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas|language=Spanish|location=Madrid, Spain|isbn=978-84-00-04726-9|pages=438–439|oclc=253589596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered the [[Society of Jesus]] at eighteen, and, having finished his studies, taught [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] in several colleges of his Order. He was subsequently rector of [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[University of Cervera|Cervera]], and chancellor of the [[University of Gandia]].&lt;ref name="Díaz1980" /&gt; He was in [[Madrid]], supervising the printing of some books, when the decree of the expulsion of the Society from Spain was announced. He went on board ship without complaint, reportedly thinking only of consoling his companions, several of whom were old and infirm. He took up his abode in [[Ferrara]], [[Italy]] and it was there, in exile, that he carried out much of his philological work.  His only help was the public [[library]], and even that his infirmities often prevented him from consulting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01236a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides some works of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophy, ascetical works, and discourses, we have from his pen the following works:

*''Monina et acta Episcoporum Barcinonencium''
*''Quinti Moderati Censorini de vitâ et morte linguae Paradoxa philologica, criticis nonnullis dissertationibus opposite, asserta, et probata'', of which there were but a few copies printed; the book is consequently very rare.
*a defense of the preceding work;
*''Specimen veteris romanae literaturae deperditae vel adhuc latentis'';
*''Novum Lexicon historicum et criticum antiquae romanae literaturae''. This work, which is the sequel to the preceding, was the one which made Aimerich's reputation. He left also an MS., which was a supplement to his [[dictionary]]; and a number of Latin discourses.

Aimerich died in Ferrara, Italy, in 1799.&lt;ref name="Díaz1980" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">'''Maxwellisation''' is the legal practice in [[Civil procedure in England and Wales|English]] and [[Scots civil procedure|Scots]] law that allows persons who are to be criticised in an official report to respond prior to publication, based on details of the criticism received in advance.

The process takes its name from the publisher [[Robert Maxwell]]. In 1969, Maxwell was criticised in a report by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] as "unfit to hold the stewardship of a public company". Maxwell took the matter to court, where the DTI was said by the judge to have "virtually committed the business murder" of Maxwell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maxwellisation|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-2073483/30-SECOND-GUIDE-MAXWELLISATION.html|work=Thisismoney.co.uk|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell v Department of Trade and Industry [1974] QB 523&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid any repeat of Mr Justice Forbes' ruling, official policy was altered to ensure prior notice would be given of critical findings. Relevant witnesses are shown the specific extracts of reports relating to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consultation on Inquiries (Scotland) Rules: Scottish Inquiries Under the Inquiries Act 2005|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/14163951/2|work=The Scottish Government|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many examples exist of the process being applied, including the 1997 report into the [[Guinness share-trading fraud]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DTI Inquiries|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo970604/debtext/70604-04.htm|work=4 June 1997|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Iraq Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chilcot |first=John |title=Letter to David Cameron |date=13 July 2012 |url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/media/96313/2012-07-13-Letter-Chilcot-to-Cameron.pdf |work=Iraq Inquiry |accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Joseph Roads''', (born 14 April 1937) is a UK-born resident of Australia and an [[author]] of essays, articles and books including ''Talking with Nature - Journey Into Nature, Journey Into Oneness and Into a Timeless Realm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith Marian Campbell|author2=Jane Karchmar|title=Energywellness.ca|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yrvRVoxw78UC&amp;pg=PA140|date=January 2004|publisher=GeneralStore PublishingHouse|isbn=978-1-894263-90-0|pages=140–}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite book|author=Judith M.

== Biography ==
Roads was born in [[Cambridgeshire, England]], and grew up as a farmer’s son. He left school as early as he could and worked for his father. At the age of 21, he married his first wife, Treenie, with whom he emigrated to Australia in 1964. Together, they had a beef and dairy farm and raised four children. During this time, he joined the Australian organic movement and he wrote his first book, on organic gardening, which became a bestseller. After selling the farm he and his wife co-founded a spiritual community, which they left after four years, eventually moving to a small town on the east coast of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Roads: awakening true abundance &amp; communicating with nature|url=http://juicylivingtour.com/2012/05/08/michael-roads-awakening-true-abundance-communicating-with-nature/|publisher= |website=Lilou's Juicy Living Tour|date=8 May 2012|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his books, Roads declares that during his youth as a farmer he developed an ability to communicate with nature and began to explore the world from a metaphysical plane. Claiming that this insight helped him to recover from a serious illness, he began writing his books and giving public talks. For over twenty years,{{when|date=October 2018}} Roads has been a writer and spiritual teacher in many countries around the world.

== Teachings ==
Roads writes and gives inspirational talks about the power of unconditional love, and encourages his readers and listeners to explore spirituality and to overcome their perceived limitations in order to lead happier and more successful lives.

As well as in his own publications, Roads and his work have appeared in the publications and videos of a number of other writers, including ''Healthy-Living'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nexuspub.com/ "Road's way: A common man's tale of enlightenment"]. ''Healthy-Living''. Nexus.&lt;/ref&gt; Polly Darling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pollyannadarling.com/1850/a-conversation-with-michael-roads/ "Pollyanna's interview with Michael Roads"]&lt;/ref&gt; GaiamTV's, [[Lilou Mace]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaiamtv.com/video/choose-love-michael-roads#sthash.VytHEyxm.dpuf "Awakening true abundance &amp; communicating with nature"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Having started his academic career as [[Junior Researcher]] in 1962, he continued as [[Research Associate]] and [[Senior Research Associate]] until progressing to the position of the Deputy Director for Academic Work of the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in 1978. He later worked as Director of the Inter-republican Branch of the Academy of Social Sciences in Kiev (until 1991). His research focused on philosophical and sociological problems of development of intellectual and spiritual culture, evolution of mass consciousness and the way of life, scientific and technological revolution, sociology of religion and the history of religion in Ukraine.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Peter Lombard was born in [[Lumellogno]]&lt;ref&gt;Hödl, in ''Biografisch-Bibliografisches Kirchenlexikon''.&lt;/ref&gt; (then a rural commune, now a ''quartiere'' of [[Novara]], [[Piedmont]]), in northwestern [[Italy]], to a poor family.&lt;ref&gt;The few known facts of Peter's life are presented in Philippe Delhaye, ''Pierre Lombard: sa vie, ses œuvres, sa morale'' (Paris/Montreal) 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;  His date of birth was likely between 1095 and 1100.

His education most likely began in Italy at the [[cathedral school]]s of [[Novara Cathedral|Novara]] and Lucca.  The patronage of [[Odo of Lucca|Odo, bishop of Lucca]], who recommended him to [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at [[Reims]] and [[Paris]]. Petrus Lombardus studied first in the [[cathedral school at Reims]], where Magister Alberich and Lutolph of Novara were teaching, and arrived in Paris about 1134,&lt;ref&gt;Hödl&lt;/ref&gt; where Bernard recommended him&lt;ref&gt;In a surviving letter, Ep. 410, ''Opera omnia'' viii.391, noted by Hödl&lt;/ref&gt; to the canons of the church of St. Victor.

===Professor===
In Paris, where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], he came into contact with [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Hugh of St. Victor]], who were among the leading theologians of the time.  There are no proven facts relating to his whereabouts in Paris until 1142 when he became recognized as writer and teacher. Around 1145, Peter became a "magister", or professor, at the cathedral school of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris. Peter's means of earning a living before he began to derive income as a teacher and from his [[canon (priest)|canon]]'s [[prebend]] is shrouded in uncertainty.

Lombard's style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. It can be surmised that this attention is what prompted the canons of Notre Dame to ask him to join their ranks. He was considered a ''celebrated theologian'' by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. The canons of Notre Dame, to a man, were members of the [[Capetian dynasty]], relatives of families closely aligned to the Capetians by blood or marriage, scions of the [[Île-de-France]] or eastern [[Loire Valley]] nobility, or relatives of royal officials. In contrast, Peter had no relatives, ecclesiastical connections, and no political patrons in France. It seems that he must have been invited by the canons of Notre Dame solely for his academic merit.

===Priesthood and Bishop of Paris===
He became a [[subdeacon]] in 1147. Possibly he was present at the consistory of Paris in 1147, and certainly he attended the [[Council of Rheims (1148)|Council of Reims]] in 1148, where [[Pope Eugenius III]] was present at the synod, which examined [[Gilbert de la Porrée]] and [[Éon de l'Étoile]]. Peter was among the signers of the act condemning Gilbert's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Hödl.&lt;/ref&gt; At some time after 1150 he became a [[deacon]], then an [[archdeacon]], maybe as early as 1152. He was ordained priest some time before 1156. On 28 July 1159, at the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]], he was [[consecration|consecrated]] as [[bishop of Paris]]. [[Walter of St Victor]] accused Peter of obtaining the office by [[simony]].&lt;ref&gt;In his polemic ''Contra quatuor labyrinthos Franciae'' II.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The more usual story is that Philip, younger brother of [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]]. and archdeacon of Notre-Dame, was elected by the canons but declined in favor of Peter, his teacher.

His reign as bishop was brief.&lt;ref&gt;His successor, Maurice de Sully, was bishop by the end of 1160.&lt;/ref&gt;  He died on either 21 or 22 July 1160. Little can be ascertained about Lombard's administrative style or objectives because he left behind so few episcopal ''acta''. He was succeeded by [[Maurice de Sully]], the builder of the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Peter Lombard}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb  in the church of Saint-Marcel  in Paris was destroyed during the [[French Revolution]], but a transcription of his epitaph survives.

==Writings==

Peter Lombard wrote commentaries on the Psalms and the Pauline epistles; however, his most famous work by far was ''Libri Quatuor Sententiarum'', or the ''[[Sentences|Four Books of Sentences]]'', which became the standard textbook of theology at the medieval universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Scholasticism|author=Joseph Rickaby|year=1908|publisher=A. Constable|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1220s until the 16th century, no work of Christian literature, except for the [[Bible]] itself, was commented upon more frequently. All the major medieval thinkers, from [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] to [[William of Ockham]] and [[Gabriel Biel]], were influenced by it. Even the young [[Martin Luther]] still wrote glosses on the ''Sentences'', and [[John Calvin]] quoted from it over 100 times in his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion|Institutes]]''.

Though the ''Four Books of Sentences'' formed the framework upon which four centuries of scholastic interpretation of Christian dogma was based, rather than a dialectical work itself, the ''Four Books of Sentences'' is a compilation of biblical texts, together with relevant passages from the [[Church Fathers]] and many medieval thinkers, on virtually the entire field of Christian theology as it was understood at the time. Peter Lombard's ''magnum opus'' stands squarely within the pre-scholastic [[exegesis]] of biblical passages, in the tradition of [[Anselm of Laon]], who taught through quotations from authorities.&lt;ref&gt;This is a central point of Delhaye 1961, who sees Abelard, rather than Peter, as the founder of [[scholasticism]].&lt;/ref&gt;  It stands out as the first major effort to bring together commentaries on the full range of theological issues, arrange the material in a systematic order, and attempt to reconcile them where they appeared to defend different viewpoints. The ''Sentences'' starts with the [[Trinity]] in Book I, moves on to [[Creation myth|creation]] in Book II, treats [[Christ]], the saviour of the fallen creation, in Book III, and deals with the [[sacraments]], which mediate Christ's grace, in Book IV.

==Doctrine==
Peter Lombard's most famous and most controversial doctrine in the ''Sentences'' was his identification of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] with the [[Holy Spirit]] in Book I, distinction 17. According to this doctrine, when the Christian loves God and his neighbour, this love literally is God; he becomes divine and is taken up into the life of the Trinity.  This idea, in its inchoate form, can be extrapolated from certain remarks of [[St. Augustine of Hippo]] (cf. De Trinitate xiii.7.11). Although this was never declared unorthodox, few theologians have been prepared to follow Peter Lombard in this aspect of his teaching. Compare [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'', 2006.

Also in the ''Sentences'' was the doctrine that [[marriage]] was consensual and need not be consummated to be considered perfect, unlike [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]'s analysis (see ''[[sponsalia de futuro]]'').  Lombard's interpretation was later endorsed by [[Pope Alexander III]], and had a significant impact on Church interpretation of marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1802">'''Peter de Rivo''' (Petrus) (Aalst ca. 1420 - Leuven 1499) was a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[scholastic philosopher]], teaching at the [[Old University of Leuven|Catholic University of Leuven]].

His views on [[future contingent]]s were controversial, being opposed by [[Henry of Zomeren]], also at [[Leuven]] (French: ''Louvain'').&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Radcliffe Parkinson, Stuart Shanker, ''Routledge History of Philosophy'' (1999), p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; De Rivo went to Rome in 1472 to defend his views to [[Pope Sixtus IV]]; they were condemned in 1473.&lt;ref&gt;John Monfasani, ''Fernando of Cordova: A Biographical and Intellectual Profile'' (1992), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; Under pressure from the influence of [[Cardinal Bessarion]] to whom Henry had as secretary,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Itinerarium Italicum: The Profile of the Italian Renaissance in the Mirror'' (1975), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; de Rivo retracted partially his opinions in 1473, and more fully three years later.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Vanden Broecke, ''The Limits of Influence: Pico, Louvain, and the Crisis of Renaissance Astrology'' (2003), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that views going back at least to [[Peter Auriol]], that future contingents lacked a [[truth value]], had become heretical in the view of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/medieval-futcont/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', article ''Medieval Theories of Future Contingents'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2883">'''Peter of Corbeil''' (died June 3, 1222), born at [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]],  was a preacher and canon of [[Nôtre Dame de Paris]], a [[scholastic philosophy|scholastic philosopher]] and master of theology at the [[University of Paris]], ca 1189. He is remembered largely because his aristocratic student Lotario de' Conti became pope as [[Pope Innocent III|Innocent III]]. In 1198 Innocent appointed him to the sinecures of [[York Minster|prebendary and archdeacon of York]]. The following year Innocent raised his former master to the [[Bishop of Cambrai|see of Cambrai]], an immensely important diocese with a jurisdiction that covered [[Flanders]]. Peter became [[Archbishop of Sens]] in 1200. His interest in the intellectual life of Paris was undiminished: in 1210 he convoked a council at Paris that forbade the teaching, whether in public or privately, of the recently rediscovered Natural Philosophy (the [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] and very likely the [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]) of [[Aristotle]] and the recently translated commentaries on Aristotle of [[Averroës]] (''nec libri Aristotelis de naturali philosophia nec commenta legantur Parisius publice vel secreto''), texts which were beginning to revolutionize the medieval approach to logical thinking, At the same time the council [[Book burning|consigned to the public flames]] a work of [[David of Dinant]] that had been circulated since the end of the century, ''De Tomis, id est de Divisionibus'' (called the "Quaternuli"), which proposed that God is the matter which constitutes the inmost core of things (de Wulf 1909), a form of [[pantheism]] that was condemned by [[Albert the Great]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]].

A manuscript of his commentary on [[Psalms]] is at the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford.

The journal was established in 2011, after the society's third annual conference. The founding co-editors were Elaine Miller and Emily Zakin ([[Miami University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Miller|Zakin|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its founding editors, the society and journal were named after [[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]], the feminine aspect of God who fell from grace because of her love of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Miller|Zakin|2011|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name serves to illustrate that women who love philosophy are not necessarily in love with the [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Miller|Zakin|2011|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pierre Charron''' ({{IPA-fr|pjɛʁ ʃaʁɔ̃}}; 1541 &amp;ndash; 16 November 1603) was a [[France|French]] 16th-century Catholic theologian and [[philosopher]], and a disciple and contemporary of [[Michel de Montaigne]].

==Biography==
[[File:Pierre Charron.jpg|thumb|right|Pierre Charron's obituary]]
Pierre Charron was born in [[Paris]], one of the twenty-five children of a bookseller.  After studying [[law]] at [[Orléans]] and [[Bourges]] he practiced as an advocate, for a few years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/newschaffherzog29haucgoog#page/n40/mode/2up ''Schaff-Herzog'' article]&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered the church and soon became a popular priest, rising to become a canon.

He moved to the southwest of France, invited by [[Arnaud de Pontac]], [[Bishop of Bazas]].&lt;ref name = Annales&gt;https://archive.org/stream/annalesdumidi3132univuoft#page/102/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed priest in ordinary to [[Marguerite de Valois]], wife of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV of Navarre]]. In about 1588, Charron decided to become a monk, but being rejected by both the [[Carthusian]]s and the [[Celestines]], he returned to his old profession. He delivered a course of sermons at [[Angers]], and in the next year moved to [[Bordeaux]], where he formed a famous friendship with [[Michel de Montaigne]].  On Montaigne's death, in 1592, Charron was requested in the will to bear the Montaigne arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pierre Charron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1594, he used his own name; he spent from 1594 to 1600 under the protection of [[Antoine Hérbrard de Saint-Sulpice]],&lt;ref name = Annales/&gt; [[Bishop of Cahors]], who appointed him grand vicar and theological canon. His first book led to his being chosen deputy to the [[general assembly of the clergy]], for which he became chief secretary.

Charron retired to [[Condom, Gers|Condom]] in 1600; he died suddenly of a stroke; his works were then receiving attention.&lt;ref name=Popkin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gale&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pierre-charron ''Gale Dictionary of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Charron first published his works anonymously. Later he wrote under the name of "Benoit Vaillant, Advocate of the Holy Faith." While Charron's reading of Montaigne is now considered dogmatic and indeed something of a distortion, it was important in its time and during the 17th century as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Les Trois Vérités''===
In 1594, he published a long work, ''[[Les Trois Vérités]],'' in which Charron sought to prove that there is a [[God]] and a true religion, that the true religion is [[Christian]]ity, and that the true church is [[Roman Catholicism]]. It was a response to the [[Protestant]] work ''Le Traité de l'Eglise,'' by [[Philippe de Mornay]]. In the second edition (1595), there is an elaborate reply to criticisms of the third ''Vérité'' by a Protestant writer. ''Les Trois Vérités'' ran through several editions.

===''Discours chretiens''===
Then followed, in 1600, ''[[Discours chretiens]],'' a book of sermons with a similar tone, half of which is about the [[Eucharist]] {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

===''De la sagesse''===
[[File:De la sagesse - 1607.jpg|thumb|250px|left|De la sagesse : trois livres / par Pierre Charron. – 3me ed. rev. et augm.– Paris : David Deuceur Libraire Iuré, 1607.]]
In 1601, Charron published in [[Bordeaux]] his third work, ''[[De la sagesse]],'' a system of [[moral philosophy]] that develops ideas of [[Montaigne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 978-0-521-39748-3 | page = 315 | editors = Charles B. Schmitt, Quentin Skinner (eds.) | last1 = Kraye | first1 = Jill | title = The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy | chapter = Moral Philosophy | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charron also connected Montaigne's [[scepticism]] with the anti-rational strand in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Popkin&gt;[[Richard Popkin]], ''The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza'' (1979), p. 56-7.&lt;/ref&gt;  It received the support of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] and of magistrate [[Pierre Jeannin]]. A second revised edition appeared in 1603, supported by [[Claude Dormy]], the second [[Bishop of Boulogne]].&lt;ref name=Popkin/&gt;

''De la sagesse'' also was attacked, in particular by the [[Jesuit]] [[François Garasse]] (1585–1631), who described Charron as an [[atheist]].
[[File:De la Sagesse (Of Wisdom).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pierre Charron; "Of Wisdom" London: Printed for Nathaniel Ranew and Jonathan Robinson, 1670]]
A summary and defence of the book, written shortly before his death, appeared in 1606. In 1604, Charron's friend [[Michel de la Roche]] prefixed a "Life" to an edition of ''De la sagesse,'' which depicts Charron as an amiable man of good character. His complete works, with this contribution by de la Roche, were published in 1635. An abridgment of the ''Sagesse'' is given in [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann]]'s ''Philosophie'', vol. ix. An edition with notes by A. Duval appeared in 1820. It was translated into English as ''Of Wisdome'' (1612) by [[Samson Lennard]];&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Lennard, Samson (d 1633), genealogist and translator, by [[Thompson Cooper]]. Published 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; and again by [[George Stanhope]] (1697).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Stanhope, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the major influence of Montaigne, Charron took from [[Raymond of Sabunde]] (Sibiuda).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O_FrVmnY8EMC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22Les+Trois+V%C3%A9rit%C3%A9s%22+Charron&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GzKnVA6oP9&amp;sig=xmrUxxH2agJfF6bLH5z7Qf0NpBE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DDHBTc62Asms8QONxOS8BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Les%20Trois%20V%C3%A9rit%C3%A9s%22%20Charron&amp;f=false Emmanuel Faye, ''Philosophie et perfection de l'homme: de la Renaissance à Descartes'']&lt;/ref&gt; Another influence was [[neostoicism]], as handled by [[Justus Lipsius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/neostoic/&lt;/ref&gt;

;Psychology
According to Charron, the [[soul]], located in the [[Ventricular system|ventricles]] of the [[brain]], is affected by the temperament of the individual; the dry temperament produces acute intelligence; the moist, memory; the hot, imagination. Dividing the intelligent soul into these three faculties, he writes the branches of science corresponding with each. On the nature of the soul, he quotes opinions. The belief in its [[immortality of the soul|immortality]], he says, is the most universal of beliefs, but the most feebly supported by reason. As to a human's power of attaining truth, he declares that none of our faculties enable us to distinguish truth from error. In comparing humans with animals, Charron insists that there are no breaks in nature. Though inferior in some respects, in others, animals are superior. Namely, humanity's essential qualities are vanity, weakness, inconstancy, and presumption.

;Theology
Charron writes that all religions teach that God is to be appeased by prayers, presents, vows, but especially, and, most irrationally, by human suffering {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. Each religion is said by its devotees to have commenced by [[Revelation|divine inspiration]]. A human is a [[Christian]], [[Jew]], or [[Muslim]], before he or she knows that they are persons. Furthermore, he writes that one religion is built upon another.

While Charron declares religion to be "strange to common sense," the practical result at which he arrives is that one is not to sit in judgment on his or her faith, but to be "simple and obedient," and to submit to public authority{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. He writes that this is one rule of wisdom with regard to religion. Another equally important is to avoid [[superstition]], which he defines as the belief that God is like a hard judge who, eager to find fault, narrowly examines our slightest act, that he is vengeful and hard to appease, and that, therefore, he must be flattered and won over by pain and sacrifice.

Charron states that true [[piety]], which is the first of duties, is the knowledge of God and of one's self; the latter knowledge being necessary to the former. The belief that what God sends is all good, and that all the bad is from ourselves is the abasing of humanity and the exalting of God. It leads to spiritual worship, for external ceremony is merely for our advantage, not for his glory.

;Politics
Charron is a founder of modern [[secularism]]. He declares the sovereign to be the source of law, and asserts that popular freedom is dangerous.

'''Sigismondo Boldoni''' (5 July 1597 – 3 July 1630) was an Italian writer, philosopher, and physician. Boldoni was born in [[Bellano]] and died in [[Pavia]] from the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] shortly before his 33rd birthday. At the time of his death he held the principal chair in philosophy at the [[University of Pavia]]. His literary works included a description of the geography and history of [[Lake Como]] entitled  ''Larius'' and the epic poem ''La caduta de' Longobardi'' (The Fall of the [[Lombards]]). His letters of 1629 describing the advance of invading German armies in the region around Lake Como and the plague epidemic they brought in their wake were used by [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]] as a source for his 1827 novel ''[[I Promessi Sposi]]''. &lt;ref name = "Cermenati"&gt;Cermenati, Mario (1899). [https://archive.org/stream/sigismondoboldo00cermgoog#page/n5/mode/2up ''Sigismondo Boldoni da Bellano, letterato, medico e filosofo del seicento''], pp. 11–14; 30–53; 84–86. Ermanno Loescher &amp; C. {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Boldoni was one of seven siblings born to a prominent family in [[Bellano]] on the shores of Lake Como. His brothers Giovanni Nicolò, Ottavio, Flavio, and Aurelio and his sisters Aurelia and Livia all later became writers of some note.{{efn|Livia married into the {{ill|House of Scotti|it|Scotti (famiglia)}} and Aurelia into the {{ill|House of Castiglione|it|Castiglione (famiglia)}}. Flavio became a noted jurist. Both Giovanni Nicolò and Ottavio became members of the [[Barnabites|Barnabite Order]], while Aurelio  served as the [[Provost (religion)|Provost]] of the Chiesa di San Stefano in Broglio in Milan.&lt;ref name = "Cermenati" /&gt;}} Boldoni's mother was Cecilia Cattaneo di Primaluna. His father Ottavio was a jurist and the only son of Nicolò Boldoni, the Italian court physician of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. Little is known about Boldoni's youth. He is thought to have been educated in [[Como]] and Milan, and then following in the footsteps of his grandfather he studied medicine and philosophy at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref name = "DBDI"&gt;Vescovini, Graziella Federici (1969). [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sigismondo-boldoni_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ "Boldoni, Sigismondo"]. ''[[Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]]'', Vol. 11. Treccani. Online version retrieved 12 December 2017 {{it}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Byrne"&gt;Byrne, Joseph P. (2010). [http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/656938 "Review: Sigismondo Boldoni. ''Il lario''"]. ''[[Renaissance Quarterly]]'', Vol. 63, No. 3, pp. 895-896. . Retrieved 12 December 2017 (subscription required for full access).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was the death of his father in 1615 that led to Boldoni enrolling in the University of Padua.  A quarrel over their father's inheritance between Boldoni and his brothers Flavio and Aurelio led to Boldoni wounding Flavio with a sword. Although his brothers pardoned him, he remained subject to arrest for attempted fratricide and fled Milan for Padua where he completed his studies in 1618.&lt;ref name = "DBDI" /&gt;

After leaving Padua, Boldoni spent time in Venice, [[Pesaro]] and [[Urbino]] before moving to Rome where he lived for the next four years. He became a member of the [[Accademia degli Umoristi]] and enjoyed the patronage of Cardinal [[Roberto Ubaldini]] and [[Maffeo Barberini]] (Pope Urban VIII). He was finally able to return to the [[Duchy of Milan]] in 1622. Several prominent members of the [[Roman Curia]] and the Milanese senator Giovanni Battista Arconati had successfully intervened with the authorities on his behalf over the incident with his brother. Boldoni was given a teaching position in philosophy at the [[University of Pavia]] and in 1623 was accepted into Milan's Noble College of Physicians.&lt;ref name = "DBDI" /&gt;

By his own confession, Boldoni's passion for writing led to him to devote the minimal amount of his time to teaching in Pavia, and he began writing an epic poem ''La Caduta dei Longobardi'' (The Fall of the [[Lombards]]). In 1625 he also spent three months in Rome, having travelled there via Bologna and Florence, and continued working on ''La Caduta dei Longobardi'' with the encouragement of the poet [[Alessandro Tassoni]]. Nevertheless, in 1628 Boldoni was promoted to the most important chair of philosophy at Pavia despite competition from Nicola Sacco who had taught at the university for over thirty years and was considered a renowned authority on [[Aristotle]]. Boldoni's literary activity during this time included a lecture on Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens|De Caelo]]'', editing ''Historiae patriae'' by Benedetto  Giovio (the elder brother  of [[Paolo  Giovio]]), and efforts to complete ''La Caduta dei Longobardi''.&lt;ref name = "DBDI" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Byrne" /&gt;

Boldoni's letters of 1629 written while he was sojourning in Bellano describe the ravages of the advancing German armies in the region around Lake Como and the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] which the soldiers brought in their wake. Two centuries later, the letters would serve as a source for [[Alessandro Manzoni|Manzoni]]'s novel ''[[I Promessi Sposi]]''. When the plague approached Bellano, Boldoni returned to Pavia. He died there on 3 July 1630, two days before his 33rd birthday. According to the historian [[Cesare Cantù]], he had contracted the plague from a contaminated suit of clothes brought to him by his tailor. Some 19th-century accounts of his life state that shortly before his death, Boldoni had been appointed to the principal chair of philosophy at the University of Padua. However, doubts have been cast on this because the previous holder of the chair, [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], died a year later than Boldoni and there are no records of him having retired.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cesare Cantù|Cantù, Cesare]] (1832).

==Works==
[[File:La Caduta de' Lombardi by Sigismondo Boldoni - Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece to the 1656 edition of Boldoni's ''La caduta de' Longobardi'']] 
*''Larius'' ([[Lario]]). Written in Latin between 1613 and 1615, the book is a description of the geography of Lake Como and was modeled on [[Paolo Giovio]]'s 1559 ''Descriptio Larii Lacus''. It was first published in Padua in 1617 with a dedication to Ercole Sfondrati, Duke of [[Montemarciano]] whom Boldoni credited with having given him the idea for the book. The Sfrondati family also had the fiefdom of [[Bellagio, Lombardy|Bellagio]] on Lake Como and owned a large villa there. Boldoni's book had a considerable success and was re-published several times between 1617 and 1776. It was considered remarkable not only for its accurate, detailed descriptions of the geography and landscapes of the area but also for the historical and anthropological descriptions of the settlements and towns bordering the lake and the people who lived there. ''Larius'' was published in an annotated translation into modern Italian by Franco Minonzio in 2009 and republished in 2014 under the title ''Larius: uno sguardo sul Lario di straordinaria modernità''.&lt;ref name = "Cermenati" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Byrne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|903203297}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Orationibus Patavii'' (The Padua Orations). These were three Latin orations which Boldoni delivered while at the University of Padua. The first two were delivered in 1616. One  of them was on the relation between art, science, and virtue. The other was a funeral oration for Samuele Geusuffio di Longeloy, the Vice-Rector of the university. Both of these were published in the same volume as ''Larius'' in 1617. The third oration, delivered on the departure of Nicolò [[Vendramin]] from the Captaincy of Padua in 1618, was published separately.&lt;ref name = "Cermenati" /&gt; 
*''Apotheosis in morte Philippi III'' ([[Apotheosis]] on the Death of Philip III). Written in Latin to commemorate the death of [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], it was published in two editions in 1621, one in Pavia and the other in Antwerp.&lt;ref name = "Cermenati" /&gt;
*''Epistolarum Liber'' (Book of Letters). This was published posthumously in 1651 in a single volume edited and annotated by Boldoni's brother Giovanni Nicolò. It consists of 186 letters from Boldoni written in Latin and presented chronologically. It includes the letters written from Bellano in 1629 which served as one of the sources for ''I Promessi Sposi''. A selection of those letters was translated into Italian by [[Cesare Cantù]] and published in 1831. ''Epistolarum Liber'' also contains several previously unpublished Latin poems and [[epigram]]s by Boldoni, some of which were recited at the meetings of the Accademia degli Umoristi during his sojourns in Rome, and a copy of his ''Apotheosis in morte Philippi III''.&lt;ref name = "Godt" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Cermenati" /&gt; 
*''La caduta de' Longobardi'' (The Fall of the [[Lombards]]). Written in Italian, this epic poem by Boldoni in twenty [[canto]]s was unfinished at the time of his death. It was published posthumously in 1656 with notes and additions by his brother, Giovanni Nicolò, who dedicated it to [[Christine of France|Cristina, Duchess of Savoy]]. Boldoni's feud with his brother Flavio which had led to his exile from Milan in 1616 is fictionalised in one of the episodes of the poem, although the name of the character representing his brother was changed to "Fulvio".&lt;ref name = "Cermenati" /&gt;

== Industrial career ==
As a teenager Rogerson wanted to work in the computer industry. On graduating from the University of Dundee he joined Thorn Lighting as a Fortran Programmer in 1972. He progressed to Senior Systems Analyst before transferring to Thorn EMI in 1976 as Technical Systems Manager and where he became Computer Services Manager in 1981. He left his full-time post in 1983 to pursue a career in academia. However, he maintained his link with industry through freelance consultancy and membership of several professional bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dmu.academia.edu/SimonRogerson/CurriculumVitae|title=Simon Rogerson - De Montfort University - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Rogerson joined the Department of Information Systems at Leicester Polytechnic (later to become De Montfort University&lt;ref&gt;Leicester Polytechnic became De Montfort University in accordance with the Further and Higher Education Act in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1983. He was appointed under a government initiative to attract IT industrialists in to Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;"… the government in 1983 … extra money for universities to spend on information technology courses and 'new blood' posts, mainly in science and technology" p100 in {{cite journal | last1 = Welch | first1 = Penny | year = 2009 | title = The evolution of government policy towards English higher education 1979–2007 | url = | journal = Learning and Teaching | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 96–122 | doi = 10.3167/latiss.2009.020206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he focused on lecturing about [[Project Management]], [[Systems Analysis]] and Management Support Systems. It was the latter which led him into research starting by co-authoring works with Dr Christine Fidler culminating in the book ''Strategic Management Support Systems'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson catalogue http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Strategic-Management-Support-Systems/9780273614180.page&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
Rogerson is an innovative educator. He created and was the founding course leader of a European-focused [[Business Information Systems]] Degree in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., European Language Education for information systems undergraduates, in: Student Skills for the New Europe, Cunningham, L., Editor, Higher Education for Capability, 1993, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; He developed student guides for undergraduates, publishing ''Project Skills Handbook'' &lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., Project Skills Handbook, Chartwell-Bratt, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and co-authoring ''Successful Group Work''.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., RICE, J., SAUNDERS, C. &amp; O'SULLIVAN, T., Successful group work, Kogan Page, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced a series of course modules focussing on computer and information ethics. Rogerson and Tugrul Esendal developed and delivered an innovative course module addressing quality assurance and ethics in Software Engineering for which they received a ''Research Informed Teaching Award'' in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;ESSENDAL, T. &amp; ROGERSON, S.

=== Research ===
Through sharing his IS/IT industrial experience with his students Rogerson realised that current professional practice was having little effect on reducing the risk of IS/IT system failure. This led him to focus his research on new interdisciplinary approaches to IS/IT project management, design and implementation which embraced computer and information ethics.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S. (2015) Future Vision, Special Issue - 20 years of ETHICOMP, Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society, Volume 13, Issue 3/4, pp.346 – 360.&lt;/ref&gt; He and [[Donald Gotterbarn]] created the Software Development Impact Statement (SoDIS) process which encourages those involved in IS/IT project management to consider the wider ramifications of their work.&lt;ref&gt;Gotterbarn, D and Rogerson, S (2005), Responsible Risk Analysis for Software Development: Creating the Software Development Impact Statement, Communications of the Association for Information Systems, Volume 15, Article 40. at http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol15/iss1/40/&lt;/ref&gt; An associated decision support tool, SoDIS Project Auditor was developed and successfully used around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softimp.com.au/sodis/sodis_process.html|title=Software Improvements :: SoDIS Process®|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the BCS Ethics Strategic Panel, he was one of the creators of DIODE, an ethical assessment tool for new and emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jennings | first2 = Richard C. | last3 = Pullinger | first3 = David | last4 = Rogerson | first4 = Simon | last5 = Duquenoy | first5 = Penny | year = 2011 | title = Ethical assessment of new technologies: a meta methodology | url = | journal = Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 49–64 | doi=10.1108/14779961111123223}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceived and co-developed a dependency mapping method for the implementation of technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;ROGERSON, S., WILFORD, S and FAIRWEATHER, N.B. (2013) A dependencies mapping method for personal health monitoring. in Schmidt, S. &amp; Rienhoff, O (eds).Interdisciplinary Assessment of Personal Health Monitoring. Vol 187 of Studies in Health Technology and Informatics. IOS Press, {{ISBN|9781614992554}}. available at http://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/34521&lt;/ref&gt; Rogerson’s research extended to IS/IT application areas with notable work in [[electronic voting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fairweather | first1 = NB | last2 = Rogerson | first2 = S | year = 2005 | title = Interfaces for electronic voting: focus group evidence | url = | journal = Electronic Government, an International Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 369–383 | doi = 10.1504/EG.2005.008329 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and personal health monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson was a principal investigator on EU-funded PHM-Ethics project see http://ethics.p-h-m.org/consortium.html&lt;/ref&gt;
A second important focus of Rogerson’s research is [[professionalism]] in computing. His book ''Ethical aspects of information technology: Issues for senior executives'', published in 1998 for the Institute of Business Ethics, remains one the few to address ethics of computing from a corporate perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Simon, (1998), Ethical aspects of information technology: issues for senior executives, Institute of Business Ethics, {{ISBN|0952402041}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has made significant contributions to the development of professional standards in several computer related bodies. He was a member of the executive team which developed the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) / [[IEEE Computer Society]] (IEEE-CS) Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice for which he received the ''IEEE Certificate of Appreciation'' in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;De Montfort University, RAE 2001 submission to Library and Information Management, RA6a: Additional observations, Evidence of esteem available at http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/Submissions/Textform.asp?route=2&amp;HESAInst=H-0068&amp;UoA=61&amp;Msub=Z&amp;Form=RA6a&lt;/ref&gt; He led the development of the code of ethics for the Institute for the Management of Information Systems &lt;ref&gt;MCROBB, S., ROGERSON, S., FAIRWEATHER, N.B., Code of Ethics, IMIS Journal, April, Vol 10 No 2, 2000, pp 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; and the redevelopment of the Code of Good Practice of BCS, The Chartered Institute of IT.&lt;ref&gt;http://bcs.org/upload/pdf/cop.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and 2010 Rogerson led a longitudinal survey to explore the attitudes of information systems professionals. It provides a unique snapshot as seen through an ethical lens.&lt;ref&gt;IS IT Ethical? 2010 ETHICOMP Survey of Professional Practice https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299485534_IS_IT_Ethical_2010_ETHICOMP_Survey_of_Professional_Practice?ev=prf_pub&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioner access to Rogerson’s research was made possible through his regular ''ETHIcol'' column which he wrote for the IMIS Journal from 1995 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk/resources/general/ethicol.html|title=CCSR: ETHIcol by Simon Rogerson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leadership ===
Rogerson has been the prime instigator in establishing a computer and information ethics movement in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, Terrell, "Computer and Information Ethics", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.) The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2015 Edition) available at http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/ethics-computer/&lt;/ref&gt; As founding director of the Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility (CCSR) his visionary leadership resulted in the ETHICOMP conference series, which he co-directed with [[Terrell Ward Bynum|Terry Bynum]], and the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society. Professor Krystyna Gorniak, who attended ETHICOMP 95, wrote to Rogerson on 10 April 1995, "… the newly established CCSR is one of the prominent steps towards the creation of a world-wide network of scholars who are concerned about humankind's wellbeing in the age of computers …" CCSR's web site, which was launched in 1997, became the world's leading portal for computer and information ethics. With over 2 million annual visits&lt;ref&gt;Total hits 2,117,448 worldwide, in last 12 months Usage statistics for www.ccsr.cse.dmu.ac.uk, generated 30 April 2003 23.58 BST, using Webalizer Version 2.01&lt;/ref&gt; it remained so until the advent of social media. There have been 15 ETHICOMP conferences to date with around 1,250 papers being presented.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, S. (2015) The ETHICOMP Odyssey: 1995 to 2015, ResearchGate. {{DOI| 10.13140/RG.2.1.2660.1444}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ETHICOMP'' name has become recognised and respected in the field of computer and information ethics and in 1999 it was registered as a trademark by De Montfort University to control its use and ensure ongoing integrity on behalf of the ETHICOMP community.&lt;ref&gt;Trademark no. UK00002184304  details available at https://www.ipo.gov.uk/tmcase/Results/1/UK00002184304&lt;/ref&gt; Now in its fourteenth volume, the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society aims to promote thoughtful dialogue regarding the wider social and ethical issues related to the planning, development, implementation and use of new media and information and communication technologies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/jices|title=EmeraldInsight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His leadership extends into professional bodies. As chairman of the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (2009-2013) he led its incorporation into BCS – The Chartered Institute for IT (formerly [[British Computer Society]]) in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"Following an overwhelming majority vote from its membership, the Institute for the Management of Information Systems (IMIS), has ratified its decision to merge with BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT, with immediate effect. The agreement will see all IMIS professional members transfer into BCS membership." http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/50485&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe he was one a five-person commission which undertook the review of FP6 (the European Union's Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development for the period 2002 to 2006) reporting its findings and recommendations to the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Invited member of the 2005 FP6 Monitoring Review Panel of the European Commission see report at http://ec.europa.eu/research/reports/2005/pdf/final_report_monitoring_2005_response_commission_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He led the development of the ethics guidelines for the ICT work programme of FP7 (European Union's Research and Innovation. funding programme for 2007-2013), making it mandatory for all [[European Union]] funded ICT research to address explicitly the ethical issues surrounding prospective research activity.&lt;ref&gt;Annex 5: Ethical Guidelines for undertaking ICT research in FP7, Guide for Applicants: Information and Communication Technologies ( FP7-ICT-2013-10), pp64-66. available at http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/doc/call/fp7/fp7-ict-2013-10/32886-gfa_cp-csa_for_pcp_v2_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suspended judgment''' is a cognitive process and a rational state of mind in which one withholds judgments, particularly on the drawing of moral or ethical conclusions. The opposite of suspension of judgment is '''premature judgment''', usually shortened to [[prejudice]]. While prejudgment involves drawing a conclusion or making a judgment before having the information relevant to such a judgment, suspension of judgment involves waiting for all the facts before making a decision.

Suspension of judgment is a cornerstone of standard research methodology. Much of the [[scientific method]] is designed to encourage the suspension of judgments until observations can be made, tested, and verified through [[peer review]]. The advance of [[social science]] often depends on excluding [[cognitive bias]], of which [[List of cognitive biases|many forms]] are known.

Within [[philosophy]], the suspension of judgment is typically associated with [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] and [[positivism]], but it is not limited to these areas. The 17th century rationalist [[René Descartes]], for example, used it as the cornerstone of his [[epistemology]].  In a process that he called [[methodological skepticism]], he asserted that in order to gain a solid foundation when building one's system of knowledge and belief, one must first doubt everything. Only by eliminating preconceptions and prejudgments can one come to know what is true.

Suspension of judgment is also a term used in [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] to indicate a court's decision to nullify a civil judgment. More generally in [[jurisprudence]], the ideal [[juror]] is expected to [[presumption of innocence|presume innocence]] of the person tried in court. And in the case of [[conviction]], a [[suspended sentence]] is one of the possible [[sentence (law)|sentence]]s available to the court.

{{Vajrayana}}
'''Tantra techniques''' in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] are techniques used to attain [[Buddhahood]]. 

==Tantra==
[[File:Mandala1 detail.jpg|thumb|right|238px|Detail of the mandala shown above. This is a ''[[Garbhadhatu]]'' [[mandala]], representing [[Vairocana]] Buddha surrounded by eight [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s (clockwise from top: Ratnaketu, [[Samantabhadra]], Samkusumitaraja, [[Manjusri]], [[Amitabha]], [[Avalokitesvara]], Dundubhinirghosa, [[Maitreya]]).]]

Vajrayana partially relies on various tantric techniques rooted in scriptures such as [[tantra]]s and various tantric commentaries and treatises. Tantra is defined as an inner realization that functions to prevent ordinary appearances and conceptions and to accomplish the four complete purities of a Buddha (environment, body, enjoyments and deeds)."&lt;ref&gt;''Mahamudra Tantra'': The Supreme Heart Jewel Nectar, p. 19, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2005) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-93-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deity yoga===
{{Main|Deity yoga}}

The most important aspect of the tantric path is to 'use the result as the Path'; which means that rather than placing full enlightenment as a goal far away in the future, one identifies with the indivisible [[three vajra]]s that is, the enlightened body, speech and mind of a Buddha. The practitioner focuses on and identifies with the resultant buddha-form or 'meditation deity', the ''[[yidam]]'' (Tibetan) or (Sanskrit) 'ishtadevata'.

===Symbolism===
In order to achieve this self-identification with the yidam, much symbolism, ritual and visualization is used in Buddhist tantric techniques. Tantric techniques may initially appear to consist of ritualistic nonsense; however, it should only be practiced on the basis of a thorough understanding of Buddhist philosophy and strictly following the traditions.&lt;ref name="Tharpa"&gt;''Tantric Grounds and Paths'': How to Enter, Progress on, and Complete the Vajrayana Path, p. 65, [[Tharpa Publications]] (1994) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-33-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secrecy===
Secrecy is often a cornerstone of tantric Buddhism, simply to avoid harm to oneself and to others by practicing without proper guidance. Full explanation of tantric symbolism and the psychology of the practice is forbidden to the uninitiated, which can easily lead to misunderstanding and dismissal by those who have not been initiated:&lt;ref name="Tharpa" /&gt;
{{quote|Tantra is limited to persons whose compassion is so great that they cannot bear to spend unnecessary time in attaining Buddhahood, as they want to be a supreme source of help and happiness for others quickly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama]]quoted in p. 111 of [[Jeffrey Hopkins (Tibetologist)|Jeffrey Hopkins]]'s ''Meditation on Emptiness'', Wisdom Publication, 1996, {{ISBN|0-86171-110-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Practices==
Tantric techniques include:
* Importance of a guru-disciple relationship, for example by ritual '[[Wang (Tibetan Buddhism)|empowerments]]' or 'initiations' wherein the student obtains permission from a duly-empowered guru of appropriate lineage to practise a particular tantra.
* Oral transmissions given by a tantric master. These teachings are only given personally from teacher to student and are secret, because they demand a certain maturity on the part of the student. Otherwise they may have a negative effect. Such teachings describe certain aspects of the mind and how to attain them, and help the student realize that certain practices can be dangerous to one's health if preparation is not thorough, as such states of mind are normally experienced at the time of death. A mature yogi 'dies' in the course of the meditation and comes back again, experiencing all the levels of mind.
* Use of specialized rituals and symbols rooted in Vajrayana [[cosmology]] and beliefs:
** Repetition of [[mantra]]s and [[dharani]]s.
** Use of various [[yoga]] techniques such as [[Trul Khor]], including breath control ([[Pranayama]]), [[yantra]] and the use of special hand positions ([[mudra]]s).
** Use of an extensive vocabulary of visual aids, such as cosmic [[mandala]] diagrams which teach and map pathways to spiritual enlightenment. Seed syllables in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] and [[Lendza]] are also used.
** The use of ritual objects such as the [[vajra]] and bell ([[ghanta]]), [[phurba]], hand drum ([[damaru]]), and many other symbolic tools and musical instruments.
* [[Ganachakra]] feasts with ritual consumption of meat and alcohol.

===Gathering a group of women===
In the ''Caryamelapakapradipa'', the tantric Aryadeva says to build a three story house. On the third story one "should reside together with the yoginis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wedemeyer|first1=Christian|title=Aryadeva's Lamp that Integrates the Practices (Caryamelapakapradipa) : the Gradual Path of Vajrayana Buddhism according to the Esoteric Communion Noble Tradition|date=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-9753734-5-3|pages=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With these women one is to enjoy food, drink and sexual relations:

===Guru yoga===
The [[guru]] or spiritual teacher, in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] generally the [[lama]], is essential as a guide during tantric practice. Without the guru's example, blessings and grace, genuine progress is held to be impossible for all but the most keen and gifted. Many tantric texts qualify the [[Three Jewels]] of [[refuge (Buddhism)|refuge]] thus: "Guru is Buddha, Guru is Dharma and Guru is Sangha" to reflect their importance for the disciple. In the Vajrayana the guru is considered even more compassionate and more potent than the Buddha because a direct relationship can be had with the guru. The guru also appears in the 'Inner' refuge formulation of the [[Three Roots]], the three foundations of tantric practice.

Guru yoga (or 'teacher practice'; Tibetan: ''bla ma'i rnal 'byor''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrul Rinpoche|Rinpoche, Patrul]] (author); Brown, Kerry (ed.); and Sharma, Sima (ed.)(1994). ''The Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (Tibetan title: ''kunzang lama'i shelung''). Translated by the Padmakara Translation Group. With a foreword by the Dalai Lama. San Francisco, California, USA: HarperCollins''Publishers''. {{ISBN|0-06-066449-5}} (cloth: alk. paper). p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;) is a practice that has many variations, but may be understood as a tantric devotional process where the practitioner unites their [[mindstream]] with the mindstream of the guru's [[Three Vajras]]. Guru yoga is akin to Deity yoga since the guru is engaged as the [[yidam]], or meditational deity, a [[nirmanakaya]] manifestation of a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]].  The process of guru yoga generally entails [[Creative visualization|visualization]] of a [[refuge tree]] as an invocation of the lineage, with the root [[guru]] channelling the blessings of the refuge tree (and thus the entire lineage) to the practitioner. It might involve visualization of the guru above or in front of the practitioner.  Guru yoga may also entail a [[liturgy]] or mantra such as the ''Prayer in Seven Lines'' (Tibetan: ''tshig bdun gsol 'debs''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrul Rinpoche|Rinpoche, Patrul]] (author); Brown, Kerry (ed.); and Sharma, Sima (ed.)(1994). ''The Words of My Perfect Teacher'' (Tibetan title: ''kunzang lama'i shelung''). Translated by the Padmakara Translation Group. With a foreword by the Dalai Lama. San Francisco, California, USA: HarperCollins''Publishers''. {{ISBN|0-06-066449-5}} (cloth: alk. paper). p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; an [[evocation]] and [[invocation]] of [[Padmasambhava]], though this is neither necessary nor mandatory.

===Deity yoga===
{{Main|Deity yoga}}

Deity yoga (Tibetan: ''lha'i rnal 'byor''; Sanskrit: ''Devata-yoga'') is the fundamental [[Vajrayana]] practice, involving a [[sadhana]] practice in which the practitioner visualizes himself or herself as the meditation Buddha or [[yidam]] of the sadhana. 

====Purpose====
The purpose of Deity yoga is to bring the meditator to the realization that the deity and the practitioner are in essence the same, [[non-dual]]. The yidam generally appears in a [[mandala]] and the practitioner visualizes himself or herself and their environment as the yidam and mandala of their Deity Yoga practice. This visualization method undermines a habitual belief that views of reality and self are solid and fixed, enabling the practitioner to purify spiritual obscurations (Sanskrit: ''[[kleśā (Buddhism)|klesha]]'') and to practice compassion and wisdom simultaneously:
{{quote|Deity Yoga employs highly refined techniques of creative imagination, visualisation, and photism in order to self-identify with the divine form and qualities of a particular deity as the union of method or skilful means and wisdom. As His Holiness the Dalai Lama says, "In brief, the body of a Buddha is attained through meditating on it".&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (2004). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs''. Serindia Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|1-932476-10-5}}. p. 142.

====Visualisation====
Representations of the deity, such as a statues, paintings (Tibetan: ''[[thangka]]''), or [[mandala]]s, are often employed as an aid to visualization in both the [[Generation Stage]] (Tibetan: ''Kye-rim'') and the [[Completion Stage]] (Tibetan: ''[[Dzog-rim]]'') of [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]. The mandalas are symbolic representations of sacred enclosures, [[sacred architecture]] that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a yidam. In the book, ''The World of Tibetan Buddhism'', the Dalai Lama describes a mandala: “This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity.”

====Yidams====
{{see also|sādhana}}
In the Vajrayāna Buddhism of Tibet and East Asia, which follow the [[Nalanda|Nālandā Tradition]] of [[India]]-[[Tibet]]-[[China]], there are fifteen major tantric ''sādhanās'', each connected with a specific [[yidam]]:

# [[Shurangama Mantra|Śūraṅgama]]
# [[Sitatapatra|Sitātapatrā]]
# [[Nīlakantha dhāranī|Nīlakaṇṭha]]
# [[Tara_(Buddhism)|Tārā]]
# [[Mahakala|Mahākāla]]
# [[Hayagriva|Hayagrīva]]
# [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] 
# [[Amitayus|Amitāyus]]
# [[Bhaisajyaguru|Bhaiṣajyaguru]]
# [[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]]
# [[Guhyasamaja|Guhyasamāja]]
# [[Vajrayogini|Vajrayoginī]] 
# [[Vajravarahi|Vajravarāhi]]
# [[Heruka]] 
# [[Chakrasamvara|Cakrasaṃvara]]
# [[Yamantaka|Yamāntaka]] 
# [[Vajrabhairava]]
# [[Kalachakra|Kālacakra]]
# [[Hevajra]]
# [[Chöd|Chod]]
# [[Vajrapani|Vajrapāṇi]].  

All of these are available in Tibetan form, many are available in Chinese, and some are still extant in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/dp/index.php?q=node/15 Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon - University of the West Archives of Ancient Sanskrit Manuscripts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612171717/http://www.uwest.edu/sanskritcanon/dp/index.php?q=node%2F15 |date=2010-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mandalas====
Mandalas are used as an aid in realizing the inner ground:
{{quote|[E]xternal ritual and internal sadhana form an indistinguishable whole, and this unity finds its most pregnant expression in the form of the mandala, the sacred enclosure consisting of concentric squares and circles drawn on the ground and representing that adamantine plane of being on which the aspirant to Buddhahood wishes to establish himself. The unfolding of the tantric ritual depends on the mandala; and where a material mandala is not employed, the adept proceeds to construct one mentally in the course of his meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Kvaerne, Per (1975).

===Luminosity yoga===
{{Main|Luminosity (Vajrayana)}}
[[Luminosity (Vajrayana)|Luminosity]] or Clear light ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] ''od gsal'', [[Sanskrit]] ''prabhāsvara''), in [[Vajrayana]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Bon]], refers to the nature of mind experienced in deep [[sleep]] and [[death]].&lt;ref name="PrincetonAdibuddha"&gt;Buswell, Robert E.; Lopez, Jr., Donald S. (2013). ''The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|9781400848058}}.

[[Patrul Rinpoche]] defines ground luminosity as the:

===Sexual yoga===
{{Main|Karmamudrā}}
Karmamudrā (Sanskrit; "action seal," erroneously: kāmamudrā or "desire seal," Tib.  ''las-kyi phyag-rgya'') is sexual practice with a physical or visualized consort. It cannot be practiced without the basis of the inner heat yoga, [[tummo]], of which karmamudrā is an extension.  This sadhana is a part of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]], [[Lamdre]], [[Kalachakra]] and [[Anuyoga]]. The practice is represented in [[yab-yum]] imagery.

All traditions agree that qualified lay practitioners (including former monks who have given back their vows) can use physical consorts as the [[Mahasiddhas|Vajrayana founders]] did. For example, [[Atisa]] wrote that "''Those (consecrations) on which the householder may rely include everything taught in the tantras."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=David|title=The Cakrasamvara Tantra|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York, NY|pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different stances on whether current monks can engage in the practice. The Buddhist scholar Tripitakamala felt the overall goal of [[Buddhahood]] overrides concerns for monastic vows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gray|first=David|title=The Cakrasamvara Tantra|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York, NY|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodor Lipps''' ({{IPA-de|lɪps|lang}}; 28 July 1851 – 17 October 1914) was a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]], famed for his theory regarding [[aesthetics]], creating the framework for the concept of ''Einfühlung'' (empathy)'',''  defined as, "projecting oneself onto the object of perception."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodor-Lipps|title=Theodor Lipps {{!}} German psychologist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has then led onto opening up a new branch of interdisciplinary research in the overlap between psychology and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Robin|last2=Elliott|first2=Richard George|date=December 2014|title=An Introduction to Einfühlung|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535?needAccess=true|journal=Art in Translation|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=353–376|doi=10.1080/17561310.2014.11425535|issn=1756-1310}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Biography==
Lipps was one of the most influential German university professors of his time, attracting many students from other countries. Lipps was very concerned with conceptions of art and the aesthetic, focusing much of his philosophy around such issues. Among his fervent admirers was [[Sigmund Freud]]. Lipps then being the main supporter of the idea of the [[Unconscious mind|Unconscious]].&lt;ref&gt;Pigman, G.W. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=7628894&amp;dopt=Abstract Freud and the history of empathy], ''The International journal of psycho-analysis'', 1995 Apr.; 76 (Pt 2):237–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted [[Robert Vischer]]'s notions of [[empathy]] or esthetic sympathy (''Einfühlung'', literally translated to "feeling-into"). This concept of aesthetic resonance finds parallels throughout aesthetic philosophy. Late in life, Lipps adopted some ideas from [[Edmund Husserl]]. Disliking his psychologism, some of his students joined with some of Husserl's to form a new branch of philosophy called [[phenomenology of essences]]. Among them there was [[Moritz Geiger]] who wrote one of the first phenomenological essays on the essence and meaning of empathy in which the influence of Lipps is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;Gödel, Florian (2015), "An introduction to Moritz Geiger’s psychological contribution on empathy." ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''8'''(1):161–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2618">:''For the "Three Yog" in Jainism, see [[Asrava]]''
The '''Three Yog''' are three soteriological paths mentioned in [[Bhagavad Gita]] for the liberation of human spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood, ''An introduction to Hinduism'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-521-43878-0}}, page 96&lt;/ref&gt; They are
#[[Karma Yoga]] or the Path of Action ([[karma yoga|karma]])
#[[Bhakti Yoga]] or the Path of Devotion ([[bhakti]]) to [[Ishvar]] (God)
#[[Jnana Yoga]] or the Path of Knowledge ([[Gyan (Sanskrit)|Gyan]])

These concepts are at the foundation of the [[Bhakti]] devotional movement. They are elaborated upon in the Vaishna ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

==Discussion==
The ''Bhagavad Gita'' had been made practically the only source for the means to ''[[moksha]]'' with the development of Classical Hinduism in the 8th or 9th century, and Hindu philosophers of the medieval period have tried to explain the nature of these three paths and the relation between them. 

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] tended to focus on ''gyan-yog'' exclusively, which he interpreted as the acquisition of knowledge or ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidya]]''. He considered ''karma-yoga'' to be inferior, and ignores ''bhakti-yog'' entirely. 

The 12th-century philosopher [[Ramanuja]] considered the three yog by interpreting his predecessor [[Yamunacharya]]. In Ramanujam's interpretation, ''bhakti-yog'' appears to be the direct path to ''moksh'', which is however available only to those whose inner faculties have already been trained by both ''karma-yog'' and ''gyan-yog''.&lt;ref&gt;Bunki Kimura, 'Ramanujas Theory of Three Yogas: The Way to Moksh' in: Shōun Hino (ed.) ''Three mountains and seven rivers: Prof. Musashi Tachikawa's felicitation volume'',  Motilal Banarsidass,  2004, {{ISBN|978-81-208-2468-3}}, 645-668&lt;/ref&gt;

A "fourth yog" is sometimes added, Raj Yog or "the Path of Meditation". This is the classical ''Yog'' presented in the ''Yog Sutr of Patanjali''. Patanjali's system came to be known as ''Raj Yog'' or "Royal Yog" retro-actively, in about the 15th century, as the term ''Yog'' had become popular for the general concept of a "religious path".

The systematic presentation of Hindu monotheism as divided into these four paths or "Yog" is modern, advocated by [[Swami Vivekananda]] from the 1890s.{{cn|date=June 2015}} They are presented as four paths to God suitable for four human temperaments, viz. the active, the emotional, the mystic and the philosophical.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

'''Walter Sinnott-Armstrong''' (born 1955) is an [[United States|American]] philosopher.  He specializes in [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], and more recently in [[neuroethics]], the [[philosophy of law]], and the [[philosophy of psychology|philosophy of cognitive science]]. He is the Chauncey Stillman Professor of Practical Ethics in the Department of Philosophy and the Kenan Institute for Ethics at [[Duke University]].&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.duke.edu/wsa/ |title=Bio |publisher=www.duke.edu |accessdate=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] under the supervision of [[Robert Fogelin]] and [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], and taught for many years at [[Dartmouth College]], before moving to Duke.&lt;ref&gt;http://sites.duke.edu/wsa/files/2011/05/WSA-CV-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

His ''Moral Skepticisms'' (2006) defends the view that we do not have fully adequate responses to [[moral skepticism|the moral skeptic]]. It also defends a [[coherentism|coherentist]] moral epistemology, which he has defended for decades. His ''Morality Without God?'' (2009) endorses the moral philosophy of his former colleague [[Bernard Gert]] as an alternative to [[ethics in religion|religious]] views of [[morality]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1999, he debated [[William Lane Craig]] in a debate titled "God? A Debate Between A Christian and An Atheist".&lt;ref&gt;http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Craig-Sinnott-Armstrong-God-A-Debate-between-a-Christian-and-an-Atheist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Sinnott-Armstrong argues that God is not only not essential to morality, but moral behaviour should be independent of religion. A separate entity, one could say. He strongly disagrees with several core ideas: that atheists are immoral people; that any society will become like ''Lord of the Flies'' if it becomes too secular; that without morality being laid out in front of us, like a commandment, we have no reason to be moral; that absolute moral standards require the existence of a God.

Walter Sinnott-Armstrong is a proponent of [[Contrastivism]], the idea that all claims of reasons are relative to contrast classes.&lt;ref&gt;A Contrastivist Manifesto, Walter Sinnott‐Armstrong, Social Epistemology, Vol. 22, Iss. 3, 2008, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02691720802546120 DOI:10.1080/02691720802546120]&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, ''"[the contrastivist] approach applies to explanation (reasons why things happen), moral philosophy (reasons for action), and epistemology (reasons for belief), and it illuminates moral dilemmas, [[free will]], and the [[New_riddle_of_induction|grue paradox]]."''

'''European colonialism and colonization''' was the policy or practice of acquiring full or partial political control over other societies and territories, creating a colony, occupying it with settlers, and exploiting it economically.

== History of colonisation and decolonization ==
{{Main article|History of colonialism|Decolonization}}
The [[History of colonialism|era of European colonialism]] lasted from the 16th to 19th centuries and involved European powers vastly extending their reach around the globe by establishing colonies in the [[Americas]], [[Africa]], and [[Asia]]. The dismantling of European empires following [[World War II]] saw the process of [[decolonization]] begin in earnest.&lt;ref name="Inquiring Minds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Inquiring Minds: Studying Decolonization  {{!}} Library of Congress Blog|url=http://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2013/07/inquiring-minds-studying-decolonization/|website=blogs.loc.gov|accessdate=7 May 2016|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] jointly released the [[Atlantic Charter]], which broadly outlined the goals of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S.]] and [[Government of the United Kingdom|British governments]]. One of the main clauses of the charter acknowledged the right of all people to choose their own government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/atlantic.asp|title=The Avalon Project : THE ATLANTIC CHARTER|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document became the foundation for the [[United Nations]] and all of its components were integrated into the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]], giving the organization a mandate to pursue global decolonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OztJcfbnpDsC|title=FDR and the Creation of the U.N.|last=Hoopes|first=Townsend|last2=Brinkley|first2=Douglas|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300085532|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a uniform effort by the United Nations, modern postcolonial states vary widely in terms of political and economic stability.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

== Varieties of colonialism  ==
Historians generally distinguish two main varieties established by European colonials: [[settler colonialism]], where towns and cities were established with primarily European residents and the amenities of a "Neo-Europe" and [[exploitation colonialism]], purely extractive and exploitative colonies whose primary function was to exploit resources.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; These frequently overlapped or existed on a spectrum.&lt;ref name="CitizenSubject" /&gt;

===Settler colonialism===
{{main article|Settler colonialism}}
Settler colonialism is a form of colonisation where foreign citizens move into a region and create permanent or temporary  [[Human settlement|settlements]] called [[colonies]]. The creation of settler colonies often resulted in the [[forced migration]] of indigenous peoples to less desirable territories through forced migration. This practice is exemplified in the colonies established in the [[United States]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], and [[Australia]]. Native populations frequently suffer population collapse due do contact with new diseases.&lt;ref name="Companion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwarz|first1=edited by Henry|last2=Ray|first2=Sangeeta|title=A companion to postcolonial studies|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|location=Malden, MA|isbn=0631206639|pages=360–376|edition=Reprint }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resettlement of indigenous peoples frequently occurs along demographic lines, but the central stimulus for resettlement is access to desirable territory. Regions free of tropical disease with easy access to trade routes were favorable.&lt;ref name="Wolfe"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolfe|first1=Patrick|title=Settler colonialism and the elimination of the native|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=December 2006|volume=8|issue=4|pages=387–409|doi=10.1080/14623520601056240}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Europeans settled in these desirable territories, natives were forced out and regional power was transferred to the colonialists. This type of colonial behavior led to the disruption of local customary practices and the transformation of [[socioeconomic]] systems. [[Ugandan]] academic [[Mahmood Mamdani]] cites "the destruction of communal autonomy, and the defeat and dispersal of tribal populations" as one primary factor in colonial oppression.&lt;ref name="CitizenSubject"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mamdani|first1=Mahmood|title=Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Late Colonialism|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691027937|edition=1st|url=https://www.amazon.com/Citizen-Subject-Contemporary-Colonialism-Princeton/dp/0691027935|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans justified settler colonialism with the belief that the settlers were more capable of utilizing resources and land than the indigenous populations due to the introduction of modern agricultural practices. As agricultural expansion continued through the territories, native populations were further displaced to clear fertile farmland.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt;

[[Daron Acemoglu]], [[James A. Robinson (Harvard University)|James A. Robinson]],  and [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]]  theorize that Europeans were more likely to form settler colonies in areas where they would not face high mortality rates due to disease and other [[exogenous]] factors.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; Many settler colonies sought to establish European-like institutions and practices that granted personal freedoms and allowed settlers to become wealthy by engaging in trade.&lt;ref name="SettlerCapitalism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denoon|first1=Donald|title=Settler capitalism : the dynamics of dependent development in the southern hemisphere.|date=1983|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198282915|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, jury trials, freedom from arbitrary arrest, and electoral representation were implemented to allow settlers rights similar to those enjoyed in Europe.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; Though these rights were generally not extended to the indigenous people.

===Exploitation colonialism===
{{main article|Exploitation colonialism}}
Since these colonies were created with the intent to extract resources, colonial powers has no incentive to invest in institutions or infrastructure that did not support their immediate goals of exploitation. Therefore, they established authoritarian regimes in these colonies, which had no limits on state power.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

Exploitation colonialism is a form of colonisation where foreign citizens conquer a country in order to control and capitalize on its natural resources and indigenous population. Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson argue, "institutions [established by colonials] did not introduce much protection for private property, nor did they provide checks and balances against government expropriation. In fact, the main purpose of the extractive state was to transfer as much of the resources of the colony to the colonizer, with the minimum amount of investment possible."&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; Since these colonies were created with the intent to extract resources, colonial powers has no incentives to invest in institutions or infrastructure that did not support their immediate goals. Thus, Europeans established authoritarian regimes in these colonies, which had no limits on state power.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt;

The policies and practices carried out by [[King Leopold II of Belgium]] in the [[Congo Basin]] are an extreme example of exploitation colonialism.&lt;ref name="Origins" /&gt; [[E. D. Morel]], a British journalist, author, pacifist, and politician, detailed the atrocities in multiple articles and books. Morel believed the Belgian system that eliminated traditional, commercial markets in favor of pure exploitation was the root cause of the injustice in the Congo.&lt;ref name="KingLeopold"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morel|first1=E. D. 1873–1924|title=King Leopold's rule in Africa|publisher=Nabu Press|isbn=9781172036806|url=https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Africa-1873-1924-Morel/dp/1172036802|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the "veil of philanthropic motive", King Leopold received the consent of multiple international governments (including the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]]) to assume trusteeship of the vast region in order to support the elimination of the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]]. Leopold positioned himself as proprietor of an area totaling nearly one million square miles, which was home to nearly 20 million Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Morel 1923, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

After establishing dominance in the [[Congo Basin]], Leopold extracted large quantities of [[ivory]], [[rubber]], and other natural resources. It has been estimated that Leopold made 1.1 billion in today's dollars&lt;ref name="InHeartOf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hochschild|first1=Adam|title=In the Heart of Darkness|journal=The New York Review of Books|date=October 6, 2005|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2005/10/06/in-the-heart-of-darkness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by employing a variety of exploitative tactics. Soldiers demanded unrealistic quantities of rubber be collected by African villagers, and when these goals were not met, the soldiers held women hostage, beat or killed the men, and burned crops.&lt;ref&gt;Morel 1923, pp. 31–39&lt;/ref&gt; These and other forced labor practices caused the birth rate to decline as famine and disease spread. All of this was done at very little monetary cost to Belgium. [[M. Crawford Young]], [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Political Science]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] observed, "[the Belgian companies] brought little capital – a mere 8000 pounds ... [to the Congo basin] – and instituted a reign of terror sufficient to provoke an embarrassing public-protest campaign in Britain and the United States at a time when the threshold of toleration for colonial brutality was high."&lt;ref name="ColonialComp"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Crawford|title=The African Colonial State in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300058024|page=104|jstor=j.ctt1npcmc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of government implemented in the Congo by Belgium was authoritarian and oppressive. Multiple scholars view the roots of authoritarianism under [[Mobutu]] as the result of colonial practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callaghy|first1=Thomas M.|title=The State-Society Struggle: Zaire in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231057219|url=https://www.amazon.com/State-Society-Struggle-Zaire-Comparative-Perspective/dp/0231057210|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Crawford|last2=Turner|first2=Thomas Edwin|title=The Rise and Decline of the Zairian State|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299101145|edition=1|url=https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Decline-Zairian-State/dp/0299101142|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indirect and direct rule of the colonial political system==
{{main article|Indirect rule|Direct colonial rule}}
Systems of colonial rule can be broken into the binary classifications of direct and indirect rule. During the era of colonisation, Europeans were faced with the monumental task of administrating the vast colonial territories around the globe. The initial solution to this problem was direct rule,&lt;ref name="CitizenSubject" /&gt; which involves the establishment of a centralized European authority within a territory run by colonial officials. In a system of direct rule, the native population is excluded from all but the lowest level of the colonial government.&lt;ref name="Empires"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=Michael W.|title=Empires|date=1986|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=080149334X|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mamdani defines direct rule as centralized [[despotism]]: a system where natives were not considered [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="CitizenSubject" /&gt; By contrast, indirect rule integrates pre-established local elites and native institutions into the administration of the colonial government.&lt;ref name="Empires" /&gt; Indirect rule maintains good pre-colonial institutions and fosters development within the local culture.&lt;ref name="Crowder" /&gt; Mamdani classifies indirect rule as “decentralized despotism,” where day-to-day operations were handled by local chiefs, but the true authority rested with the colonial powers.&lt;ref name="CitizenSubject" /&gt;

===Indirect rule===
In certain cases, as in [[India]], the colonial power directed all decisions related to foreign policy and defense, while the indigenous population controlled most aspects of internal administration.&lt;ref name="Iyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iyer|first1=Lakshmi|title=Direct versus Indirect Colonial Rule in India: Long-Term Consequences|journal=Review of Economics and Statistics|date=4 June 2010|volume=92|issue=4|pages=693–713|doi=10.1162/REST_a_00023|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00023#.Vy1B-2N1odc|issn=0034-6535}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to autonomous indigenous communities that were under the rule of local tribal chiefs or kings. These chiefs were either drawn from the existing social hierarchy or were newly minted by the colonial authority. In areas under indirect rule, traditional authorities acted as intermediaries for the “despotic” colonial rule,&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani 1996, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; while the colonial government acted as an advisor and only interfered in extreme circumstances.&lt;ref name="Crowder" /&gt; Often, with the support of the colonial authority, natives gained more power under indirect colonial rule than they had in the pre-colonial period.&lt;ref name="Crowder" /&gt; Mamdani points out that indirect rule was the dominant form of colonialism and therefore most who were colonized bore colonial rule that was delivered by their fellow natives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mamdani|first=Mahmood|date=1996-01-01|title=Indirect Rule, Civil Society, and Ethnicity: The African Dilemma|jstor=29766931|journal=Social Justice|volume=23|issue=1/2 (63-64)|pages=145–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of indirect rule was to allow natives to govern their own affairs through “customary law.” In practice though, the native authority decided on and enforced its own unwritten rules with the support of the colonial government. Rather than following the [[rule of law]], local chiefs enjoyed judicial, legislative, executive, and administrative power in addition to [[Arbitrariness#Law|legal arbitrariness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Direct rule===
[[File:Dames européennes-Ouidah.jpg|thumb|217x217px|European colonial women being carried in hammocks by natives in [[Ouidah]], [[Benin]] (known as [[French Dahomey]] during this period).]]
In systems of direct rule, Europeans colonial officials oversaw all aspects of governance, while natives were placed in an entirely subordinate role. Unlike indirect rule, the colonial government did not convey orders through local elites, but rather oversaw administration directly. European laws and customs were imported to supplant traditional power structures.&lt;ref name=Empires/&gt; [[Joost van Vollenhoven]], Governor-General of [[French West Africa]], 1917-1918, described the role of the traditional chiefs in by saying, “his functions were reduced to that of a mouthpiece for orders emanating from the outside…[The chiefs] have no power of their own of any kind. There are not two authorities in the [[Cercle (French colonial)|''cercle'']]'','' the French authority and the native authority; there is only one.”&lt;ref name=Crowder/&gt; The chiefs were therefore ineffective and not highly regarded by the indigenous population. There were even instances where people under direct colonial rule secretly elected a real chief in order to retain traditional rights and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delavignette|first1=R.|title=Freedom and Authority in French West Africa|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=First U.K. Edition, First printing|url=https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Authority-French-West-Africa/dp/B0006D8TI6|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct rule deliberately removed traditional power structures in order to implement uniformity across a region. The desire for regional homogeneity was the driving force behind the [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] doctrine of [[Assimilation (French colonialism)|Assimilation]].&lt;ref name="Crowder2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowder|first1=Michael|title=Senegal: Study in French Assimilation Policy|publisher=Institute of Race Relations/Oxford UP|url=https://www.amazon.com/Senegal-Study-French-Assimilation-Policy/dp/B000QXSU94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French style of colonialism stemmed from the idea that the [[French Third Republic|French Republic]] was a symbol of universal equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qykx505NU1oC|title=Assimilation and Association in French Colonial Theory, 1890-1914|last=Betts|first=Raymond F.|date=1960-01-01|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0803262477|page=16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a [[civilizing mission]], the European principles of equality were translated into legislation abroad. For the French colonies, this mean the enforcement of the French penal code, the right to send a representative to [[French Parliament|parliament]], and imposition of [[tariff]] laws as a form of economic assimilation. Requiring natives to assimilate in these and other ways, created an ubiquitous, European-style identity that made no attempt to protect native identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diouf|first=Mamadou|date=1998-10-01|title=The French Colonial Policy of Assimilation and the Civility of the Originaires of the Four Communes (Senegal): A Nineteenth Century Globalization Project|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7660.00095/abstract|journal=Development and Change|language=en|volume=29|issue=4|pages=671–696|doi=10.1111/1467-7660.00095|issn=1467-7660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous people living in colonized societies were obliged to obey European laws and customs or be deemed “uncivilized” and denied access to any European rights.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===Comparative outcomes between Indirect and Direct Rule===
Both direct and indirect rule have persistent, long term effects on the success of former colonies. Lakshmi Iyer, of [[Harvard Business School]], conducted research to determine the impact type of rule can have on a region, looking at postcolonial India, where both systems were present under [[British Raj|British rule]]. Iyer’s findings suggests that regions which had previously been ruled indirectly were generally better-governed and more capable of establishing effective institutions than areas under direct British rule. In the modern postcolonial period, areas formerly ruled directly by the British perform worse economically and have significantly less access to various [[public goods]], such as [[health care]], [[public infrastructure]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Iyer"/&gt;

In his book [[Mahmood Mamdani#Work|''Citizen and Subject: Contemporary Africa and the Legacy of Colonialism'']], Mamdani claims the two types of rule were each sides of the same coin.&lt;ref name = CitizenSubject/&gt; He explains that colonialists did not exclusively use one system of rule over another. Instead, European powers divided regions along urban-rural lines and instituted separate systems of government in each area. Mamdani refers to the formal division of rural and urban natives by colonizers as the “bifurcated state.” Urban areas were ruled directly by the colonizers under an imported system of European law, which did not recognize the validity of native institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani 1996, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, rural populations were ruled indirectly by customary and traditional law and were therefore subordinate to the “civilized” urban citizenry. Rural inhabitants were viewed as “uncivilized” subjects and were deemed unfit to receive the benefits of citizenship. The rural subjects, Mamdani observed, had only a “modicum of civil rights,” and were entirely excluded from all political rights.&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani 1996, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Mamdani argues that current issues in postcolonial states are the result of colonial government partition, rather than simply poor governance as others have claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bratton|first1=Michael|last2=van de Walle|first2=Nicholas|title=Democratic Experiments in Africa: Regime Transitions in Comparative Perspective|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521556125|page=63|url=https://www.amazon.com/Democratic-Experiments-Africa-Transitions-Comparative/dp/0521556120/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462668627&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Democratic+Experiments+in+Africa%3A+Regime+Transitions+in+Comparative+Perspective|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chabal|first1=Patrick|last2=Daloz|first2=Jean-Pascal|title=Africa Works: Disorder as Political Instrument|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253212870|pages=37–38|url=https://www.amazon.com/Africa-Works-Disorder-Political-Instrument/dp/0253212871|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current systems — in Africa and elsewhere — are riddled with an institutional legacy that reinforces a divided society. Using the examples of [[South Africa]] and Uganda, Mamdani observed that, rather than doing away with the bifurcated model of rule, postcolonial regimes have reproduced it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Mamdani 1996, pp. 287-288&lt;/ref&gt; Although he uses only two specific examples, Mamdani maintains that these countries are simply paradigms representing the broad institutional legacy colonialism left on the world.&lt;ref name=Commentary&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mamdani|first1=Mahmood|title=Commentary: Mahmood Mamdani response to Jean Copans' Review in Transformations 36|journal=Transformation|date=1999|volume=39|pages=97–101|url=http://pdfproc.lib.msu.edu/?file=/DMC/African%20Journals/pdfs/transformation/tran039/tran039006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that modern states have only accomplished "deracialization" and not democratization following their independence from colonial rule. Instead of pursuing efforts to link their fractured society, centralized control of the government stayed in urban areas and reform focused on “reorganizing the bifurcated power forged under colonialism.”&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani 1996, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Native authorities that operated under indirect rule have not been brought into the mainstream reformation process; instead, development has been “enforced” on the rural peasantry.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In order to achieve autonomy, successful democratization, and good governance, states must overcome their fundamental schisms: urban versus rural, customary versus modern, and participation versus representation.&lt;ref&gt;Mamdani 1996, pp. 296-298&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial actions and their impacts==
European colonizers engaged in various actions around the world that had both short term and long term consequences for the colonized. Numerous scholars have attempted to analyze and categorize colonial activities by determining if they have positive or negative outcomes. [[Stanley Engerman]] and [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] categorized activities, which were driven by regional factor endowments, by determining whether they were associated with high or low levels of economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Engerman |first=Stanley L. |last2=Sokoloff |first2=Kenneth L. |date=2002 |title=Factor Endowments, Inequality, and Paths of Development Among New World Economics |journal=Economía |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=41–109 |jstor=20065432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson attempted to understand what institutional changes caused previously rich countries to become poor after colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Acemoglu |first=Daron |last2=Johnson |first2=Simon |last3=Robinson |first3=James A. |date=2002 |title=Reversal of Fortune: Geography and Institutions in the Making of the Modern World Income Distribution |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=117|issue=4|pages=1231–1294|doi=10.1162/003355302320935025|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melissa Dell documented the persistent, damaging effects of colonial labor exploitation under the mit'a mining system in Peru; showing significant differences in height and road access between previous mit'a and non-mit'a communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dell|first1=Melissa|title=The Persistent Effects of Peru's Mining Mita|journal=Econometrica|date=November 2010|volume=78|issue=6|pages=1863–1903|doi=10.3982/ecta8121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miriam Bruhn and Francisco A. Gallego employed a simple tripartite classification: good, bad, and ugly. Regardless of the system of classification, the fact remains, colonial actions produced varied outcomes which continue to be relevant.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In trying to assess the legacy of colonization, some researchers have focused on the type of political and economic institutions that existed before the arrival of Europeans. Heldring and Robinson conclude that while colonization in Africa had overall negative consequences for political and economic development in areas that had previous centralized institutions or that hosted white settlements, it possibly had a positive impact in areas that were virtually stateless, like South Sudan or Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.3386/w18566 |title=Colonialism and Economic Development In Africa |last=Heldring |last2=Robinson |first=Leander |first2=James A. |date=November 2012 |work=NBER Working Paper No. 18566 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a complementary analysis, Gerner Hariri observed that areas outside Europe which had State-like institutions before 1500 tend to have less open political systems today. According to the scholar, this is due to the fact that during the colonization, European liberal institutions were not easily implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/11A9BAFB016B1D89F273DC523B394C7D/S0003055412000238a.pdf/autocratic_legacy_of_early_statehood.pdf|title=The Autocratic Legacy of Early Statehood|last=Gerner Hariri|first=Jacob|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond the military and political advantages, it is possible to explain the domination of European countries over non-European areas by the fact that capitalism did not emerge as the dominant economic institution elsewhere. As Ugo Pipitone argues, prosperous economic institutions that sustain growth and innovation did not prevail in areas like China, the Arab world, or Mesoamerica because of the excessive control of these proto-States on private matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aleph.academica.mx/jspui/handle/56789/5414|title=¿Por qué no fuera de Europa?|last=Pipitone|first=Ugo|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reorganization of borders===
{{main article|Berlin Conference}}

==== Defining Borders ====
Throughout the era of European colonization, those in power routinely partitioned land masses and created borders that are still in place today. It has been estimated that Britain and France traced almost 40% of the entire length of today’s international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nGyTAwAAQBAJ|title=Scars of Partition: Postcolonial Legacies in French and British Borderlands|last=Miles|first=William F. S.|date=2014-07-01|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803267718|page=3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-bZiKh9FHkC&amp;dq=Imbert-Vier+2011&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Tracer des frontières à Djibouti: des territoires et des hommes aux XIXe et XXe siècles|last=Imbert-Vier|first=Simon|date=2011-01-01|publisher=KARTHALA Editions|isbn=9782811105068|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes boundaries were naturally occurring, like rivers or mountains, but other times these borders were artificially created and agreed upon by colonial powers. The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 systemized European colonization in Africa and is frequently acknowledged as the genesis of the [[Scramble for Africa]]. The Conference implemented the Principle of Effective Occupation in Africa which allowed European states with even the most tenuous connection to an African region to claim dominion over its land, resources, and people. In effect, it allowed for the arbitrary construction of sovereign borders in a territory where they had never previously existed.

[[Jeffrey Herbst]] has written extensively on the impact of state organization in Africa. He notes, because the borders were artificially created, they generally do not conform to “typical demographic, ethnographic, and topographic boundaries.” Instead, they were manufactured by colonialists to advance their political goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|jstor=2706803|title=The Creation and Maintenance of National Boundaries in Africa on JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to large scale issues, like the division of ethnic groups; and small scale issues, such as families’ homes being separated from their farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpUqnwEACAAJ|title=Scars of Partition: Postcolonial Legacies in French and British Borderlands|last=Miles|first=William F. S.|date=2014-01-01|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=9780803248328|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William F. S. Miles of [[Northeastern University]], argues that this perfunctory division of the entire continent created expansive ungoverned borderlands. These borderlands persist today and are havens for crimes like human trafficking and arms smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2014, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Modern preservation of the colonially defined borders ====
Herbst notes a modern paradox regarding the colonial borders in Africa: while they are arbitrary there is a consensus among African leaders that they must be maintained. Organization of African Unity in 1963 cemented colonial boundaries permanently by proclaiming that any changes made were illegitimate.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/States-Power-Africa-Comparative-International/dp/0691010285|title=States and Power in Africa: Comparative Lessons in Authority and Control|last=Herbst|first=Jeffrey|date=2000-03-06|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691010281|edition=1|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in effect, avoided readdressing the basic injustice of colonial partition,&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2014, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; while also reducing the likelihood of inter-state warfare as territorial boundaries were considered immutable by the international community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Modern national boundaries are thus remarkably invariable, though the stability of the nation states has not followed in suit. African states are plagued by internal issues such as inability to effectively collect taxes and weak national identities. Lacking any external threats to their sovereignty, these countries have failed to consolidate power, leading to weak or [[failed states]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Though the colonial boundaries sometimes caused internal strife and hardship, some present day leaders benefit from the desirable borders their former colonial overlords drew. For example, [[Nigeria]]'s inheritance of an outlet to the sea — and the trading opportunities a port affords — gives the nation a distinct economic advantage over its neighbor, [[Niger]].&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2014, pp. 47-102&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the early carving of colonial space turned naturally occurring [[factor endowments]] into state controlled assets.

===Differing Colonial investments===
When European colonials entered a region, they invariably brought new resources and capital management. Different investment strategies were employed, which included focuses on health, infrastructure, or education. All colonial investments have had persistent effects on postcolonial societies, but certain types of spending have proven to be more beneficial than others. French [[economist]] Elise Huillery conducted research to determine specifically what types of [[public spending]] were associated with high levels of current development. Her findings were twofold. First, Huillery observes that the nature of colonial investments can directly influence current levels of performance. Increased spending in education lead to higher school attendance; additional doctors and [[Health facility|medical facilities]] decreased [[Public health|preventable illnesses]] in children; and a colonial focus on infrastructure translated into more modernized infrastructure today. Adding to this, Huillery also learned that early colonial investments instituted a pattern of continued spending that directly influenced the quality and quantity of [[public goods]] available today.&lt;ref name="HistoryMatters" /&gt;

===Land, property rights, and labour===

==== Land and property rights ====
According to Mahmood Mamdani, prior to colonization, indigenous societies did not necessarily consider land [[private property]]. Alternately, land was a communal resources that everyone could utilize. Once natives began interacting with colonial settlers, a long history of land abuse followed. Extreme examples of this include [[Trail of Tears]], a series of forced relocations of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] following the [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]], and the [[apartheid]] system in [[South Africa]]. Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe points out that in these instances, natives were not only driven off land, but the land was then transferred to private ownership. He believes that the “frenzy for native land” was due to economic immigrants that belonged to the ranks of Europe’s landless.&lt;ref name="Wolfe" /&gt;

Making seemingly contradictory argument, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson view strong [[property rights]] and ownership as an essential component of institutions that produce higher [[per capita income]]. They expand on this by saying property rights give individuals the incentive to invest, rather than stockpile, their assets. While this may appear to further encourage colonialists to exert their rights through exploitative behaviors, instead it offers protection to native populations and respects their customary ownership laws. Looking broadly at the European colonial experience, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson explain that exploitation of natives transpired when stable property rights intentionally did not exist. These rights were never implemented in order to facilitate the predatory extraction of resources from indigenous populations. Bringing the colonial experience to the present that, they maintain that broad property rights set the stage for the effective institutions that are fundamental to strong democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Acemoglu |first=Daron |last2=Johnson |first2=Simon |last3=Robinson |first3=James |chapter=Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth |title=Handbook of Economic Growth |volume=1 (Part A) |year=2005 |pages=385–472 |doi=10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of Acemoglu, Robinson and Johnson hypothesis is in the work of La Porta, ''et al.'' In a study of the legal systems in various countries, La Porta, ''et al.'' found that in those places that were colonized by the United Kingdom and kept its common-law system, the protection of property right is stronger compared to the countries that kept the French civil law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=La Porta |first=Rafael |last2=Lopez de Silanes |first2=Florencio |last3=Shleifer |first3=Andrei |last4=Vishny |first4=Robert |date=1998 |title=Law and Finance |journal=Journal of Political Economy |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1113–1155 |doi=10.1086/250042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of India, Abhijit Banerjee and Lakshmi Iyer found divergent legacies of the British land tenure system in India. The areas where the property rights over the land were given to landlords registered lower productivity and agricultural investments in post-Colonial years compared to areas where land tenure was dominated by cultivators. The former areas also have lower levels of investment in health and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Banerjee |first=Abhijit |last2=Iyer |first2=Lakshmi |date=September 2005 |title=History, Institutions, and Economic Performance: The Legacy of Colonial Land Tenure Systems in India |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=1190–1213 |doi=10.1257/0002828054825574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Labour exploitation ====
Prominent [[Guyana|Guyanese]] scholar and [[Activism|political activist]] [[Walter Rodney]] wrote at length about the economic exploitation of Africa by the colonial powers. In particular, he saw [[Laborer|labourers]] as an especially abused group. While a capitalist system almost always employs some form of [[wage labour]], the dynamic between labourers and colonial powers left the way open for extreme misconduct. According to Rodney, African workers were more exploited than Europeans because the colonial system produced a complete monopoly on political power and left the working class small and incapable of [[collective action]]. Combined with deep-seated [[racism]], native workers were presented with impossible circumstances. The racism and superiority felt by the colonizers enabled them to justify the systematic underpayment of Africans even when they were working alongside European workers. Colonialists further defended their disparate incomes by claiming a higher cost of living. Rodney challenged this pretext and asserted the European [[quality of life]] and [[cost of living]] were only possible because of the exploitation of the colonies and African living standards were intentionally depressed in order to maximize revenue. In its wake, Rodney argues colonialism left Africa vastly [[Underdevelopment|underdeveloped]] and without a path forward.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Europe-Underdeveloped-Africa-Walter-Rodney/dp/1574780484|title=How Europe Underdeveloped Africa|last=Rodney|first=Walter|date=2011-10-01|publisher=Black Classic Press|isbn=9781574780482|pages=147–203|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal consequences of colonialism==

===Ethnic identity===
The colonial changes to ethnic identity have been explored from the political, sociological, and psychological perspectives. In his book [[The Wretched of the Earth]],  [[Afro-Caribbean]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[revolutionary]] [[Frantz Fanon]] claims the colonized must “ask themselves the question constantly: ‘who am I?’"&lt;ref&gt;Fanon 1961, 201&lt;/ref&gt; Fanon uses this question to express his frustrations with fundamentally dehumanizing character of colonialism. Colonialism in all forms, was rarely an act of simple political control. Fanon argues the very act of colonial domination has the power to warp the personal and ethnic identities of natives because it operates under the assumption of perceived superiority. Natives are thus entirely divorced from their ethnic identities, which has been replaced by a desire to emulate their oppressors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fanon|first1=Frantz|title=The Wretched of the Earth|publisher=Grove/Atlantic, Inc.|isbn=9780802198853|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-XGKFJq4eccC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic manipulation manifested itself beyond the personal and internal spheres. [[Scott Straus]] from the [[University of Wisconsin]] describes the ethnic identities that partially contributed to the [[Rwandan genocide]]. In April 1994, following the assassination of Rwanda’s President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]], [[Hutus]] of Rwanda turned on their [[Tutsi]] neighbors and slaughtered between 500,000 and 800,000 people in just 100 days. While politically this situation was incredibly complex, the influence ethnicity had on the violence cannot be ignored. Before the German colonization of Rwanda, the identities of Hutu and Tutsi were not fixed. Germany ruled Rwanda through the Tutsi dominated monarchy and the Belgians continued this following their takeover. Belgian rule reinforced the difference between Tutsi and Hutu. Tutsis were deemed superior and were propped up as a ruling minority supported by the Belgians, while the Hutu were systematically repressed. The country’s power later dramatically shifted following the so-called Hutu Revolution, during which Rwanda gained independence from their colonizers and formed a new Hutu-dominated government. Deep-seated ethnic tensions did not leave with the Belgians. Instead, the new government reinforced the cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Straus|first1=Scott|title=The Order of Genocide: Race, Power, And War in Rwanda|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=9780801444487|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=9780801444487|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil society===
[[Joel S. Migdal|Joel Migdal]] of the [[University of Washington]] believes weak postcolonial states have issues rooted in civil society. Rather than seeing the state as a singular dominant entity, Migdal describes “weblike societies” composed of social organizations. These organizations are a melange of ethnic, cultural, local, and familial groups and they form the basis of our society. The state is simply one actor in a much larger framework. Strong states are able to effectively navigate the intricate societal framework and exert social control over people’s behavior. Weak states, on the other hand, are lost amongst the fractionalized authority of  a complex society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4280.html|title=Migdal, J.S.: Strong Societies and Weak States: State-Society Relations and State Capabilities in the Third World. (Paperback)|website=press.princeton.edu|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migdal expands his theory of state-society relations by examining [[Sierra Leone]]. At the time of Migdal’s publication (1988), the country’s leader, [[President of Sierra Leone|President]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], was widely viewed as weak and ineffective. Just three years later, the country erupted into [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], which continued for nearly 11 years. The basis for this tumultuous time, in Migdal’s estimation, was the fragmented social control implemented by British colonizers. Using the typical British system of indirect rule, colonizers empowered local chiefs to mediate British rule in the region, and in turn, the chiefs exercised social control. After achieving independence from Great Britain, the chiefs remained deeply entrenched and did not allow for the necessary consolidation of power needed to build a strong state. Migdal remarked, “Even with all the resources at their disposal, even with the ability to eliminate any single strongman, state leaders found themselves severely limited.”&lt;ref&gt;Migdal 1988, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary for the state and society to form a mutually beneficially symbiotic relationship in order for each to thrive. The peculiar nature of postcolonial politics makes this increasingly difficult.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Colonial policies contributing to indigenous deaths from disease===
[[File:Stpauls-middlechurch-man.jpg|thumb|St. Paul's Indian Industrial School, Middlechurch, [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], 1901. This school was part of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]].]]
John S. Milloy published evidence indicating that colonialists had intentionally concealed information on the spread of disease in his book ''A National Crime: The Canadian Government and the Residential School System, 1879 to 1986'' (1999). According to Milloy, the [[Government of Canada]] was aware of the origins of many diseases but maintained a secretive policy. Medical professionals had knowledge of this policy, and further, knew it was causing a higher death rate among indigenous people, yet the policy continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''A National Crime: the Canadian government and the residential school system, 1879-1986'|date=1999|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence suggests, government policy was not to treat natives infected with tuberculosis or smallpox, and native children infected with smallpox and [[tuberculosis]] were deliberately sent back to their homes and into native villages by residential school administrators. Within the residential schools, there was no segregation of sick students from healthy students, and students infected with deadly illnesses were frequently admitted to the schools, where infections spread among the healthy students and resulted in deaths; death rates were at least 24% and as high as 69%.&lt;ref name="Curry, Bill and Karen Howlett"&gt;{{cite news|last=Curry, Bill and Karen Howlett|title=Natives died in droves as Ottawa ignored warnings|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/natives-died-in-droves-as-ottawa-ignored-warnings/article754798/|accessdate=February 25, 2012|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=April 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuberculosis was the leading cause of death in Europe and North America in the 19th century, accounting for about 40% of working-class deaths in cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocp.hul.harvard.edu/contagion/tuberculosis.html Tuberculosis in Europe and North America, 1800–1922]. ''The Harvard University Library, Open Collections Program: Contagion.''&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by tuberculosis. European governments, and medical professionals in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milloy|first=John S.|title=A National Crime: the Canadian government and the residential school system, 1879-1986|year=1999|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-646-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; were well aware that tuberculosis and smallpox were highly contagious, and that deaths could be prevented by taking measures to quarantine patients and inhibit the spread of the disease. They failed to do this, however, and imposed laws that in fact ensured that these deadly diseases spread quickly among the indigenous population. Despite the high death rate among students from contagious disease, in 1920 the Canadian government made attendance at residential schools mandatory for native children, threatening non-compliant parents with fines and imprisonment. John S. Milloy argued that these policies regarding disease were not conventional genocide, but rather policies of neglect aimed at assimilating natives.&lt;ref name="Curry, Bill and Karen Howlett"/&gt;

Some historians, such as Roland Chrisjohn, director of Native Studies at [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]], have argued that some European colonists, having discovered that indigenous populations were not immune to certain diseases, deliberately spread diseases to gain military advantages and subjugate local peoples. In his book ''The Circle Game: Shadows and Substance in the Indian Residential School Experience in Canada,'' Chrisjohn argues that the Canadian government followed a deliberate policy amounting to [[genocide]] against native populations. British officers, including the top British commanding generals [[Jeffery Amherst|Amherst]] and [[General Thomas Gage|Gage]], ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted the use of smallpox against the Native Americans during the [[siege of Fort Pitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Circle-Game-Substance-Residential-Experience/dp/1894778057|title=The Circle Game: Shadows and Substance in the Indian Residential School Experience in Canada Revised Edition|last=Chrisjohn|first=Roland|last2=Young|first2=Sherri|last3=Maraun|first3=Michael|date=2006-01-17|publisher=Theytus Books|isbn=9781894778053|edition=Revised|location=Penticton, BC|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Dixon recognized, "there is no doubt that British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy."&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;Dixon, David; [https://books.google.com/books?id=UeaN0-Ra64oC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America]; (pg. 152-155); University of Oklahoma Press; 2005; {{ISBN|0-8061-3656-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Thornton went further by saying, "it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox".&lt;ref name="Thornton1987"&gt;{{cite book|last=Thornton|first=Russel|title=American Indian Holocaust and Survival: A Population History : Since 1492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9iQYSQ9y60MC&amp;pg=PA79|year=1987|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2220-5|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the exact effectiveness of the British attempts at infecting Native Americans is unknown, the outbreak of smallpox among the Indians has been documented.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, ''Never Come to Peace'', 152–55; McConnell, ''A Country Between'', 195–96; Dowd, ''War under Heaven'', 190.

==Historic debates surrounding colonialism==
[[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] (1484-1566) was the first [[Protector of the Indians]] appointed by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]]. During his time in the Spanish West Indies, he bore firsthand witnessed many of the atrocities committed by Spanish colonists against the natives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Zinn_Reader.html?id=VotAP9b-KjkC|title=The Zinn Reader: Writings on Disobedience and Democracy|last=Zinn|first=Howard|date=2011-01-04|publisher=Seven Stories Press|isbn=9781583229460|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this experience, he reformed his view on colonialism and determined the Spanish people would suffer divine punishment if the gross mistreatment in the Indies continued. de Las Casas detailed his opinion in his book ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies|The Destruction of the Indies: A Brief Account]]'' (1552'').''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krP0qAvXK4QC|title=The Devastation of the Indies: A Brief Account|last=Casas|first=Bartolomé de Las|date=1974-01-01|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=9780801844300|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the sixteenth century, [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Catholic priest|priest]] and [[philosopher]] [[Francisco Suarez]] (1548-1617) expressed his objections to colonialism in his work ''De Bello et de Indis'' (On War and the Indies). In this text and others, Suarez supported [[natural law]] and conveyed his beliefs that all humans had rights to life and liberty. Along these lines, he argued for the limitation of the imperial powers of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] by underscoring the natural rights of [[indigenous people]]. Accordingly, native inhabitants of the colonial [[Spanish West Indies]] deserved independence and each island should be considered a sovereign state with all the legal powers of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Francisco-Suarez-Benjamin-Hill/dp/0199583641|title=The Philosophy of Francisco Suarez|date=2012-03-24|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199583645|editor-last=Hill|editor-first=Benjamin|edition=1|language=English|editor-last2=Lagerlund|editor-first2=Henrik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent [[Age of Enlightenment|French Enlightenment]] philosopher and [[Encyclopédie]] founder [[Denis Diderot]] was openly critical of [[ethnocentrism]] and the colonisation of [[Tahiti]]. In a series of philosophical dialogues entitled ''[[Supplément au voyage de Bougainville]]'' (1772), Diderot imagines several conversations between Tahitians and Europeans. The two speakers discuss their cultural differences, which acts as a critique of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24280417M/Suppl%C3%A9ment_au_voyage_de_M._de_Bougainville_ou_Journal_d'un_voyage_autour_du_monde_fait_par_MM._Banks|title=Supplément au voyage de M. de Bougainville ou Journal d'un voyage autour du monde, fait par MM.

==Modern theories of colonialism==
The effects of European colonialism have consistently drawn academic attention in the decades since decolonization. New theories continue to emerge. The field of colonial and postcolonial studies has been implemented as a [[Major (academic)|major]] in multiple [[University|universities]] around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/info/20044/institute_for_colonial_and_postcolonial_studies|title=Institute for Colonial and Postcolonial Studies - Faculty of Arts - University of Leeds|website=www.leeds.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/research/specialisations/post-colonial|title=Colonial and Post Colonial Studies|last=University|first=La Trobe|website=www.latrobe.edu.au|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as.tufts.edu/ColonialismStudies/|title=Tufts University: Colonialism Studies: Home|last=|first=|date=|website=as.tufts.edu|publisher=|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dependency theory ===
{{Main article|Dependency theory|}}Dependency theory is an [[Economics#Theory|economic theory]] which postulated that advanced and industrialized “metropolitan” nations have been able to develop because of the existence of less-developed “satellite” states. Satellite nations are anchored to, and subordinate to, metropolitan countries because of the international division of labor. Satellite countries are thus dependent on metropolitan states and incapable of charting their own economic path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Development-Economics-Reader-Giorgio-Secondi/dp/0415771579|title=The Development Economics Reader|last=Ferraro|first=Vincent|date=2008-06-18|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415771573|editor-last=Secondi|editor-first=Giorgio|edition=1|pages=58–64|language=English|chapter=Dependency Theory: An Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Robert R.|last2=Chernotsky|first2=Harry I.|last3=Geller|first3=Daniel S.|date=1975-01-01|title=A Preliminary Test of the Theory of Dependency|jstor=421222|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=303–330|doi=10.2307/421222}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvWRAAAAIAAJ|title=The Underdevelopment of Development: Essays in Honor of Andre Gunder Frank|last=Chew|first=Sing C.|last2=Denemark|first2=Robert A.|date=1996-01-29|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780803972605|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was introduced in the 1950s by Raul Prebisch, Director of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America after observing that economic growth in wealthy countries did not translate into economic growth in poor countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prebisch.cepal.org/en/works/economic-development-latin-america-and-its-principal-problems|title=Textos Esenciales {{!}} Raúl Prebisch y los desafíos del Siglo XXI|last=CEPAL|website=prebisch.cepal.org|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theorists believe this is due to the import-export relationship between rich and poor countries. [[Walter Rodney]], in his book ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]'', used this framework when observing the relationship between European trading companies and African peasants living in postcolonial states. Through the labour of peasants, African countries are able to gather large quantities of [[raw materials]]. Rather than being able to export these materials directly to Europe, states must work with a number of trading companies, who collaborated to keep purchase prices low. The trading companies then sold the materials to European manufactures at inflated prices. Finally the manufactured goods were returned to Africa, but with prices so high, that labourers were unable to afford them. This led to a situation where the individuals who labored extensively to gather raw materials were unable to benefit from the finished goods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Neocolonialism ===
{{Main article|Neocolonialism|}}

Neocolonialism is the continued economic and cultural control of countries that have been decolonized. The first documented use of the term was by Former [[President of Ghana|President]] of [[Ghana]] [[Kwame Nkrumah]] in the 1963 preamble of the Organization of African States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0COAgAAQBAJ|title=Statebuilding and Justice Reform: Post-Conflict Reconstruction in Afghanistan|last=Tondini|first=Matteo|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135233181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nkrumah expanded the concept of neocolonialism in the book ''Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of Imperialism'' (1965). In Nkrumah's estimation, traditional forms of colonialism have ended, but many African states are still subject to external political and economic control by Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53xumwEACAAJ|title=Neo-Colonialism: The Last Stage of Imperialism|last=Nkrumah|first=Kwame|date=1974-01-01|publisher=Panaf|isbn=9780901787231|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neocolonialism is related to [[dependency theory]] in that they both acknowledge the financial exploitation of poor counties by the rich,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nkrumah 1965, pp. ix-xx&lt;/ref&gt; but neocolonialism also includes aspects of [[cultural imperialism]]. Rejection of cultural neocolonialism formed the basis of [[négritude]] philosophy, which sought to eliminate colonial and racist attitudes by affirming the values of "the black world" and embracing "blackness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/negritude/|title=Négritude|last=Diagne|first=Souleymane Bachir|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaDLD4O5MdIC|title=Discourse on Colonialism|last=Césaire|first=Aimé|date=2001-01-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9781583674109|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benign colonialism===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bestuursambtenaar van Seram tijdens een reis bij de Talsetibaai TMnr 10001632.jpg|thumb|250px|Dutch colonial administrator of the [[Maluku Islands|South Moluccas]], picture taken 1940.]]
''Benign colonialism'' is a supposed form of colonialism in which benefits outweighed risks for indigenous populations whose lands, resources, rights and freedoms were preempted by a colonising nation-state. The historical source for the concept of benign colonialism resides with [[John Stuart Mill]] who was chief examiner of the [[British East India Company]] dealing with British interests in [[India]] in the 1820s and 1830s. Mill's most well-known essays on benign colonialism are found in "Essays on some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart. 1844. "[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12004/12004-8.txt Essays on some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy]."&lt;/ref&gt;

Mill's view contrasted with Burkean orientalists. Mill promoted the training of a corps of bureaucrats indigenous to India who could adopt the modern liberal perspective and values of 19th century Britain.&lt;ref name=doyle&gt;Doyle, Michael W. 2006. "[http://www.princeton.edu/~pcglobal/conferences/normative/papers/Session5_Doyle.pdf Sovereignty and Humanitarian Military Intervention]." Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill predicted this group's eventual governance of India would be based on British values and perspectives.

Advocates of the concept cite improved standards of health and education, employment opportunities, liberal markets, developed natural resources and introduced improved governance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prc.utexas.edu/prec/en/publications/articles/SocialImpact_2007.pdf Robert Woodberry- The Social Impact of Missionary Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt; The first wave of benign colonialism lasted from c. 1790-1960, according to Mill. The second wave included neocolonial policies exemplified in [[Hong Kong]], where unfettered expansion of the market created a new form of benign colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, Henry C. K. 2003. "[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/EE14Ad01.html China: a Case of Self-Delusion: Part 1: From colonialism to confusion]." ''Asia Times''. May 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Political interference and military intervention in independent nation-states, such as [[Iraq]],&lt;ref name=doyle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campo, Juan E. 2004. "[http://hir.harvard.edu/articles/?id=1223 Benign Colonialism? The Iraq War: Hidden Agendas and Babylonian Intrigue]." ''Interventionism''. 26:1. Spring.&lt;/ref&gt; is also discussed under the rubric of benign colonialism in which a foreign power preempts national governance to protect a higher concept of freedom. The term is also used in the 21st century to refer to US, French and [[China|Chinese]] market activities in African countries with massive quantities of underdeveloped nonrenewable [[natural resources]].{{Citation needed |date=April 2016}}

These views have support from some academics. [[Economic historian]] [[Niall Ferguson]] argued that [[empire]]s can be a good thing provided that they are "liberal empires". He cites the British Empire as being the only example of a "liberal empire" and argues that it maintained the rule of law, benign government, [[free trade]] and, with the abolition of slavery, free labour.&lt;ref name=ferguson&gt;[[Niall Ferguson]], ''Empire: How Britain Made the Modern World'' and ''Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire''&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Rudolf von Albertini agrees that, on balance, colonialism can be good. He argues that colonialism was a mechanism for modernisation in the colonies and imposed a peace by putting an end to tribal warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Albertini, Rudolph von, and Wirz, Albert. ''European Colonial Rule, 1880-1914: The Impact of the West on India, South East Asia and Africa''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians L.H Gann and Peter Duignan have also argued that Africa probably benefited from colonialism on balance. Although it had its faults, colonialism was probably "one of the most efficacious engines for cultural diffusion in world history".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Lewis H. Gann and Peter Duignan, ''The Burden of Empire: A Reappraisal of Western Colonialism South of the Sahara''&lt;/ref&gt; These views, however, are controversial and are rejected by some who, on balance, see colonialism as bad. The economic historian [[David Kenneth Fieldhouse]] has taken a kind of middle position, arguing that the effects of colonialism were actually limited and their main weakness wasn't in deliberate [[underdevelopment]] but in what it failed to do.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;D. K. Fieldhouse, ''The West and the Third World''&lt;/ref&gt; Niall Ferguson agrees with his last point, arguing that colonialism's main weaknesses were sins of omission.&lt;ref name=ferguson/&gt; [[Marxist]] historian [[Bill Warren (British Communist)|Bill Warren]] has argued that whilst colonialism may be bad because it relies on force, he views it as being the genesis of [[Third World]] development.&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;{{cite book|title=Imperialism: Pioneer of Capitalism|last=Warren|first=Bill|publisher=Verso|year=1980|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zenodotus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ζηνόδοτος}}) was a [[Greek language|Greek]] grammarian, [[literary critic]], [[Homeric scholarship|Homeric scholar]], and the first [[librarian]] of the [[Library of Alexandria]].{{efn|name="Two Others}} A native of [[Ephesus]] and a pupil of [[Philitas of Cos]], he lived during the reigns of the first two [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]], and was at the height of his reputation about 280 BC.

==Biography==
Zenodotus was the first superintendent of the [[Library of Alexandria]] and the first critical editor ({{lang|grc|διορθωτής}} ''diorthōtes'') of [[Homer]]. His colleagues in the librarianship were [[Alexander Aetolus|Alexander of Aetolia]] and [[Lycophron of Chalcis]], to whom were allotted the tragic and comic writers respectively, Homer and other epic poets being assigned to Zenodotus.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

Although he has been reproached with arbitrariness and an insufficient knowledge of Greek, his recension undoubtedly laid a sound foundation for future criticism. Having collated the different manuscripts in the library, he expunged or obelized doubtful verses, transposed or altered lines, and introduced new readings. It is probable that he was responsible for the division of the Homeric poems into twenty-four books each (using capital Greek letters for the ''[[Iliad]]'', and lower-case for the ''[[Odyssey]]''){{dubious|date=March 2016}}, and possibly was the author of the calculation of the days of the ''Iliad'' in the ''[[Tabula Iliaca]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

He does not appear to have written any regular commentary on Homer, but his Homeric {{lang|grc|γλῶσσαι}} (''[[wikt:γλῶσσα|glōssai]]'', "lists of unusual words, [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]]") probably formed the source of the explanations of Homer attributed by the grammarians to Zenodotus. He also lectured upon [[Hesiod]], [[Anacreon (poet)|Anacreon]] and [[Pindar]], if he did not publish editions of them. He is further called an epic poet by the ''[[Suda]],'' and three epigrams in the ''[[Greek Anthology]]'' are assigned to him.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=973}}

In addition to his other scholarly work, Zenodotus introduced an organization system on the materials in the [[Library of Alexandria]] whereby texts were assigned to different rooms based on their subject matter. Within their subjects, Zenodotus organized the works [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] by the first letter of the name of their author. The principle of alphabetic organization was introduced by Zenodotus.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}  In addition, library staff attached a small tag to the end of each scroll which contained information on each work’s author, title, and subject so that materials could be easily returned to the area in which they had been classified, but also so that library users did not have to unroll each scroll in order to see what it contained. This was the first recorded use of [[metadata]], a landmark in library history.{{sfn|Phillips|2010}}

'''Étienne''' or '''Estienne de La Boétie''' ({{IPA-fr|etjɛn də la bɔesi|lang|Fr-Étienne de la Boétie.oga}}&lt;small&gt;, also&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|bwati|}} &lt;small&gt;or&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-fr|bɔeti|}};&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bonnefon (1892). ''Œuvres complètes d'Estienne de La Boétie'' (Bordeaux: C. Gounouilhou, and Paris: J. Rouam et Cie.), pp. 385–6 (available online in pdf format at [[Gallica]]).&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-oc|Esteve de La Boetiá}}&lt;!--, {{IPA-oc|eːˈteve de la bweˈtjɔ|local}}--&gt;; 1 November 1530 – 18 August 1563) was a [[France|French]] judge, writer and "a founder of modern [[political philosophy]] in [[France]]".&lt;ref name="Rothbard"&gt;[[Murray Rothbard]]. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard78.html "Ending Tyranny Without Violence"].&lt;/ref&gt; He is best remembered as the great and close friend of the eminent essayist [[Michel de Montaigne]] "in one of history's most notable [[friendship]]s".&lt;ref name=Rothbard/&gt;

== Life ==
La Boétie was born in [[Sarlat-la-Canéda|Sarlat]], in the [[Périgord]] region of southwest France, in 1530 to an aristocratic family. His father was a royal official of the Périgord region and his mother was the sister of the president of the [[Bordeaux]] Parlement (assembly of lawyers). Orphaned at an early age, he was brought up by his uncle and namesake, the curate of Bouilbonnas, and received his law degree from the [[University of Orléans]] in 1553. His great and precocious ability earned La Boétie a royal appointment to the Bordeaux Parlement the following year, despite his being under the minimum age. There he pursued a distinguished career as judge and diplomatic negotiator until his untimely death in 1563 at the age of thirty-two. La Boétie was also a distinguished poet and humanist, translating [[Xenophon]] and [[Plutarch]], and being closely connected with the leading young [[La Pléiade|Pleiade]] group of poets, including [[Pierre Ronsard]], [[Jean Dorat]] and [[Jean-Antoine de Baif]].&lt;ref name=Rothbard/&gt; La Boétie opposed religious toleration, arguing that allowing Protestants and Catholics to both conduct worship services would undermine the crown.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He served with [[Montaigne]] in the [[Bordeaux]] ''[[parlement]]'' and is immortalized in Montaigne's [[essay]] on [[friendship]].

== Writings ==
La Boétie's writings include a few [[sonnet]]s, translations from the classics and an essay attacking [[absolute monarchy]] and [[tyranny]] in general, ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude|Discours de la servitude volontaire ou le Contr'un]]'' (''Discourse on Voluntary Servitude, or the Anti-Dictator''). The essay asserts that tyrants have power because the people give it to them. [[Liberty]] has been abandoned once by society, which afterward stayed corrupted and prefers the slavery of the [[courtesan]] to the freedom of one who refuses to dominate as he refuses to [[Obedience (human behavior)|obey]]. Thus, La Boétie linked together obedience and domination, a relationship which would be later theorised by latter [[anarchism|anarchist]] thinkers. By advocating a solution of simply refusing to support the tyrant, he became one of the earliest advocates of [[civil disobedience]] and [[nonviolent resistance]]. [[Lew Rockwell]] summarizes La Boétie's political philosophy as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;To him, the great mystery of politics was obedience to rulers. Why in the world do people agree to be looted and otherwise oppressed by government overlords? It is not just fear, Boetie explains in "The Discourse on Voluntary Servitude," for our consent is required. And that consent can be non-violently withdrawn.&lt;ref name=Rothbard/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was once thought following Montaigne's claims that La Boétie wrote the essay in 1549 at the age of eighteen, but recent authorities argue that it is "likely that the ''Discourse'' was written in 1552 or 1553, at the age of twenty-two, while La Boétie was at the university".&lt;ref&gt;Rockwell, Lew (11 February 2011), p. 38. n. 2. "Having remained long in manuscript, the actual date of writing the ''Discourse of Voluntary Servitude'' remains a matter of dispute. It seems clear, however, and has been so accepted by recent authorities, that Montaigne's published story that La Boétie wrote the ''Discourse'' at the age of eighteen or even of sixteen was incorrect. Montaigne's statement, as we shall see further below, was probably part of his later campaign to guard his dead friend's reputation by dissociating him from the revolutionary Huguenots who were claiming La Boétie's pamphlet for their own. Extreme youth tended to cast the ''Discourse'' in the light of a work so youthful that the radical content was hardly to be taken seriously as the views of the author. Internal evidence as well as the erudition expressed in the work make it likely that the ''Discourse'' was written in 1552 or 1553, at the age of twenty-two, while La Boétie was at the university." See Paul Bonnefon (1892), pp. 390–1; and Donald Frame, ''Montaigne: A Biography'' (New York: Harcourt Brace, &amp; World, 1965), p. 71 (37–38 n. 2).&lt;/ref&gt; Some Montaigne scholars have argued that the essay was in fact the work of Montaigne himself. The essay was circulated privately and not published until 1576 after La Boétie's death. He died in [[Germignan (France)|Germignan]] near [[Bordeaux]] in 1563. His last days are described in a long letter from Montaigne to his own father.

== Influence==
In the 20th century, many European anarchists began to cite La Boétie as an influence, including [[Gustav Landauer]], [[Bart de Ligt]] and [[Simone Weil]].&lt;ref&gt;Roland Bleiker (2000), &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Popular Dissent. Human Agency and Global Politics''. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521778298}} (pp. 86–87).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomism|Autonomist Marxist]] thinker [[John Holloway (sociologist)|John Holloway]] also cites him in his book ''[[Crack Capitalism]]'' in order to explain his idea of "breaking with capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;John Holloway. ''[[Crack Capitalism]]''. Pluto Press (2010). Pg. 6. {{ISBN|0-7453-3008-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0745330082}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Sharp]], the leading theorist of nonviolent struggle, cites his work frequently in both ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'' and ''[[From Dictatorship to Democracy]]''.
