[[File:5S methodology.png|thumb|upright=1.3|5S methodology.]]
[[File:Resource corner 5S Safety Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|5S resource corner at Scanfil Poland factory in [[Sieradz]].]]
'''5S''' is a workplace organization method that uses a list of five [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words: {{nihongo|''seiri''|整理}}, {{nihongo|''seiton''|整頓}}, {{nihongo|''seisō''|清掃}}, {{nihongo|''seiketsu''|清潔}}, and {{nihongo|''shitsuke''|躾}}. These have been translated as "Sort", "Set In  order", "Shine", "Standardize" and "Sustain".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.graphicproducts.com/articles/what-is-5s/|title=What Is 5S? - Sort, Set In Order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list describes how to organize a work space for efficiency and effectiveness by identifying and storing the items used, maintaining the area and items, and sustaining the new order. The decision-making process usually comes from a dialogue about standardization, which builds understanding among employees of how they should do the work.

In some quarters, 5S has become 6S, the sixth element being safety.&lt;ref&gt;Gapp, R., Fisher, R., Kobayashi, K. 2008. Implementing 5S within a Japanese Context: An Integrated Management System, ''Management Decision''. 46(4): 565-579.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than a specific stand-alone methodology, 5S is frequently viewed as an element of a broader construct known as ''visual control'',&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Chris A. and Park, Murry. 2010. ''Visual Controls: Applying Visual Management to the Factory''. New York: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ''visual workplace'',&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn D. 2005. ''Visual Workplace: Visual Thinking''. Portland, Ore: Visual-Lean Enterprise Press.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''visual factory''.&lt;ref&gt;Greif, Michel. 1989. ''The Visual Factory: Building Participation through Shared Information''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki, ed. 1988. ''JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Under those (and similar) terminologies, Western companies were applying underlying concepts of 5S before publication, in English, of the formal 5S methodology. For example, a workplace-organization photo from Tennant Company (a Minneapolis-based manufacturer) quite similar to the one accompanying this article appeared in a manufacturing-management book in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard J. 1986. ''World Class Manufacturing: The Lessons of Simplicity Applied''. New York: Free Press, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of 5S ==
[[File:The scheme "Correct Arrangement of the Tool", CIT, Russia, 1920-1924.png|thumb|The scheme "Correct Arrangement of the Tool" from a CIT instruction sheet, 1920-1924.]]

5S was developed in Japan and was identified as one of the techniques that enabled [[Just in time (business)|Just in Time]] manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, Hiroyuki. 1988. ''JIT Factory Revolution: A Pictorial Guide to Factory Design of the Future.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two major frameworks for understanding and applying 5S to business environments have arisen, one proposed by Osada, the other by Hirano.&lt;ref name="5-pillars"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace|last=Hirano|first=Hiroyuki|publisher=Productivity Press|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56327-047-5|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osada"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ll-1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+5S%E2%80%99s:+Five+keys+to+a+Total+Quality+Environment&amp;dq=The+5S%E2%80%99s:+Five+keys+to+a+Total+Quality+Environment&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC8OXB0abVAhXFeD4KHWBTBZAQ6AEIKDAA|title=The 5S’s: Five keys to a Total Quality Environment|last=Osada|first=Takashi|publisher=Asian Productivity Organization &lt;!--|123= 9283311167--&gt;|year=1995|isbn=978-9-28331-115-7|location=US|deadurl=no|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hirano provided a structure to improve programs with a series of identifiable steps, each building on its predecessor. As noted by John Bicheno,&lt;ref name="lean-toolbox"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Lean Toolbox: Towards Fast, Flexible Flow|last=Bicheno|first=John|publisher=PICSIE|isbn=978-0-9541244-1-0|location=Buckingham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toyota's adoption of the Hirano approach was '4S', with Seiton and Seiso combined.{{Verify source|date=February 2016}}

A precursor development to the Japanese system of management was outlined by [[Aleksei Gastev|Alexey Gastev's]] development and the [[Central Institute of Labour]] (CIT) in Moscow.{{clarify|date=August 2016}}&lt;ref name="WorkManagingRusJap"&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/managing-modernity-work-community-and-authority-in-late-industrializing-japan-and-russia/oclc/231965117 Managing «modernity»: work, community, and authority in late-industrializing Japan and Russia, Rudra Sil, Publisher: Ann Arbor, Mich. : University of Michigan Press, 2002.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The 5S ==
There are five 5S phases. They can be translated from the Japanese as "sort", "set in order", "shine", "standardize", and "sustain". Other translations are possible.

===Sort (Seiri)===
[[File:Red Tag Area 0123.jpg|thumb|1S – a red tag area containing items waiting for removal.]]
Seiri is sorting through all items in a location and removing all unnecessary items from the location.

Goals:
* Reduce time loss looking for an item by reducing the number of items.
* Reduce the chance of distraction by unnecessary items.
* Simplify inspection.
* Increase the amount of available, useful space.
* Increase safety by eliminating obstacles.

Implementation:
* Check all items in a location and evaluate whether or not their presence at the location is useful or necessary.
* Remove unnecessary items as soon as possible. Place those that cannot be removed immediately in a 'red tag area' so that they are easy to remove later on.
* Keep the working floor clear of materials except for those that are in use to production.

===Set in order (Seiton) ===
[[File:5S ręczny wózek paletowy.jpg|thumb|2S – simple floor marking.]]
Seiton is putting all necessary items in the optimal place for fulfilling their function in the workplace.

Goal:
* Make the [[workflow]] smooth and easy.

Implementation:
* Arrange work stations in such a way that all tooling / equipment is in close proximity, in an easy to reach spot and in a logical order adapted to the work performed. Place components according to their uses, with the frequently used components being nearest to the workplace.
* Arrange all necessary items so that they can be easily selected for use. Make it easy to find and pick up necessary items.
* Assign fixed locations for items. Use clear labels, marks or hints so that items are easy to return to the correct location and so that it is easy to spot missing items.

===Shine (Seiso)===
[[File:Cleanliness point 5S Scanfil Sieradz.jpg|thumb|3S – cleanliness point with cleaning tools and resources.]]
Seiso is sweeping or cleaning and inspecting the workplace, tools and machinery on a regular basis.

Goals:
* Prevent deterioration.
* Keep the workplace safe and easy to work in.
* Keep the workplace clean and pleasing to work in.
* When in place, anyone not familiar to the environment must be able to detect any problems within 50 feet in 5 sec.

Implementation:
* Clean the workplace and equipment on a daily basis, or at another appropriate (high frequency) cleaning interval.
* Inspect the workplace and equipment while cleaning.

===Standardize (Seiketsu) ===
Seiketsu is to standardize the processes used to sort, order and clean the workplace.

Goal:
* Establish procedures and schedules to ensure the repetition of the first three ‘S’ practices.

Implementation:
* Develop a work structure that will support the new practices and make it part of the daily routine.
* Ensure everyone knows their responsibilities of performing the sorting, organizing and cleaning.
* Use photos and visual controls to help keep everything as it should be.
* Review the status of 5S implementation regularly using audit checklists.

===Sustain/Self-discipline (Shitsuke) ===
Shitsuke or sustain the developed processes by self-discipline of the workers. Also translates as "do without being told".

Goal:
* Ensure that the 5S approach is followed.

Implementation:
* Organize training sessions.
* Perform regular audits to ensure that all defined standards are being implemented and followed.
* Implement improvements whenever possible. Worker inputs can be very valuable for identifying improvements.
* When issues arrise, identify their cause and implement the changes necessary to avoid their recurral.

== Variety of 5S applications ==
5S methodology has expanded from manufacturing and is now being applied to a wide variety of industries including health care, education, and government. Visual management and 5S can be particularly beneficial in health care because a frantic search for supplies to treat an in-trouble patient (a chronic problem in health care) can have dire consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Graban, Mark. 2012. ''Lean Hospitals: Improving Quality, Patient Safety, and Employee Engagement''. Boca Raton, Fl: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the origins of the 5S methodology are in manufacturing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.5stoday.com/what-is-5s/|title=What Is 5S?|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it can also be applied to [[knowledge economy]] work, with information, software, or media in the place of physical product.&lt;ref name="ceiton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ceiton.com/CMS/EN/company/profile.html#Origin|title=CEITON – Profile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5S in lean product &amp; process development ==
The output of engineering and design in a lean enterprise is information, the theory behind using 5S here is "Dirty, cluttered, or damaged surfaces attract the eye, which spends a fraction of a second trying to pull useful information from them every time we glance past. Old equipment hides the new equipment from the eye and forces people to ask which to use"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ward|first1=Allen|title=Lean Product and Process Development|date=March 2014|publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-934109-43-4|page=215|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14988">An '''address confidentiality program''' allows victims of [[domestic violence]], [[sexual assault]], [[stalking]] or other types of crime to receive mail at a [[confidential]] address, while keeping their actual address undisclosed. This is usually done through the state's [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State's]] address or some other address which will legally substitute the agency's address for the victim's physical address on public records.

According to the [[National Network to End Domestic Violence]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;Address Confidentiality Programs (ACP) and Confidential Voter Listings are programs administered by the state enabling victims of domestic violence (and sometime victims of sexual assault and/or stalking) to participate in the voting process without fear of being found by their abusers. ACPs generally provide a substitute address for all public records. Confidential Voter Listings only provide confidentiality on election-related public records.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Bank Accounts and Address Confidentiality==
The rules implementing the [[Bank Secrecy Act]] require a financial institution to implement a [[Customer Identification Program]] that includes procedures that enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers. The rules also require that a financial institution obtain a residential or business street address from each customer. Unfortunately, the substitute address under an Address Confidentiality Program does not meet the standards.

The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] issued a letter ruling to help the situation. The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] regulations also allow: "If the individual customer does not have a residential or business street address, then the rules permit the individual customer to provide a "residential or business street address of next of kin or of another contact individual."

In FIN-2009-R003, the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] found: "A customer who participates in a state-created ACP shall be treated as not having a residential or business street address and a secretary of state, or other state entity serving as a designated agent of the customer consistent with the terms of the ACP, will act as another contact individual for the purpose of complying with FinCEN's rules. Therefore, a financial institution should collect the street address of the ACP sponsoring agency for purposes of meeting its CIP address requirement."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">'''Afro-pessimism''' is a framework and critical idiom that describes the ongoing effects of [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and historical processes of enslavement including the [[Atlantic slave trade|Trans-Atlantic slave trade]], and their impact on structural conditions as well as personal, subjective, and lived experience, and [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] reality. 

The term was first coined  in 1990 in an article in ''[[Jeune Afrique|Jeune Afrique Economie]]'' by Francophone Cameroonian author [[Sony Lab'ou Tansi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/71173671 |title=African literature : an anthology of criticism and theory |last=Tansi |first=Sony Labou |date=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub |isbn=1405112018 |location=Malden, MA |pages=54-60 |chapter=An Open Letter to Africans c/o The Punic One Party State |oclc=71173671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sony Labou Tansi, "Lettre aux Africains... sous couvert du parti punique," ''Jeune Afrique Economie 1''36 (1990): 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[intellectual]] [[Frank B. Wilderson III]] developed the term in his political [[memoir]] about his time spent teaching and participating in the [[African National Congress]] in [[South Africa]] during [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=3|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/9780822374985-003|work=Incognegro|pages=96–146|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822374985|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Tansi, "Afro-pessimism [is] a terrible word used to conceal the greatest mess of all time," which is the "tragedy" that Africa's position "dooms us to construct and build garbage economies in the depths of the most cruel, unbearable, and inhuman form of indignity that humans can swallow" (as translated by John Conteh-Morgan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Wilderson, afro-pessimism theorizes blackness as a position of "accumulation and fungibility" (Saidiya Hartman); that is, as condition—or relation—of ontological death, as opposed to a cultural identity or human subjectivity.

Wilderson, along with [[Hortense Spillers]], [[Saidiya Hartman]], [[Achille Mbembe]], [[Jared Sexton]], and others who have contributed to afro-pessimist thought, cite the [[Martinique|Martinician]] psychiatrist, philosopher, and writer [[Frantz Fanon]] as a foundational figure in the tradition of Afro-pessimism. 

Afro-pessimism has been constructed in many ways and with different aims. But Afro-pessimism is chiefly approached a [[wikt:transcendence|transcendent]] position, not as a negative or disaffected political attitude in the sense that [[pessimism]] might seemingly connote. The Black radical tradition has drawn upon the term as a way to acknowledge the power, depth, and vitality of the resilience and radical imagination of people of [[African descent]]. Within this same critique, some have used Afro-pessimism to articulate the subject-position of renunciation, refusal, distancing, dread, doubt and abjection in response to the multitude and ongoing effects and historical [[Psychological trauma|traumas]] of colonialism. This includes the view that dismantling [[white supremacy]] would mean dismantling much of the social and political institutions of the [[modern world]].

Discussions of Afro-pessimism have manifest in an [[online]] context, and have continued in Afro-pessimist approaches to art, [[poetics]], and [[computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sexton|first1=Jared|title=Afro-Pessimism:The Unclear Word|journal=Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in Emerging Knowledge|date=2016|issue=29|url=http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|issn=1555-9998|doi=10.20415/rhiz/029.e02|doi-access=free|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907061732/http://www.rhizomes.net/issue29/sexton.html|archive-date=2017-09-07|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pan-Africanism ==
Afro-pessimist ideas have been part of ongoing conversations about [[pan-African]] identity, as an inclusionary concept of blackness among all people of African descent.&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pan-African thought has drawn attention to the shared racial identity and also the particulars of the expression of African identity among the [[African Diaspora]] and peoples on the [[Africa|African continent]]. Pan-African thought has analyzed the ongoing struggles of African peoples, and the power of [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentricity]] as a move away from the colonialism and violence of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentricity]]. The writings of [[Frantz Fanon]], a [[Martinique|Martinican]] psychiatrist, intellectual, and revolutionary, reflect pan-African and Afro-pessimistic approaches to decolonization and black liberation. 

=== Négritude ===
The [[Pan-African]] movement [[négritude]] represents pessimism as a kind of realist recognition of the historical traumas of colonialism, from an [[existentialist]] position. A key figure in the movement, [[Aimé Césaire]], uses pessimism to consider transcendence and a recognition of the breadth of the cultural imagination and perseverance of people of African descent.

==In international relations theory==
Afro-pessimism has also been employed as a term describing a narrative in Western media and International relations theory that portrays [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]] Africa as unlikely to achieve economic growth and democratic governance. This use of Afro-pessimism has nothing to with Wilderson's definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilderson|first1=Frank|title=Red, White &amp; Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonisms|date=2010|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-4692-0|page=346|oclc=457770963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of Afro-pessimism has been criticized as a Western construct regarding the ongoing portrayal of Africa and African people in Western media, overwhelmingly in terms of tragedy, doom, victimization, and victim-hood.&lt;ref name="de B'eberi and Louw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de B’béri |first1=Boulou Ebanda |last2=Louw |first2=P.

In this ways the media tends to victimize and exoticize Africa for its going struggles with poverty, health-crisis, famine, and lack of modern development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bassil |first1=Noah R. |title=The roots of Afropessimism: the British invention of the 'dark continent.' |journal=Critical Arts: South-North Cultural and Media Studies |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2011-10-13 |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=377-396 |issn=0256-0046 |doi=10.1080/02560046.2011.615141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victimization is then visible in the [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] and development projects, which sometimes use the language of "saving" African people from such "humanitarian disasters".&lt;ref name="Nothias"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Archon''''' ({{lang-el|ἄρχων}}, ''árchon'', &lt;small&gt;plural:&lt;/small&gt; ἄρχοντες, ''árchontes'') is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that means "ruler", frequently used as the title of a specific public office. It is the masculine present participle of the verb stem αρχ-, meaning "to rule", derived from the same root as ''[[monarch]]'' and ''[[hierarchy]]''.

==Ancient Greece==
In the early literary period of [[ancient Greece]] the chief [[magistrates]] of various Greek city states were called ''Archon''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} The term was also used throughout Greek history in a more general sense, ranging  from "club leader" to "master of the tables" at ''[[syssitia]]'' to "Roman governor".{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In Roman terms, ''archontes'' ruled by ''[[imperium]]'', whereas ''[[Basileus|basileis]]'' ("[[king]]s") had ''[[auctoritas]]''.

In [[Athens]] a system of three concurrent Archons evolved, the three office holders being known as the ''[[Archon Eponymos]]'', the ''[[Polemarch]]'', and the ''Archon [[Basileus]]''.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=444}} According to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', the power of the king first devolved to the archons, and these offices were filled from the aristocracy by elections every ten years. During this period the Archon Eponymos was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the Archon Eponymos. (Many ancient [[calendar]] systems did not number their years consecutively.) Although the process of the next transition is unclear, after 487 BC the archonships were assigned by lot to any citizen and the Polemarch's military duties were taken over by a new class of generals known as ''[[strategoi]]''. The Polemarch thereafter had only minor religious duties. The Archon Eponymos remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance. The Archons were assisted by "junior Archons", called ''Thesmothetes''. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically at that time.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

Under the Athenian constitution, Archons were also in charge of organizing festivals by bringing together poets, playwrights, actors, and city-appointed [[choregos|choregai]] (wealthy citizen patrons). The Archon would begin this process months in advance of a festival by selecting a chorus of three playwrights based on descriptions of the projected plays.  Each playwright would be assigned a choregos, also selected by the Archon, from among the wealthy citizens who would pay all the expenses of costumes, masks, and training the chorus.  The Archon also assigned each playwright a principal actor (the ''protagonist''), as well as a second and third actor. The City Dionysia, an ancient dramatic festival held in March in which tragedy, comedy, and satyric drama originated, was under the direction of one of the principal magistrates, the ''archon eponymos''. The ''archon eponymos'' remained the titular head of state under [[democracy]], though of much reduced political importance.{{sfn|Mitchell|1911|p=445}}

==Byzantine Empire==
[[Byzantine]] historians usually described foreign rulers as ''archontes''.&lt;ref&gt;Aksum: an African civilisation of late antiquity By Stuart C. Munro-Hay  Page 145 {{ISBN|0-7486-0209-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rulers of the [[Bulgars]] themselves, along with their [[kanasubigi|own titles]], often bear the title ''archon placed by God'' in inscriptions in Greek.

Inside Byzantium, the term could be used to refer to any powerful noble or magnate, but in a technical sense, it was applied to a class of provincial governors. In the 8th and 9th centuries, these were the governors of some of the more peripheral provinces, inferior in status to the ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thema]]ta'': [[Dalmatia]], [[Cephalonia]], [[Crete]] and [[Cyprus]]. ''Archontes'' were also placed in charge of various naval bases and trade stations, as well as semi-autonomous [[Slavs|Slavic]]-inhabited areas (''[[sclaviniae]]'') under Byzantine sovereignty. In the 10th–12th centuries, ''archontes'' are also mentioned as the governors of specific cities. The area of an archon's jurisdiction was called an '''''archontia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἀρχοντία}}).&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{ODB | page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was also used for the holders of several financial posts, such as the head of the [[mint (facility)|mint]] ({{lang|grc|ἄρχων τῆς χαραγῆς}}), as well as directors of the imperial workshops, arsenals, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODB | pages=160–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of '''''[[megas archon]]''''' ("grand archon") is also attested, as a translation of foreign titles such as "grand prince". In the mid-13th century, it was established as a special court rank, held by the highest-ranking official of the emperor's company. It existed throughout the [[Palaiologan period]], but did not have any specific functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Mark C. | last = Bartusis | title = The Late Byzantine Army: Arms and Society 1204-1453 | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-8122-1620-2 | page=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople==
From time to time, [[laity]] of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] in communion with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] have been granted the title of ''Archon'' to honor their service to Church administration. In 1963, Archons were organized into a service society dedicated to [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew]]. This ''Archon'' status is not part of the Church hierarchy and is purely honorary. See http://www.archons.org/ .

An Archon is an honoree by His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, for his outstanding service to the Church, and a well-known, distinguished, and well-respected leader of the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] (at large).

It is the sworn oath of the Archon to defend and promote the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Church]] faith and tradition. His main concern is to protect and promote the Holy Patriarchate and its mission. He is also concerned with [[human rights]] and the well-being and general welfare of the Church.

As it is a significant religious position, the faith and dedication of a candidate for the role are extensively reviewed during consideration; the candidate should have demonstrated commitment for the betterment of the Church, Parish-Diocese, Archdiocese and the community as a whole.

==Other uses==
"Archon" is also used in Modern Greek colloquially, as ''άρχοντας'' (''archontas)'' to someone that holds a form of status, or power &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slang.gr/lemma/9091-arxontas|title=Άρχοντας - SLANG.gr|author=|date=|website=www.slang.gr|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is used within the [[Arabic|Arab]]-speaking [[Copt]]s in church parlance as a [[title]] for a leading member of the [[laity]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Various [[fraternities and sororities]] use the title of archon or variations on it.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Some [[Gnosticism|Gnostic sects]] used this term for [[Archon (Gnosticism)|demons]] associated with the planetspheres.

[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Howard Hughes]] was a major American aviation and film maverick during the 20th century.]]
A '''business magnate''' or '''industrialist''' is an [[entrepreneur]] of great influence, importance, or standing in a particular enterprise or field of business. The term characteristically refers to a wealthy entrepreneur or investor who controls, through personal business ownership or dominant shareholding position, a firm or industry whose goods or services are widely consumed. Such individuals may also be called ''[[Tsar|czar]]s'', ''[[Magnate|mogul]]s'', ''proprietors'', ''tycoons'', ''taipans'', ''[[baron]]s'', or ''[[Business oligarch|oligarch]]s''.

==Etymology==
The word ''[[magnate]]'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''magnates'' (plural of ''magnas''), meaning "a great man" or "great nobleman".

]]
The word '''''tycoon''''' derives from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{Nihongo|[[taikun]]|大君}}, which means "great lord", used as a title for the ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American English Spelling: An Informal Description |last=Cummings |first= Donald Wayne |year=1988 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-3443-1 |page=277 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OVIqCV57pYC |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tycoon |title=tycoon |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 May 2012 |quote=Origin of TYCOON Japanese taikun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word entered the English language in 1857&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tycoon |title=tycoon |work=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=22 May 2012 |quote=First Known Use: 1857}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the return of [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] to the United States.  U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]] was humorously referred to as ''the Tycoon'' by his aides [[John Nicolay]] and [[John Hay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Return of the Samurai |first=Adam |last=Goodheart |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/return-of-the-samurai/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term spread to the business community, where it has been used ever since.

The word ''mogul'' is an English corruption of ''mughal'', Persian or Arabic for "Mongol".  It alludes to emperors of the [[Mughal Empire]] in the [[Medieval India]], who possessed great power and storied riches capable of producing wonders of opulence such as the [[Taj Mahal]].

==Usage==
Modern business magnates are entrepreneurs that amass on their own or wield substantial family fortunes in the process of building or running their own businesses. Some are widely known in connection with these entrepreneurial activities, others through high-visibility secondary pursuits such as [[philanthropy]], political fundraising and campaign financing, and sports team ownership or sponsorship.

The terms ''mogul'', ''tycoon'' and ''baron'' were often applied to late 19th and early 20th century [[North America]]n business magnates in [[natural resource|extractive industries]] such as [[mining]], [[logging]] and [[petroleum]], transportation fields such as [[shipping]] and [[rail transport|railroad]]s, manufacturing such as [[Automobile manufacturing|automaking]] and [[steel]]making, in [[banking]], as well as newspaper publishing. Their dominance was known as the [[Second Industrial Revolution]], the [[Gilded Age]], or the [[Robber baron (industrialist)|Robber Baron Era]].

&lt;!--Please discuss additions to the below list on the talk page so it does not become unwieldy--&gt;
Examples of well-known business magnates in the western world include historical figures such as oilman [[John D. Rockefeller]], automobile pioneer [[Henry Ford]], shipping and railroad veterans [[Aristotle Onassis]], [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]], [[Jay Gould]], and [[James J. Hill]], steel innovator [[Andrew Carnegie]], newspaper publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], retail merchant [[Sam Walton]], and banker [[J. P. Morgan]]. Contemporary industrial tycoons include e-commerce entrepreneur [[Jeff Bezos]], real estate developer [[Donald Trump]], investor [[Warren Buffett]], computer programmer [[Bill Gates]], technology innovator [[Steve Jobs]], steel investor [[Lakshmi Mittal]], telecommunications investor [[Carlos Slim]], airline owner Sir [[Richard Branson]], technology entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]], Formula 1 manager [[Bernie Ecclestone]], media entrepreneur [[Rupert Murdoch]], and poultry technologist [[Frank Perdue]].&lt;!--Please discuss additions to the above list on the talk page so it does not become unwieldy--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9071">The '''camel's nose''' is a [[metaphor]] for a situation where the permitting of a small, seemingly innocuous act will open the door for larger, clearly undesirable actions.

== History ==
According to [[Geoffrey Nunberg]], the image entered the English language in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Nunberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nunberg|first1=Geoffrey|title=Going Nucular: Language, Politics, and Culture in Confrontational Times|date=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York|isbn=9780786738649|page=118|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Doxh1e87V-UC|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is a [[fable]] printed in 1858 in which an [[Arab]] [[miller]] allows a camel to stick its nose into his bedroom, then other parts of its body, until the camel is entirely inside and refuses to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Anonymous | title = The Child's Companion and Juvenile Instructor | year = 1858 | chapter = Sin is a Bad Master | publisher = The Religious Tract Society | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lydia Sigourney]] wrote another version, a widely reprinted poem for children, in which the camel enters a shop because the workman does not forbid it at any stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigourney|first1=Lydia Howard|title=Gleanings|date=1860|publisher=Brown &amp; Gross|location=Hartford|isbn=9781425523282|pages=58–59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nlQxe8xckw0C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1858 example above says, "The Arabs repeat a fable", and Sigourney says in a footnote, "To illustrate the danger of the first approach of evil habit, the Arabs have a proverb, 'Beware of the camel's nose.'" However, Nunberg could not find an Arab source for the saying and suspected it was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] invention.&lt;ref name=Nunberg/&gt;

An early citation with a tent is "The camel in the Arabian tale begged and received permission to insert his nose into the desert tent."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', April 21, 1875&lt;/ref&gt; By 1878, the expression was familiar enough that part of the story could be left unstated. "It is the humble petition of the camel, who only asks that he may put his nose into the traveler's tent. It is so pitiful, so modest, that we must needs relent and grant it."&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', March 14, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1909 essay by John B. West, founder of the West legal classification system, used the metaphor to describe the difficulty of trying to insert an otherwise innocuous set of facts into a rigid legal system:
&lt;blockquote&gt;three excellent digesters [] spent an entire day in disagreeing as to whether seal fishery cases should be classified under the topic 'Fish' or that of 'Game' .... It is the old story of the camel's head in the tent. What seems at first a plausible pretext for forcing some novel case or new principle into a topic or subdivision to which it does not naturally belong, leads to hopeless confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=West|first1=John|title=Multiplicity of Reports|url=http://www.hyperlaw.com//90-99-docs/1909-multiplicity_of_reports_jbwest.html|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1915 book of fables by [[Horace Scudder]], the story titled ''The Arab and His Camel'' ends with the [[moral]]: "It is a wise rule to resist ''the beginnings of evil''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=scudder&amp;book=fables&amp;story=arab |title=The Baldwin Project: The Book of Fables and Folk Stories by Horace E. Scudder |publisher=Mainlesson.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Barry Goldwater]] used the metaphor in expressing his opposition to the [[National Defense Education Act]] in 1958:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=John T.|title=Academic Science, Higher Education, and the Federal Government, 1950-1983|date=1983|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226900520|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oti9Yo4AVUAC&amp;ots=tq55qGY97c&amp;pg=PA51|accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This bill and the foregoing remarks of the majority remind me of an old Arabian proverb: "If the camel once gets his nose in the tent, his body will soon follow." If adopted, the legislation will mark the inception of aid, supervision, and ultimately control of education in this country by the federal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pierce|first1=Patrick A.|last2=Miller|first2=Donald E.|title=Gambling Politics: State Gambling Politics: State Government and the Business of Betting|date=2004|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=9781588262684|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FcaTLPJ05X0C|accessdate=15 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The phrase was used in ''Reed v. King'' (193 CA Rptr. 130 - 1983):{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} "The paramount argument against an affirmative conclusion is it permits the camel's nose of unrestrained irrationality admission to the tent. If such an 'irrational' consideration is permitted as a basis of [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] the stability of all conveyances will be seriously undermined." The case in question involved a plaintiff suing because the defendant sold a house without telling them that the house's previous inhabitants had been brutally murdered 10 years earlier.

'''Cat intelligence''' is the capacity of the [[cat|domesticated cat]] to solve problems and adapt to its environment. Researchers have also shown feline intelligence to include the ability to acquire new behavior that applies previously learned knowledge to new situations, communicating needs and desires within a social group, and responding to training cues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Brain and diet ===
{{Further|Cat food|Cat cognitive support diets}}
A cognitive support diet for felines is a food that is formulated to improve mental processes like attention, short and long-term memory, learning, and problem solving. Claims for cognitive support appear on a number of kitten formulations to help with brain development, as well as diets aimed at seniors to help prevent cognitive disorders. These diets typically focus on supplying [[Omega-3 fatty acid]]s, [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, [[taurine]], vitamins, and other supporting supplements that have positive effects on cognition.

The omega-3 fatty acids are a key nutrient in cognition for felines. They are essential for felines as they cannot be synthesized naturally and must be obtained from the diet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Covington|first=MB.|date=2004|title=Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0701/p133.html#|journal=American Family Physician|volume=70|pages=133–140|via=American Family Physician}}&lt;/ref&gt; Omega-3 fatty acids that support brain development and function are [[Alpha-Linolenic acid|alpha-linolenic acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fish oils, fish and other marine sources provide a very rich source of DHA and EPA.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Alpha-linolenic acid can be acquired from oils and seeds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Omega-6 fatty acids are also needed in feline cognition diets. The important omega-6 fatty acid that plays a role in brain support and cognition is [[arachidonic acid]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer EB.|first=|date=2006|title=Metabolic basis for the essential nature of fatty acids and the unique dietary fatty acid requirement of cats.|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=229 | issue = 11 |pages=1729–32|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.229.11.1729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arachidonic acid or AA is found in animal sources such as meat and eggs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; AA is required in cat diets, as felines convert insignificant amounts of it from linoleic acid due to the limited delta-6 desaturase.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Biagi G., Moedenti A. and Cocchi M.|first=|date=2004|title=The role of dietary omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids in the nutrition of dogs and cat: A review.|url=|journal=Progress in Nutrition|volume=6 | issue = 2 |pages=1–13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like DHA, arachidonic acid is often found in the brain tissues of cats and seems to have a supporting role in brain function.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In a 2000 study completed by Contreras ''et al.'', it was found that DHA and AA made up 20% of the fatty acids in the mammalian brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coutreras MA., Greiner RS., Chang MC., Myers CS., Salem N JR. and Rapoport SI|first=|date=2000|title=Nutritional deprivation of alpha-linolenic acid decreases but does not abolish turnover and availability of unacylated docosahexaenoic acid and docosahexaenoyl-CoA in rat brain.|url=|journal=Journal of Neurochemistry|volume=75|pages=2392–400.|via=|doi=10.1046/j.1471-4159.2000.0752392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arachidonic acid makes up high amounts in the membrane of most cells and has many pro-inflammatory actions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Taurine]] is an amino acid, which is essential in cat diets due to their low capacity to synthesize it. Because taurine has the ability to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] in the brain, it has been found to have a role in many neurological functions, especially in the visual development.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturman JA., Lu P., Xu Y. and Imaki H.

The [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS]] test is a measure of intelligence in adult ''[[homo sapiens]]''. The test scores on four criteria: [[Linguistic intelligence|verbal comprehension]], [[perceptual organization]], [[working memory]] and [[Mental chronometry|processing speed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gläscher|first1=Jan|last2=Tranel|first2=Daniel|last3=Paul|first3=Lynn K.|last4=Rudrauf|first4=David|last5=Rorden|first5=Chris|last6=Hornaday|first6=Amanda|last7=Grabowski|first7=Thomas|last8=Damasio|first8=Hanna|last9=Adolphs|first9=Ralph|year=2009|title=Lesion Mapping of Cognitive Abilities Linked to Intelligence|journal=Neuron|volume=61|issue=5|pages=681–91|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2009.01.026|pmc=2728583|pmid=19285465|laysource=Caltech|laydate=11 March 2009|laysummary=http://www.caltech.edu/article/13239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soto, Timothy.

In controlled experiments, cats showed that they had fully developed concepts of [[object permanence]], meaning that sensorimotor intelligence is completely developed in cats. For human infants, tests involving multiple invisible displacements of an object are used to assess the beginning of mental representation in the sixth and last stage of sensorimotor intelligence. The cats' searches on these tasks were consistent with representation of an unsensed object and fully developed sensorimotor intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1981|title=Object permanence in cats and dogs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03212035|journal=Animal Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=9|issue=1|pages=135–139|doi=10.3758/bf03212035 | last1 = Triana | first1 = Estrella}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=June 1995|title=Human Analog Tests of the Sixth Stage of Object Permanence|url=http://pms.sagepub.com/content/80/3_suppl/1059.refs|journal=Percept Mot Skills|volume=80|issue=3 !pages=1059-1068}}&lt;/ref&gt; The working memory for [[object permanence]] of the domesticated cat is surmised from experiment as being of 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fiset|first1=Sylvain|last2=Doré|first2=François Y.|year=2006|title=Duration of cats' (Felis catus) working memory for disappearing objects|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=9|issue=1|pages=62–70|doi=10.1007/s10071-005-0005-4|pmid=16133631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More negative results were obtained in an experiment conducted in 2009 where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen. When presented with one string, cats had no trouble getting the treats, but when presented with multiple strings, some of which were not connected to treats, the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings, leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/social-applied-sciences/applied-social-sciences/staff/Britta-Osthaus/ B.

Occasionally cats have violent nightmares with muffled screams and may suddenly wake up screaming from the nightmare.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Memory ==
Taken as a whole, cats have excellent [[memories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feline Intelligence|url=http://www.animalplanet.com/pets/cat-intelligence/|website=Animal Planet|quote=Once attained, even if by accident or trial and error, most knowledge is retained for life, thanks to the cat's excellent memory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In experimental conditions, the memory of a cat was demonstrated as having an information-retention or recall, of a duration totalling as much as 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catsinternational.org/articles/training/the_intelligent_cat.html|title=The Intelligent Cat|publisher=Cats International|access-date=24 January 2007|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67mDoL8qM?url=http://www.catsinternational.org/articles/training/the_intelligent_cat.html#|archive-date=19 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, relationships with humans, individual differences in [[intelligence]], and age may all affect memory. Cats easily adapt to their current environment because they can adapt their memories of past environments throughout their lives.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Stock, Judith A.

=== In kittens ===
The period during which the cat is a [[kitten]] is the time when the cat learns and memorizes survival skills, which are acquired through observation of their mothers and playing with other cats. Playing, in fact, constitutes more than fun for a kitten, for it is essential for ranking social order, building hunting skills, and generally exercising for the adult roles.

The first two to seven weeks are a particularly critical time for kittens, for it is during this period that they bond with other cats. It has been suspected that without any human contact during this time, the cat would forever mistrust humans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== In older cats ===
Just as in humans, advancing age may affect [[Memory and aging|memory]] in cats. Some cats may experience a weakening of both learning ability and memory that affects them adversely in ways similar to those occurring in poorly aging humans. A slowing of function is normal, and this includes memory. Aging may affect memory by changing the way their brain stores information and by making it harder to recall stored information. Cats lose brain cells as they age, just as humans do.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Memory Loss With Aging. Family Doctor. 22 January 1996. Web. 24 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The older the cat, the more these changes can affect its memory. There have been no studies done on the memories of aging cats, but there is some speculation that, just like people, [[short-term memory]] is more affected by aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Cats Have Long-Term Memory?|url=http://pets.thenest.com/cats-longterm-memory-8646.html|website=The Nest|quote=As Kitty ages, his brain function will decline. Feline cognitive dysfunction is a disease similar to Alzheimer's in humans. It is caused by deterioration of the brain itself, leading to reduced cognitive functioning. A cat with this condition has trouble getting around, because he becomes disoriented easily.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one test of where to find food, cats' short-term memory lasted about 16 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do Cats Have Long-Term Memory?|url=http://pets.thenest.com/cats-longterm-memory-8646.html|website=The Nest|quote=In one test of where to find food, cats' short-term memory lasted about 16 hours...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diseases ===
Disease, such as [[feline cognitive dysfunction]] (FCD) – a condition similar to [[Alzheimer's disease]] in humans – could also affect cat memory. Symptoms of FCD include disorientation, reduced social interaction, sleep disturbances, and loss of house training. FCD causes degenerative changes in the brain that are the source of the functional impairment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

== Learning capacities ==
{{See also|Animal cognition}}
[[Edward Thorndike]] conducted some key experiments on cat's learning capacity. In one of Thorndike's experiments, cats were placed in various boxes approximately 20&amp;nbsp;inches long, 15&amp;nbsp;inches wide, and 12&amp;nbsp;inches tall with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it. The cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by "[[trial and error]] with accidental success."&lt;ref name="thorndike" /&gt;&lt;ref name="psychology-cengage"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.Bernstein |author2=L. A. Penner |author3=A. Clarke-Stewart |author4=E. J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one test the cat was shown to have done worse in a later trial than in an earlier one, suggesting that no learning from the previous trials was retained in [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorndike|first=Edward Lee
|title=Animal Intelligence|year=1898|page={{page needed|date=February 2012}}|nopp=yes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfJGAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Thorndike considered the cat to have the capacity for learning due to the ''[[law of effect]]'', which states that responses followed by satisfaction (i.e. a reward) become more likely responses to the same stimulus in the future.&lt;ref name="psychology-cengage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thorndike"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Edward Lee|last1=Thorndike|year=1911|title=Animal Intelligence
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LC7GeCzw0lQC|publisher=Macmillian Company|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thorndike was generally skeptical of the presence of intelligence in cats, criticising sources of the contemporary writing of the sentience of animals as "partiality in deductions from facts and more especially in the choice of facts for investigation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Budiansky

An experiment was done to identify possible [[observational learning]] in kittens. Kittens that were able to observe their mothers performing an experimentally organised act were able to perform the same act sooner than kittens that had observed a non-related adult cat, and sooner than the ones who, being placed in trial and error conditions, observed no other cat performing the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.166.3907.901|title=Maternal Influence in Learning by Observation in Kittens|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/166/3907/901.short|year=1969

In [[baseball]], '''charging the mound''' is an assault by a [[Batter (baseball)|batter]] against the [[pitcher]], usually the result of being [[hit by pitch|hit by a pitch]] or nearly being hit by a pitch, such as a [[brushback pitch|brushback]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingcharts.com/dictionary/mlb/charging-the-mound.aspx|title=Charging the Mound Definition - Sporting Charts|website=www.sportingcharts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first incidence of a professional charging of the mound has not been identified, but the practice dates back to the game's early days. Charging the mound is the most common initiator of a [[bench-clearing brawl]].

Before charging, the batter usually throws his [[Baseball bat|bat]] and [[Batting helmet|helmet]] aside so that he may face the pitcher unarmed (it is a very serious breach of baseball [[etiquette]], not to mention dangerous, for the batter to charge the mound with a bat). Though serious injuries have occurred from charging in the past, usually fights are either broken up or joined by all other players so the conflict turns into posturing and name-calling; in baseball parlance, this is known as a [[wikt:rhubarb|rhubarb]].

Charging the mound is typically about responding to an indignity rather than an attempt to injure the pitcher. There is long-standing etiquette in baseball regarding what is an acceptable offense to warrant a [[Beanball|beaning]], and there are similar "unwritten rules" for charging in response to being hit.  While these unwritten rules have become more vague, the response of [[Major League Baseball]] to the incidents has become far more strict. Whereas suspensions in the past were rare and usually short, [[Commissioner]] [[Fay Vincent]] and his successor [[Bud Selig]] reacted harshly to both instances of beaning and charging during their respective tenures.  Recently, most incidents which have caused the benches to clear have been met with large fines and lengthy suspensions.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In Japan, pitchers tip their cap to a batter hit by a pitch if it was not their intent to hit the batter to avoid a mound charging incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1987/04/13/106777648/no-tip-of-the-hat-from-this-japanese-pitcher|title=NO TIP OF THE HAT FROM THIS JAPANESE PITCHER|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=NO TIP OF THE HAT FROM THIS JAPANESE PITCHER|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|date=|work=SI.com|access-date=2018-03-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charismatic authority''' is a concept about leadership that was developed by the German [[sociologist]] [[Max Weber]]. It involves a type of [[organization]] or a type of [[leadership]] in which [[authority]] derives from the [[charisma]] of the leader. This stands in contrast to two other types of authority: [[legal authority]] and [[traditional authority]]. Each of the three types forms part of [[Max Weber]]'s [[tripartite classification of authority]].

"Charisma" is an ancient Greek term that initially gained prominence through Saint Paul's letters to the emerging Christian communities in the first century. In this context, it generally referred to a divinely-originating "gift" that demonstrated the authority of God within the early leaders of the Church. [[Max Weber]] took this theological notion and generalized it, viewing it as something that followers attribute, thereby opening it up for use by [[sociologist]]s who applied it to political, military, celebrity, and non-Christian religious contests.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul.  2014.  "Becoming a God: Max Weber and the Social Construction of Charisma.  Journal of Classical Sociology 14(3) 266–283. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1468795X14536652&lt;/ref&gt;  Other terms used are "charismatic domination"&lt;ref&gt;[http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o12f99.htm Power, Domination, Legitimation, and Authority] Sociology 250 Retrieved October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and "charismatic leadership".&lt;ref&gt;
Adair-Toteff,  Christopher, ''Max Weber’s Charisma'', ''Journal of Classical Sociology'', Vol. 5, No. 2, 189-204 (2005)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

===Charisma===
Weber applies the term [[charisma]] to 
{{quote|[A] certain quality of an individual personality, by virtue of which he is set apart from ordinary men and treated as endowed with supernatural, superhuman, or at least specifically exceptional powers or qualities. These are such as are not accessible to the ordinary person, but are regarded as of divine origin or as exemplary, and on the basis of them the individual concerned is treated as a leader ... How the quality in question would be ultimately judged from an ethical, aesthetic, or other such point of view is naturally indifferent for the purpose of definition.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Maximillan. ''Theory of Social and Economic Organization.'' Chapter: "The Nature of Charismatic Authority and its Routinization" translated by A. R. Anderson and [[Talcott Parsons]], 1947. Originally published in 1922 in German under the title [http://www.textlog.de/7415.html ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft'' chapter III, § 10] (available online)&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Original German: "»Charisma« soll eine als außeralltäglich (ursprünglich, sowohl bei Propheten wie bei therapeutischen wie bei Rechts-Weisen wie bei Jagdführern wie bei Kriegshelden: als magisch bedingt) geltende Qualität einer Persönlichkeit heißen, um derentwillen sie als mit übernatürlichen oder übermenschlichen oder mindestens spezifisch außeralltäglichen, nicht jedem andern zugänglichen Kräften oder Eigenschaften oder als gottgesandt oder als vorbildlich und deshalb als »Führer« gewertet wird."}}}}

===Legitimization===
Charismatic authority is often the most lasting of regimes because the leader is seen as infallible and any action against him will be seen as a crime against the state. Charismatic leaders eventually develop a [[cult of personality]] often not by their own doing. 
{{quote|[P]ower legitimized on the basis of a leader's exceptional personal qualities or the demonstration of extraordinary insight and accomplishment, which inspire loyalty and obedience from followers.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Diana, Jane Lothian Murray, and Rick Linden. ''Sociology in our time'' (2nd ed.), 2000. Scarborough, On: Nelson, 438-439.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leadership is the power to diffuse a positive energy and a sense of greatness. As such, it rests almost entirely on the [[leadership|leader]]. The absence of that leader for any reason can lead to the authority's power dissolving. However, due to its idiosyncratic nature and lack of formal [[organization]], charismatic authority depends much more strongly on the perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the authority than Weber's other forms of authority. For instance, a charismatic leader in a [[religion|religious]] context might require an unchallenged [[belief]] that the leader has been touched by [[God]], in the sense of a [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.about.com/od/religiousauthority/a/types_2.htm Charismatic Authority: Emotional Bonds Between Leaders and Followers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Should the strength of this belief fade, the power of the charismatic leader can fade quickly, which is one of the ways in which this form of authority shows itself to be unstable.

In contrast to the current popular use of the term ''charismatic leader'', Weber saw charismatic authority not so much as character traits of the charismatic leader but as a relationship between the leader and his followers. The validity of [[charism]] is founded on its "recognition" by the leader's followers (or "adepts" - ''Anhänger''). 
His charisma risks disappearing if he is "abandoned by God" or if "his government doesn't provide any prosperity to those whom he dominates".{{refn|group=lower-alpha|A Weber-style charismatic leader need not be a positive force;&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology'' By Jens Beckert, Milan Zafirovski, Published by Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-28673-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-28673-2}}, pag. 53&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] qualify. Furthermore, sociology is [[axiology|axiologically]] neutral (''Wertfreie Soziologie'') towards various forms of charismatic domination: it does not differentiate between the charisma of a [[Berserker]], of a [[shaman]] or of that displayed by [[Kurt Eisner]]. For Weber, sociology considers these types of charismatic domination in "an identical manner to the charisma of [[hero]]es, prophets, the "greatest saviours according to common appreciation".}}

=== Routinizing charisma ===
Charismatic authority almost always endangers the boundaries set by [[traditional authority|traditional]] (coercive) or [[Rational-legal authority|rational]] (legal) authority. It tends to challenge this authority, and is thus often seen as [[revolutionary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/weber_links.html WEBER LINKS page http&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426080033/http://cbae.nmsu.edu/~dboje/teaching/503/weber_links.html |date=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kunin, Seth D. "Religion; the modern theories" University of Edinburgh 2003 {{ISBN|0-7486-1522-9}} page 40&lt;/ref&gt; Usually this charismatic authority is incorporated into society. Hereby the challenge that it presents to society will subside. The way in which this happens is called ''routinization''.

By routinization,  the charismatic authority changes: 
{{quote|[C]harismatic authority is succeeded by a bureaucracy controlled by a rationally established authority or by a combination of traditional and bureaucratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Beeghley, and Powers, 1995 cited in Kendal et al. 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A religion which evolves its own [[priesthood]] and establishes a set of laws and rules is likely to lose its charismatic character and move towards another type of authority. For example, [[Muhammad]], who had charismatic authority as "The Prophet" among his followers, was succeeded by the traditional authority and structure of [[Islam]], a clear example of routinization.

In politics, charismatic rule is often found in various [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian states]], [[Autocracy|autocracies]], [[dictatorship]]s and [[Theocracy|theocracies]]. To help to maintain their charismatic authority, such regimes will often establish a vast [[personality cult]]. When the leader of such a state dies or leaves office, and a new charismatic leader does not appear, such a regime is likely to fall shortly thereafter, unless it has become fully routinized.&lt;ref&gt;''International Encyclopedia of Economic Sociology'' By Jens Beckert, Milan Zafirovski, Published by Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|0-415-28673-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-28673-2}}, pag. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charismatic succession==
Because the [[authority]] is concentrated in one leader, the death of the charismatic leader would constitute the destruction of the government unless prior arrangements were made. A society that faces the end of their charismatic leader can choose to move to another format of [[leadership]] or to have a transference of charismatic authority to another leader by means of succession.

According to Max Weber, the methods of succession are: search, revelation, designation by original leader, designation by qualified staff, hereditary charisma, and office charisma.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}} These are the various ways in which an individual and a society can contrive to maintain the unique energy and nature of charisma in their leadership.

===Search===
"The search for a new charismatic leader (takes place) on the basis of the qualities which will fit him for the position of [[authority]]." An example of this search method is the search for a new [[Dalai Lama]]. "It consists in a search for a child with characteristics which are interpreted to mean that he is a [[reincarnation]] of the [[Buddha]]." This search is an example of the way in which an original charismatic leader can be made to "live on" through a replacement.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Revelation===
"In this case the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the new leader is dependent on the legitimacy of the technique of selection." The technique of selection is the ''modus operandi'' of the selection process. In ancient times, [[oracles]] were believed to have special access to "divine judgment" and thus their technique in selection was perceived to be [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]]. Their choice was imbued with the charismatic authority that came with the oracle's endorsement.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Designation by original leader===
In this form, the original holder of charismatic authority is perceived to have passed their authority to another. An excellent example is [[Joseph Stalin]]'s claim that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had designated him to be his successor as leader of the USSR. Insofar as people believed in this claim, Stalin gained Lenin's charismatic authority.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Designated by qualified staff===
"A successor (may be designated) by the charismatically qualified administrative staff... (T)his process should not be interpreted as 'election' or 'nomination'... It is not determined by merely a majority vote...Unanimity (is) often required." A case example of this form of succession is the [[papal conclave]] of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] to choose a new [[pope]]. The cardinals taking part in the papal conclave are viewed to be charismatically qualified by their [[Roman Catholic]] congregations and thus their choice is imbued with charismatic authority.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

===Hereditary charisma===
Charisma can be perceived as "a quality transmitted by heredity". This method of succession is present in [[Kim il Sung]]'s charisma being passed on to his son, [[Kim Jong Il]]. This type of succession is a difficult undertaking and often results in a movement toward [[Traditional authority|traditionalization]] and [[Rational-legal authority|legalization]] in [[authority]].{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-B}}{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-D}}

===Office charisma===
"The concept of charisma may be transmitted by [[ritual]] means from one bearer to another...It involves a dissociation of charisma from a particular individual, making it an objective, transferable entity." [[Consecration|Priestly consecration]] is believed to be a modus through which priestly charisma to teach and perform other priestly duties is transferred to a person. In this way, [[priest]]s inherit priestly charisma and are subsequently perceived by their congregations as having the charismatic authority that comes with the priesthood.{{sfn|Szelényi|2009-A}}

==Application of Weber's theories==
Weber's model of charismatic leadership giving way to institutionalization is endorsed by several academic sociologists.

===New religious movements===
[[Eileen Barker]] discusses the tendency for [[new religious movement]]s to have founders or leaders who wield considerable charismatic authority and are believed to have special powers or knowledge.  Charismatic leaders are unpredictable, Barker says, for they are not bound by tradition or rules and they may be accorded by their followers the right to pronounce on all aspects of their lives. Barker warns that in these cases the leader may lack any accountability, require unquestioning obedience, and encourage a dependency upon the movement for material, spiritual and social resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eileen Barker|Barker, E]]. ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'' (1990), Bernan Press, {{ISBN|0-11-340927-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] asserts that not all new religious movements have charismatic leaders, and that there are differences in the hegemonic styles among those movements that do.&lt;ref&gt;[[George D. Chryssides|Chryssides, George D.]] ''Unrecognized charisma? A study and comparison of four charismatic leaders: Charles Taze Russell, Joseph Smith, L Ron Hubbard, Swami Prabhupada.'' Paper presented at the 2001 International Conference The Spiritual Supermarket: Religious Pluralism in the 21st Century, organised by [[INFORM]] and [[CESNUR]] (London, April 19–22, 2001). [http://www.cesnur.org/2001/london2001/chryssides.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narcissism==
[[Len Oakes]], an [[Australia]]n psychologist who wrote a [[dissertation]] about charisma, had eleven charismatic leaders fill in a psychometric test, which he called the ''adjective checklist'', and found them as a group quite ordinary. Following the [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Heinz Kohut]], Oakes argues that charismatic leaders exhibit traits of [[narcissism]] and also argues that they display an extraordinary amount of energy, accompanied by an inner clarity unhindered by the anxieties and guilt that afflict more ordinary people. He did however not fully follow Weber's framework of charismatic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Oakes, Len: ''Prophetic Charisma: The Psychology of Revolutionary Religious Personalities'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-8156-0398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25024">In [[cognitive science]], '''choice-supportive bias''' or '''post-purchase rationalization''' is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option one has selected. It is a [[cognitive bias]]. For example, if a person chooses option A instead of option B, they are likely to ignore or downplay the faults of option A while amplifying those of option B. Conversely, they are also likely to notice and amplify the advantages of option A and not notice or de-emphasize those of option B.

What is remembered about a decision can be as important as the decision itself, especially in determining how much regret or satisfaction one experiences.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Research indicates that the process of making and remembering choices yields [[Memory|memories]] that tend to be distorted in predictable ways.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; In cognitive science, one predictable way that memories of choice options are distorted is that positive aspects tend to be remembered as part of the chosen option, whether or not they originally were part of that option, and negative aspects tend to be remembered as part of rejected options.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Once an action has been taken, the ways in which we evaluate the effectiveness of what we did may be biased.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; It is believed this may influence our future decision-making. These biases may be stored as memories, which are attributions that we make about our mental experiences based on their subjective qualities, our prior knowledge and beliefs, our motives and goals, and the social context. True and [[false memories]] arise by the same mechanism because when the brain processes and stores information, it cannot tell the difference where they came from.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==General definition==
The tendency to remember one's choices as better than they actually were, where people tend to over attribute positive features to options they chose and negative features to options not chosen.&lt;ref name= "Mather" /&gt;

==Theory==
Experiments in cognitive science and [[social psychology]] have revealed a wide variety of biases in areas such as statistical reasoning, [[social attribution]], and [[memory]].&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt;

Choice-supportive memory distortion is thought to occur during the time of memory retrieval and was the result of the belief that, "I chose this option, therefore it must have been the better option."&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt;  It is also possible that choice-supportive memories arise because an individual is only paying attention to certain pieces of information when making a decision or to post-choice [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt; In addition,  biases can also arise because they are closely related to the high level [[cognitive operations]] and complex [[social interactions]].&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

Memory distortions may sometimes serve a purpose because it may be in our interest to not remember some details of an event or to forget others altogether.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt;

==Making a selection==
The objective of a choice is generally to pick the best option. Thus, after making a choice, a person is likely to maintain the belief that the chosen option was better than the options rejected. Every choice has an upside and a downside. The process of making a decision mostly relies upon previous experiences. Therefore, a person will remember not only the decision made but also the reasoning behind making that decision.

===Motivation===
Motivation may also play a role in this process because when a person remembers the option that they chose as being the best option, it should help reduce regret about their choice. This may represent a positive illusion that promotes well-being.

===Cases when individual is not in control===
There are cases where an individual is not always in control of which options are received. People often end up with options that were not chosen but, instead were assigned by others, such as job assignments made by bosses, course instructors assigned by a registrar, or vacation spots selected by other family members.&lt;ref name="Mather3" /&gt; However, being assigned (random or not) to an option leads to a different set of cognitions and memory attributions that tend to favor the alternative (non-received) option and may emphasize regret and disappointment.&lt;ref name="Stoll" /&gt;
*'''Assigned options''': Making a choice or having a choice made for you by other people in your best interest can prompt memory attributions that support that choice.  Current experiments show no choice-supportive memory bias for assigned options.&lt;ref name="Mather3" /&gt; However, choices which are made on a person's behalf in their best interest do show a tendency for choice-supportive memory bias.
*'''Random selection''': People do not show choice-supportive biases when choices are made randomly for them.&lt;ref name="Henkel" /&gt;  This is because choice-supportive memory bias tends to arise during the act of making the decision.

==How it relates to self==
People's conception of who they are can be shaped by the memories of the choices they make; the college favored over the one renounced, the job chosen over the one rejected, the candidate elected instead of another one not selected.&lt;ref name="Mather2" /&gt; Memories of chosen as well as forgone alternatives can affect one's sense of well-being. Regret for options not taken can cast a shadow, whereas satisfaction at having made the right choice can make a good outcome seem even better.&lt;ref name="Mather2" /&gt;

===Positive illusions===
Choice-supportive bias often results in memories that depict the self in an overly favorable light. In general, cognitive biases loosen our grasp on reality because the line between reality and fantasy can become fuzzy if one's brain has failed to remember a particular event.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;
Positive illusions are generally mild and are important contributors to our sense of well being. However, we all need to be aware that they do exist as part of human nature.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

==Memory storage==
Human beings are blessed with having an intelligent and complex mind, which allows us to remember our past, be able to optimize the present, and plan for the future. Remembering involves a complex interaction between the current environment, what one expects to remember, and what is retained from the past.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt; The mechanisms of the brain that allow memory storage and retrieval serves us well most of the time, but occasionally gets us into trouble.

===Memories change over time===
There is now abundant evidence that memory content can undergo systematic changes. After some period of time and if the memory is not used often, it may become forgotten.
*'''Memory retention''': It is recognized that retention is best for experiences that are pleasant, intermediate for experiences that are unpleasant, and worst for experiences that are neutral. Generic memories provide the basis for inferences that can bring about distortions. These distortions in memory do not displace an individual's specific memories, but they supplement and fill in the gaps when the memories are lost.&lt;ref name="Bahrick" /&gt; It has been shown that a wide variety of strategic and systematic processes are used to activate different areas of the brain in order to retrieve information.
*'''Credibility of a memory''': People have a way to self-check memories, in which a person may consider the plausibility of the retrieved memory by asking themselves is this event even possible.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; For example, if a person remembers seeing a pig fly, they must conclude that it was from a dream because pigs cannot fly in the real world. Memory does not provide people with perfect reproductions of what happened, it only consists of constructions and reconstructions of what happened.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Brain areas of interest==
There is extensive evidence that the [[amygdala]] is involved in effectively influencing memory.&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt;  Emotional arousal, usually fear based, activates the amygdala and results in the modulation of memory storage occurring in other brain regions.
The [[forebrain]] is one of the targets of the [[amygdala]]. The forebrain receives input from amygdala and calculates the emotional significance of the stimulus, generates an emotional response, and transmits it to [[cerebral cortex]]. This can alter the way neurons respond to future input, and therefore cognitive biases, such as choice-supportive bias can influence future decisions.

===Stress hormones affect memory===
Effects of stress-related [[hormones]], such as [[epinephrine]] and [[glucocorticoids]] are mediated by influences involving the amygdala.&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt; It has been shown in experiments with rats that when they are given systemic injections of epinephrine while being trained to perform a task, they show an enhanced memory of performing the task. In effect the stronger the emotion that is tied to the memory, the more likely the individual is to remember. Therefore, if the memory is stored and retrieved properly it is less likely to be distorted.

==Brain mapping==

A [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan or [[fMRI]] can be used to identify different regions of the brain that are activated during specific memory retrieval.

===fMRI study===
*'''True versus False Memories''': One study asked subjects to remember a series of events while being monitored by an [[fMRI]] to see which areas "light up." When an individual remembered a greater number of true memories than false memories, it showed a cluster spanning the right [[superior temporal gyrus]] and lateral [[occipital cortex]]. However, when the reverse occurred (when an individual remembered a greater number of false memories than true) the brain area that showed activation was the left [[Insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name="Baym" /&gt;  These findings may provide some insight as to which areas of the brain are involved with storing memories and later retrieving them.

==Increase with age==
Studies now show that as people age, their process of memory retrieval changes. Although general memory problems are common to everyone because no memory is perfectly accurate, older adults are more likely than younger adults to show choice-supportive biases.

===Aging of the brain===
Normal aging may be accompanied by [[neuropathy]] in the frontal brain regions. Frontal regions help people encode or use specific memorial attributes to make source judgments, controls personality and the ability to plan for events. These areas can attribute to memory distortions and regulating emotion.

===Regulation of emotion===
In general, older adults are more likely to remember [[emotional]] aspects of situations than are younger adults. For example, on a memory characteristic [[questionnaire]], older adults rated remembered events as having more associated thoughts and feelings than did younger adults. As a person ages, regulating personal emotion becomes a higher priority, whereas knowledge acquisition becomes less of a powerful motive. Therefore, choice-supportive bias would arise because their focus was on how they felt about the choice rather than on the factual details of the options. Studies have shown that when younger adults are encouraged to remember the emotional aspect of a choice, they are more likely to show choice-supportive bias.  This may be related to older adults' greater tendency to show a [[positivity effect]] in memory.

===Rely on familiarity===
Older adults rely more than younger adults on categorical or general knowledge about an event to recognize particular elements from the event.&lt;ref name="Mather" /&gt; Older adults are also less likely to correctly remember contextual features of events, such as their color or location. This may be because older adults remember (or rely on) fewer source identifying characteristics than the young. Consequently, older adults must more often guess or base a response on less specific information, such as [[wikt:familiar|familiarity]].&lt;ref name="Dodson" /&gt; As a result, if they can't remember something, they are more likely to fill in the missing gaps with things that are familiar to them.&lt;ref name="Daniel" /&gt;

===Getting the 'gist'===
Older adults are more reliant on gist-based retrieval. A number of studies suggest that using [[stereotypes]] or general knowledge to help remember an event is less cognitively demanding than relying on other types of memorial information and thus might require less reflective activity. This shift towards gist-based processes might occur as a compensation for age decrements in [[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]] memory.&lt;ref name="Lovden" /&gt;

===Inhibition===
The [[episodic memory|episodic]] memory and inhibition accounts of age-related increases in [[false memories]].  Inhibition of a memory may be related to an individual's hearing capacity and attention span. If the person cannot hear what is going on around them or is not paying much attention, the memory cannot be properly stored and therefore cannot be accurately retrieved.

==Examples==

===Deciding between two used cars===
Henkel and Mather tested the role of beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen by giving participants several hypothetical choices like deciding between two used cars.&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt;
After making several choices, participants left and were asked to return a week later. At that point, Henkel and Mather reminded them which option they had chosen for each choice and gave them a list of the features of the two options; some new positive and negative features were mixed in with the old features. Next, participants were asked to indicate whether each option was new, had been associated with the option they chose, or had been associated with the option they rejected. Participants favored whichever option Henkel and Mather had told them they had chosen in their memories.&lt;ref name="Memory" /&gt; These findings show that beliefs at the time of retrieval about which option was chosen shape both which features are attributed to the options and how vividly they are remembered.

===Remembering high school grades===
One study looked at the accuracy and distortion in memory for high school grades. The relation between accuracy and distortion of [[autobiographical memory]] content was examined by verifying 3,220 high school grades recalled by 99 freshman college students.&lt;ref name="Bahrick" /&gt;  It was shown that most errors inflated the actual high school grade, meaning that these distortions are attributed to memory reconstructions in a positive and emotionally gratifying direction. In addition, their findings indicate that the process of distortion does not cause the actual unpleasant memory loss of getting the bad grade.&lt;ref name="Bahrick" /&gt; This is because there was no correlation found between the percentage of accuracy recall and the degree of asymmetry, or distortion. This shows that the distortion in memories of high school grades arises after the content has been forgotten by another mechanism.

===A 50 year study of college grades===
Many similar studies have been performed, such as a fifty-year study of remembering college grades. In this study one to 54 years after graduating, 276 alumni correctly recalled 3,025 of 3,967 college grades. The number of omission errors increased with the retention interval and better students made fewer errors.&lt;ref name="Bahrick2" /&gt; The accuracy of recall increased with confidence in recall. Eighty-one percent of [[errors of commission]] inflated the actual grade. These data suggested that distortions occur soon after graduation, remain constant during the retention interval, and are greater for better students and for courses students enjoyed most. Therefore, sometime in between when the memory is stored and when it is retrieved some time later, the distortion may arise.&lt;ref name="Bahrick2" /&gt;

==Methods for testing==

===Written scenario memory tests===
Researchers have used written scenarios in which participants are asked to make a choice between two options. Later, on a memory test, participants are given a list of positive and negative features, some of which were in the scenario and some of which are new. A choice-supportive bias is seen when both correct and incorrect attributions tend to favor the chosen option, with positive features more likely to be attributed to the chosen option and negative features to the rejected option.
*'''Deception''': Henkel and Mather (2007) found that giving people false reminders about which option they chose in a previous experiment session led people to remember the option they were told they had chosen as being better than the other option. This reveals that choice-supportive biases arise in large part when remembering past choices, rather than being the result of biased processing at the time of the choice.

===Deese/Roediger–McDermott paradigm===
The [[Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm]] (DRM) consists of a participant listening to an experimenter read lists of thematically related words (e.g. table, couch, lamp, desk); then after some period of time the experimenter will ask if a word was presented in the list.  Participants often report that related but non-presented words (e.g. chair) were included in the encoding series, essentially suggesting that they 'heard' the experimenter say these non-presented words (or critical lures). Incorrect 'yes' responses to critical lures, often referred to as false memories, are remarkably high under standard DRM conditions.&lt;ref name="Foley" /&gt;

==Relation to cognitive dissonance==
The theory of cognitive dissonance proposes that people have a motivational drive to reduce [[Cognitive dissonance|dissonance]]. Choice-supportive bias is potentially related to the aspect of [[cognitive dissonance]] explored by Jack Brehm (1956) as postdecisional dissonance. Within the context of cognitive dissonance, choice-supportive bias would be seen as reducing the conflict between "I prefer X" and "I have committed to Y".

==Debiasing==

A study of the [[Lady Macbeth effect|''Lady Macbeth'' effect]] showed reduced choice-supportive bias by having participants engage in [[washing]].&lt;ref name="lee"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3676">The '''circuit topology''' of a linear [[polymer]] refers to arrangement of its intra-molecular contacts.  Examples of linear polymers with intra-molecular contacts are [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s. For defining the circuit topology, contacts are defined depending on the context. For proteins with disulfide bonds, these bonds could be considered as contacts. In a context where beta-beta interactions in proteins are more relevant, these interactions are used to define the circuit topology. As such, circuit topology framework can be applied to a wide range of applications including protein folding and analysis of genome architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212614002093 | doi=10.1016/j.str.2014.06.015 | volume=22 | title=Circuit Topology of Proteins and Nucleic Acids | year=2014 | journal=Structure | pages=1227–1237 | last1 = Mashaghi | first1 = Alireza | last2 = van Wijk | first2 = Roeland J. | last3 = Tans | first3 = Sander J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, data from [[Chromosome conformation capture|Hi-C]] and related technologies can be readily analysed using circuit topology framework. 

For a chain with two binary contacts, three arrangements are available: parallel, series and crossed. For a chain with n contacts, the topology can be described by an n by n matrix in which each element illustrates the relation between a pair of contacts and may take one of the three states, P, S and X. 
[[Image:Circuit topology.jpg|right|250px|right|Circuit topology relations in a chain with two binary contacts.]] Multi-valent intra chain interactions can often be structurally decomposed into binary interactions and then be subjected to similar analysis. 

Circuit topology has implications for folding kinetics and molecular evolution.

[[File:Clone war of sea anemones 2-17-08-2.jpg|thumb|[[Sea anemones]] compete for the [[Territory (animal)|territory]] in [[tide pools]]]]

'''Competition''' is an  [[Biological interaction|interaction]] between [[organism]]s or [[species]] in which both the organisms or species are harmed. [[Limiting factor|Limited]] supply of at least one [[Resource (biological)|resource]] (such as [[food]], [[water]], and [[Territory (animal)|territory]]) used by both can be a factor.&lt;ref&gt;Begon, M.; Harper, J. L.; Townsend, C. R. (1996) ''[[Ecology: Individuals, populations and communities]]'' Blackwell Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Competition both within and between [[species]] is an important topic in [[ecology]], especially [[community ecology]]. Competition is one of many interacting [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors that affect [[community (ecology)|community]] structure. Competition among members of the same species is known as [[intraspecific competition]], while competition between individuals of different species is known as [[interspecific competition]]. Competition is not always straightforward, and can occur in both a direct and indirect fashion.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{ cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html |author1 =Sahney, S. |author2=Benton, M.J. |author3 =Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume=6 | pages=544–547 | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the [[competitive exclusion principle]], species less suited to compete for resources should either [[Adaptation|adapt]] or [[Extinction|die out]], although competitive exclusion is rarely found in natural ecosystems. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources is important in [[natural selection]]. However, competition may play less of a role than expansion among larger [[clades]];&lt;ref name="Jardine2012"&gt;{{citation |author1 =Jardine, P.E. |author2 =Janis, C.M. |author3 =Sahney, S. |author4 =Benton, M.J. | title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates Glires | journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | year=2012 | pages= 1–10 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001 | volume=365-366}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is termed the 'Room to Roam' hypothesis.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

== By mechanism ==
Competition occurs by various [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanism]]s, which can generally be divided into direct and indirect. These  apply equally to intraspecific and interspecific competition. Biologists typically recognize two types of competition: interference and exploitative competition. During interference competition, organisms interact directly by fighting for scarce resources. For example, large [[aphid]]s defend feeding sites on [[Populus angustifolia|cottonwood]]&lt;!--which species?--&gt; leaves by ejecting smaller aphids from better sites. In contrast, during exploitative competition, organisms interact indirectly by consuming scarce resources. For example, [[plants]] consume [[nitrogen]] by [[Nitrogen assimilation|absorbing]] it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. Plants that produce many roots typically reduce [[Nitrogen fixation|soil nitrogen]] to very low levels, eventually killing neighboring plants.{{cn|date=January 2017}}
 
[[File:Hirschkampf.jpg|thumb|Male-male competition in [[red deer]] during [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]] is an example of interference competition within a species.]]

===Interference===

Interference competition occurs directly between individuals via [[aggression]] etc. when the individuals interfere with foraging, survival, reproduction of others, or by directly preventing their physical establishment in a portion of the habitat. An example of this can be seen between the ant ''[[Novomessor cockerelli]]'' and [[Pogonomyrmex barbatus|red harvester ants]], where the former interferes with the ability of the latter to forage by plugging the entrances to their [[Colony (biology)|colonies]] with small rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Barton, Kasey E. |author2=Sanders, Nathan J. |author3=Gordon, Deborah M. |year=2002 |title=The Effects of Proximity and Colony Age on Interspecific Interference Competition between the Desert Ants ''Pogonomyrmex barbatus'' and ''Aphaenogaster cockerelli'' |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=148 |issue=2 |pages=376–382 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2002)148[0376:TEOPAC]2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitative===

Exploitation competition occurs indirectly through a common [[limiting resource]] which acts as an intermediate. For example, use of resources depletes the amount available to others, or they compete for space.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. (1982) Resource competition and community structure. Princeton university press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apparent===

Apparent competition occurs indirectly between two species which are both preyed upon by the same predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Predation, apparent competition, and the structure of prey communities |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040580977900429 |journal=Theoretical Population Biology |date=1977 |pages=197–229 |volume=12 |issue=2 |doi=10.1016/0040-5809(77)90042-9 |first=Robert D. |last=Holt |pmid=929457}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, species A and species B are both prey of predator C. The increase of species A may cause the decrease of species B, because the increase of As may aid in the survival of predator Cs, which will increase the number of predator Cs, which in turn will hunt more of species B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Van Nouhuys | first1=S. | last2=Hanski | first2=I. | doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00123.x | title=Apparent competition between parasitoids mediated by a shared hyperparasitoid | journal=Ecology Letters | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=82–84 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By size asymmetry ==
{{Main|size-asymmetric competition}}

Competition varies from [[size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to [[size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely [[size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities, e.g. in plant communities size-asymmetric competition for light has stronger effects on diversity compared with competition for soil resources.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==By taxonomic relationship==
{{See also|Female intrasexual competition}}

Competition can occur between individuals of the same species, called intraspecific competition, or between different species, called interspecific competition. Studies show that intraspecific competition can regulate population dynamics (changes in population size over time). This occurs because individuals become crowded as a population grows. Since individuals within a population require the same resources, crowding causes resources to become more limited. Some individuals (typically small juveniles) eventually do not acquire enough resources and die or do not reproduce. This reduces population size and slows population growth.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Species also interact with other species that require the same resources. Consequently, interspecific competition can alter the sizes of many species' populations at the same time. Experiments demonstrate that when species compete for a limited resource, one species eventually drives the populations of other species extinct. These experiments suggest that competing species cannot coexist (they cannot live together in the same area) because the best competitor will exclude all other competing species.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

===Intraspecific===

{{Main|Intraspecific competition}}
Intraspecific competition occurs when members of the same species compete for the same [[Natural resource|resource]]s in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Townsend2008"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Townsend, Colin R.; Begon, Michael | title=Essentials of Ecology | year=2008 | pages=103–105 | isbn=978-1-4051-5658-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interspecific===

{{Main|Interspecific competition}}
Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered [[fecundity]], growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter [[population]]s, communities and the evolution of interacting species. An example among animals could be the case of [[cheetah]]s and [[lion]]s; since both species feed on similar prey, they are negatively impacted by the presence of the other because they will have less food, however they still persist together, despite the prediction that under competition one will displace the other. In fact, lions sometimes steal prey items killed by cheetahs.  Potential competitors can also kill each other, in so-called '[[intraguild predation]]'.  For example, in southern California coyotes often kill and eat gray foxes and bobcats, all three carnivores sharing the same stable prey (small mammals).&lt;ref&gt;.Fedriani, J. M., T. K. Fuller, R. M. Sauvajot and E. C. York. 2000. Competition and intraguild predation among three sympatric carnivores. [[Oecologia]], 125:258-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example among protozoa involves ''[[Paramecium aurelia]]'' and ''[[Paramecium caudatum]].'' Russian ecologist, [[Georgy Gause]], studied the competition between the two species of ''Paramecium'' that occurred as a result of their coexistence. Through his studies, Gause proposed the [[Competitive exclusion principle]], observing the competition that occurred when their different ecological niches overlapped.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgy Gause|Gause, G.F.]] (1934). ''The struggle for existence''. Baltimore, MD: Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition has been observed between individuals, populations and species, but there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. For example, mammals lived beside reptiles for many millions of years of time but were unable to gain a competitive edge until dinosaurs were devastated by the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

== Evolutionary strategies ==
{{Main|r/K selection theory|Verhulst equation}}

In evolutionary contexts, competition is related to the concept of r/K selection theory, which relates to the [[Natural selection|selection]] of [[Trait (biological)|trait]]s which promote success in particular environments. The theory originates from work on [[island biogeography]] by the ecologists [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E. O. Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur, R.]] and [[E. O. Wilson|Wilson, E. O.]] (1967). ''The Theory of Island Biogeography'', [[Princeton University Press]] (2001 reprint), {{ISBN|0-691-08836-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[r/K selection theory]], selective pressures are hypothesised to drive evolution in one of two stereotyped directions: ''r''- or ''K''-selection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Pianka|Pianka, E. R.]] (1970). On r and K selection. ''[[American Naturalist]] '104' '', 592-597.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms, r and K, are derived from standard ecological [[algebra]], as illustrated in the simple [[Verhulst equation#Verhulst equation|Verhulst equation]] of [[population dynamics]]:&lt;ref name=Verhulst&gt;[[Pierre François Verhulst|Verhulst, P. F.]] (1838). Notice sur la loi que la population pursuit dans son accroissement. ''Corresp. Math. Phys. '10' '', 113-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\left(1 - \frac{N}{K}\right) \qquad \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''r'' is the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] of the [[population]] (''N''), and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of its local environmental setting. Typically, r-selected species exploit empty [[Ecological niche|niches]], and produce many [[offspring]], each of whom has a relatively low [[probability]] of surviving to adulthood. In contrast, K-selected species are strong competitors in crowded niches, and [[Parental investment|invest]] more heavily in much fewer offspring, each with a relatively high probability of surviving to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Verhulst/&gt;

== Competitive exclusion principle ==
[[File:Competitive-20Exclusion-20Principle.svg|thumb|1: a smaller (yellow) species of bird forages across whole tree.&lt;br&gt;2: a larger (red) species competes for resources.&lt;br&gt;3: red dominates in middle for the more abundant resources. Yellow adapts to new niche, avoiding competition.]]
{{main article|Competitive exclusion principle}}

To explain how species coexist, in 1934 [[Georgii Gause]] proposed the [[competitive exclusion principle]] which is also called the Gause principle: species cannot coexist if they have the same [[ecological niche]]. The word "niche" refers to a species' requirements for survival and reproduction. These requirements include both resources (like food) and proper [[habitat]] conditions (like temperature or pH). Gause reasoned that if two species had identical niches (required identical resources and habitats) they would attempt to live in exactly the same area and would compete for exactly the same resources. If this happened, the species that was the best competitor would always exclude its competitors from that area. Therefore, species must at least have slightly different niches in order to coexist.&lt;ref name=hardin60&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hardin, Garrett |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal=Science |volume=131 |pages=1292–1297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015&gt;{{cite book | last=Pocheville | first=Arnaud | year=2015 | chapter=The Ecological Niche: History and Recent Controversies | chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/6188833/The_Ecological_Niche_History_and_Recent_Controversies | editor1-last=Heams | editor1-first=Thomas | editor2-last=Huneman | editor2-first=Philippe | editor3-last=Lecointre | editor3-first=Guillaume |display-editors=3 | editor4-last=Silberstein | editor4-first=Marc | title=Handbook of Evolutionary Thinking in the Sciences | location=Dordrecht | publisher=Springer | publication-date=2015 | pages=547–586 | isbn=978-94-017-9014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character displacement ==
[[File:Geospiza fortis.jpg|thumbnail|left|Medium ground finch ([[Geospiza fortis]]) on Santa Cruz Island in the [[Galapagos Islands|Galapagos]]]]
{{main article|Character displacement}}

Competition can cause species to evolve differences in traits. This occurs because the individuals of a species with traits similar to competing species always experience strong interspecific competition. These individuals have less reproduction and survival than individuals with traits that differ from their competitors. Consequently, they will not contribute many offspring to future generations. For example, [[Darwin's finches]] can be found alone or together on the [[Galapagos Islands]]. Both species' populations actually have more individuals with intermediate-sized beaks when they live on islands without the other species present. However, when both species are present on the same island, competition is intense between individuals that have intermediate-sized beaks of both species because they all require intermediate sized seeds. Consequently, individuals with small and large beaks have greater survival and reproduction on these islands than individuals with intermediate-sized beaks. Different finch species can coexist if they have traits—for instance, beak size—that allow them to specialize on particular resources. When ''[[Geospiza fortis]]'' and ''[[Geospiza fuliginosa]]'' are present on the same island, ''G. fuliginosa'' tends to evolve a small beak and ''G. fortis'' a large beak. The observation that competing species' traits are more different when they live in the same area than when competing species live in different areas is called character displacement. For the two finch species, beak size was displaced: Beaks became smaller in one species and larger in the other species. Studies of character displacement are important because they provide evidence that competition is important in determining ecological and evolutionary patterns in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, W. L., and [[E. O. Wilson]]. 1956. "Character displacement". ''Systematic Zoology'' 5:49–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2529">'''Correlative''' ("corelative," UK spelling) is the term adopted by [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]] to describe the philosophical relationships between fundamental legal concepts in [[jurisprudence]].

== Hohfeldian analysis ==

Hohfeld was concerned that there was some ambiguity in the explanation of the similarities and differences between concepts in law. Hence, with the focus on the nature of ''rights'', he proposed a system of analysis based on "jural correlatives" and "jural opposites". A correlative is where two concepts are [[logically consistent]] and the one necessarily implies the other. When two concepts are Hohfeldian opposites (technically, logical contradictions), they are mutually exclusive.

Thus, if A has a right with regard to B, an analysis of their relationship from B's point of view must imply that B has a duty to A. An owner of land may hold four distinct entitlements: rights, privileges, powers, and immunities. Hohfeld linked each entitlement to a corelative and its opposite:

{| style="width:250px; height:200px" border="1"
|- 
| '''Elements'''
| '''Correlatives'''
| '''Opposites'''
|- style="height:100px" 
| Right
| style="width:250px" |Duty
| No Right
|-
| Privilege or Liberty
| No Right
| Duty
|- style="height:100px" 
| Power
| style="width:250px" |Liability
| Disability
|- style="height:100px" 
| Immunity
| style="width:250px" |Disability
| Liability
|-
|-
|}

==In practice==
Jurists such as [[Mickey Dias]] and [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld#Hohfeldian analysis|Hohfeld]] have declared that rights and duties are ''jural corelatives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dias |title=Jurisprudence |year=1976 |first=Reginald Walter Michael |oclc=2668655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that if someone has a right, ''someone else'' owes a duty to him. This reasoning of Dias' was used in ''[[Murphy v Brentwood DC|Murphy v Brentwood District Council]]'' (1991) to disapprove  [[Alfred Denning|Lord Denning]] [[Master of the Rolls|MR]]'s judgment in ''[[Dutton v Bognor Regis UDC|Dutton v Bognor Regis Urban District Council]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;Denning had argued, wrongly, that when a local council has a right to inspect a building under construction, the council has a corresponding duty of care to "inspect properly".&lt;/ref&gt;

Digraphia has implications in [[language planning]], [[language policy]], and [[language ideology]].

==Terminology==
''Digraphia'' "using two writing systems for the same language" is an uncommon term, generally restricted to linguistic contexts.

===Etymology===
English [[wikt:digraphia|''digraphia'']], like [[French language|French]] [[wikt:digraphie|''digraphie'']], [[etymology|etymologically]] derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''di-'' [[wikt:δι-|''δι-'']] "twice" and ''-graphia'' [[wikt:-γραφία|''-γραφία'']] "writing".

''Digraphia'' was modeled upon [[wikt:diglossia|''diglossia'']] "the coexistence of two languages or dialects among a certain population", which derives from Greek ''diglossos'' [[wikt:δίγλωσσος|δίγλωσσος]] "bilingual." [[Charles A. Ferguson]], a founder of [[sociolinguistics]],  coined ''diglossia'' in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferguson | first1 = Charles A | year = 1959 | title = Diglossia | url = | journal = Word | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 325–340 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grivelet analyzes how the influence of diglossia on the unrelated notion of digraphia has "introduced some distortion in the process of defining digraphia," such as distinguishing "high" and "low" varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Unseth notes one usage of "digraphia" that most closely parallels Ferguson’s “diglossia,” situations where a language uses different scripts for different domains; for instance, "shorthand in English, [[pinyin]] in Chinese for alphabetizing library files, etc. or several scripts which are replaced by Roman script during e-mail usage."&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which does not yet include ''digraphia'', enters two ''digraph'' terms and ''digraphic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' (2009). 2nd ed., v. 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt; First, the [[linguistic]] term ''digraph'' is defined as, "A group of two letters expressing a simple sound of speech". This meaning applies to both two letters representing a single speech sound in [[Digraph (orthography)|orthography]] (e.g., English ''ng'' representing the [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}}) and a single [[grapheme]] with two letters in [[Typographical ligature#Digraphs|typographical ligature]] (e.g., the [[Old English Latin alphabet]] letter [[æ]]). Second, the [[graph theory]] term ''digraph'' (a [[portmanteau]] from [[directed graph]]) is defined as, "A graph in which each line has a direction associated with it; a finite, non-empty set of elements together with a set of ordered pairs of these elements." The two ''digraph'' terms were first recorded in 1788 and 1955, respectively. The ''OED2'' defines two ''digraphic'' meanings, "Pertaining to or of the nature of a digraph" and "Written in two different characters or alphabets." It gives their earliest examples in 1873 and 1880 (which was used meaning "digraphia"). [[Isaac Hollister Hall]], an American scholar of [[Oriental studies]], described an [[Eteocypriot language]] publication as "bilingual (or digraphic, as both inscriptions are in the same language)."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Isaac Hollister (1880). "The Cypriote Inscriptions". ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', vol. 20, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4YwPAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q=digraphic&amp;f=false p. 205].&lt;/ref&gt; Hall's article was antedated by [[Demetrios Pieridis]]'s 1875 usage of ''digraphic'' instead of ''bilingual'' for an inscription written in both the [[Greek alphabet]] and [[Cypriot syllabary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pierides | first1 = Demetrios | year = 1875 | title = On a digraphic inscription found in Larnaca | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ursMAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=gypDUe5UVx&amp;dq=On%20a%20digraphic%20inscription%20found%20in%20Larnaca&amp;pg=PA38 | journal = Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

English ''digraphic'' and ''digraphia'' were contemporaneous with their corresponding terms in French linguistics. In 1877, [[Julius Oppert]] introduced ''digraphique'' to describe languages written in [[cuneiform]] syllabaries.&lt;ref&gt;Oppert, Jules (1877). [Review of] François Lenormant, Études sur quelques parties des syllabaires cunéiformes, Paris 1877; idem, Les syllabaires cunéiformes, Paris 1877. Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen 1877(45–46). 1409–1449.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, [[Auguste Barth]] used French ''digraphisme'' for Cambodian inscriptions written in [[Khmer script]] and [[Brāhmī script]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergaigne, Abel (1893). Inscriptions sanscrites du Cambodge [edited and commented by Auguste Barth]. Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque Nationale et autres bibliothèques 27(1). 293–588.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[Robèrt Lafont]] coined ''digraphie'' regarding the sociolinguistics of French and [[Occitan language|Occitan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lafont | first1 = Robert | year = 1971 | title = Un problème de culpabilité sociologique: La diglossie franco-occitane | url = http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1971_num_9_1_5576 | journal = Langue française | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 93–99 | doi=10.3406/lfr.1971.5576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the word "digraphia" is new, the practice is ancient. [[Darius the Great]]'s (c. 522-486 BCE) [[Behistun Inscription]] was written in three [[cuneiform script]]s for [[Old Persian]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], and [[Babylonian language|Babylonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unseth | first1 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Sociolinguistic parallels between choosing scripts and languages | url = | journal = Written Language &amp; Literacy | volume = 8 | issue = 1| page = 36 | doi=10.1075/wll.8.1.02uns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neologizers===
Four authors independently neologized English ''digraphia'' from ''diglossia''.

The [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] [[linguist]] Petr Zima (1974) first used "digraphia" to describe the [[Hausa language]] having two writing systems, [[Boko (alphabet)|Boko]] ([[Latin script]]) and [[Ajami script]] ([[Arabic script]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zima | first1 = Petr | year = 1974 | title = Digraphia: The case of Hausa | url = http://related.springerprotocols.com/lp/de-gruyter/digraphia-the-case-of-hausa-ZFtJZ8w2Kk | journal = Linguistics | volume = 124 | issue = | pages = 57–69 | doi=10.1515/ling.1974.12.124.57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zima differentiated these paired situations.
*''Digraphia'': "Two types of written form of one language co-exist, based upon the usage of two distinct graphical systems (scripts) by the respective language community."
*''Diorthographia'': "Two types of written form of a particular language co-exist, using the same script, but they are based upon the usage of two distinct orthographies by the same language community."&lt;ref&gt;Zima (1974), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;
Usage of "diorthographia" is unusual. Compare [[dysgraphia]] meaning "a language disorder that affects a person's ability to write" and [[dysorthographia]] "a synonym for [[dyslexia]]".

The [[anthropologist]] James R. Jaquith (1976), who studied unconventional spelling in advertising, used "digraphia" to describe the practice of writing brand names in [[all caps]] (e.g., [[Arrid|ARRID]]). He described digraphia as "the graphic analog of what linguists call diglossia", and defined it as "different versions of a written language exist simultaneously and in complementary distribution in a speech community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jaquith | first1 = James R | year = 1976 | title = Digraphia in advertising: The public as guinea pig | url = | journal = Visible Language | volume = 10 | issue = 4| page = 303 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sociolinguist]] Ian R. H. Dale (1980) wrote a general survey of digraphia, defined as, "the use of two (or more) writing systems to represent varieties of a single language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dale | first1 = Ian R. H. | year = 1980 | title = Digraphia | url = http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d5134/rm2173940.doc | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 26 | issue =  | pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1515/ijsl.1980.26.5 | access-date = 2011-08-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111007201951/http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d5134/rm2173940.doc | archive-date = 2011-10-07 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[sinologist]] and [[lexicographer]] [[John DeFrancis]] (1984) used ''digraphia'', defined as "the use of two or more different systems of writing the same language," to translate Chinese ''shuangwenzhi'' (雙文制 "two-script system") of writing in [[Chinese characters]] and [[Pinyin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = DeFrancis | first1 = John | year = 1984 | title = Digraphia | url = | journal = Word | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 59–66 | doi=10.1080/00437956.1984.11435748}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DeFrancis later explained, "I have been incorrectly credited with coining the term ''digraphia'', which I indeed thought I had created as a parallel in writing to Charles Ferguson’s ''diglossia'' in speech."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John (2006). [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp171_chinese_writing_reform.pdf Prospects for Chinese Writing Reform], ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'' 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegyi coined and suggested the terms "bigraphism" and "multigraphism",&lt;ref&gt;Hegyi, O. 1979. Minority and restricted uses of the Arabic alphabet: the aljamiado phenomenon. ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' Vol. 99, No. 2:262-269.&lt;/ref&gt; but he only used them in a footnote (fn. 17, p. 268) and did not promote the use of either of these terms, nor follow up on his insights into the importance of studying "the use of two or more different writing systems for the same language... such cases have been more widespread than commonly assumed."

===Usage===
''Digraphia'' is an uncommon term in current English usage. For instance, the [[Corpus of Contemporary American English]], which includes over 425,000,000 words, lists ''digraphia'' three times in "academic genre" contexts.
 
Stéphane Grivelet, who edited a special "Digraphia: Writing systems and society" issue of the ''[[International Journal of the Sociology of Language]]'', explains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grivelet | first1 = Stéphane | year = 2001 | title = Introduction", "Digraphia: Writing systems and society | url = | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 1–10 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2001.037}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;After 25 years and various articles on the subject, there are still important differences in the scope of the definition, and the notion itself is rarely used in sociolinguistics, apart from the field of Chinese studies, where the notion of digraphia is nowadays frequently used to describe the coexistence of two writing systems: Chinese script and Pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Digraphia''' has some rare synonyms. '''Orthographic diglossia''' antedates digraphia, and was noted by Paul Wexler in 1971."&lt;ref&gt;Wexler, Paul (1971). "Diglossia, language standardization and purism." ''Lingua'' 27, 340. "Orthographic differences are not always a reflection of ethnocultural differences and multiple standards. Different scripts may be used by a single ethnic group for different purposes (e.g., secular versus religious literature), in which case we could speak of 'orthographic diglossia'."&lt;/ref&gt; '''Bigraphism''', '''bialphabetism''', and '''biscriptality''' are infrequently used.

Some scholars avoid using the word "digraphia". Describing terminology for "script obsolescence," [[Stephen D. Houston]], [[John Baines (Egyptologist)|John Baines]], and Jerrold Cooper say, "'Biscript' refers to a text in two different writing systems. 'Biliteracy' and 'triliteracy' label the concurrent use of two or three scripts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houston |first1=S. |last2=Baines |first2=J. |last3=Cooper |first3=J. |year=2003 |title=Last writing: Script obsolescence in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Mesoamerica |url=http://neareast.jhu.edu/bin/g/o/jc%20Last%20Writing.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History |volume=45 |issue=3 |page=432 |doi=10.1017/s0010417503000227 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical aspects==
Digraphia can be either "synchronic" (or "concurrent") or "diachronic" ("historical" or "sequential"),&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 60 uses concurrent and sequential.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s classic division between [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic linguistics]] and  [[historical linguistics|diachronic linguistics]]. Dale first differentiated "diachronic (or historical) digraphia" ("more than one writing system used for a given language in successive periods of time") and "synchronic digraphia" ("more than one writing system used contemporaneously for the same language").&lt;ref&gt;Dale (1980), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Dale concluded that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two primary factors have been identified as operating on a society in the choice of script for representing its language. These are the prevailing cultural influence (often a religion) and the prevailing political influence of the period in which the choice is made. Synchronic digraphia results when more than one such influence is operating and none can dominate all groups of speakers of the language in question [ … ] Diachronic digraphia results when different influences prevail over a given speech community at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Dale (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some recent scholarship questions the practicality of this synchronic/diachronic distinction. Grivelet contends that, "digraphia is a single sociolinguistic process with two types of outcome (concurrent or sequential digraphia) and with specific features related to the causes and types of development of the various cases.&lt;ref&gt;Grivelet (2001), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Unseth lists and exemplifies four factors that can influence a language community's choice of a script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Unseth | first1 = Peter | year = 2005 | title = Sociolinguistic parallels between choosing scripts and languages | url = | journal = Written Language &amp; Literacy | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 22–29 | doi=10.1075/wll.8.1.02uns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#"To identify themselves with a group." In the 1940s, Mongolia replaced the traditional [[Mongolian script]] first briefly with the [[Mongolian Latin alphabet]] and then, under Soviet influence, with the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. From the 1980s, the Mongolian script was reintroduced into schools for its historical and cultural importance.
#"To distance themselves from a group." In the mid-19th century, the LDS Church developed and promoted the [[Deseret alphabet]] for English. [[Brigham Young]] publicly claimed it was more phonetically accurate than Latin script and would facilitate learning to read and write English. However, historian David Bigler says the Deseret alphabet "demonstrated cultural exclusivism, an important consideration. It also kept secrets from curious non-Mormons, [and] controlled what children would be allowed to read."&lt;ref&gt;Bigler, David (1998). ''Forgotten kingdom: the Mormon theocracy in the American West, 1847–1896'', p. 56. Arthur Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Participation in developments on a broader scale. The choice of a script can influence a group's preparedness to interact with other regional or international groups. For instance, the [[Hmong language]] has numerous alternate writing systems. Hmong who live in Southeast Asia prefer the indigenous [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]] (RPA) or the [[Pahawh Hmong]] [[semi-syllabary]]; Hmong expatriates who live in the United States prefer to romanize names differently, such as Latin ''Hmong'' instead of RPA ''Hmoob''.
#"Linguistic considerations." Sometimes a foreign script is rejected because it is unsuitable for the phonetics of a language. [[Korean language|Korean]] was first written in logographic ''[[Hanja]]'' Chinese characters, but king [[Sejong the Great]] promulgated the [[Hangul]] alphabet, which is better suited for transcribing [[Korean phonology]]. In the present day, [[South Korea]]n uses both ''Hanja'' logographs and ''Hangul'' letters, while [[North Korea]] uses only ''Hangul''.

Linguists who study [[language and gender]] have analyzed gender-differentiated speech varieties ("genderlects", usually spoken by women), and there are a few cases of scripts predominantly used by women. Japanese ''hiragana'' was initially a women's script, for instance, used by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] to write ''[[The Tale of Genji]]''. Chinese [[Nüshu script]] (literally "women's writing) is a simplification of characters that was traditionally used by women in [[Jiangyong County]] of [[Hunan]] province.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only scripts, but also letters can have iconic power to differentiate social groups. For example, the names of many [[heavy metal bands]] (e.g., [[Motörhead]], [[Infernäl Mäjesty]], [[Mötley Crüe]]) use umlauts "to index the musical genre as well as the notion of ‘Gothic’ more generally."&lt;ref&gt;Sebba (2009), p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; This digraphic usage is called the "[[metal umlaut]]" (or "röck döts").

==Synchronic digraphia==
''Synchronic digraphia'' is the coexistence of two or more writing systems for the same language. A modern example is the [[Serbian language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ivković | first1 = Dejan | year = 2013 | title = Pragmatics meets ideology: Digraphia and non-standard orthographic practices in Serbian online news forums | url = | journal = Journal of Language and Politics | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 335–356 | doi = 10.1075/jlp.12.3.02ivk }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is written in either the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] or [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]]. Although most speakers can read and write both scripts, Roman Catholic Croatians and Muslim [[Bosniaks]] generally use Latin, while Orthodox Serbians commonly use both. However, older indigenous scripts were used much earlier, most notably [[Bosnian Cyrillic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trager | first1 = George L | year = 1974 | title = Writing and writing systems | url = | journal = Current Trends in Linguistics | volume = 12 | issue = | page = 413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inuktitut]] is also officially digraphic, using both Latin and [[Inuktitut syllabics]]. In [[Hindi-Urdu]], the [[Devanagari]] or [[Persian script]] generally follows the [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] standards and the speaker's religious affiliation, though Urdu is sometimes written in Devanagari in India. Digraphia is limited, however, in that most people know only one script.

The [[Japanese writing system]] has unusually complex digraphia. William C. Hannas distinguishes two digraphic forms of Japanese: "true digraphia" of occasionally using ''[[rōmaji]]'' Latin alphabet for a few [[loanwords]] like ''DVD'', and of regularly using three scripts (technically, "trigraphia") for different functions. Japanese is written with ''[[kanji]]'' "Chinese character" [[Logogram|logographs]] used for [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]; ''[[hiragana]]'' used for native Japanese words; and ''[[katakana]]'' used for foreign borrowings or graphic emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, William C. (1997). ''Asia's Orthographic Dilemma''. University of Hawaii Press, pp. 299-300.&lt;/ref&gt; Take ''Nihon'' for instance, the primary [[Names of Japan|name of Japan]]. It is normally written 日本 (literally, "sun's origin") in ''kanji'' – but is occasionally written にほん in ''hiragana'', ニホン in ''katakana'', or Nihon in ''[[rōmaji]]'' ("romanization"). Japanese users having a certain amount of flexibility in choosing between scripts, and their choices can have social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sebba | first1 = Mark | year = 2009 | title = Sociolinguistic approaches to writing systems research | url = | journal = Writing Systems Research | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 38 | doi=10.1093/wsr/wsp002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Berontoseno Arabica Coffee 250gr in Multiscript.jpg|thumb|247x247px|The use of Javanese script, [[Pegon script|Pegon]] (modified Arabic script) and Latin alphabet for coffee packaging in Indonesia saying ''100% Pure Coffee Powder''.]]
Another example is the [[Malay language]], which most often uses the [[Latin alphabet]], while in certain geographic areas ([[Kelantan]] state of Malaysia, [[Brunei]]) it is also written with an adapted Arabic alphabet called [[Jawi script|Jawi]]. Adaptation of Arabic script is also widely used across [[Malay Archipelago]] since the introduction of [[Islam]]. In Java, [[Javanese people|Javanese]] people, which predominantly ruled by [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhism|Buddha]] kingdoms, have their own writing system called [[Javanese script|Hanacaraka]]. When Islamic power took place, modified Arabic writing system (called [[Pegon script|Pegon]]) was introduced, alongside with the massive introduction of Latin alphabet by western colonialists. This results in the use of three writing systems to write modern Javanese, either based on a particular context (religious, cultural or normal), or sometimes also written simultaneously. This phenomenon also occurred in some other cultures in Indonesia.

An element of synchronic digraphia is present in many languages not using the Latin script, in particular in text messages and when typing on a computer which does not have the facility to represent the usual script for that language. In such cases, Latin script is often used, although systems of transcription are often not standardised.

Digraphia is controversial in modern [[Written Chinese]]. The ongoing [[debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]] concerns "diglyphia" or "[[Pluricentric language|pluricentricity]]" rather than digraphia. Chinese digraphia involves the use of both [[Chinese characters]] and [[Hanyu Pinyin]] romanization. Pinyin is officially approved for a few special uses, such as annotating characters for learners of Chinese and transcribing Chinese names.&lt;ref&gt;Xieyan Hincha (2004). [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp134_chinese_digraphia.pdf Two Steps Toward Digraphia in China]. ''Sino-Platonic Papers'' 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Pinyin continues to be adopted for other functions, such as computers, education, library catalogs, and merchandise labels.&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[Chinese input methods for computers]], [[Pinyin input method|Pinyin]] is the most popular phonetic method. [[Zhou Youguang]] predicts, "Digraphia is perhaps the key for Chinese to enter the age of Information processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Youguang | first1 = Zhou | year = 1986 | title = Modernization of the Chinese Language | url = http://plosjournal.deepdyve.com/lp/de-gruyter/modernization-of-the-chinese-language-SmsCBMDYNZ | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 7–23 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.1986.59.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many writers, both from China (e.g., [[Mao Dun]] and Zhou Youguang) and from abroad (e.g., John DeFrancis, [[Victor H. Mair]], [[J. Marshall Unger]], and William Hannas&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, William C. (1997). ''Asia's Orthographic Dilemma''. University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;) have argued for digraphia to be implemented as a Chinese language standard. These digraphic reformers call for a generalized used of Pinyin orthography along with Chinese characters. 
Yat-Shing Cheung differentiates three Chinese digraphic situations. (1) Both the High and the Low forms derive from the same script system: traditional and simplified characters. (2) Both forms derive from the same system but the Low form borrows foreign elements: [[Putonghua]] and topolects (or "dialects"). (3) The High and the Low forms derive from two different script systems: Chinese characters and pinyin.&lt;ref&gt;Cheung, Yat-Shing (1992). "The form and meaning of digraphia: the case of Chinese". In K. Bolton and H. Kwok. ''Sociolinguistics Today: International Perspectives''. 210-215. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diachronic digraphia==
"Diachronic" or "sequential digraphia", in which a language switches writing systems, can occur historically through [[language change]] or suddenly through [[language reform]]. "Abrupt script shift can be seen in the change of Turkish from Arabic script to Roman (in one year), while a gradual change of script can be seen in the change from writing Korean in Chinese characters to Hangul (a process that arguably nearly spanned five centuries)."&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Azerbaijani language]] provides an "extreme example" of diachronic digraphia; it has historically been written in [[Runic alphabet|runic]], Arabic, Latin, Cyrillic, and again Latin alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth (2005), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Lynley. 2008. Script change in Azerbaijan: acts of identity. ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language'' 192:105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of languages that used to be written in a script, which was replaced later. Examples are [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (which originally used [[Cyrillic]] and changed to [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]) in the 1860s; [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (which switched from a form of Chinese writing called [[Chữ Nôm]] to the Latin alphabet); [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Somali language|Somali]], and (partially) [[Malay language|Malay]], which all switched from [[Arabic script]] to the [[Latin alphabet]], and many countries of the former Soviet Union, which abandoned the [[Cyrillic]] script after the dissolution of the [[USSR]] such as [[Moldova]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]] all switched from Cyrillic to Latin. DeFrancis notes, "The old literature in the earlier scripts remains, however, so that all these scripts more or less overlap in use, by scholars involved with early texts, or for reprinting earlier materials for a wider readership and for other limited uses."&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis (1984), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4767">The '''flail space model (FSM)''' is a [[Physical model|model]] of how a [[passenger|car passenger]] moves in a [[vehicle]] that collides with a roadside feature such as a [[Traffic barrier|guardrail]] or a [[crash cushion]]. Its principal purpose is to assess the potential risk of harm to the hypothetical occupant as he or she impacts the interior of the passenger compartment and, ultimately, the efficacy of an experimental roadside feature undergoing full-scale vehicle crash testing.

The FSM eliminates the complexity and expense of using instrumented [[Crash test dummy|anthropometric dummies]] during the crash test experiments. Furthermore, while crash test dummies were developed to model collisions between vehicles, they are not accurate when used for the sorts of collision angles that occur when a vehicle collides with a roadside feature; by contrast, the FSM was designed for such collisions.&lt;ref name="gabauer"&gt;Gabauer, Douglas, "A methodology to evaluate the flail space model using event data recorder technology", Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rowan University, Glassboro, NJ, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The FSM is based on research performed at [[Southwest Research Institute]] in 1980&lt;ref&gt;Michie, J. D., "Development of improved criteria for evaluating safety performance of highway appurtenances", Final Report of  Internal Research Project No. 03-9254, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, June 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and published in 1981 in the paper entitled "Collision Risk Assessment Based on Occupant Flail-Space Model" by Jarvis D. Michie.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Michie, J. D., "Collision risk assessment based on occupant flail space model," in Transportation Research Record 796, 1981, pp. 1–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The FSM (coined by Michie) was accepted by the highway community and published as a key part of the "Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances" published in 1981 in [[National Cooperative Highway Research Program]] (NCHRP) Report 230.&lt;ref&gt;Michie, J. D.  National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 230: Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluation of Highway Appurtenances.  NCHRP Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, March 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the NCHRP Report was updated and presented as NCHRP Report 350;&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H. E., Jr. et al.  National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 350:  Recommended Procedures for the Safety Evaluation of Highway Features.  NCHRP Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; in this research effort performed by the [[Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute|Texas Transportation Research Institute]], the FSM was reexamined and was unmodified in the new publication. In 2004, Douglas Gabauer further examined the efficacy of the FSM in his [[PhD thesis]].&lt;ref name="gabauer" /&gt; The [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO) retained the FSM as the method of assessing the risk of harm to vehicle occupants in the 2009 "Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware" that replaced NCHRP Report 350, stating that the FSM had "served its intended purpose well".&lt;ref&gt;Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware.  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Washington, DC,  2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Details ==
The FSM hypothesis divides the collision into two stages.  In stage one, the unrestrained occupant is propelled forward and sideways in the compartment space due to vehicle collision [[Acceleration|accelerations]] and then impacts one or more surfaces (including the steering wheel) with velocity "V". According to the model, the vehicle (instead of the occupant) is the object that is accelerating. The occupant experiences no injury-producing force prior to contact with the compartment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In stage two, the occupant is assumed to remain in contact with the compartment surface and experiences the same accelerations as the vehicle for the rest of the collision.  The occupant may sustain [[Blunt trauma|injury]] at the end of stage one based on the velocity of impact with the compartment surfaces and due to vehicle accelerations during stage two.  The occupant impact velocity and acceleration are computed from the vehicle collision acceleration history and the compartment geometry.  Finally, the hypothetical occupant impact velocity and acceleration are then compared to threshold values of [[Engineering tolerance|human tolerance]] to these forces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13115">In social science '''foodways''' are the [[culture|cultural]], [[society|social]], and [[economics|economic]] practices relating to the production and consumption of [[food]].
Foodways often refers to the intersection of food in culture, traditions, and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Darnton|first=Julia|title=Foodways: When food meets culture and history|url=http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/foodways_when_food_meets_culture_and_history|website=Michigan State University Extension|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/encyclopedia/entries/F/FO014.html |work=Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |title= Foodways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and Historical Overview ==

The ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary'' defines Foodways as "the eating habits and culinary practices of a people, region, or historical period".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary|title=foodways:}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ′foodways′ appears to have been coined in 1942 by three University of Chicago graduate students, John W. Bennett, Harvey L. Smith and Herbert Passim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rachellaudan.com/2017/02/19542.html|title=Foodways and Ways of Talking about Food}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, agricultural scientists and rural sociologists, usually under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture, had undertaken various studies of food habits of the rural poor, with the aim of improving them. With the advent of World War II, these efforts increased. Those with information to share about different food habits were encouraged to contact the anthropologist Margaret Mead at the National Research Council. 

It was in these circumstances that John W. Bennett and his companions went to study Anglo-Americans, German-Americans and African-Americans in the fertile but frequently flooded bottomlands of southern Illinois along the banks of the Mississippi. All depended on white bread, pork, and potatoes. To the investigators these habits, particularly the spurning of plentiful, nutritious foods such as fish, seemed irrational. They argued "The illusion of an 'economic man,' searching out the most obscure foodstuffs from an unwilling Nature in the reasoned pursuit of complete fulfillment of his needs, must give way to the concept of a man conditioned by the preferences and prejudices of his neighbors, selecting only those foods sanctioned by the 'culture.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last==Bennett |first=John |first2=Harvey L. |last2=Smith |first3=Herbert |last3=Passim |last-author-amp=yes |date=October 1942 |title=Food and Culture in Southern Illinois–A Preliminary Report |journal= [[American Sociological Review]] |volume =7|p=645}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably they chose the term 'foodways' by analogy with the term 'folkways.' This had gained currency in the United States following its adoption by Yale professor and pioneering social scientist William Graham Sumnner. &lt;ref&gt;Folkways: A Study of the Sociological Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals (1906).&lt;/ref&gt; Since folkways were established by use, not reason, they were resistant to change and not easily altered by government intervention. Similarly, Bennett et al. concluded, foodways were not likely to change in just because bureaucrats suggested that new ways had economic or nutritional benefits. 

The term 'foodways' was little used until late 1960s and early 1970s and the surge in folklife research, including the establishment of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in 1967. As the field of Foodways develops, scholars offer their own definitions: "Contemporary scholarship defines foodways as the study of what we eat, as well as how and why and under what circumstances we eat it. As folklorist Jay Anderson argued in a pioneering 1971 essay, foodways encompasses “the whole interrelated system of food conceptualization and evaluation, procurement, preservation, preparation, consumption and nutrition shared by all the members of a particular society. This broad definition embraces both historical and regional differences while simultaneously pointing to the importance of food events (barbecues, Brunswick stew suppers, oyster roasts), food processes (ham curing, snap-bean canning, friend apple pie making), and even the aesthetic realms that touch upon the world of food (country songs about food, quilts raffled at community fish fries, literary references to eating)." - John T. Edge &lt;ref&gt; John Egerton, and Ann Bleidt Egerton. Southern Food: At Home, on the Road, in History. New York: Knopf :, 1987. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Social science ==

Anthropologists, folklorists, sociologists, historians, and food scholars often use the term foodways to describe the study of why we eat what we eat and what it means.  The term, therefore, looks at food consumption on a deeper than concrete level and includes, yet goes, beyond sustenance, recipes, and/or taste. Thus, according to Harris, Lyon and McLaughlin: “…everything about eating including what we consume, how we acquire it, who prepares it and who’s at the table – is a form of communication rich with meaning.  Our attitudes, practices and rituals around food are a window onto our most basic beliefs about the world and ourselves.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Patricia |last2=Lyon |first2=David |last3=McLaughlin |first3=Sue |date=2005 |title=The Meaning of Food|location= CT|publisher= The Globe Pequot Press|pages=VIII-IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics like social inclusion and exclusion, power, and sense making are explored under the umbrella term foodways. Furthermore, the ways in which food shapes and is shaped by social organization are essential to examination of foodways.  Since consumption of food is socially constructed, cultural study is also incorporated in the term.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

Anthropologist Mary Douglas, explains: “A very modest life of subsistence contrasts with our own use of goods, in for example, the use of food. How would we be able to say all of the things we want to say, even just to the members of our families, about different kinds of events and occasions and possibilities if we did not make any difference between breakfast and lunch and dinner and if we made no difference between Sunday and weekends, and never had a different kind of meal when friends came in, and if Christmas Day had also to be celebrated with the same kind of food?” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Douglas |first=Mary |editor-last=Hargreaves |editor-first=Shaun |editor-last2=Ross |editor-first2=Agus |date=1992 |title=Why Do People Want Goods? |journal= Understanding the Enterprise Culture |publisher= Edinburgh University Press |page= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in fields like anthropology, the production, procurement, preparation, presentation, and consumption of foods have always been regarded as central in the study of cultures&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal|author=Lévi-Strauss, Claude |date=1983|title=[[The Raw and the Cooked]]|journal= [[Mythologiques]] |volume =1|edition= Paperback Reprint |location= Chicago|publisher= University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; the use of the term foodways in popular culture is used as an oriented way of looking at food practices.  In this sense, the term is a consumer culture expression that encompasses, in popularly understandable and debatable formats, contemporaneous social practices related to foods as well as nutritional and culinary aspects of foods.

== Regional aspects ==

The term foodways can be employed when referencing the "ways of food" of a region or location. For example:
*The Foodways Section of the [[American Folklore Society]] and the Department of Popular Culture at [[Bowling Green State University]] release an annual publication called ''Digest: An Interdisciplinary Study of Food and Foodways''. In addition to scholarly articles, this annual compendium offers reports of works in progress on foodways.  These include photo essays, course syllabi, and announcements.  Also found here are reviews of books, periodicals, conferences, exhibits, festivals, museums, and films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://afsnet.org/sections/foodways/digest.htm |title=Digest: An Interdisciplinary Study of Food and Foodways|publisher=American Folklore Society: Foodways Section|author=Department of Popular Culture at Bowling Green State University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The website ''[[Michigan Foodways]]'' is devoted to "exhibitions and public programs focused on Michigan's unique contributions to the national culinary tapestry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=MichiganFoodways.org|url=http://www.michiganfoodways.org/|title=Michigan Foodways}} &lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Mystic Seaport Museum]] in Connecticut published the book ''Saltwater Foodways'', focusing on the foods of New Englanders.  It examines the population's behavior as seafaring people and when ashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mystic Seaport Museum|location=CT|url=http://foodhistorynews.com/saltwater.html|title=Saltwater Foodways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Colonial Williamsburg]] has a foodways staff dedicated to studying and recreating the foodways and practices of historical Williamsburg's upper class.  "The foodways team prepares dishes served to the colony's upper class because so much historical information about their culinary life is available, said Frank Clark, foodways supervisor and Colonial Williamsburg's first journeyman cook. Historians know far less about food practices of people further down the social scale, but cookbooks, documents, kitchen inventories, and archaeological research provide a detailed picture about how the governor and the gentry dined." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=History.org|url=http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/autumn04/food.cfm|title=Food|date=Autumn 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Southern Foodways Alliance]] explores the foodways of the [[American South]] via [[oral history]] projects, films, sharing of recipes, and promoting the teaching of foods and cultures of the region.  Their website also links to that of the University of Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernfoodways.com/ |website=SouthernFoodways.com|title=Southern Foodways Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigrant foodways are also featured prominently in America. For example, The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, located in Southeastern Massachusetts - which has a very large immigrant population from Cape Verde - describes Cape Verdean Foodways by publishing recipes from these southern Atlantic islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=University of Massachusetts at Dartmoth|url=http://www.umassd.edu/SpecialPrograms/caboverde/cvrecipes.html|title=Cape Verdean Recipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly approaches ==
In contrast to the anthropological treatments of food, the term foodways aims at a highly cross-disciplinary approach to food and nutrition. For example, the refereed journal ''Food and Foodways'', published by Taylor &amp; Francis, is "devoted to publishing original scholarly articles on the history and culture of human nourishment. By reflecting on the role food plays in human relations, this unique journal explores the powerful but often subtle ways in which food has shaped, and shapes, our lives socially, economically, politically, mentally, nutritionally, and morally. Because food is a pervasive social phenomenon, it cannot be approached by any one discipline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|website=researchgate.net|url=https://www.researchgate.net/journal/0740-9710_Food_and_Foodways|title=Food and Foodways}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In consumer culture research, contemporary and postmodern foodways are topics of interest. In an article in the journal ''Consumption Markets &amp; Culture'', from Taylor &amp; Francis publications, Douglas Brownlie, Paul Hewer, and Suzanne Horne explore culinary consumptionscapes through  a study of contemporary cookbooks, with chic recipes often turning intensely into a kind of "gastroporn", creating a "simulacrum of desire" as well as a "simulacrum of satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brownlie |first1=Douglas |last2=Hewer |first2=Paul |last3=Horne |first3=Suzanne |date=March 2005 |title=Culinary Tourism: An Exploratory Reading of Contemporary Representations of Cooking |journal=Consumption, Markets and Culture |volume= 8|pages= 7-26 |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/10253866.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical studies of foodways help scientists, anthropologists, and scholars gain insight into past cultures. Springer Publishing has released the book, ''Pre-Columbian Foodways'', by John Staller and Michael Carrasco, which studies and examines "the symbolic complexity of food and its preparation, as well as the social importance of feasting in contemporary and historical societies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.springer.com/social+sciences/anthropology+%26+archaeology/book/978-1-4419-0470-6 |title=Pre-Columbian Foodways |last=Staller |first=John |last2=Carrasco |first2=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Books like this help further the study of foodways and increase public awareness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5285">The '''gravitational metric system''' (original French term {{lang|fr|Système des Méchaniciens}}) is a non-standard system of units, which does not comply with the [[International System of Units]] (SI). It is built on the three [[base quantity|base quantities]] [[length]], [[time]] and [[force]] with [[base unit (measurement)|base units]] [[metre]], [[second]] and [[kilopond]] respectively. Internationally used abbreviations of the system are '''MKpS''', '''MKfS''' or '''MKS''' (from French {{lang|fr|mètre–kilogramme-poids–seconde}} or {{lang|fr|mètre–kilogramme-force–seconde}}).&lt;ref name="cardarelli"&gt;

|year=2003
|ISBN=185233682X
|url={{google books|BookID=6KCx8Ww75VkC|page=17}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the abbreviation MKS is also used for the [[MKS system of units]], which, like the SI, uses [[mass]] in [[kilogram]] as a base unit.

== Disadvantages ==

Nowadays, the mass as a property of an object and its weight, which depends on the gravity of the earth at its position are strictly distinguished. However historically, the kilopond was also called kilogram, and only later the kilogram-mass (today's kilogram) was separated from the kilogram-force (today's kilopond). A kilopond originally referred to the weight of a mass of one kilogram. Since the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the earth can differ, one gets different values for the unit kilopond and its derived units at different locations. To avoid this, the kilopond was first defined at sea-level and a [[latitude]] of 45 degrees, since 1902 via the [[standard gravity]] of {{val|9.80665|u=m/s2}}.

Further disadvantages are inconsistencies in the definition of derived units such as [[horsepower]] (1&amp;nbsp;PS = 75&amp;nbsp;kp⋅m/s) and the missing link to electric, magnetic or thermodynamic units.&lt;ref name="cardarelli" /&gt;

In Germany, the kilopond lost its legal status as a unit of force on the first of January 1978 and is replaced by SI units. A kilopond can be converted to the SI unit Newton by multiplication with the standard acceleration ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:
:1 kp = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ 1&amp;nbsp;kg = {{val|9.80665|u=kg⋅m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;}} = {{val|9.80665|u=N}}

== Units ==

===Force===
In English contexts the unit of force is usually formed by simply appending the suffix "force" to the name of the unit of mass, thus ''gram-force'' (gf) or ''[[kilogram-force]]'' (kgf, which follows the tradition of [[pound-force]] (lbf). In other, international contexts the special name ''pond'' (p) or ''kilopond'' (kp) respectively is more frequent.
; 1 p = 1 gf := 1 g ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.80665 g⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 980.665 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 980.665 [[Dyne|dyn]]
; 1 kp = 1&amp;nbsp;kgf := 1&amp;nbsp;kg ⋅ ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.80665&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 980665 g⋅cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

===Mass===
The hyl, metric slug (mug), or TME (German: technische Masseneinheit, technical mass unit), is the mass that accelerates at 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under a force of 1&amp;nbsp;kgf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.numericana.com/answer/units.htm#slug Measurements, Units of Measurement, Weights and Measures – Numericana]&lt;/ref&gt; The hyl has also been used as the unit of mass in a metre–gram-force–second (mgfs) system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sizes.com/units/sys_MKGFS.htm metre–kilogram-force–second systems of units]&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1 TME := 1 kp / 1&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 kp⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m = {{val|9.80665|u=kg}}
; 1 hyl := 1 kp⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m = {{val|9.80665|u=kg}} ''or''
; 1 hyl (alternate definition – mgfs) := 1 p⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m = {{val|9.80665|u=g}}

===Pressure===
The (only) gravitational unit of pressure is the [[technical atmosphere]] (at). It is the gravitational force of one kilogram, i.e. 1&amp;nbsp;kgf, exerted on an area of one square centimetre.
; 1 at := 1 kp/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&amp;nbsp;000 × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 98&amp;nbsp;066.5&amp;nbsp;kg/(m⋅s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = 98.066&amp;nbsp;5 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]

===Energy===
There is no dedicated name for the unit of energy, “metre” is simply appended to “[[Kilogram-force|kilopond]]”, but usually the symbol of the kilopond-metre is written without the middle dot.
; 1 kpm := 1 kp⋅m = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg⋅m = 9.806&amp;nbsp;65&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9.806&amp;nbsp;65 J

===Power===
In 19th-century France there was as a unit of power, the [[poncelet]], which was defined as the power required to raise a mass of 1 [[quintal]] (1 q = 100&amp;nbsp;kg) at a velocity of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. The German or metric [[horsepower]] (PS, ''Pferdestärke'') is arbitrarily selected to be three quarters thereof.
; 1 p&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; := 1 q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;⋅m/s = 100 kp⋅m/s = 100 × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg⋅m/s = 980.665&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.980&amp;nbsp;665&amp;nbsp;kW
; 1 PS := {{sfrac|3|4}} p&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; = 75 kp⋅m/s = 75 × ''g''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; kg⋅m/s = 735.498&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.735&amp;nbsp;498&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;kW

'''''Homo magi''''' is a [[fictional]] sub-race of [[magic in fiction |magic]]-using humans in the [[DC Universe]]. The ''Homo magi'' first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #164 (March 1979), and were created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Dick Dillin]].

==Publication history==
The ''Homo magi'' first appeared as "The Hidden Ones" in ''Justice League of America'' #164 (March 1979).&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' (vol. 1) #164 (March 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; They are referred to as ''Homo magus'' in issue #165, and as ''Homo magi'' in #166. In the storyline, Justice League member [[Zatanna]] is searching for her mother Sindella along with her father [[Zatara|Giovanni Zatara]]. The ''Homo magi'' were also featured in the pages of ''[[Secret Origins]]'' vol. 2 #27 (June 1988) written by [[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] (credited as Ehrich Weiss), [[Randy Lofficier]], and [[Roy Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lofficier.com/resume.htm |title=Lofficier Resume |publisher=Lofficier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lofficiers, their story in ''Secret Origins'' that re-told the origins of the ''Homo magi'' was revised heavily prior to publication; this is their reason for using a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lofficier.com/secretorigins.htm |title=Lofficier Secret Origins |publisher=Lofficier.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the original plot, Nommo, a sorcerer from the Empire of ''Kor'' in Ancient [[Africa]], (from [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s "[[She (novel)|She]]") created the ''Flame of Life'' from the life forces gathered after the sinking of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Nommo later fought [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]] (changed to [[Felix Faust]] by [[DC Comics|DC]]), unwittingly causing the destruction of Kor when he absorbed the full power of the Flame.&lt;ref name="origins"&gt;''Secret Origins'' (vol. 2) #27 (June 1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

Changing his name to [[Doctor Mist]], Nommo embarked on a breeding plan to foster the creation of a race of sorcerers known as ''Homo magi''. As part of his centuries - spanning scheme, Dr. Mist created the various ''Stones of Power'' used by [[Arak (comics)|Arak]], [[Doctor Occult]] (not a ''Homo magi''), [[Sargon the Sorcerer|Sargon]], [[Zatara]], etc. and the [[Global Guardians]] after [[World War II]]. [[Zatanna]] is the final product of Dr. Mist's plan for a perfect mate. But Wotan (Felix Faust) returns to steal his power and take revenge.&lt;ref name="origins" /&gt;

==History==

Homo Magus is a sub-race of naturally magic-wielding humans. According to Doctor Mist, the Homo magi evolved in a parallel but separate line, alongside Homo sapiens. Homo magi are naturally adept at magic; since many humans possesses the Homo Magi gene because of their relationships in the distant past, these humans can learn to use indirect magic by perform rituals, but pure Homo Magi or their direct descendants can use direct magic, too.

The Homo magi existed for as long as the human race, but due to their special abilities, they did not expand as the Homo sapiens. Eventually, they started to inbreed with normal humans, resulting in many generations of Homo magi turned to Homo sapiens. As the number of pure Homo magi dwindled, they decided to recede and went into hiding.

==Darkworld==

Darkworld was a dimension created by an unnamed cosmic entity who later fell into a deep sleep. This entity's dreams were responsible for creating the first Lords of Chaos and Lords of Order, Chaon (chaos), Gemimn (order), and Tynan the balancer. These beings and others became the gods of Atlantis. Darkworld was tethered to Atlantis by a massive chain created by Deedra goddess of nature, much in the same way Ifé, the home dimension of the Orishas, is tethered to Earth by an iron chain. 

== Atlantis == 

In the DC Universe the Homo magi apparently originated on the lost continent of Atlantis. The continent was a focal point for unharnessed magical energies (wild magic), and the local Homo sapiens evolved into Homo Magi as a result of their exposure to these energies. Those humans who gained these inherent mystic abilities interbred for thousands of years, concentrating and strengthening the genetic predisposition. Upon the fall of Atlantis, people who carried the predisposition scattered to the four winds. Many humans today are descended from Homo magi. 

Homo magi are genetically compatible with normal humans, and are genetically identical to normal humans. The mysterious property that makes them homo magi is somehow "dominant" like a gene, the child of a normal human and a Homo magi will always be Homo magi. How and why this trait expresses itself the way it does has yet to be recorded. Apparently that altered Atlantean genome is the difference between Homo magi and regular human magic users. Sindella (Zatanna's mother), Arion, Atlan and Tempest are all famously powerful magic users and presumably all Homo magi. Known offspring of Homo magi are Zatanna, daughter of Sindella and the original John Zatara, and Traci Thirteen the daughter of Doctor Thirteen and an unknown female member of the Homo magi. 

== Gemworld == 


The dimension where the Gemworld is located was originally owned by the Lords of Chaos. However, thousands of years ago, when magic began to drop in level on Earth due to a change in the alignment of the stars (due to a star going nova) the sorceress Citrina went there and struck a deal with the Lords of Chaos so she would be allowed to create a realm there for those wizards who wanted to emigrate from Earth. It would seem that Gemworld like Skartaris was colonized by Homo Magi emigrants from Earth. All of Gemworld's inhabitants can use magic, though most only at a very pedestrian level. Gemworld was the home of Amethyst, Princess of Gem World. 

== Hidden City == 


Led by Doctor Mist the Homo magi created a hidden retreat in the mountains of Turkey called Hidden City, out of fears their uniqueness would be absorbed and diluted by the Homo sapiens. Powered by the Medulla Jewel the City is then shifted into another dimension for protection. 

== Kor == 


Another hidden retreat of the ancient Homo magi out of Atlantis was apparently Doctor Mist's African kingdom known as Kor. Seven thousand years ago Doctor Mist, also known as Nommo, was the wizard-king of the mighty African empire of Kor, and he was the guardian and chosen disciple of the mystic Flame of Life. The Flame was coveted by a sorcerer known as Felix Faust. When Faust attempted to kill Nommo, and take the Flame for himself, Nommo absorbed the Flame and used its power to hurl Felix Faust into another dimension, sadly destroying Kor in the process. In order to nurture the growth of the Homo magi and produce a candidate powerful enough to be his bride, Nommo created magical jewels known as the Stones of Life. He gave the stones to the Homo magi to aid in their growth. 

== Land of the Nightshades ==


The Land of the Nightshades was home to Even Eden's (Nightshade) unnamed race of Homo magi exiles. Her brother while possessed by a demon called the Incubus killed all the former inhabitants. 

== New Atlantis ==

Atlantean survivors of the city of Challa-Bel-Nalla, then ruled by Lord Daamon an ancestor of Deimos, formed an alliance with an alien race they called the Red-Moon Gods. These aliens provided the Atlanteans with advanced technology that Travis Morgan would later discover in New Atlantis. 

== Skartaris==

Atlantean descendant humans and Homo magi led by Lord Norrad the Younger, apparently made it all the way to the strange dimension known as Skartaris, a world of eternal sunlight. Jennifer Morgan daughter of Travis Morgan the Warlord is a Sorceress of Skartaris, as is Deimos the Warlord's archenemy. 


== Powers and Abilities ==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31378">{{Psychology sidebar}}'''Intergroup relations''' refers to interactions between individuals in different social groups, and to interactions taking place between the groups themselves collectively. It has long been a subject of research in [[social psychology]], [[political psychology]], and [[organizational behavior]].&lt;ref name="iess"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Intergroup Relations|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/intergroup-relations|date=2008|language=en|website=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=2014|title=Intergroup Relations|encyclopedia=Wiley Encyclopedia of Management|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118785317.weom110172/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Muzafer Sherif]] proposed a now-widely recognized definition of intergroup relations:

"Whenever individuals belonging to one group interact, collectively or individually, with another group or its members in terms of their group identification, we have an instance of intergroup behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Intergroup relations|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631233176_chunk_g978063123536113_ss2-18|website=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Management|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on intergroup relations involves the study of many psychological phenomena related to intergroup processes including [[Social identity theory|social identity]], [[prejudice]], [[group dynamics]], and [[conformity]] among [[#See also|many others]]. Research in this area has been shaped my many [[#Notable Figures|notable figures]] and continues to provide empirical insights into modern social issues such as social inequality and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/637074045|title=Social psychology|last=M.|first=Kassin, Saul|date=2011|publisher=Cengage Wadsworth|others=Fein, Steven., Markus, Hazel Rose.|isbn=9780495812401|edition= 8th|location=Belmont, CA|oclc=637074045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
While philosophers and thinkers have written about topics related to intergroup relations dating back to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59879503|title=Aristotle's Politics : critical essays|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|others=Kraut, Richard, 1944-, Skultety, Steven.|isbn=0742534235|location=Lanham|oclc=59879503}}&lt;/ref&gt; the psychological study of group attitudes and behavior began in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Allport, G. W (1985). "The historical background of social psychology". In Lindzey, G; Aronson, E. The Handbook of Social Psychology. New York: McGraw Hill.p.5&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest scientific publications on group processes is ''[[The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind]]'', written in 1895 by French doctor and scientist [[Gustave Le Bon]]. Le Bon proposed that a group of individuals is different from the sum of its parts (often paraphrased as "a group is more than the sum of its parts"). This idea of [[crowd psychology]] states that when individuals form a group, this group behaves differently than each individual would normally act. Le Bon theorized that when individuals formed a group or crowd, there would emerge a new psychological entity which would be shaped by the group's "[[Racial unconscious|racial [collective] unconscious]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925485880|title=Crowds in the 21st century : perspectives from contemporary social science|others=Drury, John., Stott, Clifford John T.|isbn=1138922919|location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire|oclc=925485880}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Bon put forth three phenomena that explained crowd behavior: ''submergence'' (or ''anonymity''), when individuals lose their sense of self and responsibility by joining a crowd, ''contagion'', the tendency for individuals in a crowd to follow the beliefs and behaviors of the crowd, and ''suggestion'', which refers to how the beliefs and behaviors of the crowd are shaped by a shared [[Collective unconscious|racial unconscious.]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Subsequent generations of intergroup relations researchers built from these foundational ideas and explored them through empirical studies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The empirical study of intergroup relations, as well as the broader field of [[social psychology]], grew tremendously in the years following [[World War II]]. The events of [[World War II]], including the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Fascism|Facism]], and the widespread use of [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]], led many social scientists to study [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]], [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[conformity]], [[dehumanization]], and other related phenomena.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Social scientists were interested in understanding the behavior of the german population under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] rule, specifically how their attitudes were influenced by [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|propaganda]] and how so many could obey orders to carry out or support the mass murder of Jews and other minority groups as part of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust.]]&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Several prominent social psychologists were directly affected by the Nazi's actions because of their [[Jews|Jewish]] faith, including [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Fritz Heider]], and [[Solomon Asch]]. [[Muzafer Sherif]] was briefly detained by the Turkish government in 1944 for his pro-communist and anti-fascist beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/879600152|title=Norms, groups, conflict, and social change : rediscovering Muzafer Sherif's psychology|others=Dost-Gozkan, Ayfer., Keith, Doga Sonmez.|isbn=9781412855051|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|oclc=879600152}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scientists would draw from these experiences and go on to make major theoretical contributions to intergroup relations research as well as the broader field of psychology.

The [[cognitive revolution]] in psychology in the 1950s and 60s led researchers to study how [[cognitive bias]]es and [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristics]] influence beliefs and behavior. The resulting focus on [[Cognition|cognitive processes]] and [[meaning-making]] represented a significant shift away from the mainstream [[Behaviorism|behaviorist]] philosophy that shaped much of psychology research in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=Thagard|first=Paul|title=Cognitive Science|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/cognitive-science/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition= Winter 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the cognitive revolution, intergroup relations researchers began to study [[Bias|cognitive biases]], [[heuristic]]s, and [[stereotype]]s and their influences on beliefs and behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Asch conformity experiments|Solomon Asch's studies on conformity]] in the 1950s were among the first experiments to explore how a cognitive process (the need to conform to the behavior of the group) could override individual preferences to directly influence behavior.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Leon Festinger]] also focused on cognitive processes in developing [[cognitive dissonance]] theory,&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1957) Cognitive dissonance. Stanford, Calif.: [[Stanford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Elliot Aronson]] and other researchers would later build upon to describe how individuals feel liking for a group whose views they may not agree with but they were initiated into.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aronson|first=Elliot|last2=Mills|first2=Judson|date=1959|title=The effect of severity of initiation on liking for a group.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/h0047195|journal=The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=59|issue=2|pages=177–181|doi=10.1037/h0047195|issn=0096-851X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 60s galvanized social scientists to study [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and [[collective action]] in the context of race in America. [[Gordon Allport]]'s 1954 book ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'' provided the first theoretical framework for understanding and counteracting prejudice.&lt;ref name="iess" /&gt; In his book, Allport proposed the [[contact hypothesis]] which states that interpersonal contact, in the correct context, can be an effective means of reducing [[prejudice]], [[discrimination]], and reliance on [[stereotype]]s.&lt;ref name="iess" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Subsequent generations of scientists built on and applied Allport's [[contact hypothesis]] to other domains of [[prejudice]] including [[sexism]], [[homophobia]], and [[ableism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Thomas F.|last2=Tropp|first2=Linda R.|date=2006|title=A meta-analytic test of intergroup contact theory.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=90|issue=5|pages=751–783|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.5.751|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]] spoke at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] urging social scientists to advance causes of social justice in their research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Martin Luther|date=1968|title=The Role of the Behavioral Scientist in the Civil Rights Movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1968.tb01465.x|journal=Journal of Social Issues|language=en|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1968.tb01465.x|issn=0022-4537|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech, Dr. King called on scientists to study many topics related to the [[civil rights movement]] including the barriers to upward social mobility for African Americans, political engagement and action in the African American community, and the processes of psychological and ideological change among African Americans and Whites.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Intergroup relations research in the final decades of the 20th century refined earlier theories and applied technological advances to the study of [[group dynamics]]. For example, [[Lee Ross]] applied his research on [[Fundamental attribution error|correspondence biases and attributional errors]] as part of the [[conflict resolution]] process in Northern Ireland during [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ravindran, Sandeep (2012). "Profile of Lee D. Ross". Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 109 (19): 7132–7133. doi:10.1073/pnas.1205295109. PMC 3358840. &lt;nowiki&gt;PMID 22517739&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[implicit-association test]] (IAT), developed by [[Anthony Greenwald]] and colleagues in 1998 as a means to measure the strength of implicit (automatic) association of between different mental representations of objects, is one example of psychologists leveraging new technology to advance intergroup relations research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenwald|first=Anthony G.|last2=McGhee|first2=Debbie E.|last3=Schwartz|first3=Jordan L.

== Foundational Theories ==

=== Contact Hypothesis ===
{{Main|Contact hypothesis}}[[Gordon Allport]] developed this hypothesis which states that contact with members of another social group in the appropriate circumstances can lead to a reduction of [[prejudice]] between majority and minority group members.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are three psychological processes underlying the [[contact hypothesis]]: learning about the outgroup through direct contact, fear and anxiety reduction when interacting with the outgroup, and increased ability to [[Perspective-taking|perspective take]] and empathize with the outgroup which results in reduced negative evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G.; Stephan, C. W. (1985). "Intergroup anxiety". Journal of Social Issues. 41 (3): 157–175. doi:10.1111/j.1540-4560.1985.tb01134.x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, W. G.; Finlay, K. (1999). "The role of empathy in improving intergroup relations". Journal of Social Issues. 55 (4): 729–743. doi:10.1111/0022-4537.00144.&lt;/ref&gt; These processes take place optimally when four conditions are met: groups must have relatively equal status, shared goals, be able to cooperate with each other, and recognize an authority that supports contact between groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Some researchers have critiqued the [[contact hypothesis]], specifically its generalizability and the fact that intergroup contact can result in an increase rather than decrease in prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, John; Durrheim, Kevin; Tredoux, Colin (2005). "Beyond the optimal contact strategy: A reality check for the contact hypothesis". American Psychologist. 60 (7): 697–711.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, F. K.; Paolini, S.; Pedersen, A.; Hornsey, M. J.; Radke, H. R. M.; Harwood, J.; Rubin, M.; Sibley, C. G. (2012). "The contact caveat: Negative contact predicts increased prejudice more than positive contact predicts reduced prejudice".

=== Realistic Conflict Theory ===
{{Main|Realistic conflict theory}}[[Realistic conflict theory|Realistic Conflict Theory]] (RCT), also known as Realistic Group Conflict Theory (RGCT), is a model of [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]] that describes how conflict and [[prejudice]] between groups stems from conflicting goals and competition for limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Jay W (1993). "Realistic Group Conflict Theory: A Review and Evaluation of the Theoretical and Empirical Literature". Psychological Record. 43 (3): 395–415.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups may compete for concrete resources such as money and land or abstract resources such as political power and social status which leads to hostility-perpetuating [[Zero-sum thinking|zero-sum beliefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Baumeister, R.F. &amp; Vohs, K.D. (2007). "Realistic Group Conflict Theory". Encyclopedia of Social Psychology. 2: 725–726.&lt;/ref&gt; The RCT was originally proposed by [[Donald T. Campbell]] and was later elaborated on in classic experiments by [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Sherif|Carolyn Wood Sherif]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, D.T. (1965).

Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment. Norman, OK: The University Book Exchange. pp. 155–184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sherifs' Robbers Cave experiment provided evidence for the RCT by arbitrarily assigning boys at a summer camp with similar backgrounds to different groups. The boys in these groups then competed with each other and elicited hostile outgroup beliefs until a superordinate, cooperative goal was imposed that required the groups to work together resulting in decreased feelings of intergroup hostility.&lt;ref name="Sherif, M. 1961 pp. 155"/&gt;

=== Social Identity Approach ===
{{Main|Social identity approach|Self-categorization theory|Social identity theory}}Relations between groups and group-members are based on individuals first categorizing themselves into meaningful social groups. In the 1970s and 80s, [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]] proposed two connected theories of social identity, [[self-categorization theory]] and [[social identity theory]], that together form a method for understanding the psychological processes underlying how individuals make sense of their identities and group membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/457164088|title=Rediscovering social identity : key readings|date=2010|publisher=Psychology Press|others=Postmes, T. (Tom), Branscombe, Nyla R.|isbn=9781841694917|location=New York, NY|oclc=457164088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-categorization theory]] explains the contexts in which an individual perceives a collection of people as a group and the psychological processes that result from an individual perceiving people in terms of a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28221607|title=Stereotyping and social reality|last=J.|first=Oakes, Penelope|date=1994|publisher=Blackwell|others=Haslam, S. Alexander., Turner, John C., 1947-|isbn=0631188711|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=28221607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social identity theory]] describes how individual identity is shaped by membership in a social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4194174|title=The Social psychology of intergroup relations|date=1979|publisher=Brooks/Cole Pub.

"Some current issues in research on social identity and self-categorization theories". ''Social identity''. Oxford: Blackwell: 6–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social identity approach]] has had a wide-ranging impact on [[social psychology]], influencing theory on topics such as [[social influence]],&lt;ref&gt;Turner, J. C. (1991). Social influence. Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[self-stereotyping]],&lt;ref&gt;McGarty, C. (1999). Categorization in social psychology.

"Social identity, personality, and the self-concept: A self-categorization perspective". The Psychology of the Social Self: 11–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current Directions ==
Early research on intergroup relations focused on understanding the processes behind group interactions and dynamics, constructing theories to explain these processes and related psychological phenomena. Presently, intergroup relations is characterized by researchers applying and refining these theories in the context of modern social issues such as [[discrimination]] based on [[gender identity]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race/ethnicity]], and [[religion]].

=== Prejudice Reduction ===
Theories from intergroup relations research have informed many [[approaches to prejudice reduction]]. Researchers have focused on developing theoretical frameworks for understanding how to effectively reduce [[Group conflict|intergroup conflict]] and [[prejudice]]. For example, a recent intervention developed by [[Patricia Devine]] and colleagues focuses on training individuals to overcome cognitive biases and reduce implicit bias. The intervention resulted in reduced implicit bias up to 2 months after the intervention was administered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devine|first=Patricia G.|last2=Forscher|first2=Patrick S.|last3=Austin|first3=Anthony J.|last4=Cox|first4=William T.L.|date=2012|title=Long-term reduction in implicit race bias: A prejudice habit-breaking intervention|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022103112001369|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48|issue=6|pages=1267–1278|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.06.003|issn=0022-1031|pmc=3603687|pmid=23524616|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Figures ==

=== Kurt Lewin  ===
{{Main|Kurt Lewin}}[[Kurt Lewin]] is considered to be one of the founding fathers of [[social psychology]] and made major contributions to psychological research. Lewin founded the [http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/ Research Center for Group Dynamics] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1945:

"Lewin was interested in the scientific study of the processes that influence individuals in group situations, and the center initially focused on group productivity; communication; social perception; intergroup relations; group membership; leadership and improving the functioning of groups"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu/|title=Research Center for Group Dynamics|website=www.rcgd.isr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewin coined the term [[group dynamics]] to describe how individuals and groups behave differently depending on their environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/842246442|title=Group dynamics|last=Forsyth|first=Donelson R.|date=|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|year=2014|isbn=9781133956532|edition= 6th|location=Belmont, CA|pages=|oclc=842246442}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of intergroup relations, he applied his formula of ''B'' = ''ƒ''(''P'', ''E'') - behavior is a function of the person and their environment - to group behavior. The theory behind this formula, which emphasizes that context shapes behavior in conjunction with an individual's motivations and beliefs, is a cornerstone of social psychological research.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gordon Allport ===
{{Main|Gordon Allport}}

The American social psychologist [[Gordon Allport]] is considered to be one of the pioneers of the psychological study of intergroup relations. Especially influential is Allport's 1954 book ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'', which proposed the [[contact hypothesis]] and has provided a foundation for research in the area since the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). The nature of prejudice. Cambridge, MA: Perseus Books&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iess" /&gt;

=== Muzafer Sherif and Carolyn Wood Sherif ===
{{Main|Muzafer Sherif|Carolyn Sherif}}Other influential researchers on intergroup relations include [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Sherif|Carolyn Wood Sherif]], who performed multiple notable experiments on the subject in the mid-20th century; these experiments formed the basis for [[realistic conflict theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/processes/n232.xml|title=Sherif, Muzafer (19061988)|last=Vaughan|first=Graham M.|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|pages=754–756|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muzafer Sherif's research was informed by his experiences studying discrimination and social pressures in the United States and in Turkey, and he was motivated to understand the psychology of [[group conflict]].

=== Solomon Asch ===
{{Main|Solomon Asch}}

[[Asch conformity experiments|Solomon Asch's work on conformity]] in the 1950s also helped shape the study of intergroup relations by exploring the social pressures to adhere to group attitudes and behavior. This research first shed light on the how the social pressures of group membership influence individuals to adhere their behavior, attitudes, and beliefs to [[Social norm|group norms]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asch|first=Solomon E.|date=1955|title=Opinions and Social Pressure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31|journal=Scientific American|volume=193|issue=5|pages=31–35|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1155-31|issn=0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11112922|title=Handbook of social psychology|date=1985|publisher=Random House|others=Lindzey, Gardner., Aronson, Elliot.|isbn=0394350499|edition=3rd|location=New York|oclc=11112922}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asch's research, along with [[Stanley Milgram shock experiments|Stanley Milgram's shock expriments]], shed light on the psychological processes underlying [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]], [[conformity]], and authority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Henri Tajfel and John Turner ===
{{Main|Henri Tajfel|John Turner (psychologist)}}

British psychologists [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]] developed [[social identity theory]] and later [[self-categorization theory]], pioneering the [[social identity approach]] in psychology in the 1970s and 80s. Tajfel &amp; Turner were among the first psychologists to study the importance of social group membership and explored how whichever group membership was most salient determined behavior and beliefs in the group context.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Lee Ross ===
{{Main article|Lee Ross}}[[Lee Ross]] has conducted research on several psychological phenomena closely related to intergroup relations including the [[fundamental attribution error]], [[belief perseverance]], and most recently [[Naïve realism (psychology)|naive realism]] - the idea that we believe they see the world objectively and that those who disagree with us must be irrational or biased.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, L., &amp; Ward, A.

'''Isothermal transformation diagrams''' (also known as time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a [[logarithmic scale]]). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs  time measurements, and are useful for understanding the transformations of an [[alloy steel]] at elevated temperatures.  

An isothermal transformation diagram is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature.  Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they also can be used to describe the kinetics of [[crystallization]] in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.

'''Isothermal transformation''' (IT) diagram or the C-curve is associated with mechanical properties,microconstituents/microstructures, and heat treatments in carbon steels. Diffusional transformations like [[austenite]] transforming to a [[cementite]] and [[Allotropes of iron|ferrite]] mixture can be explained using the sigmoidal curve; for example the beginning of pearlitic transformation is represented by the pearlite start (P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) curve. This transformation is complete at P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; curve. Nucleation requires an incubation time. The rate of nucleation increases and the rate of microconstituent growth decreases as the temperature decreases from the liquidus temperature reaching a maximum at the bay or nose of the curve. Thereafter, the decrease in diffusion rate  due to low temperature offsets the effect of increased driving force due to greater difference in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. As a result of the transformation, the microconstituents, [[Pearlite]] and [[Bainite]], form; Pearlite forms at higher temperatures and bainite at lower.

Austenite is slightly undercooled when quenched below [[Eutectic system|Eutectoid]] temperature. When given more time, stable microconstituents can form: ferrite and cementite. Coarse pearlite is produced when atoms diffuse rapidly after phases that form pearlite nucleate. This transformation is complete at the pearlite finish time (P&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;).

However, greater undercooling by rapid quenching results in formation of martensite or bainite instead of pearlite. This is possible provided the cooling rate is such that the cooling curve intersects the martensite start temperature or the bainite start curve before intersecting the P&lt;sub&gt;s &lt;/sub&gt;curve. The martensite transformation being a diffusionless shear transformation is represented by a straight line to signify the martensite start temperature.

'''Karma''' (Sanskrit, also ''karman'', Pāli: ''kamma'') is a Sanskrit term that literally means "action" or "doing". In the [[Buddhist]] tradition, ''karma'' refers to action driven by intention (''[[cetanā]]'') which leads to future consequences. Those intentions are considered to be the determining factor in the kind of rebirth in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'', the cycle of rebirth.

==Etymology==
''Karma'' (Sanskrit, also ''karman'', Pāli: ''kamma'', Tib. ''las''{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=101}}) is a Sanskrit term that literally means "action" or "doing". The word ''karma'' derives from the verbal root ''kṛ'', which means "do, make, perform, accomplish."{{sfn|Chapple|1986|p=2}}

''Karmaphala'' (Tib. ''rgyu 'bras''{{sfn|Lichter|Epstein|1983|p=232}}{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=101}}{{refn|group=note|In common Tibetan common speech, the term ''las'', "karma", is often used to denote the entire process of karma-and-fruit.{{sfn|Padmakara Translation Group|1994|p=101}}}}) is the [[Phala|"fruit"]],{{sfn|Kalupahanna|1992|p=166}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=36-37}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}} "effect"{{sfn|Kopf|2001|p=141}} or "result"{{sfn|Kragh|2001|p=11}} of ''karma''. A similar term is ''karmavipaka'', the [[Vipāka|"maturation"]]{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=810-813}} or "cooking"{{sfn|Klostermaier|1986|p=93}} of ''karma'':
{{quote|The remote effects of karmic choices are referred to as the 'maturation' (vipāka) or 'fruit' (phala) of the karmic act."{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=36-37}}}}

The metaphor is derived from agriculture:{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Keown|2000|p=37}}
{{quote|One sows a seed, there is a time lag during which some mysterious invisible process takes place, and then the plant pops up and can be harvested.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}}}}

==Buddhist understanding of ''karma''==
[[Image:Tibetan chakra.jpg|thumb|150px|Tibetan ''Bhavacakra'' or "Wheel of Life" in [[Sera monastery|Sera]], [[Lhasa]].]]

''Karma'' and ''karmaphala'' are fundamental concepts in Buddhism.{{sfn|Kragh|2006|p=11}}{{sfn|Lamotte|1987|p=15}} The concepts of ''karma'' and ''karmaphala'' explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in ''samsara'', whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], shows us the way out of ''samsara''.{{sfn|Bucknell|1984}}

===Rebirth===
[[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Rebirth]],{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit, punaraāvŗtti, punarutpatti, punarjanman, or punarjīlvātu}}, is a common belief in all Buddhist traditions. It says that birth and death in the [[six realms]] occur in [[Samsara|successive cycles]] driven by ignorance (''[[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]]''), desire (''[[Taṇhā|trsnā]]''), and hatred (''[[Dvesha (Buddhism)|dvesa]]''). The cycle of rebirth is called ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsāra]]''. It is a beginningless and ever-ongoing process.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}} Liberation from samsāra can be attained by following the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|Buddhist Path]]. This path leads to ''vidyā'', and the stilling of ''trsnā'' and ''dvesa''. Hereby the ongoing process of rebirth is stopped.

The cycle of rebirth is determined by ''karma'',{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=712}} literally "action".{{refn|group=note|In early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance,{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}}{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}} and the theory of ''karma'' may have been of minor importance in early Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}{{sfn|Schmithausen|1986|p=206-207}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=13}}}} In the [[Buddhist]] tradition, ''karma'' refers to actions driven by ''intention'' (''[[cetanā]]''),{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998}}{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119-120}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=19}}&lt;!---START OF NOTE---&gt;{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: "[Karma is] a being’s intentional 'actions' of body, speech, and mind—whatever is done, said, or even just thought with definite intention or volition";{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=119}} "[a]t root karma or 'action' is considered a mental act or intention; it is an aspect of our mental life: 'It is "intention" that I call karma; having formed the intention, one performs acts (karma) by body, speech and mind.'"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=120}}}}&lt;!---END OF NOTE---&gt; a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=55}} The ''Nibbedhika Sutta'', [[Anguttara Nikaya]] 6.63:{{quote|Intention (''[[cetana]]'') I tell you, is kamma.

(A.III.415).{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=39-40}}}}}}

According to Peter Harvey,
{{quote|It is the psychological impulse behind an action that is 'karma', that which sets going a chain of causes culminating in karmic fruit. Actions, then, must be intentional if they are to generate karmic fruits.{{sfn|Harvey|1990|pp=39-40}}}}

And according to Gombrich,
{{quote|The Buddha defined karma as intention; whether the intention manifested itself in physical, vocal or mental form, it was the intention alone which had a moral character: good, bad or neutral [...] The focus of interest shifted from physical action, involving people and objects in the real world, to psychological process.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=51}}}}

According to Gombrich, this was a great innovation, which overturns brahmanical, caste-bound ethics. It's a rejection of caste-bound differences, giving the same possibility to reach liberation to all people, not just Brahmanins:{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=65-66}}
{{quote|Not by birth is one a brahmin or an outcaste, but by deeds (''kamma'').{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=68}}{{refn|group=note|Sutta-nipata verse 1366}}}}

===Karmaphala===
Karma leads to future consequences, ''karma-phala'', "fruit of action".{{sfn|Kalupahana|1992|p=166}} Any given action may cause all sorts of results, but the ''karmic results'' are only those results which are a consequence of both the moral quality of the action, and of the intention behind the action.{{sfn|Reichenbach|1988|p=399}}{{refn|group=note|In the [[Abhidharma]] they are referred to by specific names for the sake of clarity, karmic causes being the "cause of results" (S. ''vipāka-hetu'') and the karmic results being the "resultant fruit" (S. ''vipāka-phala'').{{sfn|Waldron|2003|p=61}}}} According to Reichenbach,
{{quote|[T]he consequences envisioned by the law of karma encompass more (as well as less) than the observed natural or physical results which follow upon the performance of an action.{{sfn|Reichenbach|1990|p=1}}}}

The "law of karma" applies

===Complex process===
The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1975|p=127}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=20}}{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}{{refn|group=quote|[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu|Bhikkhu Thanissaro]]: "Unlike the theory of [[causality|linear causality]] — which led the [[Vedas|Vedists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]] to see the relationship between an act and its result as predictable and tit-for-tat — the principle of ''[[Idappaccayatā|this/that conditionality]]'' makes that relationship inherently complex. The results of kamma&lt;ref group=subnote&gt;Bhikkhu Thanissaro uses the Pali spelling for karma.&lt;/ref&gt; experienced at any one point in time come not only from past kamma, but also from present kamma. This means that, although there are general patterns relating habitual acts to corresponding results [MN 135], there is no set one-for-one, tit-for-tat, relationship between a particular action and its results. Instead, the results are determined by the context of the act, both in terms of actions that preceded or followed it [MN 136] and in terms one’s state of mind at the time of acting or experiencing the result [AN 3:99]. [...] The feedback loops inherent in ''this/that conditionality'' mean that the working out of any particular cause-effect relationship can be very complex indeed. This explains why the Buddha says in AN 4:77 that the results of kamma are [[Acinteyya|imponderable]]. Only a person who has developed the mental range of a Buddha—another imponderable itself—would be able to trace the intricacies of the kammic network. The basic premise of kamma is simple—that skillful intentions lead to favorable results, and unskillful ones to unfavorable results—but the process by which those results work themselves out is so intricate that it cannot be fully mapped. We can compare this with the [[Mandelbrot set]], a mathematical set generated by a simple equation, but whose graph is so complex that it will probably never be completely explored."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Thanissaro|2010|pp=47-48}}}} It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process,{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=42}} and not all present conditions can be ascribed to karma.{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=20}}{{refn|See also  [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.021.than.html Sivaka Sutta] (Samyutta Nikaya 36.21), in which the Buddha mentions eight different possible causes from which feelings can arise.

But karma is simply a law of cause and effect, not to be confused with morality or ethics. No one, including Buddha, set the fundamental bar for what is negative and what is positive. Any motivation and action that steer us away from such truths as "all compounded things are impermanent" can result in negative consequences, or bad karma.

* Khandro Rinpoche states: "Buddhism is a nontheistic philosophy. We do not believe in a creator but in the causes and conditions that create certain circumstances that then come to fruition. This is called karma. It has nothing to do with judgement; there is no one keeping track of our karma and sending us up above or down below. Karma is simply the ''wholeness'' of a cause, or first action, and its effect, or fruition, which then becomes another cause. In fact, one karmic cause can have many fruitions, all of which can cause thousands more creations. Just as a handful of seed can ripen into a full field of grain, a small amount of karma can generate limitless effects."{{sfn|Khandro Rinpoche|2003|p=95}}
* Walpola Rahula states: "The theory of karma should not be confused with so-called 'moral justice’ or 'reward and punishment’.

The term 'justice’ is ambiguous and dangerous, and in its name more harm than good is done to humanity. The theory of karma is the theory of cause and effect, of action and reaction; it is a natural law, which has nothing to do with the idea of justice or reward and punishment. Every volitional action produces its effects or results. If a good action produces good effects and a bad action bad effects, it is not justice, or reward, or punishment meted out by anybody or any power sitting in judgment on your action, but this is in virtue of its own nature, its own law."{{sfn|Walpola Rahula|2007|loc=Kindle Locations 860-866}}}} Certain experiences in life are the results of previous actions, but our responses to those experiences are not predetermined, although they bear their own fruit in the future.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=27}}{{refn|group=quote|Rupert Gethin: "From the Buddhist perspective certain experiences in life are indeed the results of previous actions; but our responses to those experiences, whether wished for or unwished for, are not predetermined but represent new actions which in time bear their own fruit in the future.

In the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], it is stated that karmic results are experienced either in this life (P. ''diṭṭadhammika'') or in a future lives (P. ''samparāyika'').{{sfn|McDermott|1984|p=21}} The former may involve a readily observable connection between action and karmic consequence, such as when a thief is captured and tortured by the authorities,{{sfn|McDermott|1984|p=21}} but the connection need not necessarily be that obvious and in fact usually is not observable.

The Sammyutta Nikaya makes a basic distinction between past karma (P. ''purānakamma'') which has already been incurred, and karma being created in the present (P. ''navakamma'').&lt;ref&gt;SN.4.132&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the present one both creates new karma (P. ''navakamma'') and encounters the result of past karma (P. ''kammavipāka''). Karma in the early canon is also threefold: Mental action (S. ''manaḥkarman''), bodily action (S. ''kāyakarman'') and vocal action (S. ''vākkarman'').{{sfn|Lamotte|2001|p=18}}

In fact, originally karman seems to have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth, but in the course of time it proved to be more popular than others. One of these ‘other concepts’ linked with rebirth is a curious notion of ‘rebirth according to one’s wish’, sometimes referred to in the texts as kAmacAra. The wish — variously referred to in the texts as kAma or kratu — is directed to a particular form or place of rebirth and can be spontaneous (at the time of death) or cultivated for a long time. This understanding seems to have some affinity with the Buddhist notion that a mental effort, a positive state of mind, can bring about a good rebirth."{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26}}}} Tillman Vetter notes that in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi}} Buswell too notes that "Early Buddhism does not identify bodily and mental motion, but desire (or thirst, ''trsna''), as the cause of karmic consequences."{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=416}} Matthews notes that "there is no single major systematic exposition" on the subject of karma and "an account has to be put together from the dozens of places where karma is mentioned in the texts,"{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}} which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=124}}

According to Vetter, "the Buddha at first sought, and realized, [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Ideas and practices|"the deathless"]] (''amata/amrta''{{refn|group=note|Stanislaw Schayer, a Polish scholar, argued in the 1930s that the Nikayas preserve elements of an archaic form of Buddhism which is close to Brahmanical beliefs,{{sfn|Lindtner|1997}}{{sfn|Lindtner|1999}}{{sfn|Akizuki|1990|p=25-27}}{{sfn|Ray|1999}} and survived in the Mahayana tradition.{{sfn|Reat|1998|p=xi}}{{sfn|Conze|1967|p=10}} According to Schayer, one of these elements is that Nirvana was conceived as the attainment of immortality, and the gaining of a deathless sphere from which there would be no falling back.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=374-377}} According to Falk, in the precanonical tradition, there is a threefold division of reality, the third realm being the realm of nirvana, the "amrta sphere," characterized by prajna. This nirvana is an "abode" or "place" which is gained by the enlightened holy man.{{sfn|Ray|1999|p=375}} According to Falk, this scheme is reflected in the precanonical conception of the path to liberation.{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} The nirvanic element, as an "essence" or pure consciousness, is immanent within samsara. The three bodies are concentric realities, which are stripped away or abandoned, leaving only the nirodhakaya of the liberated person.{{sfn|Ray|p=375}} See also Rita Langer (2007), ''Buddhist Rituals of Death and Rebirth: Contemporary Sri Lankan Practice and Its Origins'', p.26-28, on "redeath" (''punarmrtyu'').{{sfn|Langer|2007|p=26-28}}}}), which is concerned with the here and now.{{refn|group=note|Tilmann Vetter, ''Das Erwachen des Buddha'', referenced by Bronkhorst.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}}}} Only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=3}} Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha "introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time."{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=16}} According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1998|p=14}}

The doctrine of karma may have been especially important for common people, for whom it was more important to cope with life's immediate demands, such as the problems of pain, injustice, and death. The doctrine of karma met these exigencies, and in time it became an important soteriological aim in its own right.{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=125}}

====Vaibhāṣika-Sarvāstivādin tradition====
{{see also|Vaibhāṣika|Sarvastivada}}

The Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda was widely influential in India and beyond. Their understanding of karma in the Sarvāstivāda became normative for Buddhism in India and other countries.{{sfn|Ryose|1987|p=3}} According to Dennis Hirota,
{{quote|Sarvastivadins argued that there exists a dharma of "possession" (''prapti''), which functions with all karmic acts, so that each act or thought, though immediately passing away, creates the "possession" of that act in the continuum of instants we experience as a person. This possession itself is momentary, but continually reproduces a similar possession in the succeeding instant, even though the original act lies in the past. Through such continual regeneration, the act is "possessed" until the actualization of the result.{{sfn|Hirota|2004|p=5100}}}}

The ''Abhidharmahṛdaya'' by Dharmaśrī was the first systematic exposition of Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda doctrine, and the third chapter, the ''Karma-varga'', deals with the concept of karma systematically.{{sfn|Ryose|1987|pp=3-4}}

Another important exposition, the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣa]]'', gives three definitions of karma: 
# action; karma is here supplanted in the text by the synonyms ''kriya'' or ''karitra'', both of which mean "activity";
# formal vinaya conduct; 
# human action as the agent of various effects; karma as that which links certain actions with certain effects, is the primary concern of the exposition.{{sfn|Ryose|1987|pp=39-40}}

The 4th century philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] compiled the ''[[Abhidharma-kośa]]'', an extensive compendium which elaborated the positions of the  [[Vaibhashika|Vaibhāṣika]]-[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādin]] school on a wide range of issues raised by the early sutras. Chapter four the Kośa is devoted to a study of karma, and chapters two and five contain formulation as to the mechanism of fruition and retribution.{{sfn|Lamotte|2001|p=18}} This became the main source of understanding of the perspective of early Buddhism for later Mahāyāna  philosophers.{{sfn|Lamotte|2001}}

====Dārṣṭāntika-Sautrāntika====
The Dārṣṭāntika-[[Sautrāntika]] school pioneered the idea of karmic seeds (S. ''bija'') and "the special modification of the psycho-physical series" (S. ''saṃtatipaṇāmaviśeṣa'') to explain the workings of karma.{{sfn|Park|2007|pp=234-236}} According to Dennis Hirota,
{{quote|[T]he Sautrantikas [...] insisted that each act exists only in the present instant and perishes immediately. To explain causation, they taught that with each karmic act a "perfuming" occurs which, though not a dharma or existent factor itself, leaves a residual impression in the succeeding series of mental instants, causing it to undergo a process of subtle evolution eventually leading to the act’s result. Good and bad deeds performed are thus said to leave "seeds" or traces of disposition that will come to fruition.{{sfn|Hirota|2004|p=5100}}}}

===Theravādin tradition===

====Canonical texts====
In the Theravāda Abhidhamma and commentarial traditions, karma is taken up at length. The ''Abhidhamma Sangaha'' of Anuruddhācariya offers a treatment of the topic, with an exhaustive treatment in book five (5.3.7).{{sfn|Matthews|1986|p=132}}

The ''[[Kathāvatthu]]'', which discusses a number of controverted points related either directly or indirectly to the notion of kamma."{{sfn|McDermott|1975|p=424}} This involved debate with the [[Pudgalavada|Pudgalavādin]] school, which postulated the provisional existence of the person (S. ''pudgala'', P. ''puggala'') to account for the ripening of karmic effects over time.{{sfn|McDermott|1975|p=424}} The Kathāvatthu also records debate by the Theravādins with the Andhakas (who may have been [[Mahāsāṃghika]]s) regarding whether or not old age and death are the result (''vipāka'') of karma.{{sfn|McDermott|1975|pp=426-427}} The Theravāda maintained that they are not—not, apparently because there is no causal relation between the two, but because they wished to reserve the term ''vipāka'' strictly for mental results--"subjective phenomena arising through the effects of kamma."{{sfn|McDermott|1975|pp=426-427}}

In the canonical Theravāda view of kamma, "the belief that deeds done or ideas seized at the moment of death are particularly significant."{{sfn|McDermott|1980|p=168}}

====Transfer of merit====
{{Main|Transfer of merit}}
The ''[[Milindapañha]]'', a [[Paracanonical texts (Theravada Buddhism)|paracanonical Theravāda text]], offers some interpretations of karma theory at variance with the orthodox position.{{sfn|McDermott|1984|p=110}} In particular, [[Nāgasena]] allows for the possibility of the transfer of merit to humans and one of the four classes of [[preta|petas]], perhaps in deference to folk belief.{{sfn|McDermott|1984|pp=109-111}} Nāgasena makes it clear that demerit cannot be transferred.{{sfn|McDermott|1977|p=463}} One scholar asserts that the sharing of merit "can be linked to the Vedic ''śrāddha'', for it was Buddhist practice not to upset existing traditions when well-established custom was not antithetic to Buddhist teaching."{{sfn|McDermott|1977|p=462}}

The [[Petavatthu]], which is fully canonical, endorses the transfer of merit even more widely, including the possibility of sharing merit with all petas.{{sfn|McDermott|1984|pp=109-111}}

===Mahayana tradition===

====Indian Yogācāra tradition====
In the [[Yogācāra]] philosophical tradition, one of the two principal Mahāyāna schools, the principle of karma was extended considerably. In the Yogācāra formulation, all experience without exception is said to result from the ripening of karma.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=297}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=URZNk9noWJEC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22due+to+karma%22+yogacara&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ug8YVFASFC&amp;sig=ASkknejfBRiFHO4RfQaDiAIX0U4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rGFPS7b9OZXU8QbM_u2TCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22due%20to%20karma%22%20yogacara&amp;f=false An Introduction to Buddhist ethics], Harvey&lt;/ref&gt; Karmic seeds (S. ''bija'') are said to be stored in the "storehouse consciousness" (S. ''[[ālayavijñāna]]'') until such time as they ripen into experience. The term ''vāsāna'' ("perfuming") is also used, and Yogācārins debated whether vāsāna and bija were essentially the same, the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|p=194}} The seemingly external world is merely a "by-product" (''adhipati-phala'') of karma. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called ''[[Saṅkhāra|saṃskāra]]''.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|p=48}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IeiwsT-XqwQC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=conditioning+buddhism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3J5qEoez8F&amp;sig=kbQ75qvMRURcje0GPsMfS68rdJ4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8xNRS-npJ4mb8AaQnrCZCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=conditioning&amp;f=false ''Buddhist Phenomenology: A philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih lun'' by Dan Lusthaus.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Treatise on Action'' (''Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa''), also by Vasubandhu, treats the subject of karma in detail from the Yogācāra perspective.{{sfn|Lamotte|2001|pp=13,35}} According to scholar Dan Lusthaus,
{{quote|Vasubandhu's ''Viṃśatikā'' (''Twenty Verses'') repeatedly emphasizes in a variety of ways that karma is intersubjective and that the course of each and every stream of consciousness (''vijñāna-santāna'', i.e., the changing individual) is profoundly influenced by its relations with other consciousness streams.{{sfn|Lusthaus|2002|p=48}}}}

According to Bronkhorst, whereas in earlier systems it "was not clear how a series of completely mental events (the deed and its traces) could give rise to non-mental, material effects," with the (purported) idealism of the Yogācāra system this is not an issue.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|2000}}

In Mahāyāna traditions, karma is not the sole basis of rebirth. The [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirths]] of [[bodhisattva]]s after the seventh stage (S. ''[[bhūmi]]'') are said to be consciously directed for the benefit of others still trapped in {{IAST|saṃsāra}}.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=130}} Thus, theirs are not uncontrolled rebirths.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=130}}

====Mādhyamaka philosophy====
[[Nāgārjuna]] articulated the difficulty in forming a karma theory in his most prominent work, the ''[[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]'' (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way):
{{quote|If (the act) lasted till the time of ripening, (the act) would be eternal. If (the act) were terminated, how could the terminated produce a fruit?&lt;ref group=subnote&gt;MMK (XVII.6), cited in Dargyay, 1986, p.170{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Mūlamadhyamakavṛtty-Akutobhayā'', also generally attributed to Nāgārjuna,{{sfn|Huntington|1986|p=4}} concludes that it is impossible both for the act to persist somehow and also for it to perish immediately and still have efficacy at a later time.{{refn|group=note|''Mūlamadhyamakavṛtty-Akutobhayā'', sDe dge Tibetan Tripitaka (Tokyo, 1977) pp. 32, 4.5, cited in Dargyay, 1986, p.170.{{sfn|Dargyay|1986|p=170}}}}

====Tibetan Buddhism====
{{Main|Karma in Tibetan Buddhism}}

In Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings on karma belong to the preliminary teachings, that turn the mind towards the Buddhist dharma.{{sfn|Norgay|2014|p=v}}

In the Vajrayana tradition, negative past karma may be "purified" through such practices as meditation on [[Vajrasattva]] because they both are the mind's psychological phenomenon.{{sfn|Kalu Rinpoche|1993|p=204}}{{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=ix}} The performer of the action, after having purified the karma, does not experience the negative results he or she otherwise would have.{{sfn|Thrangu Rinpoche|2012|pp=20-21}} Engaging in the ten negative actions out of selfishness and delusions hurts all involved. Otherwise, loving others, receives love; whereas; people with closed hearts may be prevented from happiness.{{sfn|Zopa Rinpoche|2004|p=ix}} One good thing about karma is that it can be purified through confession, if the thoughts become positive.{{sfn|Patrul Rinpoche | 2011| pp=264-265}} Within Guru Yoga seven branch offerings practice, confession is the antidote to aversion.

====East Asian traditions====

=====Zen=====
{{religious text primary|section|reason=You need to confirm the relevance of these quotes by secondary sources, to prove it is not cherry-picking quotes.|date=October 2017}}
[[Dōgen Kigen]] argued in his ''[[Shobogenzo]]'' that karmic latencies are emphatically not empty, going so far as to claim that belief in the emptiness of karma should be characterized as "non-Buddhist," although he also states that the "law of karman has no concrete existence."{{sfn|Dōgen|1975|p=142, 149}}

Zen's most famous [[koan]] about karma is called [[wild fox koan|''Baizhang's Wild Fox'']] (百丈野狐). The story of the koan is about an ancient Zen teacher whose answer to a question presents a wrong view about karma by saying that the person who has a foundation in cultivating the great practice "does not fall into cause and effect." Because of his unskillful answer the teacher reaps the result of living 500 lives as a wild fox. He is then able to appear as a human and ask the same question to Zen teacher Baizhang, who answers, "He is not in the dark about cause and effect." Hearing this answer the old teacher is freed from the life of a wild fox.  The Zen perspective avoids the duality of asserting that an enlightened person is either subject to or free from the law of karma and that the key is not being ignorant about karma.

=====Tendai=====
The Japanese [[Tendai]]/[[Pure Land]] teacher [[Genshin]] taught a series of ten reflections for a dying person that emphasized reflecting on the [[Amida Buddha]] as a means to purify vast amounts of karma.{{sfn|Lopez|2001|p=239}}{{relevance inline|date=October 2017}}

=====Nichiren Buddhism=====
Nichiren Buddhism teaches that transformation and change through faith and practice changes adverse karma—negative causes made in the past that result in negative results in the present and future—to positive causes for benefits in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fowler |first= Jeaneane and Merv |year=(2009) |title= Chanting in the Hillsides |publisher= Sussex Academic Press |publication-place= Portland, Oregon |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations and controversies==

===Social conditioning===
Buddhist modernists often prefer to equate karma with social conditioning, in contradistinction with, as one scholar puts it, "early texts &lt;nowiki&gt;[which]&lt;/nowiki&gt; give us little reason to interpret 'conditioning' as the infusion into the psyche of external social norms, or of awakening as simply transcending all psychological conditioning and social roles. Karmic conditioning drifts semantically toward 'cultural conditioning' under the influence of western discourses that elevate the individual over the social, cultural, and institutional. The traditional import of the karmic conditioning process, however, is primarily ethical and soteriological—actions condition circumstances in this and future lives."{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=198}}

Essentially, this understanding limits the scope of the traditional understanding of karmic effects so that it encompasses only ''saṃskāra''s—habits, dispositions and tendencies—and not external effects, while at the same time expanding the scope to include social conditioning that does not particularly involve volitional action.{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=198}}

===Karma theory and social justice===
Some western commentators and Buddhists have taken exception to aspects of karma theory, and have proposed revisions of various kinds. These proposals fall under the rubric of [[Buddhist modernism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=174}}

The "primary critique" of the Buddhist doctrine of karma is that some feel "karma may be socially and politically disempowering in its cultural effect, that without intending to do this, karma may in fact support social passivity or acquiescence in the face of oppression of various kinds."{{sfn|Wright|2004|p=81}} Dale S. Wright, a scholar specializing in Zen Buddhism, has proposed that the doctrine be reformulated for modern people, "separated from elements of supernatural thinking," so that karma is asserted to condition only personal qualities and dispositions rather than rebirth and external occurrences.{{sfn|Wright|2004|p=89-90}}

Loy argues that the idea of accumulating merit too easily becomes "spiritual materialism," a view echoed by other Buddhist modernists,{{refn|group=note|name="Jones"|Ken Jones,'' The Social Face of Buddhism: An Approach to Political and Social Activism'', Wisdom Publications, 1989, quoted in "A Buddhist Ethic Without Karmic Rebirth?" by Winston L. King ''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' Volume 1 1994}} and further that karma has been used to rationalize racism, caste, economic oppression, birth handicaps and everything else.{{sfn|Loy|2008|p=57}}

Loy goes on to argue that the view that suffering such as that undergone by [[Holocaust]] victims could be attributed in part to the karmic ripenings of those victims is "fundamentalism, which blames the victims and rationalizes their horrific fate," and that this is "something no longer to be tolerated quietly. It is time for modern Buddhists and modern Buddhism to outgrow it" by revising or discarding the teachings on karma.{{sfn|Loy|2008|p=55}}

Other scholars have argued, however, that the teachings on karma do not encourage judgment and blame, given that the victims were not the same people who committed the acts, but rather were just part of the same [[mindstream]]-continuum with the past actors,{{sfn|Burke|2003|p=32-33}} and that the teachings on karma instead provide "a thoroughly satisfying explanation for suffering and loss" in which believers take comfort.{{sfn|Burke|2003|p=32-33}}

'''Colleen J. Stan''' (born December 31, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;"United States Public Records, 1970-2009," database, FamilySearch (23 May 2014), Colleen J Stan, Residence, Burney, California, United States; a third party aggregator of publicly available information.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Americans|American]] woman who was kidnapped and held as a [[Sexual slavery|sex slave]] by Cameron and Janice Hooker in their [[Red Bluff, California]], home for over seven years between 1977 and 1984. At the trial of her abductor, Stan's experience was described as unparalleled in [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] history.{{Sfn|Green|2009|p=5}}

Her case has received international publicity, and has been the subject of multiple books, films, and television series.

==Kidnapping==
On May 19, 1977, Colleen Stan was [[hitchhiking]] from her home in [[Eugene, Oregon]], to a friend's home in northern California, where she was heading to a birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Girl in the Box' Speaks: How I Survived Being Held Captive for 7 Years|url=http://people.com/crime/girl-in-the-box-speaks-how-i-survived-my-seven-year-ordeal/|work=People|series=Crime|date=September 7, 2016|author=Egan, Nicole Weisensee|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron Hooker (born November 5, 1953) kidnapped 20 year-old Stan after picking her up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steinbrecher |first=Ed |title=Hooker, Cameron Michael |url=http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Hooker,_Cameron_Michael |work=astrological data |publisher=Astro-Databank |accessdate=June 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715071124/http://www.astro.com/astro-databank/Hooker%2C_Cameron_Michael |archivedate=July 15, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stan stated that she was an experienced hitchhiker and had allowed two rides to go past before accepting the ride with Hooker. She reportedly "felt confident climbing into the blue van",&lt;ref&gt;(Woollard p.&amp;nbsp;5)&lt;/ref&gt; because Hooker's wife, Janice, and their baby were in the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woollard|first=Lisa|title=I was locked in a box for 7 years!|url=http://www.closeronline.co.uk/RealLife/Reallifestories/i-was-locked-in-a-box-for-7-years.aspx|work=Online Article|publisher=Closer Online|accessdate=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When they stopped at a gas station along the way, Stan went to use the restroom.  "A voice told me to run and jump out a window and never look back," she recalled, but she calmed her fears and went back to the car. According to Stan and Janice Hooker's testimonies, once they were alone in an isolated area, Hooker pulled off the highway and put a knife to Stan's throat.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=22}} She was subsequently locked in a wooden head box which was designed to prevent light, sound and fresh air from entering.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=23}}

==Imprisonment==
Before this, Cameron and Janice had reached an agreement that he could capture a slave to take to Janice's place, because up until that time Cameron had been using Janice to act out [[Bondage (BDSM)#BDSM|sexual bondage]]. There was to be no [[Penetrative sexual intercourse|penetrative sex]] with Stan according to the agreement, but this later changed.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=172 &amp; 175}} On the first night of her kidnapping, Stan was strung up by her hands and physically attacked by Cameron, being left blindfolded and suspended while the pair [[Sexual intercourse|had sex]] below her.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=28}}

After her kidnapping, Stan stated that she was tortured and kept locked in a box 23 hours a day until she was given a contract and forced to sign herself into slavery for life in January 1978. She further stated that Cameron led her to believe that she was being watched by a large, powerful organization called "The Company" which would painfully torture her and harm her family if she tried to escape.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web|title=CNN Saturday Morning News|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1305/11/smn.04.html|work=[[CNN]]|publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|accessdate=December 25, 2013|date=May 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stan subsequently became a slave referred to as "K"&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite news|last=LaRosa|first=Paul|title=Exclusive: Woman Imprisoned in Coffin for 7 Years Has Special Message for Jaycee Dugard|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/exclusive-woman-imprisoned-in-coffin-for-7-years-has-special-message-for-jaycee-dugard/|accessdate=December 25, 2013|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was forced to call Cameron "Master", and was not allowed to talk without permission. Cameron reportedly wanted Stan to be like the female character in the 1954 French [[erotic novel]], ''[[Story of O]]'' and soon started raping her,{{sfn|Green|pages=59–64}} which consisted of oral [[rape]]. Cameron did not want to have vaginal sex with Stan because he considered that to be a breach in his agreement with his wife. Instead he raped her vaginally and anally with implements. Following this, the Hooker family moved to a mobile home in Red Bluff with Stan, where she was kept locked in wooden boxes under the couple's water bed. In 1978, Janice gave birth to a second child on the water bed above Stan.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=84}}

Stan said that her faith in [[God]] and belief of escape helped her survive;{{sfn|Green|2009|p=6}} her greatest fear was of "The Company", which Cameron "reinforced" daily.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=65}} To avoid painful punishments, Stan tried to comply with his commandments,{{sfn|Green|2009|p=184}} which later led to her being allowed to go out to jog, work in the yard, and care for the family's children in the mobile home. Even with an open door, neighbors and a telephone, she made no attempt to escape as—according to Stan—her fear of "The Company" kept her from seeking help.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=88}} Additionally, Stan was allowed to visit her family by herself in 1981&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; but did not reveal her situation because of her fear and the possible consequences.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; Her family thought she was involved in a cult because of her homemade clothes, lack of money and absence of communications over the years; they did not want to pressure her fearing she would go away forever. The next day, Stan returned with Hooker as her boyfriend.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; At the trial Stan explained that she was happy due to visiting her family, who were therefore able to take a photograph of the pair happily smiling together.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=108–117}}

According to Stan, Hooker feared he had given his slave too much freedom and took her back to his mobile home where he locked her in the wooden box under his water bed; she remained in the box 23 hours a day for the next three years.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=118}} [[Toilet|Bodily function]]s were dealt with by her using a [[bed pan]] which she hooked under herself with her feet. It was stated in court that Hookers' children were told "K" had gone home; however, after the children had gone to bed, Hooker took Colleen out of the box to feed and torture her.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=118–121}} She was reportedly not allowed to make any noise and had to lie still 23 hours long at a time in the dark with little air to breathe. In summer, conditions were especially harsh on her as the temperatures would swelter to over 100 degrees in her box. To feed herself, she ate cold scraps of food.

==Aftermath and consequences==

===Escape and trial===
It was not until 1983 that Stan was reintroduced to the children and neighbors, with her being also allowed to get a job as a maid at a motel.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=131–132}} Hooker wanted Stan to become his second wife, which was a turning point for Janice.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=178}} Janice confessed that—starting with their first date—she had also been tortured, [[Mind control|brainwashed]] and referred to as a whore over the years by Cameron.{{sfn|Green|2009|pages=170–172}} Janice further stated that she survived their relationship with [[denial]] and [[Compartmentalization (psychology)|compartmentalization]]. By August 1984, Janice began struggling with herself, and also went to Stan in order to inform her that Hooker was not part of "The Company". However, she did maintain that the organization did exist.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=136}} In a televised interview for ''Girl in the Box'', Stan told the interviewer that she then went to a bus station and called Hooker to inform him that she was leaving him, and that he reacted by bursting into tears; Stan subsequently caught a bus home. In the months that followed, she did not contact the police but continued to call Hooker regularly; she explained this at the trial by saying that she wanted to give Hooker, at Janice's request, a chance to reform. Three months later, Janice reported her husband to the police.{{sfn|Green|2009|p=179}} She informed Lt. Jerry D.

===Cultural impact===
The case and its core elements of an invisible conspiracy used to coerce the victim into servitude and long periods of confinement has formed the basis for several episodes of television crime series, including ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' (episode "The Company", season seven), ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' (episode "Ball &amp; Chain", season four), and ''[[Law and Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (episode "Slaves", [[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit (season 1)|season one]]). It was also profiled in the 2008 episode "Kidnapped" of [[Investigation Discovery]] series ''[[Wicked Attraction]]''. A 2012 episode of [[SyFy]] series ''[[Paranormal Witness]]'', "The Apartment", told the story of the disappearance of Marie Spannhake, and includes a cameo mention of Stan's kidnapping. The case was also mentioned in passing during an episode of ''[[Waking the Dead (TV series)|Waking the Dead]]'' (episode "Fugue States", part 1, season 4). It was also documented in the book ''Perfect Victim: The True Story of the Girl in the Box'' (1989) by prosecutor Christine McGuire and Carla Norton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mcguire |first=Christine |last2=Norton |first2=Carla |title=Perfect Victim: The True Story of "The Girl in the Box" by the D.A.

In 1996, American rock band [[Elysian Fields (band)|Elysian Fields]] released a song titled "Jack in the Box" for their debut studio album, ''Bleed Your Cedar'', which was made available for purchase that same year. Its lyrical content delves into Stan's experience of being imprisoned by Cameron in the box under the bed he shared with his wife, and alludes to the power he had over her. The case inspired the name for [[Richard Ramirez (musician)|Richard Ramirez]]'s Texas [[Noise music|experimental noise]] group Black Leather Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/black-leather-jesus-the-most-horrifying-origin-story-ever-6760212 |title=Black Leather Jesus: The Most Horrifying Origin Story Ever |access-date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a short opera piece composed by Patrik Jarlestam and Jonas Bernander was based on the kidnapping, and premiered in [[Stockholm]], Sweden under the name of ''Den 4444:e dagen'' (''The 4444th day'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://patrikjarlestam.se/works.htm |title=Patrik Jarlestam Portfolio |website=patrikjarlestam.se}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the main plot of ''[[The Poughkeepsie Tapes]]'' (2007) was based on this case. An updated version of Stan's story, ''Colleen Stan, The Simple Gifts of Life'' by Jim Green, was published in 2009.

On September 10, 2016, a television movie based on the case titled ''Girl in the Box'' premiered on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] starring [[Addison Timlin]] as Colleen Stan, [[Zane Holtz]] as Cameron Hooker, and [[Zelda Williams]] as Janice Hooker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nicole Weisensee |last=Egan |url=http://www.people.com/article/how-girl-in-the-box-became-lifetime-movie |title=WATCH: How the 'Girl in the Box' Became a Lifetime Movie – Nearly 40 Years After Her Kidnapping |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=September 9, 2016 |access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lindsay |last=MacDonald |url=http://zap2it.com/2016/09/liftime-girl-in-the-box-based-on-true-story/ |title=TV Query: Is Lifetime’s ‘Girl in the Box’ based on a true story? |work=[[Zap2it]] |date=September 10, 2016 |access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the movie was followed by a two-hour documentary called ''Colleen Stan: Girl in the Box''.

In [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and related fields, a '''kinetic scheme''' is a network of states and connections between them representing the scheme of a dynamical process. Usually a kinetic scheme represents a [[Markovian process]], while for non-Markovian processes generalized kinetic schemes are used. Figure 1 shows an illustration of a kinetic scheme.

==A Markovian kinetic scheme==

===Mathematical description===
A '''kinetic scheme''' is a network (a [[directed graph]]) of distinct states (although repetition of states may occur and this depends on the system), where each pair of states ''i'' and ''j'' are associated with directional rates, &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; (and &lt;math&gt;A_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;). It is described with a [[master equation]]: a first-order [[differential equation]] for the [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt; of a system to occupy each one its states at time ''t'' (element ''i'' represents state ''i''). Written in a matrix form, this states: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of connections (rates) &lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

In a '''Markovian kinetic scheme''' the connections are constant with respect to time (and any jumping time probability density function for state ''i'' is an exponential, with a rate equal the value of all the exiting connections). 

When [[detailed balance]] exists in a system, the relation &lt;math&gt;A_{ji}P_{i}(t\rightarrow\infty)=A_{ij}P_{j}(t\rightarrow\infty)&lt;/math&gt; holds for every connected states ''i'' and ''j''. The result represents the fact that any closed loop in a Markovian network in equilibrium does not have a net flow.

Matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; can also represent birth and death, meaning that probability is injected (birth) or taken from (death) the system, where then, the process is not in equilibrium. These terms are different than a [[birth-death process]], where there is simply a '''linear kinetic scheme'''.

===Specific Markovian kinetic schemes===
* A [[birth-death process]] is a linear one-dimensional Markovian kinetic scheme.
* [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]] are a type of a Markovian kinetic scheme when solved with the steady state assumption for the creation of intermediates in the reaction pathway.

==Generalizations of Markovian kinetic schemes==

* '''A kinetic scheme with time dependent rates''': When the connections depend on the actual time (i.e. matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; depends on the time, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{A}(t)&lt;/math&gt; ), the process is not Markovian, and the master equation obeys, &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}=\mathbf{A}(t)\vec{P}&lt;/math&gt;.  The reason for a time dependent rates is, for example, a time dependent external field applied on a Markovian kinetic scheme (thus making the process a not Markovian one).
* '''A semi-Markovian kinetic scheme''': When the connections represent multi exponential jumping time probability density functions, the process is [[Semi-Markov process|semi-Markovian]], and the equation of motion is an [[integro-differential equation]] termed the generalized master equation: &lt;math&gt; \frac{d\vec{P}}{dt}= \int^t_0 \mathbf{A}(t- \tau )\vec{P}( \tau )d \tau &lt;/math&gt;.
An example for such a process is a [[reduced dimensions form]]. 
* '''The Fokker Planck equation''': when expanding the master equation of the kinetic scheme in a continuous space coordinate, one finds the [[Fokker Planck equation]].

In [[personality psychology]], '''locus of control''' is the degree to which people believe that they have control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Understanding of the concept was developed by [[Julian Rotter|Julian B. Rotter]] in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's "loci" (plural of "locus", Latin for "place" or "location") are conceptualized as internal (a belief that one's life can be controlled) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which they cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0092976 |title=Generalized expectancies for internal versus external control of reinforcement |journal=Psychological Monographs: General and Applied |volume=80 |pages=1–28 |year=1966 |last1=Rotter |first1=Julian B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with a strong internal locus of control believe events in their life derive primarily from their own actions: for example, when receiving exam results, people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves and their abilities.  People with a strong external locus of control tend to praise or blame external factors such as the teacher or the exam.&lt;ref name="Carlson, N.R. 2007"&gt;Carlson, N.R., et al. (2007). Psychology: The Science of Behaviour - 4th Canadian ed.. Toronto, ON: Pearson Education Canada.{{pn|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Summary, critique and the future}}
Locus of control generated much research in a variety of areas in psychology. The construct is applicable to such fields as [[educational psychology]], [[health psychology]] and [[clinical psychology]]. Debate continues whether specific or more global measures of locus of control will prove to be more useful in practical application. Careful distinctions should also be made between locus of control (a concept linked with expectancies about the future) and attributional style (a concept linked with explanations for past outcomes), or between locus of control and concepts such as [[self-efficacy]].

Locus of control is one of the four dimensions of [[core self-evaluations]] – one's fundamental appraisal of oneself – along with [[neuroticism]], [[self-efficacy]], and [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=Judge1997&gt;{{cite journal |last=Judge |first=T.

(2002) argued that locus of control, neuroticism, self-efficacy and self-esteem factors may have a common core.&lt;ref name=pmid12219863&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.3.693 |pmid=12219863 |title=Are measures of self-esteem, neuroticism, locus of control, and generalized self-efficacy indicators of a common core construct? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=83 |issue=3 |pages=693–710 |year=2002 |last1=Judge |first1=Timothy A |last2=Erez |first2=Amir |last3=Bono |first3=Joyce E |last4=Thoresen |first4=Carl J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|History of concept}}History==

Locus of control is the framework of Rotter's (1954) social-learning theory of personality. In 1966 he published an article in ''Psychological Monographs'' which summarized over a decade of research (by Rotter and his students), much of it previously unpublished. In 1976, Herbert M. Lefcourt defined the perceived locus of control: "...a generalised expectancy for internal as opposed to external control of reinforcements".&lt;ref&gt;Lefcourt 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;27{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts have been made to trace the genesis of the concept to the work of [[Alfred Adler]], but its immediate background lies in the work of Rotter and his students. Early work on the topic of expectations about control of reinforcement had been performed in the 1950s by James and Phares (prepared for unpublished doctoral dissertations supervised by Rotter at [[The Ohio State University]]).&lt;ref name=Lefcourt&gt;Herbert M. Lefcourt, ''Locus of Control: Current Trends in Thory and Research''. Psychology Press, 1982{{pn|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Rotter student, William H. James studied two types of "expectancy shifts":
* ''Typical expectancy shifts'', believing that success (or failure) would be followed by a similar outcome
* ''Atypical expectancy shifts'', believing that success (or failure) would be followed by a dissimilar outcome

Additional research led to the hypothesis that typical expectancy shifts were displayed more often by those who attributed their outcomes to ability, whereas those who displayed atypical expectancy were more likely to attribute their outcomes to chance. This was interpreted that people could be divided into those who attribute to ability (an internal cause) versus those who attribute to luck (an external cause). [[Bernard Weiner]] argued that rather than ability-versus-luck, locus may relate to whether attributions are made to stable or unstable causes.

Rotter (1975, 1989) has discussed problems and misconceptions in others' use of the internal-versus-external construct.

=={{anchor|Locus of control personality orientations}}Personality orientation==
Rotter (1975) cautioned that internality and externality represent two ends of a continuum, not an either/or typology. ''Internals'' tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have internal locus of control believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes.&lt;ref name="JL reff 2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5539/res.v4n2p124 |title=Impact of Locus of Control Expectancy on Level of Well-Being |journal=Review of European Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=2012 |last1=April |first1=Kurt A |last2=Dharani |first2=Babar |last3=Peters |first3=Kai }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. ''Externals'' attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control,&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt; and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below –  makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of [[need for achievement]]. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals tend to feel they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to [[clinical depression]].&lt;ref name=pmid3057032&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-843x.97.3.357 |title=Is there a relation between locus of control orientation and depression? |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=357–367 |year=1988 |last1=Benassi |first1=Victor A |last2=Sweeney |first2=Paul D |last3=Dufour |first3=Charles L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internals were believed by Rotter (1966) to exhibit two essential characteristics: high achievement motivation and low outer-directedness. This was the basis of the locus-of-control scale proposed by Rotter in 1966, although it was based on Rotter's belief that locus of control is a single construct. Since 1970, Rotter's assumption of uni-dimensionality has been challenged, with Levenson (for example) arguing that different dimensions of locus of control (such as beliefs that events in one's life are self-determined, or organized by powerful others and are chance-based) must be separated. Weiner's early work in the 1970s suggested that [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the internality-externality dimension, differences should be considered between those who attribute to stable and those who attribute to unstable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

This new, dimensional theory meant that one could now attribute outcomes to ability (an internal stable cause), effort (an internal unstable cause), task difficulty (an external stable cause) or luck (an external, unstable cause). Although this was how Weiner originally saw these four causes, he has been challenged as to whether people see luck (for example) as an external cause, whether ability is always perceived as stable, and whether effort is always seen as changing. Indeed, in more recent publications (e.g. Weiner, 1980) he uses different terms for these four causes (such as "objective task characteristics" instead of "task difficulty" and "chance" instead of "luck"). Psychologists since Weiner have distinguished between stable and unstable effort, knowing that in some circumstances effort could be seen as a stable cause (especially given the presence of words such as "industrious" in English).

Regarding locus of control, there is another type of control that entails a mix among the internal and external types. People that have the combination of the two types of locus of control are often referred to as Bi-locals. People that have Bi-local characteristics are known to handle stress and cope with their diseases more efficiently by having the mixture of internal and external locus of control.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt; People that have this mix of loci of control can take personal responsibility for their actions and the consequences thereof while remaining capable of relying upon and having faith in outside resources; these characteristics correspond to the internal and external loci of control, respectively. An example of this mixed system would be an alcoholic who will accept the fact that he brought the disease upon himself while remaining open to treatment and/or acknowledging that there are people, mainly doctors and therapists, that are trying to cure his/her addiction, and on whom he should rely.

The most widely used questionnaire to measure locus of control is the 23-item (plus six filler items), [http://www.psych.uncc.edu/pagoolka/LC.html forced-choice scale] of Rotter (1966). However, this is not the only questionnaire; Bialer's (1961) 23-item scale for children predates Rotter's work. Also relevant to the locus-of-control scale are the Crandall Intellectual Ascription of Responsibility Scale (Crandall, 1965) and the Nowicki-Strickland Scale.&lt;ref&gt;Nowicki and Strickland, 1971{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest psychometric scales to assess locus of control (using a [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type scale, in contrast to the forced-choice alternative measure in Rotter's scale) was that devised by W. H. James for his unpublished doctoral dissertation, supervised by Rotter at Ohio State University; however, this remains unpublished.&lt;ref name= autogenerated1&gt;Lefcourt, 1976{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many measures of locus of control have appeared since Rotter's scale. These were reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) and include those related to [[health psychology]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]] and those specifically for children (such as the Stanford Preschool Internal-External Control Index&lt;ref&gt;Mischel et al., 1974{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnham &amp; Steele, 1993{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for three- to six-year-olds). Furnham and Steele (1993) cite data suggesting that the most reliable, valid questionnaire for adults is the Duttweiler scale. For a review of the health questionnaires cited by these authors, see "Applications" below.

The Duttweiler (1984) Internal Control Index (ICI) addresses perceived  problems with the Rotter scales, including their forced-choice format, susceptibility to [[social desirability]] and heterogeneity (as indicated by  [[factor analysis]]). She also notes that, while other scales existed in 1984 to measure locus of control, "they appear to be subject to many of the same problems".&lt;ref&gt;Duttweiler 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;211&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the forced-choice format used on Rotter's scale, Duttweiler's 28-item ICI uses a Likert-type scale in which people must state whether they would rarely, occasionally, sometimes, frequently or usually behave as specified in each of 28 statements. The ICI assess variables pertinent to internal locus: cognitive processing, autonomy, resistance to social influence, self-confidence and delay of [[gratification]]. A small (133 student-subject) validation study indicated that the scale had good internal reliability (a [[Cronbach's alpha]] of 0.85).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Salmani Nodoushan |first1=M.

=={{anchor|Related area: attributional style}}Attributional style==
{{Main|Explanatory style}}
Attributional style (or explanatory style) is a concept introduced by [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson]], [[Martin Seligman]] and [[John D. Teasdale]].&lt;ref&gt;Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept advances a stage further than Weiner, stating that in addition to the concepts of internality-externality and stability a dimension of globality-specificity is also needed. Abramson et al. believed that how people explained successes and failures in their lives related to whether they attributed these to internal or external factors, short-term or long-term factors, and factors that affected all situations.

The topic of [[attribution theory]] (introduced to psychology by [[Fritz Heider]]) has had an influence on locus of control theory, but there are important historical differences between the two models. Attribution theorists have been predominantly [[Social psychology|social psychologists]], concerned with the general processes characterizing how and why people make the attributions they do, whereas locus of control theorists have been concerned with individual differences.

Significant to the history of both approaches are the contributions made by [[Bernard Weiner]] in the 1970s. Before this time, attribution theorists and locus of control theorists had been largely concerned with divisions into external and internal loci of causality. Weiner added the dimension of stability-instability (and later controllability), indicating how a cause could be perceived as having been internal to a person yet still beyond the person's control. The stability dimension added to the understanding of why people succeed or fail after such outcomes. Although not part of Weiner's model, a further dimension of attribution, that of globality-specificity, was added by Abramson, Seligman and Teasdale.

=={{anchor|Applications of locus of control theory}}Applications==
Locus of control's best known application may have been in the area of [[health psychology]], largely due to the work of Kenneth Wallston. Scales to measure locus of control in the health domain were reviewed by Furnham and Steele  in 1993. The best-known are the Health Locus of Control Scale and the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, or MHLC.&lt;ref&gt;Wallston, Wallston, &amp; DeVellis, 1976; Wallston, Wallston, Kaplan &amp; Maides, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The latter scale is based on the idea (echoing Levenson's earlier work) that health may be attributed to three sources: internal factors (such as self-determination of a healthy lifestyle), powerful others (such as one's doctor) or luck (which is very dangerous as lifestyle advice will be ignored – these people are very difficult to help).

Some of the scales reviewed by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as [[obesity]] (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of [[diabetes mellitus]]. Empirical data on health locus of control in a number of fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as [[jogging]]) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as [[breast self-examination]], weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.

Norman and Bennett note that some studies that compared alcoholics with non-alcoholics suggest [[alcoholism]] is linked to increased externality for health locus of control; however, other studies have linked alcoholism with increased internality. Similar ambiguity has been found in studies of alcohol consumption in the general, non-alcoholic population. They are more optimistic in reviewing the literature on the relationship between internal health locus of control and [[smoking cessation]], although they also point out that there are grounds for supposing that powerful-others and internal-health loci of control may be linked with this behavior. It is thought that, rather than being caused by one or the other, that alcoholism is directly related to the strength of the locus, regardless of type, internal or external.

They argue that a stronger relationship is found when health locus of control is assessed for specific domains than when general measures are taken. Overall, studies using behavior-specific health locus scales have tended to produce more positive results.&lt;ref&gt;Lefcourt, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; These scales have been found to be more predictive of general behavior than more general scales, such as the MHLC scale.&lt;ref&gt;Norman &amp; Bennett, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;72&lt;/ref&gt; Norman and Bennett cite several studies that used health-related locus-of-control scales in specific domains (including smoking cessation),&lt;ref&gt;Georgio &amp; Bradley, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, Price, Desmond and Roberts, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; tablet-treated diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Lewis, Jennings and Ward, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;Stantion, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; arthritis,&lt;ref&gt;Nicasio ''et al'', 1985&lt;/ref&gt; cancer,&lt;ref&gt;Pruyn ''et al'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt; and heart and lung disease.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

They also argue that health locus of control is better at predicting health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach to their health), suggesting that health value is an important [[moderator variable]] in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed.&lt;ref&gt;Norman and Bennett, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking internal locus of control with improved physical health, mental health and [[quality of life]] in people with diverse conditions: [[HIV]], [[migraines]], [[diabetes]], [[kidney disease]] and [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;Maltby, Day &amp; Macaskill, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s, Whyte correlated locus of control with the academic success of students enrolled in higher-education courses. Students who were more internally controlled believed that hard work and focus would result in successful academic progress, and they performed better academically. Those students who were identified as more externally controlled (believing that their future depended upon luck or fate) tended to have lower academic-performance levels.  [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] researched how control tendency influenced behavioral outcomes in the academic realm by examining the effects of various modes of counseling on grade improvements and the locus of control of high-risk college students.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, C., "An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center" (1980). New Directions Sourcebook-Learning Assistance Centers. Jossey-Bass, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = C | year = | title = Effective Conseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen (1978) | url = | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 198–200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = C.

Rotter also looked at studies regarding the correlation between gambling and either an internal or external locus of control.  For internals, gambling is more reserved.  When betting, they primarily focus on safe and moderate wagers.  Externals, however, take more chances and, for example, bet more on a card or number that has not appeared for a certain period, under the notion that this card or number has a higher chance of occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hock |first1=Roger R. |year=2013 |contribution=Personality |pages=190–7 |editor1-first=C. |editor1-last=Campanella |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Mosher |editor3-first=S. |editor3-last=Frail |editor4-first=M. |editor4-last=Schricker |title=Forty Studies that Changed Psychology |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational psychology and religion===
Other fields to which the concept has been applied include [[industrial and organizational psychology]], [[sports psychology]], [[educational psychology]] and the [[psychology of religion]]. Richard Kahoe has published work in the latter field, suggesting that intrinsic religious orientation correlates positively (and extrinsic religious orientation correlates negatively) with internal locus.&lt;ref&gt;Kahoe, 1974{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of relevance to both health psychology and the psychology of religion is the work of Holt, Clark, Kreuter and Rubio (2003) on a questionnaire to assess spiritual-health locus of control. The authors distinguished between an active spiritual-health locus of control (in which "God empowers the individual to take healthy actions"&lt;ref&gt;Holt et al., p294&lt;/ref&gt;) and a more passive spiritual-health locus of control (where health is left up to God). In [[industrial and organizational psychology]], it has been found that internals are more likely to take positive action to change their jobs (rather than merely talk about occupational change) than externals.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Weeks and Moffat, 2005{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maltby et al., 2007{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer research===
Locus of control has also been applied to the field of consumer research. For example, Martin, Veer and Pervan (2007) examined how the weight locus of control of women (i.e., beliefs about the control of body weight) influence how they react to female models in advertising of different body shapes. They found that women who believe they can control their weight ("internals"), respond most favorably to slim models in advertising, and this favorable response is mediated by self-referencing. In contrast, women who feel powerless about their weight ("externals"), self-reference larger-sized models, but
only prefer larger-sized models when the advertisement is for a non-fattening product. For fattening products, they exhibit a similar preference for larger-sized models and slim models. The weight locus of control measure was also found to be correlated with measures for weight control beliefs and  willpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11002-007-9014-1 |title=Self-referencing and consumer evaluations of larger-sized female models: A weight locus of control perspective |journal=Marketing Letters |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=197–209 |year=2007 |last1=Martin |first1=Brett A. S |last2=Veer |first2=Ekant |last3=Pervan |first3=Simon J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political ideology===
Locus of control has been linked to political ideology. In the 1972 U.S. Presidential election, research of college students found that those with an internal locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Republican, while those with an external locus of control were substantially more likely to register as a Democrat.&lt;ref name=pmid4814098&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0035997 |title=Locus of control and political participation of college students: A comparison of unidimensional and multidimensional approaches |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=42 |pages=54–58 |year=1974 |last1=Gootnick |first1=Andrew T }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 study surveying students at [[Cameron University]] in Oklahoma found similar results,&lt;ref&gt;Laverghetta, Antonio. "[http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p556976_index.html The Relationship between the Big 5 Personality factors, Locus of Control, and Political Ideology]" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Oklahoma Research Day, Cameron University, Lawton, OK, Nov 04, 2011. 2014-11-25; URL accessed 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; although these studies were limited in scope.

Those with an internal locus of control are more likely to be of higher socioeconomic status, and are more likely to be politically involved (e.g., following political news, joining a political organization)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = A. | last2 = Vigoda | first2 = E. | last3 = Samorly | first3 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Analysis of the mediating effect of personal psychological variables on the relationship between socioeconomic status and political participation: A structural equations framework | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 22 | issue = 4| pages = 727–757 | doi=10.1111/0162-895x.00260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with an internal locus of control are also more likely to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blanchard | first1 = E. | last2 = Scarboro | first2 = M. | year = 1973 | title = Locus of control and the prediction of voting behavior in college students | url = | journal = Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 1| pages = 123–129 | doi=10.1080/00224545.1973.9922576| pmid = 4694574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deutchman | first1 = I | year = 1985 | title = Internal-External Locus of Control, power and political participation | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 57 | issue = 3| pages = 835–843 | doi=10.2466/pr0.1985.57.3.835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Familial origins==
The development of locus of control is associated with family style and resources, cultural stability and experiences with effort leading to reward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Many internals have grown up with families modeling typical internal beliefs; these families emphasized effort, education, responsibility and thinking, and parents typically gave their children rewards they had promised them. In contrast, externals are typically associated with lower [[socioeconomic status]]. Societies experiencing social unrest increase the expectancy of being out-of-control; therefore, people in such societies become more external.&lt;ref name="Meyerhoff"&gt;Meyerhoff (2004), p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1995 research of Schneewind suggests that "children in large single parent families headed by women are more likely to develop an external locus of control".&lt;ref&gt;Schultz and Schultz (2005), p.439.&lt;/ref&gt; {{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Schultz and Schultz also claim that children in families where parents have been supportive and consistent in discipline develop internal locus of control. At least one study has found that children whose parents had an external locus of control are more likely to attribute their successes and failures to external causes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/66kSA7Ncm?url=http://psych.fullerton.edu/jmearns/rotter.htm "Social Learning Theory of Julian B. Rotter"] Archived from [http://psych.fullerton.edu/jmearns/rotter.htm the original] 2012-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from early studies on the familial origins of locus of control were summarized by Lefcourt: "Warmth, supportiveness and parental encouragement seem to be essential for development of an internal locus".&lt;ref&gt;Lefcourt, 1976, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, causal evidence regarding how parental locus of control influences offspring locus of control (whether genetic, or environmentally mediated) is lacking.

Locus of control becomes more internal with age. As children grow older, they gain skills which give them more control over their environment. However, whether this or biological development is responsible for changes in locus is unclear.&lt;ref name="Meyerhoff" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Locus of control and age}}Age==
It is sometimes assumed that as people age they will become less internal and more external, but data here have been ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Aldwin &amp; Gilmer, 2004{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Grant, Plomin, Pedersen, Ahern, Berg &amp; McClearn, 2001{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Longitudinal data collected by Gatz and Karel imply that internality may increase until middle age, decreasing thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Karel{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson et al., 2004{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the ambiguity of data in this area, Aldwin and Gilmer (2004) cite Lachman's claim that locus of control is ambiguous. Indeed, there is evidence here that changes in locus of control in later life relate more visibly to increased externality (rather than reduced internality) if the two concepts are taken to be [[orthogonal]]. Evidence cited by Schultz and Schultz (2005) suggests that locus of control increases in internality until middle age. The authors also note that attempts to control the environment become more pronounced between ages eight and fourteen.&lt;ref&gt;Heckhausen and Schulz (1995){{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryckman and Malikosi, 1975{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health locus of control is how people measure and understand how people relate their health to their behavior, health status and how long it may take to recover from a disease.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12144-011-9108-z |title=Predictors of Health Locus of Control in Older Adults |journal=Current Psychology |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=173–183 |year=2011 |last1=Jacobs-Lawson |first1=Joy M |last2=Waddell |first2=Erin L |last3=Webb |first3=Alicia K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Locus of control can influence how people think and react towards their health and health decisions. Each day we are exposed to potential diseases that may affect our health. The way we approach that reality has a lot to do with our locus of control. Sometimes it is expected to see older adults experience progressive declines in their health, for this reason it is believed that their health locus of control will be affected.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt; However, this does not necessarily mean that their locus of control will be affected negatively but older adults may experience decline in their health and this can show lower levels of internal locus of control.

Age plays an important role in one's internal and external locus of control. When comparing a young child and an older adult with their levels of locus of control in regards to health, the older person will have more control over their attitude and approach to the situation. As people age they become aware of the fact that events outside of their own control happen and that other individuals can have control of their health outcomes.&lt;ref name="JL reff 1"/&gt;

A study published in the journal ''Psychosomatic Medicine'' examined the health effect of childhood locus of control. 7,500 British adults (followed from birth), who had shown an internal locus of control at age 10, were less likely to be overweight at age 30. The children who had an internal locus of control also appeared to have higher levels of self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080619/hl_nm/self_confident_dc | title=Self-confident children may be healthier as adults | website=Yahoo!

=={{anchor|Gender-based differences in locus of control}}Gender-based differences==
As Schultz and Schultz (2005) point out, significant gender differences in locus of control have not been found for adults in the U.S. population. However, these authors also note that there may be specific sex-based differences for specific categories of items to assess locus of control; for example, they cite evidence that men may have a greater internal locus for questions related to academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland &amp; Haley, 1980{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schultz &amp; Schultz, 2005.{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study made by Takaki and colleagues (2006), focused on the gender differences with relationship to internal locus of control and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance.&lt;ref name=pmid16637257&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3200/BMED.32.1.5-11 |pmid=16637257 |title=Possible Gender Differences in the Relationships of Self-efficacy and the Internal Locus of Control with Compliance in Hemodialysis Patients |journal=Behavioral Medicine |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 |year=2006 |last1=Takaki |first1=Jiro |last2=Yano |first2=Eiji }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards to their health and medical advice compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.

=={{anchor|Cross-cultural and Regional issues in locus of control}}Cross-cultural and regional issues==
The question of whether people from different cultures vary in locus of control has long been of interest to social psychologists. Japanese people tend to be more external in locus-of-control orientation than people in the U.S.; however, differences in locus of control between different countries within Europe (and between the U.S. and Europe) tend to be small.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Poortinga, Segall and Dasen, 1992.{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Berry ''et al.'' pointed out in 1992, ethnic groups within the United States have been compared on locus of control; [[African American]]s in the U.S. are more external than [[White American|whites]] when socioeconomic status is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;Dyal, 1984{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berry ''et al.'', 1992.{{full|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berry ''et al.'' also pointed out in 1992 how research on other ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as Hispanics) has been ambiguous. More on cross-cultural variations in locus of control can be found in Shiraev and Levy (2004). Research in this area indicates that locus of control has been a useful concept for researchers in [[cross-cultural psychology]].

On a less broad scale, Sims and Baumann explained how regions in the United States cope with natural disasters differently.  The example they used was tornados.  They "applied Rotter's theory to explain why more people have died in tornado[e]s in Alabama than in Illinois".&lt;ref&gt;Hock, Roger R. 2013. Personality. P. 195 In: C. Campanella, J. Mosher, S. Frail, M. Schricker (eds.), Forty Studies that Changed Psychology. Pearson Education, Inc. Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;  They explain that after giving surveys to residents of four counties in both Alabama and Illinois, Alabama residents were shown to be more external in their way of thinking about events that occur in their lives.  Illinois residents, however, were more internal.  Because Alabama residents had a more external way of processing information, they took fewer precautions prior to the appearance of a tornado.  Those in Illinois, however, were more prepared, thus leading to fewer casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sims | first1 = J. | last2 = Baumann | first2 = D. | year = 1972 | title = The tornado threat: Coping styles in the North and South | url = | journal = Science | volume = 176 | issue = 4042| pages = 1386–1392 | doi=10.1126/science.176.4042.1386| pmid = 17834637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-efficacy==
{{Further|Self-efficacy}}
Self-efficacy is a person's belief that he or she can accomplish a particular activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/siegle/SelfEfficacy/section1.html | title=An Introduction to Self-Efficacy | publisher=Neag Center for Creativity, Gifted Education, and Talent Development | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019063232/http://www.gifted.uconn.edu/Siegle/SelfEfficacy/section1.html | archivedate=October 19, 2015 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a related concept introduced by [[Albert Bandura]], and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale.&lt;ref&gt;Sherer, Madux et al., 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and [[self-esteem]], using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen that is essential to maintaining their own health.&lt;ref name="JL reff 5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10578-010-0173-6 |pmid=20204497 |title=Locus of Control and Self-Efficacy: Potential Mediators of Stress, Illness, and Utilization of Health Services in College Students |journal=Child Psychiatry &amp; Human Development |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=353–370 |year=2010 |last1=Roddenberry |first1=Angela |last2=Renk |first2=Kimberly }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy plays an important role in one's health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.

Smith (1989) has argued that locus of control only weakly measures self-efficacy; "only a subset of items refer directly to the subject's capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;229.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith noted that training in coping skills led to increases in self-efficacy, but did not affect locus of control as measured by Rotter's 1966 scale.

== Stress ==
The previous section showed how self-efficacy can be related to a person's locus of control, and stress also has a relationship in these areas. Self-efficacy can be something that people use to deal with the stress that they are faced with in their everyday lives. Some findings suggest that higher levels of external locus of control combined with lower levels self-efficacy are related to higher illness-related psychological distress.&lt;ref name="JL reff 5"/&gt; In the previous section, the different types of locus of control, internal and external, were mentioned. Based on the definition of people who have an external locus of control, we can see that this can be associated with higher levels of stress. A study conducted by Bollini and others reveals that individuals who have a high external locus of control tend to have higher levels of psychological and physical problems. These people are also more vulnerable to external influences and as a result they become more responsive to stress.&lt;ref name="JL reff 5" /&gt;

Veterans of the military forces who have spinal cord injuries and post-traumatic stress are a good group to look at in regards to locus of control and stress. Aging shows to be a very important factor that can be related to the severity of the symptoms of PTSD experienced by patients following the trauma of war.&lt;ref name="JL reff 4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1521/psyc.2006.69.1.69 |pmid=16704333 |title=Spinal Cord Injury, Posttraumatic Stress, and Locus of Control Among the Elderly: A Comparison with Young and Middle–Aged Patients |journal=Psychiatry: Interpersonal and Biological Processes |volume=69 |issue=1 |pages=69–80 |year=2006 |last1=Chung |first1=Man Cheung |last2=Preveza |first2=Eleni |last3=Papandreou |first3=Konstantinos |last4=Prevezas |first4=Nikolaos }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that patients who suffered a spinal cord injury benefit from knowing that they have control over their health problems and their disability, which reflects the characteristics of having internal locus of control.

A study by Chung et al. (2006) focused on how the responses of spinal cord injury post-traumatic stress varied depending on age. The researchers tested different age groups including young adults, middle-aged, and elderly; the average age was 25, 48 and 65 for each group respectively. After the study, they concluded that age does not make a difference on how spinal cord injury patients respond to the traumatic events that happened.&lt;ref name="JL reff 4" /&gt; However, they did mention that age did play a role in the extent to which the external locus of control was used, and concluded that the young adult group demonstrated more external locus of control characteristics than the other age groups to which they were being compared.

'''Loubna Mrie''' (born 1991) is a [[Syria]]n civil rights activist.

Mrie comes from an [[Alawites|Alawite]] family from a village near [[Latakia]]. Her father is a high official in the [[Syrian Arab Air Force|Syrian Air Force]] Intelligence. Despite her family ties, she is one of a few Alawites to join the fight against the [[Assad regime]] and has been branded a traitor by her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Syria conflict: 'My father wants me dead'|date=2013-05-02|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22389484|language=en-GB|accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As rioting broke out in the initial stages of the Syrian Civil War, Loubna attended [[Latakia University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/middle-east/alawite-fsa-supporter-whose-father-backs-assad-tells-of-a-syrian-family-ripped-apart|title=Alawite FSA supporter whose father backs Assad tells of a Syrian family ripped apart {{!}} The National|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but moved to [[Damascus]] in 2012 as Latakia was deemed to be unsafe for activists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/read/i-left-my-family-for-the-free-syrian-army-000205-v19n11|title=I Left My Family for the Free Syrian Army {{!}} VICE {{!}} United States|date=2012-11-27|newspaper=VICE|language=en-us|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to Assad troops opening fire on civilian protestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/world/middleeast/26syria.html|title=Syrian Troops Open Fire on Protesters in Several Cities|last=Slackman|first=Michael|date=2011-03-25|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later joined the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA) where she helped with the transport of food and medical aid, then with the smuggling of ammunition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She promoted the aims of the revolution in the Alawitian community and spoke with the victims of government-run troops.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/11/syria-shabiha-alawite-peace|title=Syrian exile: 'My mother is dead.

On August 11, 2012, her mother was abducted, according to her father, who subsequently broke off all contact with her.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Loubna then received information from a friend with details about the death of her mother. It is said that her father killed her mother. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]],'' she talked about her father stating that "he wished he could do the same to me."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

She later became a photojournalist with [[Reuters]] based in [[Aleppo]] where she covered the conflict then moved to New York where she is a researcher and commentator on Syrian and Middle Eastern affairs. She has been published in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'', among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neareaststudies.as.nyu.edu/object/Loubna_Mrie.html|title=Loubna Mrie, Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, New York University|website=neareaststudies.as.nyu.edu|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''macroscopic scale''' is the [[length scale]] on which objects or phenomena are large enough to be visible almost practically with the [[naked eye]], without magnifying [[optical instrument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reif|first=F.|title=Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics|year=1965|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=007-051800-9|edition=International student edition.|page=2|quote=we shall call a system "''macro''scopic" (i.e., "''large'' scale") when it is large enough to be visible in the ordinary sense (say greater than 1 micron, so that it can at least be observed with a microscope using ordinary light).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jaeger|first1=Gregg|title=What in the (quantum) world is macroscopic?|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=September 2014|volume=82|issue=9|pages=896–905|doi=10.1119/1.4878358|bibcode = 2014AmJPh..82..896J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
When applied to physical phenomena and bodies, the macroscopic scale describes things as a person can directly perceive them, without the aid of magnifying devices. This is in contrast to observations ([[microscopy]]) or theories ([[microphysics]], [[statistical physics]]) of objects of geometric [[length]]s smaller than perhaps some hundreds of [[micrometer]]s.

A macroscopic view of a [[ball]] is just that: a ball. A [[microscopic]] view could reveal a thick round skin seemingly composed entirely of puckered cracks and fissures (as viewed through a [[microscope]]) or, further down in scale, a collection of [[molecule]]s in a roughly [[sphere|spherical]] shape. An example of a physical theory that takes a deliberately macroscopic viewpoint is [[thermodynamics]]. An example of a topic that extends from macroscopic to microscopic viewpoints is [[histology]].

Not quite by the distinction between macroscopic and microscopic, [[Classical mechanics|classical]] and [[quantum mechanics]] are theories that are distinguished in a subtly different way. At first glance one might think of them as differing simply in the size of objects that they describe, classical objects being considered far larger as to mass and geometrical size than quantal objects, for example a football versus a fine particle of dust. More refined consideration distinguishes classical and quantum mechanics on the basis that classical mechanics fails to recognize that matter and energy cannot be divided into infinitesimally small parcels, so that ultimately fine division reveals irreducibly granular features. The criterion of fineness is whether or not the interactions are described in terms of [[Planck's constant]]. Roughly speaking, classical mechanics considers particles in mathematically idealized terms even as fine as geometrical points with no magnitude, still having their finite masses. Classical mechanics also considers mathematically idealized extended materials as geometrically continuously substantial. Such idealizations are useful for most everyday calculations, but may fail entirely for molecules, atoms, photons, and other elementary particles. In many ways, classical mechanics can be considered a mainly macroscopic theory. On the much smaller scale of atoms and molecules, classical mechanics may fail, and the interactions of particles are then described by quantum mechanics. Near the [[Absolute zero|absolute minimum of temperature]], the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] exhibits effects on macroscopic scale that demand description by quantum mechanics.

The term "megascopic" is a synonym. No word exists that specifically refers to features commonly portrayed at reduced scales for better understanding, such as geographic areas or astronomical objects. "Macroscopic" may also refer to a "larger view", namely a view available only from a large perspective. A macroscopic position could be considered the "big picture".

==High energy physics compared to low energy physics==
[[Particle physics]], dealing with the smallest physical systems, is also known as ''high energy physics''. Physics of larger [[length]] scales, including the macroscopic scale, is also known as ''low energy physics''. Intuitively, it might seem incorrect to associate "high energy" with the physics of very small, ''low'' [[mass-energy]] systems, like subatomic particles. By comparison, one [[gram]] of [[hydrogen]], a macroscopic system, has ~ {{val|6|e=23|u=}} times&lt;ref&gt;[http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?na "CODATA Value: Avogadro constant"]. The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty. US National Institute of Standards and Technology. June 2015. Retrieved 13 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; the mass-energy of a single [[proton]], a central object of study in high energy physics. Even an entire [[particle beam|beam]] of protons circulated in the [[Large Hadron Collider]], a high energy physics experiment, contains ~ {{val|3.23|e=14|u=}} protons,&lt;ref name="lhcbeam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Beam Requirements and Fundamental Choices |url=http://edms.cern.ch/ui/file/445762/3/Vol3_Chap2_v4.pdf|publisher=CERN Engineering &amp; Equipment Data Management Service (EDMS)|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; each with {{val|6.5|e=12|u=[[electronvolt|eV]]}} of energy, for a total beam energy of ~ {{val|2.1|e=27|u=eV}} or ~ 336.4 [[megajoule|MJ]], which is still ~ {{val|2.7|e=5|u=}} times lower than the mass-energy of a single gram of hydrogen. Yet, the macroscopic realm is "low energy physics", while that of quantum particles is "high energy physics".

The reason for this is that the "high energy" refers to energy ''at the quantum particle level''. While macroscopic systems indeed have a larger total energy content than any of their constituent quantum particles, there can be no experiment or other [[observation]] of this total energy without extracting the respective amount of energy from each of the quantum particles – which is exactly the domain of high energy physics. Daily experiences of matter and the Universe are characterized by very low energy. For example, the [[photon energy]] of [[visible light]] is about 1.8 to 3.2 eV. Similarly, the [[bond-dissociation energy]] of a [[carbon-carbon bond]] is about 3.6 eV. This is the energy scale manifesting at the macroscopic level, such as in [[chemical reaction]]s. Even photons with far higher energy, [[gamma ray]]s of the kind produced in [[radioactive decay]], have photon energy that is almost always between {{val||e=5|u=eV}} and {{val||e=7|u=eV}} – still two [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] lower than the mass-energy of a single proton. Radioactive decay gamma rays are considered as part of [[nuclear physics]], rather than high energy physics.

Finally, when reaching the quantum particle level, the high energy domain is revealed. The proton has a mass-energy of ~ {{val|9.4|e=8|u=eV}}; some other massive quantum particles, both elementary and [[hadron]]ic, have yet higher mass-energies. Quantum particles with lower mass-energies are also part of high energy physics; they also have a mass-energy that is far higher than that at the macroscopic scale (such as [[electron]]s), or are equally involved in reactions at the particle level (such as [[neutrino]]s). [[Mass in special relativity|Relativistic effects]], as in particle accelerators and [[cosmic ray]]s, can further increase the accelerated particles' energy by many orders of magnitude, as well as the total energy of the particles emanating from their [[event (particle physics)|collision]] and [[annihilation]].

A '''magnetic circuit''' is made up of one or more closed loop paths containing a [[magnetic flux]].  The flux is usually generated by [[permanent magnet]]s or [[electromagnet]]s and confined to the path by [[magnetic core]]s consisting of [[ferromagnetic material]]s like iron,  although there may be air gaps or other materials in the path.  Magnetic circuits are employed to efficiently channel [[magnetic field]]s in many devices such as [[electric motor]]s, [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[relay]]s, lifting [[electromagnet]]s, [[SQUID]]s, [[galvanometer]]s, and magnetic [[recording head]]s.

The concept of a "magnetic circuit" exploits a one-to-one correspondence between the equations of the magnetic field in an [[Magnetic saturation|unsaturated]] ferromagnetic material to that of an [[electrical circuit]].  Using this concept the magnetic fields of complex devices such as [[transformer]]s can be quickly solved using the methods and techniques developed for electrical circuits.

Some examples of magnetic circuits are:
* [[horseshoe]] [[magnet]] with iron [[magnet keeper|keeper]] (low-[[reluctance]] circuit)
* horseshoe magnet with no keeper (high-reluctance circuit)
* [[electric motor]] (variable-reluctance circuit)
* some types of [[magnetic cartridge|pickup cartridge]] (variable-reluctance circuits) 

==Magnetomotive force (MMF)==
{{main|magnetomotive force}}
Similar to the way that electromotive force ([[Electromotive force|EMF]]) drives a current of electrical charge in electrical circuits, [[magnetomotive force]] (MMF) 'drives' magnetic flux through magnetic circuits.  The term 'magnetomotive force', though, is a misnomer since it is not a force nor is anything moving.  It is perhaps better to call it simply MMF.  In analogy to the definition of [[electromotive force|EMF]], the magnetomotive force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; around a closed loop is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} = \oint \mathbf{H} \cdot \operatorname{d}\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt;

The MMF represents the potential that a hypothetical [[magnetic monopole|magnetic charge]] would gain by completing the loop.  The magnetic flux that is driven is '''not''' a current of magnetic charge; it merely has the same relationship to MMF that electric current has to EMF.  (See microscopic origins of reluctance below for a further description.)

The unit of magnetomotive force is the [[ampere-turn]] (At), represented by a steady, direct [[electric current]] of one [[ampere]] flowing in a single-turn loop of electrically conducting material in a [[vacuum]].  The gilbert (Gb), established by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iec.ch/about/history/overview/ International Electrotechnical Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[CGS]] unit of magnetomotive force and is a slightly smaller unit than the ampere-turn. The unit is named after [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] (1544–1603) English physician and natural philosopher.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  1\;\text{Gb} &amp;= \frac{10}{4\pi}\;\text{At} \\
               &amp;\approx 0.795775\;\text{At}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew M. Radmanesh, ''The Gateway to Understanding: Electrons to Waves and Beyond'', [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NANN_b5hc_EC&amp;pg=PA539&amp;dq=gilbert p. 539], AuthorHouse, 2005 {{ISBN|1418487406}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The magnetomotive force can often be quickly calculated using [[Ampère's circuital law|Ampère's law]].  For example, the magnetomotive force &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of long coil is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F} = N I&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of [[Turn (geometry)|turns]] and ''I'' is the current in the coil.  In practice this equation is used for the MMF of real [[inductor]]s with ''N'' being the [[winding number]] of the inducting coil.

==Magnetic flux==
{{Main| Magnetic flux}}

An applied MMF 'drives' [[magnetic flux]] through the magnetic components of the system.  The magnetic flux through a magnetic component is proportional to the number of [[Magnetic field#Magnetic field lines|magnetic field lines]] that pass through the cross sectional area of that component. This is the ''net'' number, i.e. the number passing through in one direction, minus the number passing through in the other direction. The direction of the magnetic field vector '''''B''''' is by definition from the south to the north pole of a magnet inside the magnet; outside the field lines go from north to south.

The [[flux]] through an element of [[area]] [[perpendicular]] to the direction of magnetic field is given by the product of the [[magnetic field]] and the [[area]] element. More generally, magnetic flux Φ is defined by a [[scalar product]] of the magnetic field and the area element vector.  Quantitatively, the magnetic flux through a surface ''S'' is defined as the [[integral]] of the magnetic field over the area of the surface

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_m = \int \!\!\!\! \int_S \mathbf{B} \cdot \operatorname{d}\mathbf S&lt;/math&gt;

For a magnetic component the area '''''S''''' used to calculate the magnetic flux Φ is usually chosen to be the cross-sectional area of the component.

The [[SI]] [[unit of measurement|unit]] of magnetic flux is the [[Weber (unit)|weber]] (in derived units: volt-seconds), and the unit of magnetic field is the weber per square meter, or [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]].

==Ohm's law for magnetic circuits==
In [[electronic circuits]], [[Ohm's law]] is an empirical relation between the [[electromotive force|EMF]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt;  applied across an element and the [[current (electricity)|current]] I it generates through that element.  It is written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E} = IR&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the [[electrical resistance]] of that material.  There is a counterpart to [[Ohm's law]] used in magnetic circuits.  This law is often called '''Hopkinson's law''', after [[John Hopkinson]], but was actually formulated earlier by [[Henry Augustus Rowland]] in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Rowland H., Phil. Mag. (4), vol. 46, 1873, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ginerdelosrios.org/pizarra/electronica/nemesio/pizarra_neme/simuladores/parametros_magneticos.swf Magnetism (flash)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= EMC Analysis Methods and Computational Models |last=Tesche |first=Fredrick|author2=Michel Ianoz |author3=Torbjörn Karlsson |year= 1997|publisher= Wiley-IEEE|isbn=0-471-15573-X|pages=513 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=\Phi \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetomotive force (MMF) across a magnetic element, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic flux]] through the magnetic element, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic reluctance]] of that element. (It will be shown later that this relationship is due to the empirical relationship between the '''''H'''''-field and the magnetic field '''''B''''', '''''B'''''=''μ'''H''''', where ''μ'' is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the material).  Like Ohm's law, Hopkinson's law can be interpreted either as an empirical equation that works for some materials, or it may serve as a definition of reluctance.

Hopkinson's law is not a correct analogy with Ohm's law in terms of modelling power and energy flow.  In particular, there is no power dissipation associated with a magnetic reluctance in the same way as there is a dissipation in an electrical resistance.  The magnetic resistance that is a true analogy of electrical resistance in this respect is defined as the ratio of magnetomotive force and the rate of change of magnetic flux.  Here rate of change of magnetic flux is standing in for electrical current and the Ohm's law analogy becomes,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=\frac {d \Phi}{dt} R_\mathrm m&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_\mathrm m&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic resistance.  This relationship is part of an electrical-magnetic analogy called the [[gyrator-capacitor model]] and is intended to overcome the drawbacks of the reluctance model.  The gyrator-capacitor model is, in turn, part of a [[Mechanical-electrical analogies#Other energy domains|wider group of compatible analogies]] used to model systems across multiple energy domains.

==Reluctance==
{{Main|Reluctance}}
'''Magnetic reluctance''', or '''magnetic resistance''', is analogous to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] in an [[electrical]] [[Electrical network|circuit]] (although it does not dissipate magnetic energy).  In likeness to the way an [[electric field]] causes an [[electric current]] to follow the [[path of least resistance]], a [[magnetic field]] causes [[magnetic flux]] to follow the path of least magnetic reluctance.  It is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], 
[[Intensive and extensive properties#Extensive properties|extensive quantity]], akin to electrical resistance.

The total reluctance is equal to the ratio of the MMF in a passive magnetic circuit and the [[magnetic flux]] in this circuit.  In an AC field, the reluctance is the ratio of the amplitude values for a [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] MMF and magnetic flux. (see [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasors]])

The definition can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R} = \frac{\mathcal{F}}{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the reluctance in [[ampere-turn]]s per [[weber (unit)|weber]] (a unit that is equivalent to turns per [[henry (unit)|henry]]).

Magnetic flux always forms a closed loop, as described by [[Maxwell's equations]], but the path of the loop depends on the reluctance of the surrounding materials.  It is concentrated around the path of least reluctance.  Air and vacuum have high reluctance, while easily magnetized materials such as [[soft iron]] have low reluctance. The concentration of flux in low-reluctance materials forms strong temporary poles and causes mechanical forces that tend to move the materials towards regions of higher flux so it is always an attractive force(pull).

The inverse of reluctance is called ''[[permeance]]''.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P} = \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}}&lt;/math&gt;

Its [[SI]] derived unit is the [[henry (unit)|henry]] (the same as the unit of [[inductance]], although the two concepts are distinct).

==Microscopic origins of reluctance==

The reluctance of a magnetically uniform magnetic circuit element can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R} = \frac{l}{\mu A}&lt;/math&gt;

where 
:''l'' is the length of the element in [[metre]]s
:''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mu \;=\; \mu_r\mu_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] of the material (''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mu_r&lt;/math&gt;'' is the relative permeability of the material (dimensionless), and ''&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mu_0&lt;/math&gt;'' is the permeability of free space)
:''A'' is the cross-sectional area of the circuit in [[square metre]]s

This is similar to the equation for electrical resistance in materials, with permeability being analogous to conductivity; the reciprocal of the permeability is known as magnetic reluctivity and is analogous to resistivity.  Longer, thinner geometries with low permeabilities lead to higher reluctance.  Low reluctance, like low resistance in electric circuits, is generally preferred.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Summary of analogy between magnetic circuits and electrical circuits==

The following table summarizes the mathematical analogy between electrical circuit theory and magnetic circuit theory.  This is mathematical analogy and not a physical one. Objects in the same row have the same mathematical role; the physics of the two theories are very different.  For example, current is the flow of electrical charge, while magnetic flux is '''not''' the flow of any quantity.

==Limitations of the analogy==
When using the analogy between magnetic circuits and electric circuits, the limitations of this analogy must be kept in mind.  Electric and magnetic circuits are only superficially similar because of the similarity between Hopkinson's law and Ohm's law. Magnetic circuits have significant differences, which must be taken into account in their construction: 
*Electric currents represent the flow of particles (electrons) and carry [[Power (physics)|power]], part  or all of which is dissipated as heat in resistances.  Magnetic fields don't represent a "flow" of anything, and no power is dissipated in reluctances. 
*The current in typical electric circuits is confined to the circuit, with very little "leakage".  In typical magnetic circuits not all of the magnetic field is confined to the magnetic circuit because magnetic permeability also exists outside materials (see [[vacuum permeability]]). Thus, there may be significant "[[leakage flux]]" in the space outside the magnetic cores, which must be taken into account but often difficult to calculate.
*Most importantly, magnetic circuits are [[Nonlinear element|nonlinear]]; the reluctance in a magnetic circuit is not constant, as resistance is, but varies depending on the magnetic field.  At high magnetic fluxes the [[ferromagnetic materials]] used for the cores of magnetic circuits [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturate]], limiting further increase of the magnetic flux through, so above this level the reluctance increases rapidly.  In addition, ferromagnetic materials suffer from [[hysteresis]] so the flux in them depends not just on the instantaneous MMF but also on the history of MMF.  After the source of the magnetic flux is turned off, [[remanent magnetism]] is left in ferromagnetic materials, creating flux with no MMF.

==Circuit laws==
[[File:Magnetischer Kreis.svg|thumb|Magnetic circuit]]
Magnetic circuits obey other laws that are similar to electrical circuit laws. For example, the total reluctance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{R}_T&lt;/math&gt; of reluctances &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{R}_1,\ \mathcal{R}_2,\ \dots&lt;/math&gt; in series is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_T = \mathcal{R}_1 + \mathcal{R}_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

This also follows from [[Ampère's law]] and is analogous to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's voltage law]] for adding resistances in series. Also, the sum of magnetic fluxes &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \Phi_1,\ \Phi_2,\ \dots&lt;/math&gt; into any node is always zero:
:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_1 + \Phi_2 + \cdots = 0&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from [[Gauss's law for magnetism|Gauss's law]] and is analogous to [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]] for analyzing electrical circuits.

Together, the three laws above form a complete system for analysing magnetic circuits, in a manner similar to electric circuits. Comparing the two types of circuits shows that:
* The equivalent to resistance ''R'' is the ''reluctance'' &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{R}_m&lt;/math&gt;
* The equivalent to current ''I'' is the ''magnetic flux'' ''Φ''
* The equivalent to voltage ''V'' is the ''magnetomotive Force'' ''F''

Magnetic circuits can be solved for the flux in each branch by application of the magnetic equivalent of [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's Voltage Law]] ([[KVL]]) for pure source/resistance circuits. Specifically, whereas KVL states that the voltage excitation applied to a loop is equal to the sum of the voltage drops (resistance times current) around the loop, the magnetic analogue states that the magnetomotive force (achieved from ampere-turn excitation) is equal to the sum of MMF drops (product of flux and reluctance) across the rest of the loop. (If there are multiple loops, the current in each branch can be solved through a matrix equation—much as a matrix solution for mesh circuit branch currents is obtained in loop analysis—after which the individual branch currents are obtained by adding and/or subtracting the constituent [[loop current]]s as indicated by the adopted sign convention and loop orientations.)  Per [[Ampère's law]], the excitation is the product of the current and the number of complete loops made and is measured in ampere-turns. Stated more generally:

&lt;math&gt;F = N\,I = \oint \vec{H} \cdot \operatorname{d}\vec{l}&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that, per Stokes's theorem, the closed [[line integral]] of H·dl around a contour is equal to the open [[surface integral]] of curl H·dA across the surface bounded by the closed contour. Since, from [[Maxwell's equations]], [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] H = J, the closed line integral of H·dl evaluates to the total current passing through the surface. This is equal to the excitation, NI, which also measures current passing through the surface, thereby verifying that the net current flow through a surface is zero ampere-turns in a closed system that conserves energy.)

More complex magnetic systems, where the flux is not confined to a simple loop, must be analysed from first principles by using [[Maxwell's equations]].

==Applications==
*Air gaps can be created in the cores of certain transformers to reduce the effects of [[Saturation (magnetic)|saturation]]. This increases the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, and enables it to store more [[energy]] before core saturation. This effect is used in the [[flyback transformer]]s of cathode-ray tube video displays and in some types of [[Switched-mode power supply|switch-mode power supply]].
*Variation of reluctance is the principle behind the [[reluctance motor]] (or the variable reluctance generator) and the [[Alexanderson alternator]].
*[[Multimedia]] [[loudspeaker]]s are typically shielded magnetically, in order to reduce magnetic interference caused to [[television]]s and other [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]s.  The speaker magnet is covered with a material such as [[soft iron]] to minimize the stray magnetic field.

Reluctance can also be applied to variable reluctance (magnetic) [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]].

'''''Marching Men''''' is a 1917 novel by American author [[Sherwood Anderson]]. Published by [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]], the novel is Anderson's second book; the first being the 1916 novel ''[[Windy McPherson's Son]]''. ''Marching Men'' is the story of Norman "Beaut" McGregor, a young man discontented with the powerlessness and lack of personal ambition among the miners of his hometown. After moving to Chicago he discovers his purpose is to empower workers by having them march in unison. Major themes of the novel include the organization of laborers, eradication of disorder, and the role of the exceptional man in society. The latter theme led  post-World War II critics to compare Anderson's militaristic approach to homosocial order and the fascists of the War's [[Axis powers]].

''Marching Men'' was written as a hobby project while Sherwood Anderson was still working in advertising. A combination of a small first run,  mediocre reviews, and poor sales, convinced Anderson's publisher not to give ''Marching Men'' a second run. The novel has since been reprinted several times by other publishers including a 1927 Russian translation, yet is generally forgotten by the reading public except as a step in the development of its author.&lt;ref name="Dunne42"&gt;Dunne (2001), 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==
Like ''Windy McPherson's Son'', Sherwood Anderson wrote his second novel while he worked as an advertising copywriter in [[Elyria, Ohio]] between 1906 and 1913, several years before he published his first literary writing and a decade before he became an established writer.&lt;ref&gt;White (1972), xvii&lt;/ref&gt; At least part of ''Marching Men'' was written in an attic room of Anderson's Elyria home, which he set up to escape familial demands and focus on writing. Though the author later claimed that he had written his first novels in secret, Anderson's secretary remembers typing the manuscript on company time "around 1911 or 1912".&lt;ref&gt;White (1972), xii–xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspiration for ''Marching Men'' came in part from the author's time as a laborer in Chicago between 1900 and 1906 (where he, like his protagonist, worked in a warehouse, went to night school, was robbed, and fell in love several times) and his service in the [[Spanish–American War]] which took place towards the end of the war and just after the armistice in 1898–99.&lt;ref&gt;White (1972), xv–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Whalan 2007 64 65"&gt;Whalan (2007), 64–65&lt;/ref&gt; Of the latter, Anderson wrote in his ''Memoirs'' about the time he had been marching and got a rock in his shoe. After separating from his fellow soldiers to remove it, he observed them and recalled "I had become a giant.&amp;nbsp;... I was, in myself, something huge, terrible and at the same time noble. I remember that I sat, for a long time, while the army passed, opening and closing my eyes".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1969), 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with his later reading of works by [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Mark Twain]], and possibly [[Jack London]],&lt;ref name="Burbank40"&gt;Burbank (1966), 40&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson had inspiration for ''Marching Men'' that was both experiential and literary.

==Plot summary==

===Books I–II===
The novel begins with the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor packaging a loaf of bread for his uncle, the "village wit",&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 10&lt;/ref&gt; – who ironically nicknames him "Beaut" because of his off-putting appearance – in his mother Nance's [[Mahanoy Creek|Coal Creek]] bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father "Cracked" McGregor).  Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting bread on credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work and the young man gets a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] up to that point) blind drunk with a "horrible mess" made just for that purpose. Having reached a [[breaking point (psychology)|breaking point]], Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the [[World's Columbian Exposition|1893 World's Fair]]. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely [[Hatmaking|milliner]]/shop owner, with whom he develops a [[Platonic love|platonic relationship]].

===Books III–IV===
Book III begins with Beaut returning to Coal Creek for his mother's funeral. During the funeral procession, the miners who attend fall spontaneously into step and Beaut is once-again inspired by the power of marching men. Back in Chicago, Edith Carson, who had gained a modicum of wealth through her shrewd business dealings, loans McGregor the money necessary for him to quit working full-time and attend school to become a lawyer, his long-time ambition. Not long after McGregor is admitted to the bar, the son of a wealthy industrialist is found murdered. In order to quell newspaper speculation as to their involvement, the political bosses decide to redirect the media's attention by framing and demonizing small-time thief Andy Brown, an acquaintance of McGregor. From jail, Brown requests that McGregor act as his lawyer. Though McGregor refuses at first, he ends up with the job. After an unsuccessful solo investigation, McGregor turns to wealthy heiress-turned-[[settlement house]]-volunteer, Margaret Ormsby, for help. Margaret, a "new woman"&lt;ref name="Ditsky 1977 111"&gt;Ditsky (1977), 111&lt;/ref&gt; who dresses fashionably, is self-assured in demeanor, and is capable of acting independently is bothered by McGregor's bluntness, but decides to aid him nevertheless. On a tip from Edith Carson, and with Ormsby's connections, McGregor is able to clear Andy Brown of any wrongdoing. In the interim, Margaret Ormsby and McGregor develop a romance.

===Books V–VII===
While McGregor is slowly building up his idea of marching men (his law practice on the backburner), he decides that he wants to marry Margaret Ormsby. As he is leaving a formal party at her family's mansion, McGregor asks Margaret to marry him, but gets nervous and flees before she can respond. A few weeks later, McGregor falls asleep at the house of Edith Carson and wakes up with her stroking his hair. Realizing that their relationship is more intimate then he had thought, he goes to Margaret and reveals his past experiences with women. Margaret hears McGregor's confession and declares that she will still marry him, but first, she must go talk to Edith. A few weeks later, when McGregor is in the neighborhood for a [[Teamster|teamster's]] strike, he finds that Edith's shop had recently come under new ownership. Rushing to the train station, he finds Edith about to depart. Together, they go to the Ormsby house and in a confrontation Margaret cedes her claim over McGregor to Edith. As Edith and McGregor are leaving, Margaret's father, David, leader of a plow trust (nicknamed "Ormsby the Prince" by the City's [[oligarchy|oligarch]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 137&lt;/ref&gt; extends a hand to McGregor. The two men shake, the narrator noting their polite antagonism towards each other.

Soon, the marching men idea blooms with workers coming together and marching to and from work in the evenings. Becoming nervous over newspaper reports and rumors of the worker gatherings, several "men of affairs" discuss the matter. David Ormsby volunteers to dissuade to McGregor from further organizing but cannot communicate his point to the impassive McGregor. The marching men movement peaks during a demonstration on [[Labor Day]], climaxing with a speech by McGregor. Riding in a carriage with her father at the fringe of the demonstration, Margaret Ormsby is overcome by McGregor's oration, but later professes her allegiance to her father. The book ends that same night with a solitary David Ormsby, a foil to the stereotype of the ruthless businessman,&lt;ref name="Smith283"&gt;Smith (1959), 283&lt;/ref&gt; at his window overlooking the city, meditating on his life choices: "What if McGregor and his woman knew both roads? What if they, after looking deliberately along the road toward beauty and success in life, went, without regret, along the road to failure? What if McGregor and not myself knew the road to beauty?"&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Unity of workers===
As with Anderson's novels ''[[Poor White (novel)|Poor White]]'' (1920) and ''Beyond Desire'' (1932),&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 93&lt;/ref&gt; class struggle is a major theme in ''Marching Men''.&lt;ref name="Smith283" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hackett61"&gt;Hackett (1918), 61&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to it being dedicated "To American Workingmen", one critic placed ''Marching Men'' as part of a "proletarian trend" alongside [[Ernst Toller]]'s play ''Man and the Masses'' (1920).&lt;ref&gt;Calverton (1929), 391&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic noted the novel's plot shows "...&amp;nbsp;the inexorable clicking-into-place of a process of dialectic. It is Marxist reasoning, and imposes a vision of historical necessity upon its time".&lt;ref&gt;Ditsky (1977), 114&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek,&lt;ref&gt;Ditsky (1977), 104&lt;/ref&gt; to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 48-53&lt;/ref&gt; It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part of the funeral procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne (2005), 24 and 26&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 36&lt;/ref&gt; when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.&lt;ref name="Ditsky106"&gt;Ditsky (1977), 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the novel, the heretofore nascent power of the marching workers organized by McGregor is affirmed when the city's oligarchs deem it necessary to act against it.&lt;ref&gt;Ditsky (1977), 112-113&lt;/ref&gt; Though opposed to the oligarchs and their brand of ruthless capitalism, McGregor also rejects socialism, opting instead to act within the system as an individual with a "...&amp;nbsp;moral acknowledgement of social responsibility".&lt;ref&gt;Burbank (1966), 35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Order versus disorder===

|style="text-align: left;"| "The very soul of the Marching Men was a sense of order. That was the message of it, the thing that the world hasn't come up to yet. Men haven't learned that we must understand the impulse toward order, have that burned onto our consciousness, before we move on to other things."
|- 
|style="text-align: left;"|—Sherwood Anderson, ''Marching Men'' &lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 199&lt;/ref&gt; 
|}
In line with the McGregor's ideal of unified workers was a "quest" to make order from the chaos around him.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne (2005), 14&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout ''Marching Men'' distinctions between order and disorder are put forward both as ruminations of the narrator and as elements of the plot. Examples of comparisons in the plot begin early on when miners in disarray are compared with organized soldiers.&lt;ref name="Ditsky106" /&gt; Later, an unbridled Chicago is contrasted with McGregor's orderly routine.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 56&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the frustrated mass of job-seekers McGregor encounters upon his arrival to the city is seen against the neat groups of marching men that excite a young reporter in Book VI.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 182-185&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond plot points, phrases such as "In the heart of all men lies sleeping the love of order&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 48&lt;/ref&gt; and speaking of McGregor, "His body shook with the strength of his desire to end the vast disorder of life",&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 76&lt;/ref&gt; among others&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 73, 106, 108-109, 113, and others&lt;/ref&gt;  also work to set up the dichotomy of order and chaos.

Despite the repetition of this theme in the text, there is some discussion about its pervading influence. It is ironic, critic Clarence B. Lindsay posits, that while McGregor is busy organizing the marching men, he (as opposed to the narrator) all but ignores the chaos in the city he is constantly traversing.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay (1995), 21&lt;/ref&gt; On a larger scale, it is difficult to know whether Sherwood Anderson takes seriously the nostalgic notion of Civil War soldiers marching together as an inspiration for the McGregor's "aesthetic of power" or whether the exaggerated traits of McGregor are, in fact, ironic representations of the benefits of order.&lt;ref&gt;Ditsky (1977), 110&lt;/ref&gt; This view is furthered by Mark Whalan who likened Anderson's "imposition of order by masculine force" to the "masculine misogyny" of the [[Italian Futurists]] many of whom, unlike Anderson (who did not actually see combat during his military service), moved away from their glorification of violence after experiencing World War I.&lt;ref name="Whalan 2007 64 65"/&gt;

===The exceptional man===
From the book's opening chapter, the narrator of ''Marching Men'' portrayed McGregor as separate from those around him.&lt;ref&gt;Ditsky (1977), 103&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the novel McGregor is compared several times to "certain men, all soldiers or leaders of soldiers&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 86&lt;/ref&gt; that he reads about such as [[Nero]] and [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ditsky (1977), 102-103&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Anderson elevates his protagonist to the level of the "[[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emersonian]] [[Great Man theory|Great Man]] or [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzschean]] [[Übermensch|Supermen]]&amp;nbsp;... "&lt;ref name="Burbank40" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunne (2005), 14 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; making him the dream-object of women and envy of men from Coal Creek to Chicago. His size and strength, which is noted even during his teenage years&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1972), 19&lt;/ref&gt; is later joined by brains when he completes night school and becomes a lawyer.

To some critics McGregor's exceptionalism helps ''Marching Men'' read as a [[proletarian literature|proletarian novel]],&lt;ref&gt;Hackett (1918), 58&lt;/ref&gt; while others see in it an antecedent to the grotesqueness of the characters in Anderson's 1919 [[short story cycle]], ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]''.&lt;ref name="Ditsky 1977 111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dunne (2005), 29&lt;/ref&gt; To biographer John Earl Bassett, McGregor represents, in part, the author's disdain and fear for parts of modern American life, "...&amp;nbsp;that America will breed Beaut McGregors—talented, charismatic, romantic, cruel—who will use their powers to achieve frightening goals".&lt;ref&gt;Bassett (2005), 35&lt;/ref&gt; Combining the ideas of an exceptional leader and unified workers has raised questions among critics concerning the parallels between the "militaristic impulse" in ''Marching Men'' and the fascism of the WWII-era,&lt;ref&gt;Bassett (2005), 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1951), 85&lt;/ref&gt; a charge Anderson acknowledged in his posthumously-published ''Memoirs''.&lt;ref name="Burbank40" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whalan (2007), 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary significance and criticism==
Upon publication, reviews of ''Marching Men'' were moderate with a small number of reviewers taking strong negative stances. In one such  review, an anonymous critic from the ''New York Times Book Review'' noted that the beginning of the novel was "sufficiently well done to lead the reader to expect a novel of possibly a trifle more than average interest and average merit" but ultimately concludes that neither McGregor, "nor the book ever seems to get anywhere in particular".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;Anonymous (28 October 1917), 442&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers too did not hesitate to mention the novel's stunted character development&lt;ref name="Donlin275"&gt;Donlin (1917), 275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Webb"&gt;Webb (1917), 1372&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-climactic ending.&lt;ref name="NYTribune"&gt;Anonymous (27 October 1917), 9&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from these faults, several critics also commented on ''Marching Men'''s "deliberate vagueness",&lt;ref name="Nation404"&gt;Anonymous (11 October 1917), 404&lt;/ref&gt; calling the book a "generous if misty vision of the future".&lt;ref name="Boynton"&gt;Boynton (1917), 338&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the book's deficiencies, reviewers were practically unanimous in praising the realistic description and mood of Anderson's settings from Coal Creek&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; to Chicago.&lt;ref name="Donlin275" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTribune" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hackett (1918), 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; Within these settings, McGregor's scheme was acknowledged by the even-tempered ''New York Tribune'' reviewer as a "clever and original idea".&lt;ref name="NYTribune" /&gt; Others, like editor [[Francis Hackett]] wrote "Where ''Marching Men'' succeeds is in thrusting the greater American realities before us&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Hackett61" /&gt; to which critic George Bernard Donlin, in his ''[[The Dial|Dial]]'' review, adds "Mr. Anderson's book interested me chiefly as the expression of a vigorous and sincere mind&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="Donlin275" /&gt;

Written almost a decade before Sherwood Anderson established himself as a writer with the release of his 1919 [[short story cycle]], ''[[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', ''Marching Men'' is generally considered, along with ''Windy McPherson's Sons'' and two other unpublished novels,&lt;ref name="Bassett26"&gt;Bassett (2005), 26&lt;/ref&gt; as one of Anderson's "apprentice novels".&lt;ref&gt;Howe (1951), 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White (1966), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Viewed in hindsight, the shiftless plot and weak ending of ''Marching Men'' can be seen as a precursor to similar criticism in Anderson's later novels.&lt;ref name="Bassett26" /&gt;

==Publication history==

''Marching Men'' was the second book of Anderson's three-book contract with the publisher [[John Lane (publisher)|John Lane]] (the first being ''Windy McPherson's Son'' (1916) and the third being ''Mid-American Chants'', published in 1918).&lt;ref name="white-sales"&gt;White (1972), xv&lt;/ref&gt; A first edition of 2,500 copies was printed, but poor sales (around 1,000 copies)&lt;ref name="white-sales"&gt;White (1972), xv&lt;/ref&gt; kept the novel from being reprinted until [[B.W. Huebsch]] picked it up in 1921 following Anderson's success with ''Winesburg, Ohio'', novel ''Poor White'', and short story collection ''The Triumph of an Egg''.&lt;ref&gt;White (1994), xxv&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Press of [[Case Western Reserve University]] put out a critical edition of ''Marching Men'' with an introduction by noted Sherwood Anderson scholar Ray Lewis White which used as its basis Anderson's early manuscripts in addition to the John Lane/B.W. Huebsch version.&lt;ref&gt;See White (1972), xvii-xxvii, for an in-depth discussion of White's editorial philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; A Russian edition of ''Marching Men'' was published as ''V Nogu!'' (loosely translated, "In Step") (Leningrad: Mysl, 1927).&lt;ref&gt;"''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/nogu-marching-men-roman/oclc/55739928&amp;referer=brief_results V Nogu! (Marching men): roman]''".

'''Negative affectivity''' ('''NA'''), or '''negative affect''', is a personality variable that involves the experience of negative emotions and poor self-concept.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience negative aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 465–490 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative affectivity subsumes a variety of negative emotions, including [[anger]], [[contempt]], [[disgust]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[fear]],&lt;ref name=com&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Alex S.|author2=Forgas, Joseph P. |author3=Matovic, Diana |title=Can negative mood improve your conversation?

Low negative affectivity is characterized by frequent states of calmness and serenity, along with states of confidence, activeness, and great enthusiasm.

Maser (Eds.), Anxiety and the Anxiety disorders, (pp. 681-706), Hilssdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Trait negative affectivity roughly corresponds to the dominant personality factor of [[anxiety]]/[[neuroticism]] that is found within the [[Big Five personality traits]] as emotional stability.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jeronimus, B.F., Ormel, J., Aleman, A., Penninx, B.W.J.H., Riese, H.|journal=Psychological Medicine|year= 2013|volume=43|issue=11|pages=2403–15|title= Negative and positive life events are associated with small but lasting change in neuroticism| url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?aid=9030914|doi=10.1017/s0033291713000159|pmid=23410535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Big Five are characterized as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Neuroticism can plague an individual with severe mood swings, frequent sadness, worry, and being easily disturbed,&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellegen 1985"/&gt; and predicts the development and onset of all "common" [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="NeuroticismMA"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jeronimus, B.F., Kotov,  R., Riese, H., Ormel, J.| year = 2016 | title = Neuroticism's prospective association with mental disorders halves after adjustment for baseline symptoms and psychiatric history, but the adjusted association hardly decays with time: a meta-analysis on 59 longitudinal/prospective studies with 443 313 participants | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1–24 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291716001653 | doi=10.1017/S0033291716001653 | pmid=27523506 | volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that negative affectivity relates to different classes of variables: Self-reported [[stress (biological)|stress]] and (poor) coping skills,&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tessler | first1 = R. | last2 = Mechanic | first2 = D. | year = 1978 | title = Psychological distress and perceived health status | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 254–262 | doi=10.2307/2136558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wills | first1 = T.

People who express high negative affectivity view themselves and a variety of aspects of the world around them in generally negative terms.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984" /&gt; Negative affectivity is strongly related to [[subjective life satisfaction|life satisfaction]]. Individuals high in negative affect will exhibit, on average, higher levels of distress, anxiety, and dissatisfaction, and tend to focus on the unpleasant aspects of themselves, the world, the future, and other people, and also evoke more negative life events.&lt;ref name="Jeronimus2014"/&gt; The similarities between these affective traits and life satisfaction have led some researchers to view both positive and negative affect with life satisfaction as specific indicators of the broader construct of [[subjective well-being]].

Negative affect arousal mechanisms can induce negative affective states as evidenced by a study conducted by Stanley S. Seidner on negative arousal and white noise. The study quantified reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican participants in response to the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1991), Negative Affect Arousal Reactions from Mexican and Puerto Rican Respondents, Washington, D.C.: ERIC, ISBN ED346711 http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED346711&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED346711&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
There are many instruments that can be used to measure negative affectivity, including measures of related concepts, such as neuroticism and trait anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = 3| pages = 465–490 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two frequently used are:

'''[[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]]''' – [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|
The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule]] incorporates a 10-item negative affect scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=D.|author2=Clark, L. A. |author3=Tellegen, A. |title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1988|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|pmid=3397865}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PANAS-X is an expanded version of PANAS that incorporates negative affect subscales for  Fear, Sadness, Guilt, Hostility, and Shyness.

'''I-PANAS-SF''' – The International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short Form is an extensively validated brief, cross-culturally reliable 10-item version of the PANAS.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.R.|title=Development and validation of an internationally reliable short-form of the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS)|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|year=2007|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|url=http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/lit/Articles/ThompsonE2007a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative Affect items are Afraid, Ashamed, Hostile, Nervous and Upset. Internal consistency reliabilities between .72 and .76 are reported. The I-PANAS-SF was developed to eliminate redundant and ambiguous items and thereby derive an efficient measure for general use in research situations where either time or space are limited, or where international populations are of interest but where English may not be the mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Recent studies indicate that negative affect has important, beneficial impacts on cognition and behavior. These developments are a remarkable departure from past psychological research, which is characterized by a unilateral emphasis on the benefits of [[positive affect]].&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Don't Worry, Be Sad! On the Cognitive, Motivational, and Interpersonal Benefits of Negative Mood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–232|doi=10.1177/0963721412474458|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/3/225.full.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both states of affect influence mental processes and behavior.&lt;ref name=2ndary /&gt; Negative affect is regularly recognized as a "stable, heritable trait tendency to experience a broad range of negative feelings, such as worry, anxiety, self-criticisms, and a negative self-view". This allows one to feel every type of emotion, which is regarded as a normal part of life and human nature. So, while the emotions themselves are viewed as negative, the individual experiencing them should not be classified as a negative person or depressed. They are going through a normal process and are feeling something that many individuals may not be able to feel or process due to differing problems.

These findings complement [[evolutionary psychology]] theories that affective states serve adaptive functions in promoting suitable cognitive strategies to deal with environmental challenges.&lt;ref name=2ndary&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Cognitive Theories of Affect|journal=Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|date=30 January 2010|pages=1–3|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affect is associated with assimilative, top-down processing used in response to familiar, benign environments. Negative affect is connected with accommodative, bottom-up processing in response to unfamiliar, or problematic environments.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler&gt;{{cite book|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Affect in social thinking and behavior|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY, US|isbn=1-84169-454-1|pages=65–84|author2=Herbert Bless|edition=12|editor1=Klaus Fiedler|editor2=Joseph Forgas|accessdate=4 December 2013|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=psyh&amp;AN=2006-21670-004&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, positive affectivity promotes simplistic [[heuristic]] approaches that rely on preexisting knowledge and assumptions. Conversely, negative affectivity promotes controlled, analytic approaches that rely on externally drawn information.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt;

Benefits of negative affect are present in areas of cognition including [[perception]], [[judgment]], [[memory]] and interpersonal personal relations.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;&lt;ref name=2ndary /&gt; Since negative affect relies more on cautious processing than preexisting knowledge, people with negative affect tend to perform better in instances involving [[deception]], manipulation, [[impression formation]], and [[stereotyping]]. Negative affectivity's analytical and detailed processing of information leads to fewer reconstructive-memory errors, whereas positive mood relies on broader schematic to thematic information that ignores detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bless, H, Schawarz, N|first=ed. by Shelly Chaiken|title=Dual-process Theories in Social Psychology|year=1999|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=1-57230-421-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, information processing in negative moods reduces the [[misinformation effect]] and increases overall accuracy of details.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; People also exhibit less interfering responses to stimuli when given descriptions or performing any [[cognitive]] task.&lt;ref name=Seed&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=Don't Worry, Be Sad! On the Cognitive, Motivational, and Interpersonal Benefits of Negative Mood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2013|volume=22|issue=3|pages=225–232|doi=10.1177/0963721412474458|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/3/225.full.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judgment===
People are notoriously susceptible to forming inaccurate judgments based on [[biases]] and limited information. Evolutionary theories propose that negative affective states tend to increase skepticism and decrease reliance on preexisting knowledge.&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt; Consequently, judgmental accuracy is improved in areas such as [[impression formation]], reducing [[fundamental attribution error]], [[stereotyping]], and [[gullibility]].&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; While sadness is normally associated with the hippocampus, it does not produce the same side effects that would be associated with feelings of pleasure or excitement. Sadness correlates with feeling blue or the creation of tears, while excitement may cause a spike in blood pressure and one's pulse. As far as judgment goes, most people think about how they themselves feel about a certain situation. They will jump right to their current mood when asked a question. However, some mistake this process when using their current mood to justify a reaction to a stimulus. If you're sad, yet only a little bit, chances are your reactions and input will be negative as a whole.

====Impression formation====
First impressions are one of the most basic forms of judgments people make on a daily basis; yet judgment formation is a complex and fallible process. Negative affect is shown to decrease errors in forming impressions based on presuppositions.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; One common judgment error is the [[halo effect]], or the tendency to form unfounded impressions of people based on known but irrelevant information.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; For instance, more attractive people are often attributed with more positive qualities. Research demonstrates that positive affect tends to increase the halo effect, whereas negative affect decreases it.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=She just doesn't look like a philosopher…? Affective influences on the halo effect in impression formatio|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=812–817|doi=10.1002/ejsp.842|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=67365761&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study involving undergraduate students demonstrated a halo effect in identifying a middle-aged man as more likely to be a philosopher than an unconventional, young woman.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; These halo effects were nearly eliminated when participants were in a negative affective state. In the study, researchers sorted participants into either happy or sad groups using an autobiographical mood induction task in which participants reminisced on sad or happy memories.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; Then, participants read a philosophical essay by a fake academic who was identified as either a middle-aged, bespectacled man or as a young, unorthodox-looking woman. The fake writer was evaluated on intelligence and competence. The positive affect group exhibited a strong halo effect, rating the male writer significantly higher than the female writer in competence.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; The negative affect group exhibited almost no halo effects rating the two equally. Researchers concluded that impression formation is improved by negative affect.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt; Their findings support theories that negative affect results in more elaborate processing based upon external, available information.&lt;ref name="Forgas (2011)" /&gt;

====Fundamental attribution error====
The systematic, attentive approach caused by negative affect reduces [[fundamental attribution error]], the tendency to inaccurately attribute behavior to a person's internal character without taking external, situational factors into account.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=On being happy and mistaken: Mood effects on the fundamental attribution  error|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=75|issue=2|pages=318–331|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.318|pmid=9731311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph|title=She just doesn't look like a philosopher…? Affective influences on the halo effect in impression formation|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=41|issue=7|pages=812–817|doi=10.1002/ejsp.842}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental attribution error (FAE) is connected with positive affect since it occurs when people use top-down cognitive processing based on inferences. Negative affect stimulates bottom-up, systematic analysis that reduces fundamental attribution error.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt;

This effect is documented in FAE research in which students evaluated a fake debater on attitude and likability based on an essay the "debater" wrote.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt; After being sorted into positive or negative affect groups, participants read one of two possible essays arguing for one side or another on a highly controversial topic. Participants were informed that the debater was assigned a stance to take in the essay that did not necessarily reflect his views.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt;  Still, the positive affect groups rated debaters who argued unpopular views as holding the same attitude expressed in the essay. They were also rated as unlikeable compared to debaters with popular stances, thus, demonstrating FAE. In contrast, the data for the negative affect group displayed no significant difference in ratings for debaters with popular stance and debaters with unpopular stances.&lt;ref name="Forgas (1998) FAE" /&gt; These results indicate that positive affect assimilation styles promote fundamental attribution error, and negative affect accommodation styles minimize the error in respect to judging people.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

====Stereotyping====
Negative affect benefits judgment in diminishing the implicit use of stereotypes by promoting closer attention to stimuli.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;  In one study, participants were less likely to discriminate against targets that appeared Muslim when in a negative affective state.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unkelbach|first=Christian|author2=Joseph P. Forgas |author3=Thomas F. Denson |title=The turban effect: The influence of Muslim headgear and induced affect on aggressive responses in the shooter bias paradigm|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=44|pages=1409–1413|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; After organizing participants into positive and negative affect groups, researchers had them play a computer game. Participants had to make rapid decisions to shoot only at targets carrying a gun.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach/&gt; Some of the targets wore turbans making them appear Muslim. As expected, there was a significant bias against Muslim targets resulting in a tendency to shoot at them.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; However, this tendency decreased with subjects in negative affective states. Positive affect groups developed more aggressive tendencies toward Muslims.&lt;ref name=Unkelbach/&gt; Researchers concluded that negative affect leads to less reliance on internal stereotypes, thus decreasing judgmental bias.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

====Gullibility====
Multiple studies have shown that negative affectivity has a beneficial role in increasing skepticism and decreasing gullibility.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; Because negative affective states increase external analysis and attention to details, people in negative states are better able to detect deception.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bless&amp;Fiedler /&gt;

Researchers have presented findings in which students in negative affective states had improved lie detection compared to students in positive affective states.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhard|first=Marc-André|author2=Norbert Schwarz|title=The Influence of Affective States on the Process of Lie Detection|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied|year=2012|volume=18|issue=4|pages=377–389|doi= 10.1037/a0030466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study, students watched video clips of everyday people either lying or telling the truth. First, music was used to induce positive, negative, or neutral affect in participants.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt; Then, experimenters played 14 video messages that had to be identified by participants as true or false. As expected, the negative affect group performed better in veracity judgments than the positive affect group who performed no better than chance.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt; Researchers believe that the negative affect groups detected deception more successfully because they attended to stimulus details and systematically built inferences from those details.&lt;ref name="Reinhard&amp;Schwarz (2010)" /&gt;

===Memory===
Memory has been found to have many [[The Seven Sins of Memory|failures]] that effect the accuracy of recalled memories.&lt;ref name=textbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget Robinson-Riegler, Gregory|title=Cognitive psychology: Applying the Science of the mind|publisher=Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-03364-5|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been especially pragmatic in criminal settings as eyewitness memories have been found to be less reliable than one would hope. However, the externally focused and accommodative processing of negative affect has a positive effect on the overall improvement of memory. This evidenced by reduction of the misinformation effect and the number of false memories reported.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; The knowledge implies that negative affect can be used to enhance eyewitness memory;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Joseph P. Forgas |editor2=Klaus Fiedler |editor3=Constantine Sedikides |title=Social thinking and interpersonal behavior|year=2013|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-203-13967-7|pages=221–238|type=PDF|chapter=The upside of feeling down: The benefits of negative mood for social cognition and social behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, additional research suggests that the extent to which memory is improved by negative affect does not sufficiently improve eyewitness testimonies to significantly reduce its error.

====Misinformation effect====
Negative affect has been shown to decrease susceptibility of incorporating misleading information, which is related to the misinformation effect.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt; The '''misinformation effect''' refers to the finding that misleading information presented between the encoding of an event and its subsequent recall influences a witness's memory.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt; This corresponds to two types of memory failure:
:[[The Seven Sins of Memory|'''Suggestibility''']]: When recollections are influenced by the prodding or expectations of others creating [[Confabulation|false memories]].&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaPaglia|first=Jessica A.|author2=Wilford, Miko M. |author3=Rivard, Jillian R. |author4=Chan, Jason C. K. |author5= Fisher, Ronald P. |title=Misleading Suggestions can Alter Later Memory Reports even Following a Cognitive Interview|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|date=October 2013|doi=10.1002/acp.2950 |volume=28 |pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:[[Misattribution of memory|'''Misattribution''']]: When a witness gets confused and misattributes the misinformation to the original event. Also defined as the retroactive interference: When later information interferes with the ability to retain previously encoded information.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

=====In witness of events=====
Negative mood is shown to decrease suggestibility error. This is seen through reduced amounts of incorporation of false memories when misleading information is present. On the other hand, positive affect has shown to increase susceptibility to misleading information. An experiment with undergraduate students supported these results. Participants began the study in a lecture hall and witnessed what they thought was an unexpected five-minute belligerent encounter between an intruder and the lecturer. A week later, these participants watched a 10-minute-long video that generated either a positive, negative or neutral mood. They then completed a brief questionnaire about the previous incident between the intruder and lecturer that they witnessed the week earlier. In this questionnaire half of the participants received questions with misleading information and the other half received questions without any misleading information. This manipulation was used to determine if participants were susceptible to suggestibility failure. After 45 minutes of unrelated distractors participants were given a set of true or false questions which tested for false memories. Participants experiencing negative moods reported fewer numbers of false memories, whereas those experiencing positive moods reported a greater amount of false memories. This implies that positive affect promotes integration of misleading details and negative affect reduces the misinformation effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|author2=Laham, Simon M. |author3=Vargas, Patrick T. |title=Mood effects on eyewitness memory: Affective influences on susceptibility to misinformation|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=November 2005|volume=41|issue=6|pages=574–588|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=das&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Weiner|editor-first=Irving B.|title=Handbook of psychology|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781118133880|edition=2nd |type=Web|chapter=Affective Influences on Cognition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====In recall of past public events=====
People who experience negative affectivity following an event report fewer reconstructive false memories. This was evidenced by two studies conducted around public events. The first surrounded the events of the televised O.J. Simpson trial. Participants were asked to fill out questionnaires three times: one week, two months and a year after the televised verdict. These questionnaires measured participant emotion towards the verdict and the accuracy of their recalled memory of what occurred during the trial. Overall the study found that although participant response to the event outcome did not affect the quantity of remembered information, it did influence the likelihood of false memory. Participants who were pleased with the verdict of the O.J. Simpson trial were more likely to falsely believe something occurred during the trial than those who were displeased with the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Linda|author2=Bluck, Susan|title=Painting with broad strokes: Happiness and the malleability of event memory|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=June 2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=559–574|doi=10.1080/02699930341000446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=das2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Negative Emotion Enhances Memory Accuracy: Behavioral and Neuroimaging Evidence|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date= August 2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=213–218|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00506.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another experiment found the same findings with Red Sox fans and Yankees fans in their overall memory of events that occurred in the final game of a 2004 playoff series in which the Red Sox defeated the Yankees.&lt;ref name=das2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kensinger|first=Elizabeth A.|author2=Schacter, Daniel L.|title=When the Red Sox shocked the Yankees: Comparing negative and positive memories|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=5|pages=757–763|doi=10.3758/BF03193993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the Yankees fans had better memory of events that occurred than the Red Sox fans. The results from both of these experiments are consistent with the findings that negative emotion can lead to fewer memory errors and thus increased memory accuracy of events.&lt;ref name=das2 /&gt;

====Degree of enhanced memory====
Although negative affect has been shown to decrease the misinformation effect, the degree to which memory is improved is not enough to make a significant effect on witness testimony. In fact, emotions, including negative affect, are shown to reduce accuracy in identifying perpetrators from photographic lineups. Researchers demonstrated this effect in an experiment in which participants watched a video that induced either negative emotion or a neutral mood. The two videos were deliberately similar except for the action of interest, which was either a mugging (negative emotion) or a conversation (neutral emotion). After watching one of the two videos participants are shown perpetrator lineups, which either contained the target perpetrator from the video or a foil, a person that looked similar to the target. The results revealed that the participants who watched the emotion-induced video were more likely to incorrectly identify the innocent foil than to correctly identify the perpetrator. Neutral participants were more likely to correctly identify the perpetrator in comparison to their emotional counterparts. This demonstrates that emotional affect in forensic settings decreases accuracy of eyewitness memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houston|first=Kate A.|author2=Clifford, Brian R. |author3=Phillips, Louise H. |author4= Memon, Amina |title=The emotional eyewitness: The effects of emotion on specific aspects of eyewitness recall and recognition performance.|journal=Emotion|year=2013|volume=13|issue=1|pages=118–128|doi=10.1037/a0029220}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings are consistent with prior knowledge that stress and emotion greatly impair eyewitness ability to recognitive perpetrators.&lt;ref name=textbook /&gt;

===Interpersonal benefits===
Negative affectivity can produce several interpersonal benefits. It can cause subjects to be more polite and considerate with others. Unlike positive mood, which causes less assertive approaches, negative affectivity can, in many ways, cause a person to be more polite and elaborate when making requests.&lt;ref name=Seed /&gt;

Negative affectivity increases the accuracy of social perceptions and inferences. Specifically, high negative-affectivity people have more negative, but accurate, perceptions of the impression they make to others. People with low negative affectivity form overly-positive, potentially inaccurate impression of others that can lead to misplaced trust.&lt;ref name=per&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Jennifer D.|author2=Fehr, Beverley|title=Self-esteem and perceptions of conveyed impressions: Is negative affectivity associated with greater realism?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1990|volume=58|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.1.122|pmid=2308069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intergroup discrimination====
A research conducted by Forgas J.P studied how affectivity can influence intergroup discrimination. He measured affectivity by how people allocate rewards to [[in-group]] and [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-group]] members. In the procedure, participants had to describe their interpretations after looking at patterns of judgments about people. Afterwards, participants were exposed to a mood induction process, where they had to watch videotapes designed to elicit negative or positive affectivity. Results showed that participants with positive affectivity were more negative and discriminated more than participants with negative affectivity. Also, happy participants were more likely to discriminate between in-group and out-group members than sad participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|author2=Fiedler, Klaus|title=Us and them: Mood effects on intergroup discrimination.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=70|issue=1|pages=28–40|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.1.28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative affect is often associated with team selection. It is viewed as a trait that could make selecting individuals for a team irrelevant, thus preventing knowledge from becoming known or predicted for current issues that may arise.

====Communication====
Negative affectivity subconsciously signals a challenging social environment.
Negative mood may increase a tendency to conform to social norms.&lt;ref name="Watson &amp; Clark 1984"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watson | first1 = D. | last2 = Clark | first2 = L. A. | year = 1984 | title = Negative affectivity: The disposition to experience negative aversive emotional states | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 96 | issue = | pages = 465–490 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465 | pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study, college students where exposed to a mood induction process. After the mood induction process, participants were required to watch a show with positive and negative elements. After watching the show, they were asked to engage on a hypothetical conversation in which they "describe the episode (they) just observed to a friend". Their speech was recorded and transcribed during this task. Results showed that speakers in a negative mood had a better quality descriptions and greater amount of  information and details. These results show that negative mood can improve people's communication skills.&lt;ref name=com&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Alex S.|author2=Forgas, Joseph P. |author3=Matovic, Diana |title=Can negative mood improve your conversation? Affective influences on conforming to Grice's communication norms|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|date=August 2013|volume=43|issue=5|pages=326–334|doi=10.1002/ejsp.1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A negative mood is closely linked to better conversation because it makes use of the hippocampus and different regions of the brain.{{cn|date=October 2018}} When someone is upset, that individual may see or hear things differently than an individual who is very upbeat and happy all the time. The small details the negative individual picks up may be something completely overlooked before. Anxiety disorders are often associated with over-thinking and ruminating on topics that would seem irrelevant and pointless to an individual without a disorder. [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]] is one common anxiety trait that allows the affected individual a different insight on how things may appear to be. A person that makes use of his or her negative affect has a different view of the world and what goes on in it, thus making their conversations different and interesting to others.

====Self-disclosure====
Results of one study show that participants with negative affectivity were more careful with the information they shared with others, being more cautious with who they could trust or not. Researchers found that negative mood not only decreases intimacy levels but also increases caution in placing trust in others.&lt;ref name=self&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|title=Affective influences on self-disclosure: Mood effects on the intimacy and reciprocity of disclosing personal information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=449–461|doi=10.1037/a0021129|pmid=21171788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8218">The '''Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative''' ('''NMI''') was an initiative of the Effective Philanthropy Group of the [[Hewlett Foundation]] launched in 2006.&lt;ref name=guidestar&gt;{{cite web|url = http://trust.guidestar.org/2014/08/05/holden-karnofsky/|title = Dialogue about the Hewlett Foundation’s Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|last = Harold|first = Jacob|date = August 5, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2014/08/05/thoughts-on-the-end-of-hewletts-nonprofit-marketplace-initiative/|title = Thoughts on the End of Hewlett’s Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = August 5, 2014|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{cite web|url = https://philanthropy.com/article/Philanthropy-s-Results/153331|title = Hewlett Ends Effort to Get Donors to Make Dispassionate Choices on Giving|date = April 3, 2014|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hewlett-closure&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hewlett.org/blog/posts/follow-our-decision-end-nonprofit-marketplace-initiative|title = Follow-up on Our Decision to End the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|last = Twersky|first = Fay|date = April 4, 2014|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = [[Hewlett Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its closure was announced in the ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' in April 2014.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

== Origin ==

The NMI was started by the Effective Philanthropy Group at the [[Hewlett Foundation]] in 2006 with the goal that "by 2015, ten percent of individual philanthropic donations in the US (or $20 billion), would be influenced by meaningful, high-quality information about nonprofit organizations’ performance."&lt;ref name=guidestar/&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; Jacob Harold was the program officer responsible, and the Hewlett Foundation at the time was headed by [[Paul Brest]].

== Organizations funded ==

The NMI funded a number of [[charity evaluator]]s including:&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;

* [[GiveWell]], that was focused on finding the very best charities to donate to&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;
* [[Charity Navigator]]&lt;ref name=cn/&gt; and [[Guidestar]], that were focused more on rating large numbers of charities using clearly defined metrics
* [[Philanthropedia]], a platform for experts to rate charities
* [[GreatNonprofits]], a platform for people to share information about great charities

[[Holden Karnofsky]], co-founder and co-executive director of GiveWell, expressed gratitude to the NMI, saying that NMI's support of the organization was crucial in its first few years, when it was relatively unknown and the subject of unfavorable controversies. He also praised the NMI for their support despite differences in strategy and approach, and said that while the NMI often encouraged them to spread a wider net and collaborate more with other NMI grantees, they were never inappropriately pressured.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;

Ken Berger, President of [[Charity Navigator]], wrote a letter upon the closure of the NMI thanking the Hewlett Foundation for their generous support of Charity Navigator through their transition to version 3.0 of their product. Berger identified the Hewlett Foundation as the single biggest overall supporter of Charity Navigator.&lt;ref name=cn&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1734#.VmPejcoqRxU|title = President and CEO's Report for May 2014|date = May 6, 2014|accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==

In April 2014, an article the ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' announced that the Hewlett Foundation was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; The Hewlett Foundation's decision was based on an internal re-evaluation of the project, motivated by two external pieces of information:&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

* The Money For Good study conducted by Hope Consulting (paid for by the Hewlett Foundation) whose headline result was "few donors do research before they give, and those that do look to the nonprofit itself to provide simple information about efficiency and effectiveness."&lt;ref name=mfg&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hopeconsulting.us/work/money-for-good|title = Money for Good|publisher = Hope Consulting|accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2010/07/20/the-money-for-good-study/|title = The Money for Good study|last = Hassenfeld|first = Elie|date = July 20, 2010|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An external evaluation from Arabella Advisors whose results further convinced the Hewlett Foundation that their strategy was not working anywhere near as well as they hoped.&lt;ref name=hewlett-more&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hewlett.org/blog/posts/more-our-decision-end-nonprofit-marketplace-initiative|title = More on Our Decision to End the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|last = Wickline|first = Heath|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = [[Hewlett Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hewlett Foundation also had some significant personnel changes over the time period: Jacob Harold left the Hewlett Foundation for [[GuideStar]] and was replaced by Lindsay Louise, while [[Paul Brest]] was replaced by [[Larry Kramer (legal scholar)|Larry Kramer]] as President of the Hewlett Foundation. They said that these changes made it more logical for them to re-evaluate the strategy, but was not the reason for ending the program, since the external studies and evaluations that would lead to the program's cosure had been initiated under the previous staff.&lt;ref name=chronicle-more&gt;{{cite web|url = https://philanthropy.com/article/Hewlett-Foundation-Should-Be/153147|title = Hewlett Foundation Should Be More Open About Shuttered Program|last = Schambra|first = William|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hewlett-more/&gt;&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/interview-fay-twersky-hewlett-foundation/|title = Interview: Fay Twersky, Hewlett Foundation (£)|date = July 4, 2014|accessdate = December 6,  2015|publisher = ''Alliance magazine''|last = Hartnell|first = Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hewlett Foundation also clarified that even though they had failed to met their own goals with the NMI, the organizations they funded, such as [[GiveWell]], [[Charity Navigator]], and [[GuideStar]], had done a great job at meeting ''those organization's'' goals.&lt;ref name=hewlett-more/&gt;

Responding to the closure decision, [[Holden Karnofsky]] of [[GiveWell]] wrote that while the decision to shut down the program may have been the right one, GiveWell did not agree with the stated reasons for closure. Karnofsky argued that GiveWell's money moved in the years to come would alone more than justify the grand total of 12 million dollars spent on the NMI.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt; This would be validated in the years to come: in 2014, GiveWell moved $13.0 million to its top charities from donors ''excluding'' [[Good Ventures]], a multi-billion dollar foundation it works closely with.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.givewell.org/about/impact|title = Evaluating GiveWell's impact|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob Harold, the program officer formerly responsible for NMI, who had since left for [[GuideStar]], responded to Karnofsky's post, noting that the NMI's goals of reaching a large population were still worthwhile, and that its main problem may have been that it was too early for its time. Harold noted that he hoped to make the vision the NMI sought a reality through his work for GuideStar. He emphasized the importance of both quality and quantity, noting that GiveWell and the [[effective altruism]] movement it was part of might be too neglectful of the quantity goals that the NMI had.&lt;ref name=guidestar/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12319">An '''object of the mind''' is an [[object (philosophy)|object]] that [[Existence|exists]] in the imagination, but which, in the real world, can only be represented or modeled. Some such objects are [[abstraction]]s, [[literary]] [[concept]]s, or [[fictional]] [[scenario]]s.

Closely related are '''intentional objects''', which are what thoughts and feelings are [[intentionality|about]], even if they are not about anything real (such as thoughts 
about [[unicorn]]s, or feelings of apprehension about a dental appointment which is subsequently cancelled).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/cranetim/iWeb/Tim's%20website/Online%20papers_files/Intentional%20objects-1.pdf Tim Crane - ''Intentional Objects'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, intentional objects may coincide with real objects (as in thoughts about horses, or a feeling of regret about a missed appointment).

==Mathematical objects==
Mathematics and geometry describe [[abstract object]]s that sometimes correspond to familiar shapes, and sometimes do not. Circles, triangles, rectangles, and so forth describe two-dimensional shapes that are often found in the real world. However, mathematical formulas do not describe individual physical circles, triangles, or rectangles. They describe ideal shapes that are [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of the [[mind]]. The incredible precision of mathematical expression permits a vast applicability of mental abstractions to real life situations.

Many more mathematical formulas describe shapes that are unfamiliar, or do not necessarily correspond to objects in the real world. For example, the [[Klein bottle]]&lt;ref&gt;The Teaching Company, Course No. 1423. "Joy of Thinking: The Beauty and Power of Classical Mathematical Ideas." Lecture 14 - "A One-Sided, Sealed Surface - the Klein Bottle." Professors Edward B. Burger, Michael Starbird.&lt;/ref&gt; is a one-sided, sealed surface with no inside or outside (in other words, it is the three-dimensional equivalent of the [[Möbius strip]]). Such objects can be represented by twisting and cutting or taping pieces of paper together, as well as by computer simulations. To hold them in the imagination, abstractions such as extra or fewer dimensions are necessary.

==Logical sequences==
If-then arguments posit [[logical]] [[sequences]] that sometimes include objects of the mind. For example, a [[counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] argument proposes a [[hypothetical]] or [[subjunctive]] [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] which ''could'' or ''would'' be true, but ''might not'' be false. [[Conditional probability|Conditional]] sequences involving subjunctives use [[intensional logic|intensional]] language, which is studied by [[modal logic]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eom.springer.de/M/m064320.htm ''Modal Logic''. Springer Online Reference Works.]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[classical logic]] studies the [[extensional]] language of [[logical possibility|necessary]] and [[sufficient]] conditions.

In general, a logical [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] is a sufficient condition, and a logical [[consequent]] is a necessary condition(or the [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]) in a [[logical conditional]]. But logical conditionals accounting only for necessity and sufficiency do not always reflect every day if-then reasoning, and for this reason they are sometimes known as [[material conditional]]s. In contrast, [[indicative conditional]]s, sometimes known as non-material conditionals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facweb.bcc.ctc.edu/wpayne/non-material%20conditional.htm Payne, W. Russ ''The non-material conditional'']&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to describe if-then reasoning involving hypotheticals, fictions, or counterfactuals.

[[Truth tables]] for if-then statements identify four unique combinations of premises and conclusions: true premises and true conclusions; false premises and true conclusions; true premises and false conclusions; false premises and false conclusions. [[Strict conditional]]s assign a positive [[truth-value]] to every case except the case of a true premise and a false conclusion. This is sometimes regarded as counterintuitive, but makes more sense when false conditions are understood as objects of the mind.

===False antecedent===
A false antecedent is a premise known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or unnecessary. In a conditional sequence, a false antecedent may be the basis for any consequence, true or false.

The subjects of [[literature]] are sometimes false antecedents. For example, the contents of [[false documents]], the origins of [[wikt:stand-alone|stand-alone]] phenomena, or the implications of [[loaded words]]. Also, artificial sources, personalities, events, and histories. False antecedents are sometimes referred to as "[[nothing]]", or "[[nonexistent]]", whereas nonexistent referents are not referred to.

[[Art]] and [[acting]] often portray scenarios without any antecedent except an artist's imagination. For example, mythical heroes, legendary creatures, gods, and goddesses.

===False consequent===
A false consequent, in contrast, is a conclusion known to be false, fictional, imaginary, or insufficient. In a conditional statement, a fictional conclusion is known as a [[non sequitur (logic)|non sequitur]], which literally means ''out of sequence''. A conclusion that is out of sequence is not contingent on any premises that precede it, and it does not follow from them, so such a sequence is not conditional. A conditional sequence is a connected series of statements. A false consequent cannot follow from true premises in a connected sequence. But, on the other hand, a false consequent can follow from a false antecedent.

As an example, the name of a [[team]], a [[genre]], or a [[nation]] is a collective term applied [[ex post facto]] to a group of distinct individuals. None of the individuals on a sports team is the team itself, nor is any musical chord a genre, nor any person America. The name is an identity for a collection that is connected by [[consensus]] or [[reference]], but not by sequence. A different name could equally follow, but it would have different [[social]] or [[political]] [[meaning (semiotics)|significance]].

==Philosophy of mind==

{{main|Mind-body dualism}}

In philosophy, [[mind-body dualism]] is the doctrine that mental activities exist apart from the physical body, notably posited by [[René Descartes]] in ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.

==Invented sources==
{{main|False document}}
Many objects in fiction follow the example of false antecedents or false consequents. For example, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is based on an imaginary book. In the ''Appendices'' to ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien's characters name the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'' as the source material for ''The Lord of the Rings'', which they describe as a translation. But the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' is a fictional document that chronicles events in an [[imaginary world]]. One might imagine a different [[translation]], by another author.

==Convenient fictions==
{{see|Fictionalism}}
[[Social reality]] is composed of many standards and [[inventions]] that facilitate [[communication]], but which are ultimately objects of the mind. For example, [[money]] is an object of the mind which [[currency]] represents. Similarly, [[language]]s signify [[idea]]s and [[thoughts]].

Objects of the mind are frequently involved in the roles that people play. For example, [[acting]] is a profession which predicates real jobs on fictional premises. [[Charades]] is a game people play by guessing imaginary objects from short play-acts.

Imaginary [[personalities]] and histories are sometimes invented to enhance the [[verisimilitude]] of [[fictional universes]], and/or the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] of [[role-playing games]]. In the sense that they exist independently of extant personalities and histories, they are believed to be fictional characters and fictional time frames.

[[Science fiction]] is abundant with future times, alternate times, and past times that are objects of the mind. For example, in the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' by [[George Orwell]], the number 1984 represented a year that had not yet passed.

[[Calendar date]]s also represent objects of the mind, specifically, past and future times. In ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', which was released in 1986, the narration opens with the statement, "It is the year 2005." In 1986, that statement was futuristic. During the year 2005, that reference to the year 2005 was factual. Now, ''The Transformers: The Movie'' is [[retro-futuristic]]. The number 2005 did not change, but the object of the mind that it represents did change.

Deliberate [[invention]] also may reference an object of the mind. The intentional invention of fiction for the purpose of [[deception]] is usually referred to as [[lie|lying]], in contrast to invention for [[entertainment]] or [[art]]. Invention is also often applied to [[problem solving]]. In this sense the physical invention of materials is associated with the [[mind|mental]] invention of fictions.

Convenient fictions also occur in science.

==Science==
The theoretical posits of one era's scientific theories may be demoted to mere '''objects of the mind''' by subsequent discoveries: some standard examples include [[phlogiston]] and [[ptolemaic epicycle]]s.

This raises questions, in the debate between [[scientific realism]] and [[instrumentalism]] about the status of current posits, such as [[black hole]]s and [[quark]]s. Are they still merely intentional, even if the theory is correct?

The situation is further complicated by the existence in scientific practice of entities which are explicitly held not to be real, but which nonetheless serve a purpose—convenient fictions. Examples include [[field line|field lines]], [[centers of gravity]], and [[electron hole]]s in semiconductor theory.

==Self-reference==
{{Original research|section|date=September 2007}}
A [[reference]] that names an imaginary [[source text|source]] is in some sense also a [[self-reference]]. A self-reference automatically makes a comment about itself. Premises that name themselves as premises are premises by self-reference; conclusions that name themselves as conclusions are conclusions by self-reference.

In their respective [[imaginary world]]s the ''Necronomicon'', ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', and the ''Red Book of Westmarch'' are realities, but only because they are referred to as real. Authors use this technique to invite readers to [[roleplaying|pretend]] or to make-believe that their imaginary world is real. In the sense that the stories that quote these books are true, the quoted books exist; in the sense that the stories are fiction, the quoted books do not exist.

==Nonexistent objects==
Austrian philosopher [[Alexius Meinong]] (1853–1920) advanced nonexistent objects in the 19th and 20th century within a “theory of objects”. He was interested in intentional states which are directed at nonexistent objects.  Starting with the “principle of intentionality”,  mental phenomena are intentionally directed towards an object.  People may imagine, desire or fear something that does not exist.  Other philosophers concluded that intentionality is not a real relation and therefore does not require the existence of an object, while Meinong concluded there is an object for every mental state whatsoever—if not an existent then at least a nonexistent one.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Nonexistent Objects, First published Tue Aug 22, 2006; substantive revision Thu Sep 7, 2006, Accessed May 18, 2010 [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/#HisRooAleMeiProInt]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orthogenesis''', also known as '''orthogenetic evolution''', '''progressive evolution''', '''evolutionary progress''', or '''progressionism''', is the biological [[hypothesis]] that [[organism]]s have an innate tendency to [[evolution|evolve]] in a definite direction [[teleology|towards some goal (teleology)]] due to some internal mechanism or "driving force".{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1988 |title=Toward a New Philosophy of Biology: Observations of an Evolutionist |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=499 |isbn=0-674-89666-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} According to the theory, the [[largest-scale trends in evolution]] have an absolute goal such as [[Evolution of biological complexity|increasing biological complexity]]. Prominent historical figures who have championed some form of evolutionary progress include [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[Teilhard de Chardin|Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], and [[Henri Bergson]].

The term ''orthogenesis'' was introduced by [[Wilhelm Haacke]] in 1893 and popularized by [[Theodor Eimer]] five years later. Proponents of orthogenesis had rejected the theory of [[natural selection]] as the organizing mechanism in [[evolution]] for a rectilinear model of directed evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ulett, Mark A. |date=2014 |title=Making the case for orthogenesis: The popularization of definitely directed evolution (1890–1926) |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |volume=45 |pages=124–132 |doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2013.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], in which [[genetics]] was integrated with evolution, orthogenesis and other [[alternatives to Darwinism]] were largely abandoned by biologists, but the notion that evolution represents progress is still widely shared. The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] made the term effectively taboo in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1948, by stating that it implied "some supernatural force".{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}&lt;ref name=Mayr1948&gt;Letter from [[Ernst Mayr]] to R. H. Flower, ''Evolution'' papers, 23 January 1948&lt;/ref&gt; The American paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1953) attacked orthogenesis, linking it with [[vitalism]] by describing it as "the mysterious inner force".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |date=1953 |title=Life of the Past: An Introduction to Paleontology |publisher=Yale University Press |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern supporters include [[E. O. Wilson]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]], while museum displays and textbook illustrations continue to give the impression of progress in evolution.

The philosopher of biology [[Michael Ruse]] notes that in popular culture evolution and progress are synonyms, while the unintentionally misleading image of the ''[[March of Progress]]'', from apes to modern humans, has been widely imitated.

{{further|Teleology in biology}}

The term orthogenesis (from Ancient Greek ὀρθός orthós, "straight", and γένεσις génesis, "origin") was first used by the biologist [[Wilhelm Haacke]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=LevitOlsson2006/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould 2002"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=2002 |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=351–352 |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodor Eimer]] was the first to give the word a definition; he defined orthogenesis as "the general law according to which evolutionary development takes place in a noticeable direction, above all in specialized groups".&lt;ref name="Lane 1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lane, David H. |date=1996 |title=The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age |publisher=Mercer University Press |pages=60–64 |isbn=0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the zoologist [[Michael F. Guyer]] wrote:

{{quote|[Orthogenesis] has meant many different things to many different people, ranging from a mystical [[inner perfecting principle]], to merely a general trend in development due to the natural constitutional restrictions of the germinal materials, or to the physical limitations imposed by a narrow environment. In most modern statements of the theory, the idea of continuous and progressive change in one or more characters, due according to some to internal factors, according to others to external causes-evolution in a "straight line" seems to be the central idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guyer, Michael F. |date=1922 |jstor=2456504 |title=Orthogenesis and Serological Phenomena |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=56 |issue=643 |pages=116–133 |doi=10.1086/279852}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Susan R. Schrepfer in 1983:

{{quote|Orthogenesis meant literally "straight origins", or "straight line evolution". The term varied in meaning from the overtly vitalistic and theological to the mechanical. It ranged from theories of mystical forces to mere descriptions of a general trend in development due to natural limitations of either the germinal material or the environment&amp;nbsp;... By 1910, however most who subscribed to orthogenesis hypothesized some physical rather than metaphysical determinant of orderly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schrepfer, Susan R. |date=1983 |title=Fight to Save the Redwoods: A History of the Environmental Reform, 1917–1978 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |pages=81–82 |isbn=978-0-299-08854-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1988, [[Francisco J. Ayala]] defined progress as "systematic change in a feature belonging to all the members of a sequence in such a way that posterior members of the sequence exhibit an improvement of that feature". He argued that there are two elements in this definition, directional change and improvement according to some standard. Whether a directional change constitutes an improvement is not a scientific question; therefore Ayala suggested that science should focus on the question of whether there is directional change, without regard to whether the change is "improvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |year=1988 |title=Can progress be defined as a biological concept? |work=Evolutionary Progress |editor=Nitecki, M. |pages=75–96 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-58693-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be compared to [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s suggestion of "replacing the idea of progress with an operational notion of directionality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=1997 |title=Full House: The Spread of Excellence from Plato to Darwin |publisher=Harmony |isbn=0-609-80140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Peter J. Bowler]] defined orthogenesis as:

{{quote|Literally, the term means evolution in a straight line, generally assumed to be evolution that is held to a regular course by forces internal to the organism. Orthogenesis assumes that variation is not random but is directed [[Teleology in biology|towards fixed goals]]. Selection is thus powerless, and the species is carried automatically in the direction marked out by internal factors controlling variation.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}}}}

In 1996, [[Michael Ruse]] defined orthogenesis as "the view that evolution has a kind of momentum of its own that carries organisms along certain tracks".{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=261}}

==History==
[[File:Die Leiter des Auf- und Abstiegs.jpg|thumb|upright|The mediaeval [[great chain of being]] as a staircase, implying the possibility of progress:{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}} [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305]]

===Mediaeval===
The possibility of progress is embedded in the mediaeval [[great chain of being]], with a linear sequence of forms from lowest to highest. The concept, indeed, had its roots in [[Aristotle's biology]], from insects that produced only a grub, to fish that laid eggs, and on up to animals with blood and live birth. The mediaeval chain, as in [[Ramon Lull]]'s ''Ladder of Ascent and Descent of the Mind'', 1305, added steps or levels above humans, with orders of angels reaching up to God at the top.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=21–23}}

===Pre-Darwinian===
The orthogenesis hypothesis had a significant following in the 19th century when evolutionary mechanisms such as [[Lamarckism]] were being proposed. The French zoologist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) himself accepted the idea, and it had a central role in his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, the hypothesized mechanism of which resembled the "mysterious inner force" of orthogenesis.&lt;ref name="Gould 2001"/&gt; Orthogenesis was particularly accepted by paleontologists who saw in their fossils a directional change, and in [[invertebrate paleontology]] thought there was a gradual and constant directional change.  Those who accepted orthogenesis in this way, however, did not necessarily accept that the mechanism that drove orthogenesis was [[teleology|teleological]] (had a definite goal). [[Charles Darwin]] himself rarely used the term "evolution" now so commonly used to describe his theory, because the term was strongly associated with orthogenesis, as had been common usage since at least 1647.&lt;ref name=Gould1977&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=1977 |url=http://wordorigins.org/wordore.htm |title=Darwin's Dilemma: The Odyssey of Evolution |work=Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History |publisher=[[W.

Ruse observed that "Progress ''(sic, his capitalisation)'' became essentially a nineteenth-century belief. It gave meaning to life—it offered inspiration—after the collapse [with [[Malthus]]'s pessimism and the shock of the [[French revolution]]] of the foundations of the past."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=29}}
The Russian biologist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] (1792–1876) argued for an orthogenetic force in nature, reasoning in a review of Darwin's 1859 ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' that "Forces which are not directed—so-called blind forces—can never produce order."&lt;ref name=Brown2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Keven|last2=Von Kitzing|first2=Eberhard|title=Evolution and Bahá'í Belief: ʻAbduʼl-Bahá's Response to Nineteenth-century Darwinism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=egDAfpkONRsC&amp;pg=PA159|year=2001|publisher=Kalimat Press|isbn=978-1-890688-08-0|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Barbieri, Marcello |date=2013 |title=Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |page=7 |isbn=978-1-60021-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jacobsen, Eric Paul |date=2005 |title=From Cosmology to Ecology: The Monist World-view in Germany from 1770 to 1930 |page=100 |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=978-0-8204-7231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1864, the Swiss anatomist [[Albert von Kölliker]] (1817–1905) presented his orthogenetic theory, ''[[heterogenesis]]'', arguing for wholly separate lines of descent with no common ancestor.&lt;ref name=Vucinich1988&gt;{{cite book |author=Vucinich, Alexander |date=1988 |title=Darwin in Russian Thought |publisher=University of California Press |page=137 |isbn=978-0-520-06283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1884, the Swiss botanist [[Carl Nägeli]] (1817–1891) proposed a version of orthogenesis involving an "inner perfecting principle". [[Gregor Mendel]] died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an "[[idioplasm]]" transmitted inherited characteristics, dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics.&lt;ref name=Mawer2006&gt;{{cite book |author=Mawer, Simon |authorlink=Simon Mawer |title=Gregor Mendel: planting the seeds of genetics |date=2006 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |isbn= 978-0-8109-5748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nägeli many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed. {{sfn|Bowler|1989|pages=268–270}} [[Charles Darwin]] saw this as a serious challenge, replying that "There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual difference", but was unable to provide a specific answer without knowledge of genetics. Further, Darwin was himself somewhat progressionist, believing for example that "Man" was "higher" than the [[barnacle]]s he studied.&lt;ref name=WatsonAngle&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson|first1=Marc |last2=Angle|first2=Barbara |title=Man's Selection: Charles Darwin's Theory of Creation, Evolution, And Intelligent Design |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4lVGDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT149 |year=2017 |publisher=BookBaby |isbn=978-1-936883-14-1 |pages=146–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pp=154–155, 162}}

{{quote|The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, insofar, higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed.

In 1898, after studying [[butterfly]] coloration, [[Theodor Eimer&lt;!--mild overlink, seems helpful here--&gt;]] (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, ''On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation''.

He used examples such as the [[evolution]] of the [[horse]] to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a [[materialist]] who rejected any [[vitalist]] or [[teleological]] approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new [[species]].&lt;ref name=Gould2002&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |date=2002 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=355–364 |isbn=978-0-674-00613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nineteenth and twentieth century===
{{see|Eclipse of Darwinism}}

Numerous versions of orthogenesis (see table) have been proposed. Debate centred on whether such theories were scientific, or whether orthogenesis was inherently vitalistic or essentially theological.&lt;ref name=Simpson1964/&gt; For example, biologists such as Maynard M. Metcalf (1914), [[John Merle Coulter]] (1915), [[David Starr Jordan]] (1920) and Charles B. Lipman (1922) claimed evidence for orthogenesis in [[bacteria]], [[fish]] populations and [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Metcalf Maynard M | year = 1913 | title = Adaptation Through Natural Selection and Orthogenesis | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 47 | issue = 554| pages = 65–71 | jstor=2455865 | doi=10.1086/279329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Merle Coulter]].

In 1950, the German paleontologist [[Otto Schindewolf]] argued that variation tends to move in a predetermined direction. He believed this was purely mechanistic, denying any kind of [[vitalism]], but that evolution occurs due to a periodic cycle of evolutionary processes dictated by factors internal to the organism.&lt;ref name=Kwa2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Kwa, Chunglin |date=2011 |title=Styles of Knowing: A New History of Science from Ancient Times to the Present |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=237 |isbn=978-0-8229-6151-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dimichele William A | year = 1995 | title = Basic Questions in Paleontology: Geologic Time, Organic Evolution, and Biological Systematics, by Otto H.

[[File:Alternatives to Darwinism.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|Multiple explanations have been offered]] since the 19th century for how evolution took place, given that many scientists initially had objections to natural selection. Many of these theories led (solid blue arrows) to some form of orthogenesis, with or without invoking [[theistic evolution|divine control]] (dotted blue arrows) directly or indirectly. For example, evolutionists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] believed in a combination of theistic evolution, Lamarckism, vitalism, and orthogenesis,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261-262}} represented by a sequence of arrows on the left of the diagram. The development of modern Darwinism is indicated by dashed orange arrows.]]

The various [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|alternatives to Darwinian evolution]] by natural selection were not necessarily mutually exclusive. The evolutionary philosophy of the American palaeontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope]] is a case in point. Cope, a religious man, began his career denying the possibility of evolution. In the 1860s, he accepted that evolution could occur, but, influenced by Agassiz, rejected natural selection. Cope accepted instead the theory of recapitulation of evolutionary history during the growth of the embryo - that [[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]], which Agassiz believed showed a divine plan leading straight up to man, in a pattern revealed both in [[embryology]] and [[palaeontology]]. Cope did not go so far, seeing that evolution created a branching tree of forms, as Darwin had suggested. Each evolutionary step was however non-random: the direction was determined in advance and had a regular pattern (orthogenesis), and steps were not adaptive but part of a divine plan (theistic evolution). This left unanswered the question of why each step should occur, and Cope switched his theory to accommodate functional adaptation for each change. Still rejecting natural selection as the cause of adaptation, Cope turned to Lamarckism to provide the force guiding evolution. Finally, Cope supposed that Lamarckian use and disuse operated by causing a vitalist growth-force substance, "bathmism", to be concentrated in the areas of the body being most intensively used; in turn, it made these areas develop at the expense of the rest. Cope's complex set of beliefs thus assembled five evolutionary philosophies: recapitulationism, orthogenesis, theistic evolution, Lamarckism, and vitalism.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=261-262}} Other palaeontologists and field naturalists continued to hold beliefs combining orthogenesis and Lamarckism until the modern synthesis in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowler|1989|p=264}}

The stronger versions of the orthogenetic hypothesis began to lose popularity when it became clear that they were inconsistent with the patterns found by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] in the [[fossil record]], which were non-rectilinear (richly branching) with many complications. The hypothesis was abandoned by the mainstream of evolutionists when no mechanism could be found that would account for the process, and the theory of evolution by natural selection came to prevail.&lt;ref name=Mayr1982&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst |date=1982 |title=The Growth of Biological Thought: Diversity, Evolution, and Inheritance |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=530–531 |isbn=0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian of biology Edward J. Larson commented that

{{quote|At theoretical and philosophical levels, Lamarckism and orthogenesis seemed to solve too many problems to be dismissed out of hand—yet biologists could never reliably document them happening in nature or in the laboratory.

The [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the [[genetics|genetic]] mechanisms of evolution were incorporated, appeared to refute the hypothesis for good. As more was understood about these mechanisms it came to be held that there was no naturalistic way in which the newly discovered mechanism of [[heredity]] could be far-sighted or have a memory of past trends. Orthogenesis was seen to lie outside the [[methodological naturalism]] of the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |title=[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] |date=2002 |pages=Chapter 7, section "Synthesis as Restriction" |isbn=0-674-00613-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Levinton, Jeffrey S. |date=2001 |title=Genetics, Paleontology, and Macroevolution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=14–16 |isbn=0-521-80317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Montgomery, Georgina M.|author2=Largent, Mark A. |date=2015 |title=A Companion to the History of American Science  |publisher=Wiley |page=218 |isbn=978-1-4051-5625-7 |quote=With the integration of Mendelian genetics and population genetics into evolutionary theory in the 1930s a new generation of biologists applied mathematical techniques to investigate how changes in the frequency of genes in populations combined with natural selection could produce species change.

[[File:Ernst Mayr PLoS.jpg|thumb|[[Ernst Mayr]] considered orthogenesis effectively taboo in 1948.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}]]

By 1948, the evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]], as editor of the journal ''Evolution'', made the use of the term ''orthogenesis'' taboo: "It might be well to abstain from use of the word 'orthogenesis' .. since so many of the geneticists seem to be of the opinion that the use of the term implies some supernatural force."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=447}}&lt;ref name=Mayr1948/&gt; With the rise of [[evolutionary developmental biology]] in the late 20th-early 21st centuries, however, which is open to an expanded concept of heredity that incorporates the physics of [[self-organization]], ideas of constraint and preferred directions of morphological change have made a reappearance in evolutionary theory.&lt;ref&gt;see, for example, {{cite book |editor1-link=Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|editor1=Müller, Gerd B.|editor2-link=Stuart Newman|editor2=Newman, Stuart A.|title=[[Origination of Organismal Form]] |date=2003 |publisher=Bradford |isbn=0-262-13419-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of biology [[Michael Ruse]] wrote that "some of the most significant of today's evolutionists are progressionists, and that because of this we find (absolute) progressionism alive and well in their work."{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=536}} He argued that progressionism has harmed the status of [[evolutionary biology]] as a mature, professional science.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|p=530}} Presentations of evolution remain characteristically progressionist, with humans at the top of the "Tower of Time" in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington D.C.]], while ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine could illustrate the history of life leading progressively from mammals to dinosaurs to primates and finally man. Ruse noted that at the popular level, progress and evolution are simply synonyms, as they were in the nineteenth century, though confidence in the value of cultural and technological progress has declined.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}}

===In popular culture===
[[File:Huxley - Mans Place in Nature.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|The frontispiece to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]'' was intended to compare the skeletons of apes and humans, but unintentionally created a durable [[meme]] of supposed "monkey-to-man" progress.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Jennifer|title=What our most famous evolutionary cartoon gets wrong|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2012/10/27/what-our-most-famous-evolutionary-cartoon-gets-wrong/drKMD5121W6EUxXJ4pF0YL/story.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|work=The [[Boston Globe]]|date=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{further|March of Progress}}

In popular culture, progressionist images of evolution are widespread. The historian Jennifer Tucker, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', notes that [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]'s 1863 illustration comparing the skeletons of apes and humans "has become an iconic and instantly recognizable visual shorthand for evolution."&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt; She calls its history extraordinary, saying that it is "one of the most intriguing, and most misleading, drawings in the modern history of science." Nobody, Tucker observes, supposes that the "monkey-to-man" sequence accurately depicts Darwinian evolution. ''The Origin of Species'' had only one illustration, a diagrams showing that random events create a process of branching evolution, a view that Tucker notes is broadly acceptable to modern biologists. But Huxley's image recalled the great chain of being, implying with the force of a visual image a "logical, evenly paced progression" leading up to ''Homo sapiens'', a view denounced by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in ''[[Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life]]''.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

[[File:Man is But a Worm.jpg|thumb|upright|''Man is But a Worm'' by [[Edward Linley Sambourne]], ''Punch's Almanack'' for 1882]]

Popular perception, however, had seized upon the idea of linear progress. [[Edward Linley Sambourne]]'s ''Man is But a Worm'', drawn for ''Punch's Almanack'', mocked the idea of any evolutionary link between humans and animals, with a sequence from chaos to earthworm to apes, primitive men, a Victorian beau, and Darwin in a pose that according to Tucker recalls [[Michelangelo]]'s figure of [[Adam]] in his fresco adorning the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]]. This was followed by a flood of variations on the evolution-as-progress theme, including ''The New Yorker'''s 1925 "The Rise and Fall of Man", the sequence running from a chimpanzee to [[Neanderthal man]], [[Socrates]], and finally the lawyer [[William Jennings Bryan]] who argued for the anti-evolutionist prosecution in the [[Scopes Trial]] on the State of Tennessee law limiting the teaching of evolution.  Tucker noted that [[Rudolph Franz Zallinger]]'s 1965 "[[March of Progress|The Road to Homo Sapiens]]" fold-out illustration in [[F. Clark Howell]]'s ''Early Man'', showing a sequence of 14 walking figures ending with modern man, fitted the palaeoanthropological discoveries "not into a branching Darwinian scheme, but into the framework of the original Huxley diagram." Howell ruefully commented that the "powerful and emotional" graphic had overwhelmed his Darwinian text.&lt;ref name="Tucker2012"/&gt;

===Sliding between meanings===

Scientists, Ruse argues, continue to slide easily from one notion of progress to another: even committed Darwinians like [[Richard Dawkins]] embed the idea of cultural progress in a theory of cultural units, [[meme]]s, that act much like genes.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} Dawkins can speak of "progressive rather than random&amp;nbsp;... trends in evolution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard |author2=Krebs, J. R. |authorlink1=Richard Dawkins |authorlink2=John Krebs, Baron Krebs |title=Arms races between and within species |date=1979 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=205 |pages=489–511 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081|bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=466}} Dawkins and [[John Krebs, Baron Krebs|John Krebs]] deny the "earlier [Darwinian] prejudice"{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}} that there is anything "inherently progressive about evolution",{{sfn|Dawkins|1986|page=178}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}} but the feeling of progress comes from evolutionary [[arms race]]s which remain in Dawkins's words "by far the most satisfactory explanation for the existence of the advanced and complex machinery that animals and plants possess".{{sfn|Dawkins|1986|page=181}}{{sfn|Ruse|1996|page=468}}

Ruse concludes his detailed analysis of the idea of ''Progress'', meaning a progressionist philosophy, in evolutionary biology by stating that evolutionary thought came out of that philosophy. Before Darwin, Ruse argues, evolution was just a [[pseudoscience]]; Darwin made it respectable, but "only as popular science". "There it remained frozen, for nearly another hundred years",{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}} until mathematicians such as Fisher{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=292–295}} provided "both [[population genetics|models]] and status", enabling evolutionary biologists to construct the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the 1930s and 1940s. That made biology a professional science, at the price of ejecting the notion of progress. That, Ruse argues, was a significant cost to "people [biologists] still firmly committed to Progress" as a philosophy.{{sfn|Ruse|1996|pages=526–539}}

==Facilitated variation==
{{multiple image | footer=Different species of ''Heliconius'' butterfly have [[parallel evolution|independently evolved]] similar patterns, apparently both [[facilitated variation|facilitated and constrained]] by the available [[developmental-genetic toolkit]] genes controlling wing [[pattern formation]].  | align=right | image1=Heliconius erato Richard Bartz.jpg | width1=125 | caption1=''[[Heliconius erato]]'' | image2=Heliconius melpomene 2b Richard Bartz.jpg | width2=175 | caption2=''[[Heliconius melpomene]]''}}
{{main|Facilitated variation}}

Biology has largely rejected the idea that evolution is guided in any way,{{sfn|Bowler|1989|page=270}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|page=127}} but the evolution of some features is indeed [[facilitated variation|facilitated]] by the genes of the [[developmental-genetic toolkit]] studied in [[evolutionary developmental biology]]. An example is the development of wing pattern in some species of ''[[Heliconius]]'' butterfly, which have [[parallel evolution|independently evolved]] similar patterns. These butterflies are [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian mimics]] of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baxter, S.W. |author2=Papa, R. |author3=Chamberlain, N. |author4=Humphray, S.J. |author5=Joron, M. |author6=Morrison, C. |author7=ffrench-Constant, R.H. |author8=McMillan, W.O. |author9=Jiggins, C.D. |year=2008 |title=Convergent Evolution in the Genetic Basis of Mullerian Mimicry in Heliconius Butterflies |journal=Genetics |volume=180 |issue=3 |pages=1567–1577 | pmid=18791259 |pmc=2581958 | doi=10.1534/genetics.107.082982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal branding is essentially the ongoing process of establishing a prescribed image or impression in the mind of others about an individual, group, or organization.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Your Personal Brand - Los Ellis 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Personal branding often involves the application of one's name to various products. For example, the celebrity [[real estate development|real-estate]] mogul turned [[President of the United States]], [[Donald Trump]] uses his last name extensively on his buildings and on the products he endorses. (e.g. [[Trump Tower]]). In ''Be Your Own Brand'' first published in 1999, marketers David McNally and Karl Speak&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brandtoolbox.com/about-us/karl-d-speak/|title=Karl D. Speak - Founding Principal &amp; Exec. Consultant|work=Brand Tool Box|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; define personal brand this way: "Your brand is a perception or emotion, maintained by somebody other than you, that describes the total experience of having a relationship with you." Kim Kardashian has a strong personal brand since she is considered a very influential person, thus every product she endorses, skyrockets on the market. Hence why companies look out for her due to the influential power she has in the media.

The relationship between brands and consumers needs to be constantly made and remade, and this continuous process creates a demonstration of the ambivalence in brand cultures.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Banet-Weiser, Sarah (2012). Authentic™The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814787144}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same logic follows for personal brands- there is a constant desire for a reinforcement of the self-brand.

== History ==
Personal branding, self-positioning, and all individual branding by whatever name, was first introduced in 1937 in the book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]''{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} by [[Napoleon Hill]]. This relates specifically to Chapter 6, Organized Planning, Planning the Sale of Services, where Hill states, "It should be encouraging to know that practically all the great fortunes began in the form of compensation for personal services, or from the sale of IDEAS." The idea surfaced later in the 1981 book ''Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind'', by [[Al Ries]] and [[Jack Trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Ries | first=Al | last2=Trout | first2=Jack | year=1981 | title=Positioning: The Battle for your Mind | publisher=McGraw-Hill | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hjG01OzMGYC | isbn=978-0-07-135916-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically in "Chapter 23. Positioning Yourself and Your Career - You can benefit by using positioning strategy to advance your own career. Key principle: Don't try to do everything yourself. Find a horse to ride". It was later popularized by [[Tom Peters]].

Branding has reached a new level of imperative because of the rise of the Internet. The growth of the virtual world created the necessity of managing online identities. Despite being expressly virtual, social media and online identity has the ability to affect the real world. Because Individuals want to portray themselves a certain way to their social circle, they may work to maintain a certain image on their social media sites. As a result, social media enables the creation of an online identity that may not be completely true to the [[True self and false self|real self]]. (See: [[online identity]])

Today, added emphasis is placed on personal branding, especially in the online world. Employers are now increasingly using social media tools in order to vet applicants before offering them interviews. Such techniques range from searching the applicants [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]] feed to conducting large background checks using search engines and other tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/money/work-blog/2013/dec/11/job-applications-social-media-profiles-scrutiny |title=Job applications: social media profiles under scrutiny |last=Landau |first=Phillip |date=11 December 2013  | website=guardian.co.uk |accessdate= January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst job-seekers, this is leading to a shift away from the practice of submitting a resume as part of their job application process to providing potential employers with access to a number of personal brand assets. Such assets are likely to include a resume, links to a carefully managed LinkedIn profile and a personal blog, evidence of articles which disseminate original ideas on industry blogs, and evidence of having an online following. Such efforts give job-seekers better odds of being noticed by potential employers.

== Goffman's self presentation theory ==
[[Erving Goffman|Erving Goffman's]] Self Presentation is a key theory that explores the way people want to be seen and how people are perceived by their peers. Goffman, uses the term Dramaturgy as a component to his theory of self-presentation. This term refers to looking at your own persona as a drama, treating your actions as an actor in a play. One can control how he or she is viewed by their peers and in cases of celebrities or athletes, can build a personal brand through utilizing what they present to their publics using various social media outlets. Self-presentation theory and personal branding go hand  in hand, we see celebrities and athletes building a particular brand, or persona over with the use of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Building a personal brand is a big part of a celebrity's life, and it can help them spread awareness and also provide an outlet to connect with their fans/supporters. This is made possible through the use of social media and the ability of the person looking to build a personal brand to make their messages heard. The theory of self-presentation looks at how people look to create an identity for themselves that they would like to be seen as by their peers or in the public eye. This is what Goffman call's the 'front stage'.

The front stage is a key component of this theory and it is a way a person acts when in public or around other people to build a certain persona for how they would like others to view them. The front stage is where celebrities and athletes tend to build their own brand and show many positive, deliberate messages that will try and portray them in a certain light in which the person would like to be seen. As opposed to what Goffman refer's to as the 'back stage' which is a particular way a person acts when they are not in public or not posting on social media, trying to build a particular persona or brand they would like others to see.

There are many examples of celebrities building a brand for themselves over some sort of social media platform. In fact, it is rare to see an athlete or celebrity without a social media page whether it is twitter or instagram. Celebrities use these outlets as ways of branding themselves, by showing people their lives and having fans feel close to them, almost like they are friends, and have a connection through social media outlets such as twitter and instagram. Also, to keep more of their fans interested, and to reach as many as possible many celebrities will update daily on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat so their message can be seen by a wider audience. They can keep fans informed on everything from what they want to wear, to their political views. Social Media has provided a simple way for celebrities to get their personal brand to reach a wider audience, and they utilize the 'front stage'  to influence people in a particular way and to make themselves look good in the public eye.

The 'back stage' is part of Goffman's theory of self-presentation theory, and it is happenings or beliefs people wouldn't want their peers or public to necessarily see or hear. These are happenings that go on behind the scenes that can oftentimes hurt someone's reputation and are avoided when a celebrity is trying to build a personal brand. These are often personal happenings, or beliefs that will negatively effect how an audience will look at the brand you are building. There are numerous examples of celebrities saying something that they didn't want their public to hear but got out and this hurts the brand they are building. One example of this is when [[LA Clippers]] owner [[Donald Sterling]] made racist comments to his then girlfriend and she had recorded them and put them on her social media.&lt;ref name="TMZ 2014"&gt;{{cite web | title=Clippers Owner Donald Sterling to GF -- Don't Bring Black People to My Games ... Including Magic Johnson | website=TMZ | date=2014-04-25 | url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/04/26/donald-sterling-clippers-owner-black-people-racist-audio-magic-johnson/ | access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Sterling was quickly removed from the team and is no longer associated with the NBA. This is an example of how something in the back stage will negatively affect what you want the public to see you as.

Self-presentation theory is very apparent in the world of celebrities and professional athletes and is a big part of building a brand for themselves. Goffman's theory seems to identify itself well with the personal branding of these celebrities and you can see why they would want to utilize social media to positively show a message they want to be heard by their public (front stage) and avoid more personal beliefs that may negatively effect their brand (back stage).

== Social media ==
[[Social media]] can be "roughly defined as 'a group of Internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content'".&lt;ref&gt;Dijck, José Van. "Chapter 1: Engineering Sociality in a Culture of Connectivity." The Culture of Connectivity: A Critical History of Social Media. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2013. N. pag. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media extends beyond just [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] and into the professional world as well. There are general professional profiles like [[LinkedIn]] and company or industry-specific networks, such as [[Slack (software)|Slack]]. Because of these professional networks, self-branding is useful in finding a job or improving one's professional standing. As an online open source, social media has become a place that is fulfilled with highly reliable and resourceful information to target user identities&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ang, L., Khamis, S., &amp; Welling, R. (2017). Self-branding, ‘micro-celebrity’ and the rise of social media influencers. ''Celebrity Studies, 8''(2), 191-208. doi: 10.1080/19392397.2016.1218292&lt;/ref&gt;.

Building a brand and an online presence through internal corporate networks allows for individuals to network with their colleagues, not only socially but professionally as well. This kind of interaction allows for employees to build up their personal brand relative to other employees, as well as spur innovation within the company because more people can learn from more people.

Some social media sites, like [[Twitter]], can have a flattened, all-encompassing audience that can be composed of professional and personal contacts, which then can be seen as a more "'professional' environment with potential professional costs".&lt;ref&gt;Marwick, A. E., and D. Boyd. "I Tweet Honestly, I Tweet Passionately: Twitter Users, Context Collapse, and the Imagined Audience." [[New Media &amp; Society]] 13.1 (2011): 114-33. Sage Journals. Web. 20 May 2014.  {{doi|10.1177/1461444810365313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its explicitly public nature, Twitter becomes a double-sided platform that can be utilized in different ways depending on the amount of censorship a user decides on.

Personal branding focuses on "self-packaging," where "success is not determined by individuals' internal sets of skills, motivations, and interests but, rather, by how effectively they are…branded";&lt;ref name="Lair, D. J 2005"&gt;Lair, D. J. "Marketization and the Recasting of the Professional Self: The Rhetoric and Ethics of Personal Branding." Management Communication Quarterly 18.3 (2005): 307-43. Sage Journals. Web. 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; it is more about self-promotion rather than true self-expression. The difference between the two is that self-promotion is deliberately intentional in all aspects because the individual is purposely shaping their image or persona, while self-expression can even be a byproduct of promotion.&lt;ref name="Dijck, J. Van 2013"&gt;Dijck, J. Van. "'You Have One Identity': Performing the Self on Facebook and LinkedIn." Media, Culture &amp; Society 35.2 (2013): 199-215. Sage Journal. Web. 19 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from professional aspirations, personal branding can also be used on personal-level social networks to flare popularity. The online self is used as a marketing and promotional tool to brand an individual as a type of person; success on the virtual platforms then becomes "online social value [that could transform] to real rewards in the offline world."&lt;ref name="Dijck, J. Van 2013"/&gt; A prominent example of a self-made self-branded social media icon is [[Tila Tequila]], who rose to prominence in 2006 on the [[Myspace]] network, gaining more than 1.5 million friends, through expertly marketing her personal brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Authentic™The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture|last=Banet-Weiser|first=Sarah|publisher=NYU Press|year=2012|isbn=9780814787144|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As social media has become a vehicle for self-branding, these moguls have begun to situate the maintenance of their online brand as a job, which brings about new ways to think about work and labor&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Banet-Weiser, Sarah (2012). Authentic™The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814787144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of online sites and the presence of feedback means that one's online presence is viewed by others using the same rubric to judge brands: evaluation, ranking, and judgment. Thus, social media network sites serve as complex, technologically mediated venues for the branding of the self.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Personal branding offers promises of increased success in the business world. Thousands of [[self-help]] books, programs, personal coaches, and articles exist to help individuals learn to self-brand. These strategies emphasize authenticity but framed as becoming "'more of who you are' as well as who 'you were meant to be.'&lt;ref name="Banet-Weiser, Sarah 2012"&gt;Banet-Weiser, Sarah. "Branding the Postfeminist Self: The Labor of Femininity." Authentic™: The Politics of Ambivalence in a Brand Culture. New York: New York U, 2012. 51-90. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other side of these 'strategies for success' is that this is very subtle self-commodification.&lt;ref name="Lair, D. J 2005"/&gt; Because personal branding is basically pointing out, and in some cases, glorifying, certain positive characteristics of an individual, it is not unlike traditional branding of products and companies. This puts individuals in the place of products, in which their efforts to appear more human are subverted.&lt;ref name="Banet-Weiser, Sarah 2012"/&gt;

This possibility is exploited by celebrities and politicians, as "marketing individual personalities as products" is an effective way to gain millions of fans not just online but in real life as well.&lt;ref name="Dijck, J. Van 2013"/&gt; For celebrities of all types, online personas are their brands. Public relations for [[Justin Bieber]] and [[Barack Obama]] alike can easily control the "brand" and maximize exposure and profitability.

On the other hand, personal branding may afford potential employers the opportunity to more accurately judge a candidate's abilities and cultural suitability, since blogs, profiles, websites, etc., are pieces of work that can be evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/what-your-employees-personal-branding-means-to-your-company-1/|title=What Your Employees' Personal Branding Means to Your Company {{!}} OPEN Forum|website=www.americanexpress.com|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/12/04/personal-branding-in-the-future-workplace-a-crucial-skill-for-employees-and-recruiters-alike/#5809b7e416b0|title=Personal Branding in the Future Workplace: A Crucial Skill for Employees and Recruiters Alike|last=Meister|first=Jeanne|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

== Disclosure ==
Personal branding involves the practice of self-disclosure, and this transparency is part of what Foucault would call "the proper care of the self".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In this sense, disclosure refers to the details of one's everyday life for other's consumption, while transparency is the effect of this kind of disclosure. Transparency essentially works to give viewers a complete view of one's authentic self.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Digitally aided disclosure, which involves building a self-brand on a social network site, relies on traditional discourses of the authentic self as one that is transparent, without artifice, and open to others. Authenticity is viewed as both residing inside the self and is also demonstrated by allowing the outside world access to one's inner self.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It is interesting to think about the idea of authenticity with disclosure, and the freedom social networks allow in disclosing an inauthentic self. All the while, these posting are forming a digital archive of the self, through which a brand could be crafted by others. An example of this is Carly Fleishmann, whose [[Twitter]] posting created an iconicity and brand without her ever speaking out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNZVV4Ciccg|title=Autistic Girl Expresses Unimaginable Intelligence|first=|last=Ichiban MacBean|date=25 May 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a figure who rose to prominence through this disclosure is Ingrid Nilsen, who posted a video on [[YouTube]] coming out as lesbian and subsequently took off as a [[YouTube]] star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/youtubes-most-popular-coming-out-videos-2015-7|title=The top 10 most viewed YouTube coming-out videos of all time will bring you to tears|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through disclosure individuals are able to go through the process of personal branding.

'''Platonic love''' (often lower-cased as '''platonic'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |title-link=The Chicago Manual of Style |edition=16th [electronic] |chapter=8.60: When not to capitalize |date=2010 |publisher=Chicago University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term used for a type of [[love]], or close relationship that is non-sexual. Its symbol would be the [[rose|white rose]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. It is named after [[Greek philosopher]] [[Plato]], though the philosopher never used the term himself. Platonic love as devised by Plato concerns rising through levels of closeness to wisdom and true beauty from carnal attraction to individual bodies to attraction to souls, and eventually, union with the truth. This is the ancient, philosophical interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary: Tenth Edition|last=Mish|first=F|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|year=1993|isbn=08-7779-709-9|location=Springfield, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Platonic love is often contrasted with [[romantic love]].

== Philosophical interpretation ==
Platonic love is examined in Plato's dialogue, the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', which has as its topic the subject of love or [[Eros (concept)|Eros]] generally. It explains the possibilities of how the feeling of love began and how it has evolved—both sexually and non-sexually. Of particular importance is the speech of [[Socrates]], who attributes to the prophetess [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] an idea of platonic love as a means of ascent to contemplation of the divine. The step of this ascent is known as the "Ladder of Love". For Diotima, and for Plato generally, the most correct use of love of human beings is to direct one's mind to love of [[divinity]]. Socrates defines love based on separate classifications of pregnancy (to bear offspring); pregnancy of the body, pregnancy of the soul, and direct connection to Being. Pregnancy of the body results in human children. Pregnancy of the soul, the next step in the process, produces "[[virtue]]" – which is the soul (truth) translating itself into material form.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Rojcewicz, R. (1997). Platonic love: dasein's urge toward being. ''Research in Phenomenology'', ''27''(1), 103.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] virtue for the Greeks means self-sameness [...] in Plato's terms, Being or idea."(106) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Eros ===
In short, with genuine platonic love, the beautiful or lovely other person inspires the mind and the soul and directs one's attention to spiritual things. Pausanias, in Plato's ''Symposium'' (181b–182a), explained two types of love or Eros—Vulgar Eros or earthly love and Divine Eros or [[divine love]]. Vulgar Eros is nothing but mere material attraction towards a beautiful body for physical pleasure and reproduction. Divine Eros begins the journey from physical attraction, i.e. attraction towards beautiful form or body but transcends gradually to love for Supreme Beauty. This concept of Divine Eros is later transformed into the term platonic love. Vulgar Eros and Divine Eros are both connected and part of the same continuous process of pursuing totality of being itself,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with the purpose of mending human nature, eventually reaching a point of unity where there is no longer an aspiration to change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Eros is [...] a moment of transcendence [...] in so far as the other can never be possessed without being annihilated in its status as the other, at which point both desire and transcendence would cease [...] (84) &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Miller, P. A. (2013). Duras and platonic love: The erotics of substitution. ''Comparatist'', ''37''83-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Eros as a god ====
In the ''Symposium'', Eros is discussed as a Greek god – more specifically, the king of the gods, with each guest of the party giving a eulogy in praise of Eros.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Benardete, S. (1986). ''Plato's Symposium.'' Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-04275-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view of Eros is different from how a modern person would interpret it. Most modern people would think of Eros as a concept rather than a god. This is an example of [[Cultural relativism|cultural relativity]], because the modern interpretation of the term is different from the ancient Greek interpretation.&lt;blockquote&gt;"So this is how I assert that Eros is the oldest, most honorable, and most competent of the gods with regard to the acquisition of virtue and happiness by human beings both when living and dead."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (180c, 8) – Plato's quoting of Phaedrus' eulogy on Eros &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Virtue ====
Virtue, according to Greek philosophy, is the concept of how closely reality and material form equates with the ideal, true essence of an idea, such as beauty. Virtue is the result of pregnancy of the soul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This definition varies considerably from the modern English interpretation of the term, where virtue equates to that which is good, positive, or benevolent. This can be seen as a form of [[linguistic relativity]].

Some modern authors perception of the terms "virtue" and "good" as they are translated into English from the ''Symposium'' are a good indicator of this misunderstanding. In the following quote, the author simplifies the idea of virtue as simply what is "good".&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] what is good is beautiful, and what is beautiful is good [...]"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Herrmann, F. (2013). Dynamics of vision in Plato's thought. ''Helios'', ''40''(1/2), 281-307.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Ladder of Love ===
The Ladder of Love is named as such because it relates each step toward Being itself as consecutive rungs of a ladder. Each step closer to the truth further distances love from beauty of the body toward love that is more focused on wisdom and the essence of beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The ladder starts with carnal attraction of body for body, progressing to a love for body and soul. Eventually, in time, with consequent steps up the ladder, the idea of beauty is eventually no longer connected with a body, but entirely united with Being itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] decent human beings must be gratified, as well as those that are not as yet decent, so that they might become more decent; and the love of the decent must be preserved." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (187d, 17) - Eryximachus' "completion" of Pausanias' speech on Eros &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Tragedy and comedy ====
Plato's ''Symposium'' defines two extremes in the process of platonic love; the entirely carnal and the entirely ethereal. These two extremes of love are seen by the Greeks in terms of tragedy and comedy. According to Diotima in her discussion with Socrates, for anyone to achieve the final rung in the Ladder of Love, they would essentially transcend the body and rise to immortality - gaining direct access to Being. Such a form of love is impossible for a mortal to achieve.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

What Plato describes as "pregnancy of the body" is entirely carnal and seeks pleasure and beauty in bodily form only. This is the type of love, that, according to Socrates, is practiced by animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Now, if both these portraits of love, the tragic and the comic, are exaggerations, then we could say that the genuine portrayal of Platonic love is the one that lies between them. The love described as the one practiced by those who are pregnant according to the soul, who partake of both the realm of beings and the realm of Being, who grasp Being indirectly, through the mediation of beings, would be a love that Socrates could practice."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===== Tragedy =====

Diotima considers the carnal limitation of human beings to the pregnancy of the body to be a form of tragedy, as it separates someone from the pursuit of truth. One would be forever limited to beauty of the body, never being able to access the true essence of beauty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===== Comedy =====
Diotima considers the idea of a mortal having direct access to Being to be a comic situation simply because of the impossibility of it. The offspring of true virtue would essentially lead to a mortal achieving immortality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Evolution of platonic love ==
In the Middle Ages arose a new interest in Plato, his philosophy and his view of love. This was caused by [[Georgios Gemistos Plethon]] during the Councils of Ferrara and Firenze in 1438-1439. Later in 1469, [[Marsilio Ficino]] put forward a theory of neo-platonic love in which he defines love as a personal ability of an individual which guides their soul towards cosmic processes and lofty spiritual goals and heavenly ideas (''De Amore'', Les Belles Lettres, 2012). The first use of the modern sense of platonic love is taken as an invention of Ficino in one of his letters.

Though Plato's discussions of love originally centered on relationships which were sexual between members of the same sex, scholar Todd Reeser studies how the meaning of platonic love in Plato's original sense underwent a transformation during the [[Renaissance]], leading to the contemporary sense of nonsexual [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reeser|first1=T.|title=Setting Plato Straight: Translating Platonic Sexuality in the Renaissance|date=2015|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English term dates back to [[William Davenant]]'s ''The Platonic Lovers'' (performed in 1635); a critique of the philosophy of platonic love which was popular at Charles I's court. It is derived from the concept in Plato's ''Symposium'' of the love of the idea of good which lies at the root of all virtue and truth. For a brief period, Platonic love was a fashionable subject at the English royal court, especially in the circle around Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], the wife of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Platonic love was the theme of some of the courtly [[masque]]s performed in the [[Caroline era]]—though the fashion soon waned under pressures of social and political change.

=== Seven types of love ===
Throughout these eras platonic love slowly was categorized into different subsections, which were: [[Eros]], [[Philia]], [[Storge]], [[Agape]], [[Ludus (ancient Rome)|Ludus]], [[Pragma (love)|Pragma]], [[Self-love|Philautia]]. Eros is a sexual or passionate love, or a modern perspective of romantic love. Philia is the type of love that is directed towards friendship or goodwill, often is met with mutual benefits that can also can be formed by companionship, dependability, and trust. Storge is the type of love that is found between parents and children, and this is often a unilateral love. Agape is the universal love, that can consist of the love for strangers, nature, or god. Ludus is a playful and uncommitted love, this is focused for fun and sometimes as a conquest with no strings attached. Pragma is the type of love that is founded on duty and reason, and one's longer term interests. Philautia is self-love and this can be healthy or unhealthy; which can be unhealthy if you are hubris if placed ahead of gods, and it can be healthy if its used to build self esteem and confidence. These different forms of love can be mistaken as any of the listed different loves.  There is a type of porosity that allows love to filter through one type and into the next, although for Plato love is to be of the beautiful and good things. This is due to the ownership of beautiful and good things equates into happiness. All beautiful and good things sit below truth and wisdom, for everyone looks to truthful and wise people as the truly beautiful for the effort of being considered beautifully good, and this is exactly why Plato suggests that love is not a god but rather a philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201606/these-are-the-7-types-love|title=These Are the 7 Types of Love|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern interpretation ==

=== Definition of platonic love ===
"Platonic love in its modern popular sense is an affectionate relationship into which the sexual element does not enter, especially in cases where one might easily assume otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/platonic_love.htm|title=Platonic love|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Platonic lovers function to underscore a supportive role where the friend sees her or his duty as the provision of advice, encouragement, and comfort to the other person [...] and do not entail exclusivity"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Messman,|first=SJ|date=2000|title=Motives to Remain Platonic, Equity, and the Use of Maintenance Strategies in Opposite-Sex Friendships|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407500171004|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships,|volume=17|pages=67–94|via=10.1177/0265407500171004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complications of platonic love ===
90% of our closest relationship will be of a platonic nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/love-isnt-just-romantic|title=The Truth About Romantic and Platonic Love|date=2015-12-14|work=The Odyssey Online|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when there is an insistence on labelling the relationship as platonic love the terminology itself may create discourse within one's relationships. Notably romantic relationships where a bond of love has been established.

One of the complications of platonic love lies within the persistence of the use of the title itself "platonic love" versus the use of "friend". It is the use of the word [[love]] that directs us towards a deeper relationship than the scope of a normal [[friendship]].

Secondly, a study by Hause and Messman states: "The most popular reasons for retaining a platonic relationship of the opposite sex (or sex of attraction) was to safeguard a relationship, followed by not attracted, network disapproval, third party, risk aversion, and time out." This points to the fact that the title of platonic love in most cases is actually a title-holder to avoid sexual interaction between knowing and consenting friends, with mutual or singular sexual interest and/or tension existing.

{{nihongo|'''''RapeLay'''''|レイプレイ|Reipurei}} is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[eroge]] video game made by [[Illusion Soft|Illusion]], released on April 21, 2006 in [[Japan]]. Compared to Illusion's previous games, the main story is shorter, it features an improved 3D engine and is mainly played through mouse control. The game centers on a male character who stalks and rapes a mother and her two daughters. Three years after its initial release, the game garnered international attention and controversy for its content. Yoshimura Tei was arrested for obscenity charges.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Similar to 2004 video game ''[[The Guy Game]]'', the game was subsequently banned in several countries. This game could be only downloaded digitally in North America.

==Gameplay==
''RapeLay'' is played from the perspective of a ''[[Chikan (body contact)|chikan]]'' named Masaya Kimura, who [[stalking|stalks]] and subsequently [[rape]]s the Kiryuu family (a mother and her two daughters).

==Plot==

===Story===
In story mode, the player rapes the three women in the order of Manaka, Yuuko, and Aoi. The player starts off in the train station. Upon entering the train, the main character [[Frotteurism|gropes]] the woman the main character is currently in the train with. After the main character finishes raping all three women, the players has the option of free play scenes.&lt;ref name=walkthru&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jsemts.twbbs.org/view_en_error_rapelay_ZmV1ZXJkcmFjaGUncyBDb21waWxhdGlvbiBSYXBlTGF5IFdhbGt0aHJ1IENvbGxlY3Rpb24gRmluYWwgMTAwJS50eHQ=.html |title=feuerdrache's Compilation RapeLay Walkthru Collection Final 100% |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=JSEMTS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414161138/http://jsemts.twbbs.org/view_en_error_rapelay_ZmV1ZXJkcmFjaGUncyBDb21waWxhdGlvbiBSYXBlTGF5IFdhbGt0aHJ1IENvbGxlY3Rpb24gRmluYWwgMTAwJS50eHQ%3D.html |archivedate=April 14, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being caught by Aoi groping a woman on a [[Rapid transit|subway train]], Masaya Kimura is arrested by authorities. On the morning of the next day, Aoi and her young sister Manaka help their mother Yuuko find a wallet she lost around their home while talking about the incident the previous day. Unknown to them, Kimura secretly eavesdrops on their conversation while waiting outside their house. It is revealed here that his father, a well known influential/important politician, managed to release him from custody. When Kimura discovers that Yuuko is widowed, he decided to put his revenge plan into action.

Kimura first starts with the youngest, Manaka. Following her to the subway, he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, he traps her in a public bathroom and rapes her, taking pictures of her semen-covered naked body with his mobile phone. Kimura instructs Manaka to feign sickness the next day and stay in her room.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

[[File:RapeLay screenshot 01.jpg|thumb|Screenshot of ''Chikan'' mode, where the player gropes the final victim, Aoi Kiryu, on the subway.]]

The next day he follows Yuuko, the mother, from her house to the train station where he fondles her on the train. Kimura follows her to the city park. As per his plan, Manaka calls Yuuko on her mobile phone, telling her that she is in the bushes at the park. When Yuuko walks towards the bushes, Kimura ambushes her, ties her up and rapes her in the park. He takes pictures of her semen-covered naked body before handing her over to his gang of henchmen on the side, who detain her for him.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

The third day he follows Aoi, the eldest daughter, to the train station and shows her the photo of her tied up mother. Shocked, she can only follow his orders as he gropes her on the train. After getting off the train, she asks Kimura why he is doing this, at which point she remembers he is the same groper whom she reported for molesting a woman. Getting in a vehicle, Kimura and his henchmen take Aoi to a hotel owned by his family. He violently rapes her in a mini-suite room and takes photos after withdrawing.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

After having his way with Aoi, Yuuko and Manaka are taken into the room via a secret door. With all 3 captured, Kimura reveals his plans to make them his sex slaves. Yuuko tries to cover for her daughters and pleads with him to take her instead. He considers this and tells Yuuko he might spare her daughters if she can prove her worth. Yuuko gives him a very long blowjob while her two daughters watch. When Kimura seems pleased at her performance, Yuuko thinks she has won her daughters' freedom. Instead, Kimura reveals that he will never change his mind and that they are all there to stay. Yuuko breaks down in the end, Manaka breaks next and finally Aoi as well. The game ends with the ominous title card that as a new day starts the Kiryu family horror has 'only just begun'.&lt;ref name=walkthru/&gt;

====Endings====

The game is open-ended and there are two possible outcomes to the game where the main character dies.

* '''Black Ending'''&lt;ref name="rapelaystrategy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illusion.jp/support/rapelay/index.html|title=RapeLay Strategy Page (レイプレイ 攻略ページ)|publisher=[[Illusion Soft]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=2012-01-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420034549/http://www.illusion.jp/support/rapelay/index.html|archivedate=2009-04-20|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Kimura impregnates either Manaka or Aoi and decides to keep the child. After a certain number of days afterwards, Kimura falls onto the train tracks and is killed by a moving train. This ending is avoidable when a girl gets pregnant, at some point, the game asks the player whether he/she wishes the girl to have an abortion. If the player selects "no", the black ending will play. 
* '''Red ending'''&lt;ref name="rapelaystrategy" /&gt; – If the [[cowgirl position]] is used with Aoi before she breaks, the game will shift onto a scene of the same cowgirl session where Aoi brandishes a knife and stabs Kimura many times while hysterically laughing. The scene goes black, where a voice-over of Aoi is heard.&lt;ref name=bunnygirl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jsemts.twbbs.org/view_ct_error_ape_YnVubnlnaXJsJ3MgUmFwZUxheSBGQVEgNS00LTIwMDYudHh0.html |title=bunnygirl's RapeLay FAQ |accessdate=2008-04-09 |publisher=JSEMTS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403225751/http://jsemts.twbbs.org/view_ct_error_ape_YnVubnlnaXJsJ3MgUmFwZUxheSBGQVEgNS00LTIwMDYudHh0.html |archivedate=April 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The epilogue then reveals Aoi's fate as she is being held questioned by the police for Kimura's death.

==Characters==
*{{Nihongo|'''Masaya Kimura'''|鬼村 将哉|Kimura Masaya}} – The main playable character. Masaya is the son of an influential politician who becomes a ''chikan'' that stalks and subsequently rapes the Kiryū family after his release from prison.

==Reception and controversy==
Critics of violent game imagery, such as British Member of Parliament [[Keith Vaz]], have cited games involving rape as an example of why video game content needs to be more strictly regulated, and Yoshimura Tei was arrested and charged with obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Arendt |first=Susan |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/uk-politician-c.html |title=UK Politician Claims Games Feature Virtual Rape |accessdate=2008-03-25 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2008-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000826/http://blog.wired.com/games/2008/03/uk-politician-c.html |archive-date=2008-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} ''RapeLay'' in particular had come to Vaz's attention in 2009, three years after its initial release, as being one of the rape games purchasable on [[Amazon (company)|Amazon.com]], despite not being officially distributed nor supported outside of Japan, and he vowed to bring the issue into the British Parliament to prevent the game from being sold. Amazon subsequently removed the game from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fennelly |first=Gary |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/amazon-selling-3d-rape-simulator-game-14183546.html |title=Exclusive: Amazon selling rape simulation game |accessdate=2009-02-12 |work=[[Belfast Telegraph]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68U1hyeKs?url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/amazon-selling-3d-rape-simulator-game-14183546.html |archive-date=2012-06-17 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Equality Now]] followed up on the game, urging activists to write to Illusion and then-[[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Taro Aso]] in protest, arguing the game breaches Japan's obligations under the 1985 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]].&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellasia.net/japan-software-firm-shrugs-off-rape-game-protests-98705 |title=Japan software firm shrugs off rape game protests |publisher=[[Yahoo!

[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1897).svg|thumb|Rastas often claim the [[flag of Ethiopia]] as was used during Haile Selassie's reign. It combines the conquering lion of Judah, symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, with green, gold, and red.]]
'''Rastafari''', sometimes termed '''Rastafarianism''', is an [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[religion]] that developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. [[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] and related fields have classified it as both a [[new religious movement]] and a [[social movement]]. There is no centralized authority in control of the movement and much heterogeneity exists among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastas refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]], as "Rastalogy". Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God—referred to as [[Jah]]—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the [[Second Coming of Christ]].  Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognized the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses its attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or "Babylon". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the [[Promised Land]] of "Zion". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as "[[Livity (spiritual concept)|livity]]". Communal meetings are known as "groundations", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter being regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, twisting their hair into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several [[Christianity|Christian]] clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley, but the movement has survived and has a presence in many parts of the world.

The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or "[[Mansions of Rastafari]]", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres. The majority of practitioners are of black African descent, although a minority come from other racial groups.

==Definition==

[[Religious studies|Scholars of religion]] have categorised Rastafari as a [[new religious movement]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=11|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=92|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=182}} a [[new social movement]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} or as a [[social movement]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=136}} The scholar of religion Leonard E. Barrett referred to it as a [[sect]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the sociologist Ernest Cashmore as a [[cult]],{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} while scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds argued that it could best be understood as a [[revitalization movement]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}} 
Although Rastafari focuses on Africa as a source of identity,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}} the scholar of religion Maboula Soumahoro noted that it was not an "authentic" African religion but an example of [[creolization]], a product of the unique social environment that existed in the Americas.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=43}}
Edmonds also suggested that Rastafari was "emerging" as a [[world religion]], not because of the number of adherents that it had, but because of its global spread.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=71–72}}
Many Rastas themselves, however, do not regard it as a religion, instead referring to it as a "way of life".{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=188|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=267|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=92}}&lt;ref name=Glazier&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen D. Glazier|authorlink1=Stephen D. Glazier|editor1-last=Juergensmeyer|editor1-first=Mark K.|editor2-last=Roof|editor2-first=Wade Clark|title=Encyclopedia of Global Religion|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-0761927297|page=614|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B105DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA614&amp;dq=Rastafari+spiritual%7Creligion+%22way+of+life%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Rastafari%20spiritual%7Creligion%20%22way%20of%20life%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 March 2017|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, a British Industrial Tribunal concluded that—for the purposes of the [[Race Relations Act 1976]]—Rastafarians could be considered an ethnic group because they have a long, shared heritage which distinguished themselves from other groups, their own cultural traditions, a common language, and a common religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Banton|1y=1989|1p=153|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1989|2pp=158–160}} 

The term "Rastafari" derives from the pre-regnal title of Haile Selassie; the term "Ras" means a duke or prince, while "Tafari Makonen" was his name.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=82|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} It is unknown why the early Rastas adopted this form of Haile Selassie's name as the basis of their religion's name.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=82}} Many commentators—including some academic sources{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1pp=2, 103|2a1=Middleton|2y=2006|2p=152}}—refer to the movement as "Rastafarianism".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=8}} This term has also been used by some practitioners.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=187}} However, "Rastafarianism" is considered offensive by most Rastafari, who, being critical of "isms" or "ians" (which they see as a typical part of "[[Babylon (New Testament)|Babylon]]" culture), dislike being labelled as an "ism" or "ian" themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen D. Glazier]], ''Encyclopedia of African and African-American Religions'', 2001, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Cashmore urged fellow academics not to use this term, which he described as "insensitive".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=8–9}}

Rastafari is a decentralised and heterogeneous movement.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It is thus difficult to make broad generalisations about the movement without obscuring the complexities within it.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}}

==Beliefs==

[[File:Liberty Bell Temple 1.jpg|thumb|right|The Liberty Bell Temple in [[Los Angeles]] was established by [[Ed Forchion]]]]
Rastas refer to the totality of their religion's ideas and beliefs as "Rastalogy".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} The scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds described Rastafari as having "a fairly cohesive worldview";{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} however, Cashmore thought that its beliefs were "fluid and open to interpretation".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=v}} Because it has no systematic theology or highly developed institutions, the sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]] stated that it was "extremely difficult to generalise" about Rastas and their beliefs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=49}} Based on his research in Ghana, the scholar of religion Darren J. N. Middleton suggested that it was appropriate to speak of "a plethora of ''Rasta spiritualities''" displaying a "shifting eclecticism".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=158}} The movement has continuously changed and developed over the course of its history.{{sfn|King|2002|p=13}} Attempts have been made to summarise Rastafari belief, but these have never been accorded the status of a [[catechism]] or [[creed]] within the movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}}

Emphasis is placed on the idea that personal experience and intuitive understanding should be used to determine the truth or validity of a particular belief or practice.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=49–50, 63}} No Rasta, therefore, has the authority to declare what beliefs and practices are [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] and which are [[heterodox]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=63}} The conviction that Rastafari has no dogma "is so strong that it has itself become something of a dogma", according to Clarke.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}}

Rastafari belief is deeply influenced by [[Judeo-Christian]] religion.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=111|2a1=Sibanda|2y=2016|2p=183}} It accords the [[Bible]] a central place in its belief system, regarding it as a holy book,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=14|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=74|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=184}} and adopts a [[Biblical literalism|literalist interpretation]] of its contents.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} Rastas regard the Bible as an authentic account of early black history and their place as God's favoured people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} They believe that the Bible was originally written on stone in the Ethiopian language of [[Amharic]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=64|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=127}} For Rastas, the Bible is therefore viewed as the key to understanding the past and the present and for predicting the future.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} It is also regarded as a source book from which they can form their religious practices.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=127}} The Bible's final book, the [[Book of Revelation]], is widely regarded as the most important part for Rastas, having a particular significance for their situation.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=73}}

However, Rastas also believe that the true meaning of the Bible has been warped, both through mistranslation into other languages and by deliberate manipulation by those who wanted to deny black Africans their history.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=74|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=64|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=127}} They also regard it as cryptographic, meaning that it has many hidden meanings.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=74}} They believe that its true teachings can be revealed through intuition and meditation with the "book within".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=64}} As a result of what they regard as the corruption of the Bible, Rastas also turn to other sources that they believe shed light on black African history.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}} Common texts used for this purpose include [[Leonard Howell]]'s 1935 work ''[[The Promised Key]]'', [[Robert Athlyi Rogers]]' 1924 book ''[[Holy Piby]]'', and [[Fitz Balintine Pettersburg]] 1920s work, the ''[[Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy]]''.{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=44}}

===Jah Rastafari and Jesus of Nazareth===

Rastafari are [[monotheism|monotheists]], worshiping a singular God whom they call [[Jah]]. Rastas view Jah in the form of the [[Holy Trinity]] – [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and the [[Holy Spirit]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} The term "Jah" is a shortened version of "[[Jehovah]]", the name of God in English translations of the Old Testament.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=24|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=83}}

As well as regarding Jah as a deity, Rastas also believe that Jah is inherent within each human individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=6|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=12}} This belief is reflected in the aphorism, often cited by Rastas, that "God is man and man is God".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Due to the view that God exists within everyone, Rastas believe that all members of the religion are intrinsically connected, and thereby regard statements like "you and I" as being insignificant.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=175}}
As a result, Rastas speak of "knowing" Jah, rather than simply "believing" in him.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=65}} In seeking to narrow the distance between humanity and divinity, Rastafari embraces [[mysticism]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=92}}  In believing that human beings have an inner divinity within themselves, Rastas help to cultivate a bastion against the uncertainty and insecurity that exists within society and societal institutions.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=12}}

[[Jesus of Nazareth]] is an important figure in Rastafari.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} However, practitioners reject the traditional depiction of Jesus present in Christianity, particularly the depiction of him as a white European, believing that this is a perversion of the truth.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=106}} They believe that Jesus was a black African and that he was a Rasta.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} Christianity is treated with suspicion out of the view that the oppressors and the oppressed cannot share the same God,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} with many Rastas taking the view that the God worshipped by most white Christians is actually [[the Devil]].{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} Rastas therefore often view Christian preachers as deceivers,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and regard Christianity as being guilty of furthering the oppression of the African diaspora,{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=46}} often referring to it as having perpetrated "mental enslavement".{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=175}} One recurring saying among Rastafari is that "The Pope is Satan".{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=93}} Jesus is given particular prominence among a Rastafari denomination known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Rastas belonging to this group refer to Jesus as Yahshua and Yesus Kritos, and believe that his second coming is imminent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Accordingly, they do not share the view of other Rastas that Haile Selassie was the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}}

===Haile Selassie===

From Rastafari's origins, the religion was intrinsically linked with Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, who ruled as Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 to 1974.{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=960|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=32}} He remains the central symbolic figure in Rastafari ideology,{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=94}} and although all Rastas hold him in esteem, precise interpretations of his identity differ.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=34}} The Makonnen dynasty, of which Haile Selassie was a member, claimed descent from the Biblical figures [[Solomon]] and the [[Queen of Sheba]], a belief that many Rastas share.{{sfnm|1a1=Soumahoro|1y=2007|1p=44|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=960}} However, historians agree that this alleged [[Solomonic dynasty|"Solomonic" lineage]] was broken multiple times in history, and probably a 13th-century [[invented tradition]] to justify [[Yekuno Amlak]]'s new reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Briggs |first=Philip |date=2015 |title=Ethiopia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU_fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46 |publisher=Bradt Travel Guides |page=46 |isbn=9781841629223 |accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understandings of how Haile Selassie relates to Jesus differ among Rastas.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} Many, although not all, view the Ethiopian king as [[Second Coming]] of Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=67|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2pp=961, 964}} In this, Haile Selassie is also believed to be the [[messiah]] predicted in the Biblical [[Old Testament]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=15–16, 66|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=966|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=32–33}} and as the manifestation of God in human form,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=34}} and therefore "the living God".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=65|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2p=264}} Some perceive him as part of a [[Trinity]], alongside God as Creator and the [[Holy Spirit]], which is sometimes referred to among Rastas as "the Breath within the temple".{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=36}} Among those Rastas claiming a link between the two figures, some point to the belief that both Jesus and Haile Selassie were descendants from the royal line of [[David]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}}  Rastas also cite their interpretation of chapter 19 in the Book of Revelation.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=67}} 

Other Rastas see Selassie as embodying Jesus' teachings and essence but not being the reincarnated Jesus himself.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=964}} From this perspective, Haile Selassie is perceived as a messenger or emissary of God rather than a manifestation of God himself.{{sfnm|1a1=Middleton|1y=2006|1p=159|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=34}} This attitude may be more pervasive among Rastas living in Africa itself, who are more familiar with the realities of the continent's political problems.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=59}} Rastas holding to this view sometimes regard the deification of Haile Selassie as naïve or ignorant;{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=59}} there are various Rastas who went from believing that Haile Selassie was both God incarnate and the Second Coming of Jesus to seeing him as something distinct.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=968}}

[[File:Addis Ababa-8e00855u.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Haile Selassie, considered by Rastas to be the reincarnation of Christ.]]
On being crowned, Haile Selassie was given the title of "King of Kings and Lord of Lords, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}} Rastas use this title for Haile Selassie alongside others, such as "Almighty God", "Judge and Avenger", "King Alpha and Queen Omega", "Returned Messiah", "Elect of God", and "Elect of Himself".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=66}} Rastas also view Haile Selassie as a symbol of their positive affirmation of Africa as a source of spiritual and cultural heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}}

During the 1960s, many Jamaican Rastas professed the belief that Haile Selassie would never die.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=36}} The 1974 overthrow of Haile Selassie by the military [[Derg]] and his subsequent death in 1975 resulted in a crisis of faith for many Rastas.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=59|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=36–37}} Some practitioners left the movement altogether.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=63}} Others remained, and developed new strategies for dealing with the news. Some Rastas believed that Selassie did not really die and that claims to the contrary were Western misinformation.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=60|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37|3a1=Middleton|3y=2006|3p=158}} To bolster their argument, they pointed to the fact that no corpse had been produced; in reality, Haile Selassie's body had been buried beneath a toilet in his palace, remaining undiscovered there until 1992.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} To support their claim of his continued survival, some Rastas claimed that Selassie was now living under a new name, Abba Keddus or Abba Keddus Keddus Keddus.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Makeda Blake Hannah, ''Rastafari – The New Creation'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Another perspective within Rastafari acknowledged that Haile Selassie's body had perished, but claimed that his inner essence survived as a spiritual force.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=60|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=253|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=37}} A third response within the Rastafari community was that Selassie's death was inconsequential as he had only been a "personification" of Jah rather than Jah himself.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=60}}

During his life, Selassie described himself as a devout Christian.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}}
In a 1967 interview when a Canadian interviewer mentioned the Rastafari belief that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref name="Spencer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=William David|title=Dread Jesus|date=1998|publisher=SPCK Publishing|isbn=978-0281051014|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; he responded by saying: "I have heard of this idea. I also met certain Rastafarians. I told them clearly that I am a man, that I am mortal, and that I will be replaced by the oncoming generation, and that they should never make a mistake in assuming or pretending that a human being is emanated from a deity." His grandson [[Ermias Sahle Selassie]] has said that there is "no doubt that Haile Selassie did not encourage the Rastafari movement".&lt;ref name="MacLeod"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacLeod|first1=Erin C.|title=Visions of Zion: Ethiopians and Rastafari in the Search for the Promised Land|date=2014|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-1479882243|pages=70–71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yN9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22I+also+met+certain+Rastafarians.+I+told+them+clearly+that+I+am+a+man,+that+I+am+mortal,+and+that+I+will+be+replaced+by+the+oncoming+generation,+and+that+they+should+never+make+a+mistake+in+assuming+or+pretending+that+a+human+being+is+emanated+from+a+deity.#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20also%20met%20certain%20Rastafarians.%20I%20told%20them%20clearly%20that%20I%20am%20a%20man%2C%20that%20I%20am%20mortal%2C%20and%20that%20I%20will%20be%20replaced%20by%20the%20oncoming%20generation%2C%20and%20that%20they%20should%20never%20make%20a%20mistake%20in%20assuming%20or%20pretending%20that%20a%20human%20being%20is%20emanated%20from%20a%20deity.&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some Rastas, Haile Selassie's denials are taken as evidence was that he was indeed the incarnation of God.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} However, critics of the religion have insisted that Haile Selassie was merely a human being who never claimed to be God.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

===Afrocentrism, Babylon, and Zion===

[[File:Ethiopia (Africa orthographic projection).svg|thumb|right|The eastern African nation of Ethiopia is given great prominence in Rasta doctrine]]
According to Clarke, Rastafari is "concerned above all else with black consciousness, with rediscovering the identity, personal and racial, of black people".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} The Rastafari movement began among Afro-Jamaicans who wanted to reject the British imperial culture that dominated Jamaica, while at the same time making a determined effort to create an identity based on a re-appropriation of their African heritage.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=1}} Rastas equate blackness with the African continent and thus endorse a form of [[Pan-Africanism]].{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} Practitioners of Rastafari identify themselves with the ancient [[Israelites]]—God's chosen people in the [[Old Testament]]—and believe that black Africans or Rastas are either the descendants or reincarnations of this ancient people.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=129|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=17|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=111|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=38}}
Rastafari espouses the view that the true identity of black Africans has been lost and needs to be reclaimed.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} In reclaiming this identity, Rastas believe, they will help to rid themselves of feelings of inferiority.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}

Rastafari teaches that the black African diaspora are exiles living in "Babylon", a term applied to [[Western world|Western society]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} For Rastas, European [[colonialism]] and global [[capitalism]] are regarded as manifestations of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=38–40}} while police and soldiers are viewed as its agents.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=175–176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=40}} The term "Babylon" is adopted because of its Biblical associations. In the Old Testament, [[Babylon]] is the [[Mesopotamia]]n city which conquered and deported the Israelites from their homeland between 597 and 586 BCE.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} In the [[New Testament]], "Babylon" is used as a euphemism for the [[Roman Empire]], which was regarded as acting in a destructive manner akin to the ancient Babylonians.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=38}} Rastas view Babylon as being responsible for both the [[Atlantic slave trade]] which removed enslaved Africans from their continent and for the ongoing poverty facing the African diaspora.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas turn to scripture to explain the Atlantic slave trade.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=19}} Rastas believe that the slavery, exile, and exploitation of black Africans was punishment for failing to live up to their status as Jah's chosen people.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=69|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=111}}

For Rastas, Babylon is regarded as the ultimate [[evil]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=173}} Rastas regard the exile of the black African diaspora in Babylon as an experience of great suffering,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}} with the term "suffering" having a significant place in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=71}} Rastas seek to delegitimise and destroy Babylon, something often conveyed in the Rasta aphorism "Chant down Babylon".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Practitioners are often critical of Western resource extraction from Africa, seeing it as a form of exploitation akin to the Atlantic Slave Trade.{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} Adopting a Pan-Africanist ethos, many Rastas have criticised the division of Africa into nation-states, again regarding this as a Babylonian development.{{sfn|White|2010|p=317}} Rastas often expect white-dominated society to dismiss their beliefs as false, and when this happens it is seen as confirmation of the correctness of their faith, thus strengthening their convictions.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=77}}

[[File:Ethiopia - Location Map (2013) - ETH - UNOCHA.svg|thumb|left|Map of Ethiopia, the "Zion" of the Rastas]]
Rastas view "[[Zion]]" as an ideal to which they aspire.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} As with "Babylon", this is again a term derived from the Bible, where it referred to an idealised [[Jerusalem]], regarded as the City of God.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=40}} Rastas use the term in reference either to Ethiopia or to Africa more widely, a land which has an almost mythological identity in Rasta discourse.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} In doing so, Rastas reflect their desire to escape what they perceive as the domination and degradation that they experience in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} During the first three decades of the Rastafari movement, it placed strong emphasis on the need for the African diaspora to be repatriated to Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} To this end, various Rastas lobbied the Jamaican government and [[United Nations]] to oversee this resettlement process.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Other Rastas organised their own transportation to the African continent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=41}} Critics of the movement have argued that the migration of the entire African diaspora to Africa is implausible, particularly as no African country would welcome this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

By the movement's fourth decade, the desire for physical repatriation to Africa had declined among Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} This change in view was influenced by observation of the [[1983-1985 famine in Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=99}} Rather, many Rastas saw the idea of returning to Africa in a metaphorical sense, entailing restoring their pride and self-confidence as people of black African descent.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=100|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=42}} The term "liberation before repatriation" began to be used within the movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=33|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=172|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=42}} Some Rastas seek to transform Western society so that they may more comfortably live within it rather than seeking to move to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} There are nevertheless many Rastas who continue to emphasise the need for physical resettlement of the African diaspora in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Some Rastas living elsewhere in Africa see no need to migrate to Ethiopia specifically because they believe that all of Africa falls under the Biblical understanding of "Ethiopia"; thus, Rastas in Ghana for instance described themselves as already living within "Ethiopia".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=163}}

There is no uniform Rasta view on race.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Rastas typically believe that black Africans are God's [[chosen people]], meaning that they made a deal with him and thus have a special responsibility.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} This is similar to beliefs in [[Judaism]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Influenced by Garvey, many Rastas endorse [[black supremacy]], believing the black African race to be superior to other racial groups.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}} This has opened the religion up to accusations of [[racism]] from its critics, including black Jamaicans.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=149|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=81}} Cashmore noted that there was an "implicit potential" for racism in Rasta beliefs but that racism was not "intrinsic" to the religion.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=150}} Some Rastas have acknowledged that there is racism in the movement, primarily against Europeans, Asians, and also against white European Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} Some Rasta sects reject the idea that a white European could ever be a legitimate Rasta,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=81}} while others believe that an "African" identity is not inherently linked to black skin but rather is about whether an individual displays an African "attitude" or "spirit".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}}

====Salvation and paradise====

Rastafari has been characterised as a [[Millenarianism|millenarianist]] movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=7–8|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=248–249}} for it espouses the idea that the present age will come to an apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11}} With Babylon destroyed, Rastas believe that humanity will be ushered into a "new age".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=129}} In the 1980s, Rastas believed that this would happen around the year 2000.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=11, 69}} In this Day of Judgement, Babylon will be overthrown,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}} and Rastas would be the chosen few who survive.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=134}} A common view in the Rasta community was that the world's white people would wipe themselves out through [[nuclear war]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}} with black Africans then ruling the world, something that they argue is prophesied in Daniel 2: 31–32.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=119}}
In Rasta belief, the end of this present age would be followed by a millennium of peace, justice, and happiness in Ethiopia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=11}} The righteous will live in paradise in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}} Those who had supported Babylon will be denied access to paradise.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=70}}
The Rasta conception of salvation has similarities with that promoted in [[Judaism]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=69}}

Rastas do not believe that there is a specific [[afterlife]] to which human individuals go following bodily death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} They believe in the possibility of eternal life,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=108}} and that only those who shun righteousness will actually die.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=75|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=112}} One Rasta view is that those who are righteous are believed to go through a process of [[reincarnation]],{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=74}} with an individual's identity remaining throughout each of their incarnations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=76}}
Barrett observed some Jamaican Rastas who believed that those Rastas who did die had not been faithful to Jah.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=112}} He suggested that this attitude stemmed from the large numbers of young people that were then members of the movement, and who had thus seen only few Rastas die.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=113}}
In keeping with their views on death, Rastas eschew celebrating physical death and often avoid funerals,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=75}} also repudiating the practice of [[ancestor veneration]] that is common among [[African traditional religion]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=73}}

===Morality, ethics, and gender roles===

[[File:Rasta Man Barbados.jpg|thumb|Rastaman in [[Barbados]], wearing the Rastafari colours of green, gold, red and black on a [[rastacap]].]]
Most Rastas share a pair of fundamental moral principles known as the "two great commandments".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=79}} These are love of God and love of neighbour.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=79}} Rastafari promotes the idea of "living naturally",{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=79|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} in accordance with what Rastas regard as nature's laws.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} It endorses the idea that Africa is the "natural" abode of black Africans, a continent where they can live according to African culture and tradition and be themselves on a physical, emotional, and intellectual level.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=82}} Practitioners believe that Westerners and Babylon have detached themselves from nature through technological development and as a result have become debilitated, slothful, and decadent.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} Some Rastas express the view that they should adhere to what they regard as African laws rather than the laws of Babylon, thus defending their involvement in certain acts which may be illegal in the countries that they are living in.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=177}}

Rastafari promotes what it regards as the restoration of black manhood, believing that men in the African diaspora have been emasculated by Babylon.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=96}} Rastafari espouses [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] principles,{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=13|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=241|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=95}} and promotes the idea that women should submit to male leadership.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=96}} External observers—including scholars like Cashmore and Edmonds{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=178|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=95}}—have claimed that Rastafari accords women an inferior position to men.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=85}} Rastafari women usually accept this subordinate position and regard it as their duty to obey their men;{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=178}} the academic Maureen Rowe suggested that women were willing to join the religion despite its restrictions because they valued the life of structure and discipline it provided.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=16}} Rasta discourse often presents women as morally weak and susceptible to deception by [[evil]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} and claims that they are impure during their period of [[menstruation]].{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Rastafari mirrored the views on gender which were common in Jamaican society more broadly;{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=87}} however, it has retained its commitment to patriarchy while Jamaican society has moved toward greater gender equity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}} Rastas legitimise these gender roles by citing Biblical passages, particularly those in the [[Book of Leviticus]],{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} and in the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=97}}

Rasta women usually wear clothing that covers their head and masks their body contours, in a manner akin to [[hijab|traditional Islamic clothing]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=98}} Long skirts are usually worn rather than trousers,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} and women are expected to cover their head while praying.{{sfn|Rowe|1980|p=15}} Rasta discourse legitimises this female dress code with the claim that it is necessary to prevent women attracting men; it also endorses this female dress code as an antidote to the [[sexual objectification]] of women in Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=98, 99}} Rasta men are permitted to wear whatever they choose.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=98}} Although men and women took part in early Rasta rituals alongside each other, from the late 1940s and 1950s a more radical movement within the Rasta community encouraged gender segregation for ceremonies.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}} This was legitimised with the explanation that women were impure through menstruation and that their presence at the ceremonies would distract male participants.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=95}}

As it existed in Jamaica, Rastafari was not monogamous.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=38}} Rasta men are permitted to have multiple female sex partners, while women are expected to reserve their sexual activity for their one male partner.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Marriage is not usually formalised through legal ceremonies,{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=38|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88}} although there are many Rastas who are legally married.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=78–79}} Rasta men refer to their female partners as "queens",{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=79|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=109}} or "empresses",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}} while the males in these relationships are known as "kingmen".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=99}} Rastafari places great importance on family life and the raising of children,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=87–88}} with reproduction being encouraged.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=37}} The religion emphasises the place of men in child-rearing, associating this with the recovery of African manhood.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=103–104}} Women often work, sometimes while the man is left to raise the children at home.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Rastafari typically rejects [[feminism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1pp=178–179|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=87}} although since the 1970s there have been increasing numbers of Rasta women calling for greater gender equity within the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=107}} Clarke encountered Rasta women in Britain who expressed feminist sentiment and criticised [[sexism]] within the religion,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=87}} while the scholar Terisa E. Turner encountered black feminists in Kenya who were appropriating Rastafari and redefining its content to suit their political agenda.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=86}} Some Rasta women have challenged gender norms by wearing their hair uncovered in public and donning trousers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=109}}

Both [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] are usually censured by Rastas,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=79|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=209|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=99}} and a common claim in Rasta discourse is that these were inventions of Babylon created in an attempt to decrease the black African birth-rate.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=37|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=88|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=100|4a1=Sibanda|4y=2016|4p=192}} Rastas also typically express [[homophobia|hostile attitudes to homosexuality]], regarding homosexuals as evil and unnatural;{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=79|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3pp=180, 181, 191}} this attitude derives from [[The Bible and homosexuality|references to same-sex sexual activity in the Bible]].{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} In the 1960s, the scholar Sheila Kitzinger suggested that this horror of homosexuality "may be an indication of a heterosexuality which is not markedly pronounced" among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Kitzinger|1966|p=35}} The scholar of religion Fortune Sibanda suggested that there were likely homosexual Rastas who deliberately concealed their sexual orientation because of these attitudes.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}} Rastas typically see the growing acceptance of birth control and homosexuality in Western society as evidence of the degeneration of Babylon as it approaches its apocalyptic end.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=178–179}}

Some Rastas have promoted activism as a means of achieving socio-political change, while others believe in awaiting change that will be brought about through divine intervention in human affairs.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In Jamaica, Rastas do not typically vote and derogatorily dismiss politics as "politricks".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=220}} Similarly, some Ghanaian Rastas were reported as refusing to vote in the [[Ghanaian general election, 2000|2000 general election]], believing that salvation would only come through livity, not political activity.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=164}} The Rasta tendency to believe that socio-political change is inevitable opens the religion up to the criticism from the political left that it encouraged adherents to do little or nothing to change the status quo.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|pp=175–176, 179}} Most of these Jamaican practitioners have rejected both [[capitalism]] and [[socialism]] as models of economic development.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=225}} Other Rastas do engage in political activism; the Ghanaian Rasta singer-songwriter [[Rocky Dawuni]] for instance has been involved in campaigns promoting [[social justice]], [[environmental justice]], and democratic elections.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=165–167}} In the example of Grenada, many Rastas joined the [[People's Revolutionary Government (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Government]] which was formed in 1979, although Marxist-Leninist factions later turned against them.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=205}}

==Practices==

The cultural and religious practices of Rastafari are referred to as "livity" by Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}}
Rastafari has no professional priesthood,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=32}} with Rastas believing that there is no need for a priest to act as mediator between the worshipper and divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}} There are individuals who are regarded as elders within the community.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} This is an honorific title bestowed upon those who have attained a good reputation among Rastas because of their exemplary conduct.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Although respected figures, they do not necessarily have any administrative functions or responsibilities among Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} Elders are often in communication with each other through a network.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}}

===Grounding===

[[File:Rastafarians celebrate Marcus Garvey.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Rastas in the West African country of Liberia]]
The term "grounding" is used among Rastas to refer to the establishment of relationships between like-minded practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Groundings often take place in a commune or yard, and are presided over by an elder.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} The elder is charged with keeping discipline in the group, and can ban those who contravene the rules that they set forth.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=57}} The number of participants can range from a handful to several hundred.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Activities that take place at groundings include the playing of drums, chanting, the singing of hymns, and the recitation of poetry.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Ganja, or cannabis, is often smoked.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=88|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=54}} Most groundings contain only men, with women being excluded.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}} Some Rasta women have established their own, all-female grounding circles.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=100}}

One of the central activities that takes place at groundings is "[[reasoning (Rastafari)|reasoning]]".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} This is a discussion among assembled Rastas about the religion's principles and their relevance to current events.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} These discussions are supposed to be non-combative, although attendees can point out the fallacies in any arguments that are presented.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=56–57}} Those assembled inform each other about the revelations that they have received through meditation and dream.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} Each contributor is supposed to push the boundaries of understanding until the entire group has gained greater insight into the topic under discussion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=57}} Cashmore observed that in England, Rastas arrived and left throughout the reasoning session.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=10–11}} In meeting together with likeminded individuals, reasoning helps Rastas to reassure one another of the correctness of their beliefs.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=127}}

Rastafari meetings are opened and closed with prayers.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} Barrett suggested that the most common example had "all the structure of a classical ritual prayer".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} This prayer involves supplication of God, the supplication for the hungry, sick, and infants, calls for the destruction of the Rastas' enemies, and then closes with statements of adoration.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=Princes shall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia shall stretch forth her hand unto God. Oh thou God of Ethiopia, thou God of divine majesty, thy spirit come within our hearts to dwell in the parts of righteousness. That the hungry be fed, the sick nourished, the aged protected, and the infant cared for. Teach us love and loyalty as it is in Zion.|source=— Opening passage of a common Rasta prayer{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=125}} }}

The largest groundings were known as "groundations" or "grounations" in the 1950s, although were subsequently re-termed "Nyabinghi Issemblies".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=58–59}} The term [[Nyabinghi]] is adopted from the name of a mythical African queen.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=59}} Several dates are often selected for Nyabinghi Issemblies, particularly those associated with Ethiopia and Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}} These include Ethiopian Christmas (7 January), the day on which Haile Selassie visited Jamaica (21 April), Selassie's birthday (23 July), Ethiopian New Year (11 September), Selassie's coronation day (2 November).{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}} Some Rastas also organise Nyabinghi Issemblies to mark Jamaica's Emancipation Day (1 August) and [[Marcus Garvey]]'s birthday (17 August).{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=60}}

Nyabinghi Issemblies typically take place in rural areas, being situated in the open air or in temporary structures—known as "temples" or "tabernacles"—which are specifically constructed for the purpose.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} Any elder seeking to sponsor a Nyabinghi Issembly must have approval from other elders to do so, and requires the adequate resources to organise such an event.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=60–61}} The assembly usually lasts between three and seven days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} During the daytime, those Rastas attending the event engage in food preparation, ganja smoking, and reasoning, while at night they focus on drumming and dancing around bonfires.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}}
Nyabinghi Issemblies often attract Rastas from a wide area, including from different countries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} They establish and maintain a sense of solidarity among the Rasta community and cultivate a feeling of collective belonging.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}} They also help to confirm Rastas' convictions in the veracity of Rastafari teaching.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=61}}

===Spiritual use of cannabis{{anchor|Cannabis}}===

{{See also|Cannabis and religion}}
[[File:Jamaican Man.jpg|thumb|right|Rastafari man carrying a basket]]
Clarke stated that the "principle ritual" of Rastafari was the smoking of ganja, or [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} Among the names that Rastas give to the plant are ''callie'', ''Iley'', "the herb", "the grass", and "the weed".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} When smoked in ritual contexts, Rastas often refer to it as "the holy herb".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} In addition to smoking it, Rastas also ingest cannabis in a tea, as a spice in cooking, and as an ingredient in medicine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}}
Cannabis is usually smoked during groundings,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=88}} although some Rastas smoke it almost all of the time.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}} Others have criticised this practice, believing that use of the drug should be restricted to groundings.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}}
However, not all Rastas use ganja,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Benard|2y=2007|2p=90|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=53}} explaining that they have already achieved a higher level of consciousness and thus do not require it.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}}

Rastas argue that the use of ganja is promoted in the Bible, specifically in Genesis 1: 29, Psalms 18:8, and Revelation 22:2.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=89|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=48}} Rastas portray cannabis as the supreme herb,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}} and regard it as having healing properties.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=89|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=48, 55}} They also eulogise it for inducing feelings of "peace and love" in those taking it,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}} and claim that it cultivates a form of personal introspection that allows the smoker to discover their inner divinity, or "InI consciousness".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=49, 55}} Some Rastas express the view that cannabis smoke serves as an incense that counteracts perceived immoral practices, such as same-sex sexual relations, in society.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=192}}

When meeting in a grounding, Rastas typically remove their head gear first.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} Rastas most often smoke cannabis through a form of large cigarette known as a [[spliff]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=130|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=56}} This is often rolled together while a prayer is offered to Jah; only once this is completed is the spliff then lit, enabling it to be smoked.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} At other times, cannabis is smoked not in a spliff but in a [[bong|water pipe]] referred to as a "chalice".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} There are different styles of chalices used by Rastas, including [[kutchie]]s, [[chillum (pipe)|chillum]]s, and [[steamer (appliance)|steamer]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}} The pipe is passed in a counter-clockwise direction around the assembled circle of Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=56}}

[[File:Cannabis Plant.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A flowering cannabis plant]]
By the 8th century, cannabis had been introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as "[[Cannabis sativa|dagga]]"&lt;ref&gt;Hamid, ''The Ganjah Complex: Rastafari and Marijuana'', introduction, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; and many Rastas say it is a part of their African culture that they are reclaiming.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 130 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes also referred to as "the healing of the nation", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Chevannes, ''Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews'', pp. 35, 85; Edmonds, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various methods of transmission that might explain how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari. One possible source was the African diasporic religion of [[Kumina]], based on the practices of [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] enslaved people and [[indentured labourers]] who were brought to Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's [[Saint Thomas Parish, Jamaica|Saint Thomas Parish]], where a prominent early Rasta, [[Leonard Howell]], lived during the period he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}}

A second possible source was the use of cannabis in various [[Hinduism|Hindu]] rituals.{{sfnm|1a1=Benard|1y=2007|1p=95, 96|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=55}} Hindu migrants arrived in Jamaica as indentured servants from [[British India]] between 1834 and 1917, and brought the use of cannabis with them.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} One Jamaican Hindu priest, Laloo, was one of Howell's spiritual advisors, and may have influenced his adoption of ganja.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} It is also possible that its adoption was also influenced by the widespread medicinal and recreational use of cannabis among Afro-Jamaicans in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=55}} Early Rastafarians may have taken an element of Jamaican culture which they associated with their peasant past and the rejection of capitalism and sanctified it by according it Biblical correlates.{{sfn|Benard|2007|pp=91–92}}

According to many Rastas, the [[Legal issues of cannabis|illegality of cannabis]] in many nations is evidence of [[persecution of Rastafari]]. They are not surprised that it is illegal, seeing it as a powerful substance that opens people's minds to the truth&amp;nbsp;– something the Babylon system, they reason, clearly does not want.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonds, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; In smoking an illegal substance, Rastas protest the rules and regulations of Babylon.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=129}} Rastas have advocated the legalisation of cannabis.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=184}} The Rasta usage of ganja has attracted much popular, scholarly, and legal debate.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=128}}

===Music===

[[File:ReggaeV4.0.png|thumb|right|A stylized Rastafari motif, depicting the Lion of Judah]]
Rastafari music developed at reasoning sessions,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} where drumming, chanting, and dancing are all present.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} Rasta music is performed to praise and commune with Jah.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} In performing it, Rastas also reaffirm their rejection of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Rastas believe that their music has healing properties, with the ability to cure colds, fevers, and headaches.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}} Many of these songs are sung to the tune of older Christian hymns,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=94|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=123|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=58}} but others are original Rasta creations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=94}}

The bass-line of Rasta music is provided by the [[akete]], a three-drum set, which is accompanied by [[percussion instruments]] like [[rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s and [[tambourine]]s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} A syncopated rhythm is then provided by the [[fundeh]] drum.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} In addition, a [[peta (drum)|peta]] drum improvises over the rhythm.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}} The different components of the music are regarded as displaying different symbolism; the bassline symbolises blows against Babylon, while the lighter beats denote hope for the future.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=58}}

As Rastafari developed, popular music became its chief communicative medium.{{sfn|King|2002|p=5}} During the 1950s, [[ska]] was a popular musical style in Jamaica, and although its protests against social and political conditions were mild, it gave early expression to the Rastafarians' social and political ideology.{{sfn|King|2002|p=4}} Particularly prominent in the connection between Rastafari and ska were the musicians [[Count Ossie]] and [[Don Drummond]].{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=24|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=115}} Ossie was a drummer who believed that black people needed to develop their own style of music;{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=93|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=162}} he was heavily influenced by [[Kumina]] and [[Burru]], two drumming styles developed by African-Jamaicans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} Ossie subsequently popularised this new Rastafari ritual music by playing at various groundings and groundations around Jamaica,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=113}} with songs like "Another Moses" and "Babylon Gone" reflecting this Rasta influence.{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}} Rasta themes also appeared in Drummond's work, with songs such as "Reincarnation" and "Tribute to Marcus Garvey".{{sfn|King|2002|p=24}}
Rasta ideas began to feature in the lyrics of [[mento]] songs, such as [[Lord Lebby]]'s "Ethiopia".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=115}} 

1968 saw the development of [[reggae]] in Jamaica, a musical style typified by slower, heavier rhythms than ska and the increased use of [[patois]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Although like [[calypso music|calypso]], reggae was a medium for [[social commentary]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=vii}} it demonstrated a wider use of radical political and Rasta themes than had previously been present in Jamaican popular music.{{sfn|King|2002|p=46}} Reggae artists incorporated Rasta ritual rhythms,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} and also adopted Rasta chants, language, motifs, and social critiques.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=117}} Songs like [[The Wailers]]' "[[African Herbsman]]" and "Kaya", and [[Peter Tosh]]'s "Legalize It" referenced marijuana use,{{sfn|King|2002|p=57}} while tracks like [[The Melodians]]' "[[Rivers of Babylon]]" and [[Junior Byles]]' "Beat Down Babylon" referenced the Rastafarian belief in Babylon.{{sfn|King|2002|p=56}} Reggae gained widespread international popularity during the mid-1970s,{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} coming to be viewed as music of the oppressed by black people in many different countries.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Its popularity led to the emergence of "pseudo-Rastafarians", individuals who adopted the cultural trappings of Rastafari—such as dreadlocks and marijuana use—without sharing the religion's beliefs.{{sfn|King|2002|p=100}} Many Rastas grew critical of reggae, believing that it had commercialised their faith.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Although reggae contains much Rastafari symbolism,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}} and the two have come to be widely associated,{{sfn|King|2002|p=xiii}} the connection between them is often exaggerated by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Most Rastas do not listen to reggae music.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=245}} Out of reggae came [[dub music]]; dub artists often employ Rastafari terminology, even when not Rastas themselves.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}

===Language and symbolism===

{{Main|Rastafari vocabulary}}
In the 1940s, a distinct form of Rasta language, often known as "dreadtalk", developed among Jamaican practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} Rastas typically regard words as having an intrinsic power,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} with Rastafari language reflecting Rastas' own experiences,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=45}} as well as fostering a group identity and cultivating particular values.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}}
Rastas seek to avoid language that contributes to servility, self-degradation, and the objectification of the person.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=92–93}} They believe that the [[English language]] is a tool of Babylon,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=46}} and thus by formulating their own language are launching an ideological attack on the integrity of the English language.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} The use of this language helps Rastas distinguish themselves from non-Rastas,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=93}} for whom—according to Barrett—Rasta rhetoric can be "meaningless babbling".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=103}}

[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975–1987).svg|thumb|left|Garvey adopted the three colours of the Ethiopian flag for his movement; Rastas in turn adopted the tricolour]]
When greeting one another, Rastas often say "Peace and Love".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=269}} Rastas make wide use of the pronoun "I".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=45}} The use of this word denotes the Rasta view that the self is divine.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=2, 38}} It also reminds each Rasta that they are a human being, not a slave, and that they have value, worth, and dignity as a human being.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} For instance, Rastas use "I" in place of "me", "I and I" in place of "we", "I-ceive" in place of "receive", "I-sire" in place of "desire", "I-rate" in place of "create", and "I-men" in place of "[[Amen]]".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=92}} Rastas refer to this process as "InI Consciousness" or "Isciousness".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=37}} Rastas typically refer to Haile Selaisse as "Haile Selassie I", thus indicating their belief in his divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=92|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=37}} Rastas also typically believe that the [[phonetics]] of a word should be linked to its meaning.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} For instance, Rastas often use the word "downpression" in place of "oppression" because oppression bears ''down'' on people rather than lifting them ''up'', with "up" being phonetically akin to the "opp-".{{sfnm|1a1=King|1y=2002|1p=xx|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} Similarly, they often favour "livicate" over "dedicate" because "ded-" is phonetically akin to the word "dead".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}}

Rastafarians often make use of the colours red, black, green, and gold.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Red, gold, and green were used in the [[Flag of Ethiopia|Ethiopian flag]] while, prior to the development of Rastafari, Garvey had used red, green, and black as the colours for his [[United Negro Improvement Association]].{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=159|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143|3a1=White|3y=2010|3p=307}} According to Garvey, the red symbolises the blood of martyrs, the black symbolises the skin of Africans, and the green represents the vegetation of the land.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=160|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=143}} Many Rastas endorse these associations to the colours.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} The colour gold is often included alongside Garvey's three colours; it has been adopted from the [[Flag of Jamaica|Jamaican flag]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=143}} and is often interpreted as symbolising the minerals and raw materials which constitute Africa's wealth.{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} Rastas often paint these colours onto their buildings, vehicles, kiosks, and other items,{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} or display them on their clothing, helping to demarcate Rastas from non-Rastas and allowing adherents to recognise their co-religionists.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=160}} As well as being used by Rastas, the colour set has also been adopted by Pan-Africanists more broadly, who use it to display their identification with Afrocentricity;{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} for this reason it was adopted on the flags of many post-independence African states.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}} Rastas often accompany the use of these three or four colours with the image of the Lion of Judah, also adopted from the Ethiopian flag and symbolizing Haile Selassie.{{sfn|White|2010|p=308}}

===Diet===
{{Main|Ital}}

[[File:Ital food - 01.jpg|thumb|right|An ital breakfast; ackee, plantain, boiled food, breadfruit, and mango-pineapple juice]]
Rastas seek to produce food "naturally",{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=83}} eating what they call [[ital]], or "natural" food.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=141|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=47}} This is often produced [[Organic farming|organically]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=47}} and locally.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=47}} Most Rastas adhere to the [[kosher|dietary laws]] outlined in the Old Testament's [[Book of Leviticus]], and thus avoid eating pork or crustaceans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=49}} Other Rastas remain totally [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=83|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=49|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} and also avoid the addition of any additives, including sugar and salt, to their food.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=141|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=49|3a1=Sibanda|3y=2016|3p=184}} Rasta dietary practices have come under ridicule from non-Rastas; in Ghana for example, where food traditionally includes a high meat content, the Rastas' emphasis on vegetable produce has led to the humorous comment from other Ghanaians that Rastas "eat like sheep and goats".{{sfn|White|2010|p=309}} In Jamaica, Rasta practitioners have commercialised ital food, for instance by selling fruit juices prepared according to Rasta custom.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=267}}

Rastafarians typically avoid food produced by non-Rastas or from unknown sources.{{sfnm|1a1=Kitzinger|1y=1966|1p=35|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=85|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=142|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=48}} Rasta men also refuse to eat food prepared by a woman while she was menstruating.{{sfnm|1a1=Rowe|1y=1980|1p=15|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=142}} They also avoid [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]],{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=85|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=131}} [[cigarettes]],{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=131|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=48}} and hard drugs such as [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=48}}

===Dreadlocks===

{{Main|Dreadlocks}}
[[File:Dreadlocked rasta.jpg|thumb|right|Rasta man with tuff dreads]]
Through their use of language, dress, dreaded hair, and lifestyle Rastas seek to draw a clear boundary between themselves and non-Rastas.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}} One of the "distinguishing mark[s] of the movement" is the formation of hair into [[dreadlocks]].{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} The formation of dreadlocks is Biblically inspired, legitimised by reference to the [[Book of Numbers]] (6: 5–6).{{sfnm |1a1= Clarke|1y= 1986|1p=89|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=137|3a1=Edmonds |3y= 2012|3p=43}} They are regarded as marking a covenant that the Rastas have made with God,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=89}} and are also regarded as a symbol of strength linked to the hair of the Biblical figure of [[Samson]].{{sfnm |1a1=Clarke|1y=1986 |1p= 90 |2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=137}}  Sometimes this dreadlocked hair is then shaped and styled, often inspired by a lion's mane symbolising Haile Selassie, who is regarded as "the Conquering [[Lion of Judah]]".{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=90 |2a1= Edmonds |2y=2012|2pp= 44, 45}} For Rastas, the wearing of dreads is a symbolic rejection of Babylon and a refusal to conform to its norms and standards regarding grooming aesthetics.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=157|2a1=Clarke |2y= 1986 |2p= 90|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=42}} They also reflect a commitment to the Rasta idea of 'naturalness'.{{sfn|Edmonds |2012 |p=44}} Rastas are often critical of black people who straighten their hair, believing that it is an attempt to imitate white European hair and thus reflects alienation from a person's African identity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p= 44}}

There are Rastas who do not wear their hair in dreadlocks; within the religion they are often termed "cleanface" Rastas.{{sfn |Barrett|1997|p=140}} Some Rastas have also joined the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the Christian organisation to which Haile Selassie belonged, and these individuals are required to not wear their hair in locks by the Church.{{sfnm |1a1= Cashmore |1y=1983|1pp=62–63|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=53}} Many Rastas also grow their beards long.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 92}}  In reference to Rasta hairstyles, Rastas often refer to non-Rastas as "baldheads",{{sfn |Edmonds|2012|p=45}} while those who are new to Rastafari and who have only just started to grow their hair into dreads are known as "nubbies".{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |p=140}} Members of the Bobo Ashanti sect of Rastas conceal their dreadlocks within turbans.{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |pp= 257–58}} The [[tam o' shanter (cap)|tam]] headdress worn by many Rastas is coloured green, red, black, and yellow to symbolise allegiance and identification with Ethiopia.{{sfn |Clarke |1986|p= 13}}

From the beginning of the Rastafari movement in the 1930s, adherents typically grew beards and tall hair, perhaps in imitation of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} The wearing of hair as dreadlocks then emerged as a Rasta practice in the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} Within the oral culture of the movement, there are various different claims as to how this practice was adopted.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} One claim is that it was adopted in imitation of certain African nations, such as the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Somalis]], or [[Oromo people|Oromo]], or that it was inspired by the hairstyles worn by some of those involved in the anti-colonialist [[Mau Mau Uprising]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=42}} An alternative explanation is that it was inspired by the hairstyles of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[sadhus]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp= 42–43}}

It has been suggested (e.g., Campbell 1985) that the first Rasta locks were copied from Kenya in 1953, when images of the independence struggle of the feared [[Mau Mau Uprising|''Mau Mau'' insurgents]], who grew their "dreaded locks" while hiding in the mountains, appeared in newsreels and other publications that reached Jamaica. However, a more recent study by Barry Chevannes&lt;ref&gt;Barry Chevannes, 1998, ''Rastafari and Other African-Caribbean Worldviews'', chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; has traced the first hairlocked Rastas to a subgroup first appearing in 1949, known as Youth Black Faith.

[[File:Rastafarian Man In Rasta Cap.jpg|thumb|left|Rastafari man in rastacap]]
The wearing of dreadlocks has faced opposition from other sectors of society; in Jamaica during the mid-20th century, teachers and police officers used to cut off the dreads of Rastas.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=139}}  In the United States, several public schools and workplaces have lost lawsuits as the result of banning locks. [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]] is an early example, and the victory of eight children in a suit against their [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] school was a landmark decision in favor of Rastafari rights. More recently, in 2009, a group of Rastafari settled a federal lawsuit with the Grand Central Partnership in New York City, allowing them to wear their locks in neat ponytails, rather than be forced to "painfully tuck in their long hair" in their uniform caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| via = The Associated Press |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/08/08/2009-08-08_rastafarians_win_suit_allowing_them_to_bare_dreadlocks_at_work.html |title=Rastafarians win suit allowing them to bare dreadlocks at work | work =NY daily news |date= August 8, 2009 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreadlocks remain socially stigmatised in many societies; in Ghana for example, they are often associated with the homeless mentally ill, with such associations of marginality extending onto Ghanaian Rastas.{{sfn|White|2010|p=310}}

Dreadlocks and Rastafari-inspired clothing have also been worn for aesthetic reasons by non-Rastas.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p= 90}} For instance, many reggae musicians who do not adhere to the Rastafari religion wear their hair in dreads.{{sfn|Barrett |1997 |p= 245}}  Many non-Rastafari of African descent wear locks as an expression of pride in their ethnic identity, or simply as a hairstyle, and take a less purist approach to developing and grooming them. The wearing of dreads also has spread among people of other ethnicities. Locks worn for stylish reasons are sometimes referred to as "bathroom locks", to distinguish them from the kind that are purely natural. Rastafari purists also sometimes refer to such dreadlocked individuals as "wolves", as in "a wolf in sheep's clothing", especially when they are seen as trouble-makers who might potentially discredit or infiltrate Rastafari.&lt;ref&gt;''Chanting Down Babylon'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of dreadlocks has also contributed to the negative view of Rastafari held by many non-Rastas, who regard it as wild and unattractive.{{sfn|Barrett |1997|p= ix}}

== History ==

The Rastafari movement developed out of the legacy of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], in which over ten million Africans were enslaved and transported from Africa to the Americas between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. Here, they were sold to European planters and forced to work on the plantations.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} Around a third of these transported Africans were relocated in the Caribbean, with under 700,000 being settled in Jamaica.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} On the island, the enslaved Africans were divided into a stratified system, with field workers on the lowest rung and house servants above them.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=2}} In 1834, slavery in Jamaica was abolished after the British government passed the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]].{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=24|2a1=Chevannes|2y=1994|2p=3}} Racial prejudice nevertheless remained prevalent across Jamaican society,{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} with the overwhelming majority of Jamaica's legislative council remaining white throughout the nineteenth century,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} and those of African descent being treated as [[second-class citizen]]s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=24}} With slavery abolished, formerly enslaved Africans and Afro-Jamaicans became free peasants.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=3}} In the three decades after emancipation, the [[Free Villages|Free Village]] system proliferated across Jamaica as non-conformist missionaries, particularly Baptist, purchased land from the large owners and sold it as smaller plots to former slaves.{{sfn|Chevannes|1994|p=4}}

Many Afro-Jamaicans joined Christian churches during the Great Revival of 1860–61.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=21}} They brought with them many inherited African beliefs and rituals, which syncretised with Christianity in various ways and to varying degrees.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=25}} Some of the new religions that emerged, such as Pukkumina, remained heavily based on traditional African religion, while others, like Revival Zion, were more fully Christian.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=25|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=22}} The majority of these groups practiced spiritual healing and incorporated drumming and chanting, counselling, and spirit possession into their structures.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}} Increasing numbers of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] missionaries from the United States arrived in Jamaica during the early twentieth century, reaching a climax in the 1920s.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=25}} They provided a way for black Jamaicans—who continued to live with the social memory of enslavement and who were denied any substantial participation in Jamaica's political institutions—to express their hopes, fears, and aspirations.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=26}}

===Ethiopianism, Back to Africa, and Marcus Garvey===

[[File:Marcus Garvey 1924-08-05.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Garvey, a prominent African nationalist theorist who heavily influenced Rastafari and is regarded as a prophet by many Rastas]]
According to the scholar of religion Ennis B. Edmonds, Rastafari emerged from "the convergence of several religious, cultural, and intellectual streams",{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=7}} while fellow scholar Wigmoore Francis described it as owing much of its self-understanding to "intellectual and conceptual frameworks" dating from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=52}} Both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back to Africa]] ethos remain "fundamental ingredients of Rastafarian ideology".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=27}} These two movements predated Rastafari and can be traced back to the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} 

In the nineteenth century, there were growing calls for the African diaspora located in Western Europe and the Americas to be resettled in Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} In that century, many members of the African diaspora were moved to Sierra Leone and Liberia.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=27–28}} Based in Liberia, the black Christian preacher [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]] began promoting African pride and the preservation of African tradition, customs, and institutions.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1pp=29–34|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=75–76|3a1=Francis|3y=2013|3pp=54–56}} Blyden sought to promote a form of Christianity that was suited to the African context,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=32–33}} and believed that black people had to acquire their own historical knowledge about themselves.{{sfn|Francis|2013|p=66}} The idea of the African diaspora's return to Africa was given impetus by the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948 as a nation-state for the [[Jewish diaspora]] to return to.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=18}}

Also spreading through Africa was Ethiopianism, a movement that accorded special status to the east African nation of Ethiopia because it was mentioned in various Biblical passages.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} For adherents of Ethiopianism, "Ethiopia" was regarded as a synonym of Africa as a whole.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=34}} Across the continent, although particularly in South Africa, Christian churches were established that referred to themselves as "Ethiopian"; these groups were at the forefront of the burgeoning [[African nationalism|African nationalist]] movement that sought liberation from European colonial rule.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=34–35}}

Garvey supported the idea of global [[Black separatism|racial separatism]] and rejected the idea that black people of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate ''en masse'' back to Africa.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=41–42}} His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}} He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=43}}

A rumour later spread that in 1916, Garvey had called on his supporters to "look to Africa" for the crowning of a black king; this quote was never verified.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=22|2a1=Soumahoro|2y=2007|2pp=38–39}} Soumahoro noted that this statement was "legendary".{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=38}} Rather, Garvey was critical of Haile Selassie for leaving Ethiopia at the time of the Italian Fascist occupation, describing the king as "a great coward" who rules a "country where black men are chained and flogged."{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;E. David Cronon, ''Black Moses'', University of Wisconsin Press, Madison (1955), 1966, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Rastafari does not promote all of the views that Garvey espoused, but nevertheless shares many of the same perspectives,{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=44}} with many Rastas regarding Garvey as a prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=35|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=7}} According to Soumahoro, Rastafari "emerged from the socio-political ferment inaugurated by Marcus Garvey",{{sfn|Soumahoro|2007|p=39}} while for Cashmore, Garvey was the "most important" precursor of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=3}}

===Haile Selassie and the early Rastas: 1930–1949===

[[File:Selassie restored.jpg|thumb|right|Selassie I in the 1930s]]
Emperor Haile Selassie was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. A number of Christian clergymen, among them Leonard Percival Howell, Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert, Henry Archibald Dunkley, and Hinds, claimed that Selassie's coronation was evidence that he was the black messiah that they believed was prophesied in the [[Book of Revelation]] (5:2–5; 19:16), the [[Book of Daniel]] (7:3), and the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] (68:31).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}} These preachers began promoting this idea within Kingston, and soon the message spread throughout 1930s Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}} Clarke stated that "to all intents and purposes this was the beginning" of the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 46}}

Over the following years, a number of street preachers—most notably [[Leonard Howell]], [[Archibald Dunkley]], [[Robert Hinds]], and [[Joseph Hibbert]]—began promoting the idea that Haile Selassie was the returned Jesus.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett |1y= 1997 |1p=81|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=9}} Howell has been described as the "First Rasta",&lt;ref&gt;''The First Rasta: Leonard Howell and the Rise of Rastafarianism'', Helene Lee, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and the "leading figure" in the early Rastafari movement.{{sfn |Barrett|1997|p=82}} Howell preached that black Africans were superior to white Europeans and that Afro-Jamaicans should owe their allegiance to Haile Selassie rather than to [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], King of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The island's British authorities arrested him and charged him with sedition, resulting in a two-year imprisonment.{{sfnm |1a1= Clarke |1y=1986|1p=46|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=85–86 |3a1= Edmonds |3y=2012|3pp=11, 13}} Following his release, Howell established the [[Ethiopian Salvation Society]] and in 1939 created a Rasta community known as Pinnacle, in St Catherine. The community attracted between 500 and 2000 people, who were largely self-sufficient.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p= 25 |2a1= Clarke|2y=1986|2p=46|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=86 |4a1= Edmonds |4y= 2012|4pp=13–14}} Police feared that Howell was training his followers for an armed rebellion and were angered that it was producing marijuana for sale among the wider community. They raided the community on several occasions and Howell was imprisoned for a further two years.{{sfnm |1a1= Cashmore |1y=1983|1p=26|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=87|3a1=Edmonds |3y= 2012|3pp=14–15}} On his release he returned to Pinnacle, but the police continued with their raids and shut down the community in 1954; Howell himself was committed to a mental hospital.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=87|2a1=Edmonds |2y= 2012|2p= 15}}

In 1936, Italy [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invaded and occupied Ethiopia]], with Haile Selassie going into exile. The event brought international condemnation and growing sympathy for the Ethiopian cause.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} In 1937, Selassie then created the [[Ethiopian World Federation]], which established a branch in Jamaica in 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore |1y= 1983 |1p=27|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p= 47|3a1= Barrett |3y= 1997 |3p= 89}} In 1941, the Italians were driven out of Ethiopia and Selassie returned.  For many Rastas, this event was interpreted as the fulfilment of an event described in the [[Book of Revelation]] (19:11–19).{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p= 47}}

===Subsequent development: 1950–present===

Rastafari's main appeal was among the lower classes of Jamaican society.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}} For its first thirty years, Rastafari was in a conflictual relationship with the Jamaican authorities.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=10}} Jamaica's Rastas expressed contempt for many aspects of the island's society, viewing the government, police, bureaucracy, professional classes, and established churches as instruments of Babylon.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} Relations between practitioners and the police were strained, with Rastas often being arrested for cannabis possession.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=49|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=93}} During the 1950s the movement grew rapidly in Jamaica itself and also spread to other Caribbean islands, the United States, and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=47}}

[[Image:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|thumb|left|Reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] did much to raise international awareness of the Rastafari movement]]
In the 1940s and 1950s, a more militant brand of Rastafari emerged.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=15}} The vanguard of this was the [[House of Youth Black Faith]], a group whose members were largely based in [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=16}}
Backlash against the Rastas grew after a practitioner of the religion allegedly killed a woman in 1957.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} In March 1958, the first Rastafarian Universal Convention was held in [[Back-o-Wall]], Kingston.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=50|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=92}} Following the event, militant Rastas unsuccessfully tried to capture the city in the name of Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=28|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3p=93}} Later that year they tried again in [[Spanish Town]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} The increasing militancy of some Rastas resulted in growing alarm about the religion in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=50}} According to Cashmore, the Rastas became "folk devils" in Jamaican society.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=28}} In 1959, the self-declared prophet and founder of the [[African Reform Church]], [[Claudius Henry]], sold thousands of black Jamaicans, including many Rastas, tickets for a ship that he claimed would take them to Africa. The ship never arrived and Henry was charged with fraud. In 1960 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the government.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=28–29|2a1=Clarke|2y=1986|2p=50|3a1=Barrett|3y=1997|3pp=95–98|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=19}} Henry's son was accused of being part of a paramilitary cell and executed, confirming public fears about Rasta violence.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1pp=29–30|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=98–99|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3pp=19–20}} Clamping down on the Rasta movement, in 1964 the island's government implemented tougher laws surrounding marijuana use.{{sfn|King|2002|p=79}}

At the invite of Jamaica's government, Haile Selassie visited the island for the first time in August 1966, with crowds of Rastas assembling to meet him at the airport.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2pp=158–160|3a1=King|3y=2002|3pp=82–83|4a1=Edmonds|4y=2012|4p=24}} The event was the high point for many of the religion's members.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} Over the course of the 1960s, Jamaica's Rasta community underwent a process of [[Charismatic authority#Routinizing_charisma|routinization]],{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=146}} with the late 1960s witnessing the launch of the first official Rastafarian newspaper, the [[Rastafarian Movement Association]]'s ''Rasta Voice''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=52}} The decade also saw Rastafari develop in increasingly complex ways.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}} During that decade, some Rastas began to reinterpret the idea that salvation required a physical return to Africa, instead interpreting salvation as coming through a process of mental decolonisation that embraced African approaches to life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=51}}

Whereas its membership had previously come predominantly from poorer sectors of Jamaican society, in the 1960s Rastafari began to attract support from more privileged groups like students and professional musicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=51|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=25}} The foremost group emphasising this approach were the Twelve Tribes of Israel, whose members came to be known as "Uptown Rastas".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=25}} Among those attracted to Rastafari in this decade were middle-class intellectuals like [[Leahcim Semaj]], who called for the religious community to place greater emphasis on scholarly social theory as a method of achieving change.{{sfn|King|2002|p=103}} Although some Jamaican Rastas were critical of him,{{sfn|King|2002|p=81}} many came under the influence of the Guyanese black nationalist academic [[Walter Rodney]], who lectured to their community in 1968 before publishing his thoughts as the pamphlet ''Groundings''.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=26}} Like Rodney, many Jamaican Rastas were influenced by the U.S.-based [[Black Power]] movement.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2pp=25–26}} After Black Power declined following the deaths of [[Malcolm X]], [[Michael X]], and [[George Jackson (activist)|George Jackson]], Rastafari filled the vacuum it left for many black youth.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=55}} 

[[File:Rasta vendor with hat and glass Obama mug Inauguration 2013.jpg|thumb|right|A Rasta vendor in the United States, 2013]]
In the mid-1970s, the international popularity of reggae exploded.{{sfn|King|2002|p=96}} The most successful reggae artist was Bob Marley, who—according to Cashmore—"more than any other individual, was responsible for introducing Rastafarian themes, concepts and demands to a truly universal audience".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=108}} The popularity of reggae led to a growth in "pseudo-Rastafarians", individuals who listened to reggae and wore Rasta clothing but whom did not share its belief system.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=100, 102}} Many Rastas were angered by these developments, believing that the popularity of reggae had commercialised their religion.{{sfn|King|2002|p=102}} Through reggae, Rasta musicians became increasingly important in Jamaica's political life during the 1970s.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=53}} In his desire to break from the past and move towards [[democratic socialism]], Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] courted and obtained support from Marley and other reggae musicians, helping to bolster his popularity with the electorate.{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=52|2a1=King|2y=2002|2pp=105, 108–111}} Manley described Rastas as a "beautiful and remarkable people",{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=ix}} and carried a cane, the "rod of correction", which he claimed was a gift from Haile Selassie.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=220|2a1=King|2y=2002|2pp=91–92|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=27}} Following Manley's example, Jamaican political groups increasingly employed Rasta language, symbols, and reggae references in their campaigns,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} while Rasta symbols became increasingly mainstream in Jamaican society.{{sfn|King|2002|p=106}} This helped to confer greater legitimacy on Rastafari,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=27}} with reggae and Rasta imagery being increasingly presented as a core part of Jamaica's [[cultural heritage]] for the marketing purposes of the growing tourist industry.{{sfn|King|2002|pp=121–122}}

Enthusiasm for Rastafari was likely dampened by the death of Haile Selassie in 1975 and then that of Marley in 1981.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=28}} During the 1980s, the number of Rastafarians in Jamaica declined,{{sfn|King|2002|p=120}} with Pentecostal and other Charismatic Christian groups proving more successful than Rastafari at attracting young recruits.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} Several publicly prominent Rastas converted to Christianity,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=29}} and two of those who did so—[[Judith Mowatt]] and [[Tommy Cowan]]—maintained that Marley had converted from Rastafari to Christianity, in the form of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]], during his final days.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=29–30}} The significance of Rastafari messages in reggae also declined with the growing popularity of [[dancehall]], a Jamaican musical genre that typically foregrounded lyrical themes of hyper-masculinity, violence, and sexual activity rather than religious symbolism.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} Since the mid-1990s, however, there was a revival of Rastafari-focused reggae associated with musicians like [[Anthony B]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Luciano]], [[Sizzla]], and [[Capleton]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=30}} From the 1990s, Jamaica also witnessed the growth of organised political activity within the Rasta community, seen for instance through campaigns for the legalisation of marijuana and the creation of political parties like the [[Jamaican Alliance Movement]] and the [[Imperial Ethiopian World Federation Incorporated Political Party]], none of which have attained more than minimal electoral support.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=30–31}}

==Organization==

Rastafari is not a homogeneous movement and has no single administrative structure,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} nor any single leader.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=91|2a1=King|2y=2002|2p=xvii}} Centralised and hierarchical structures are avoided by Rastas because they want to avoid replicating the formal structures of Babylon.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=52–53}} Rastas also tend to avoid hierarchic and bureaucratic structures because of the ultra-individualistic ethos that the religion promotes with its ideas about inner divinity.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=53}}

The structure of Rastafari groups is less like those of Christian denominations and is instead akin to the cellular structure of other African diasporic traditions like [[Haitian Vodou]], Cuban [[Santeria]], and Jamaica's [[Revival Zion]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=52}} Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to fashion a pan-Rasta unity movement, namely through the establishment of the [[Rastafari Movement Association]], which sought political mobilisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In 1982, the first international assembly of Rastafari groups took place in [[Toronto]], Canada.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} This and subsequent international conferences, assemblies, and workshops have helped to cement global networks and cultivate an international community of Rasta practitioners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=88–89}}

===Mansions of Rastafari===

{{Main|Mansions of Rastafari}}
Within Rastafari, there are distinct groups which display particular orientations.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} There are often referred to as "houses" or "mansions", in keeping with a passage from the [[Gospel of John]] (14:2): as translated in the [[King James Bible]], Jesus states "In my father's house are many mansions".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The three most prominent branches are the House of Nyabinghi, the Bobo Ashanti, and the Twelve Tribes of Israel, although other important groups include the Church of Haile Selassie I, Inc., and the Fulfilled Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}

====House of Nyabinghi====
The House of Nyabinghi is an aggregate of more traditional and militant Rastas who seek to retain the movement close to the way in which it existed during the 1940s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} They stress the idea that Haile Selassie was a manifestation of God and the reincarnation of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} The wearing of dreadlocks is regarded as indispensable,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} and patriarchal gender roles are strongly emphasised.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}} Nyabinghi Rastas refuse to make any compromise with Babylon, and are often critical of reggae musicians like Bob Marley whom they regard as having collaborated with the commercial music industry.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=59, 62}} According to Cashmore, the Nyabinghi House is "vehemently anti-white".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=25}} It is probably the largest Rastafari group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=62}}

====Bobo Ashanti====
The Bobo Ashanti sect was founded in Jamaica by [[Charles Edwards (Rastafarian)|Emanuel Charles Edwards]] through the establishment of his Ethiopia Africa Black International Congress (EABIC) in 1958.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/boboshanti.shtml |title=Bobo Shanti (Bobo Shanti Congress or Ethiopia Black International Congress) |publisher=BBC |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group established a commune in [[Bull Bay]], where they were led by Edwards, who served as the group's high priest, until his 1994 death.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group hold to a highly rigid ethos.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Edwards advocated the idea of a new trinity, with Haile Selassie as the living God, himself as the Christ, and Garvey as the prophet.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=182|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} Male members of the group are divided into two categories: the "priests" who conduct religious services and the "prophets" who take place in reasoning sessions.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Women are regarded as impure because of menstruation and childbirth, and so are not permitted to cook for men.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} The group teaches that black Africans are God's chosen people and thus are superior to white Europeans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Bob Ashanti practitioners will often refuse to associate with white people.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=157}} Members of this sect are recognisable by their attire, which include long, flowing robes and turbans.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}} Since the 1990s, increasing numbers of Bob Ashanti Rastas have lived outside the Bull Bay commune, but continue to regard the latter as a place of [[pilgrimage]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=64}}

[[File:Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters.jpg|thumb|left|Twelve Tribes of Israel headquarters in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia]]
====Twelve Tribes of Israel====
The Twelve Tribes of Israel sect was founded in 1968 in Kingston by [[Vernon Carrington]].{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=227|2a1=Bedasse|2y=2010|2pp=961, 962|3a1=Edmonds|3y=2012|3p=64}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/subdivisions/twelvetribes.shtml |title=Twelve Tribes of Israel |website=BBC |date=October 12, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded himself as the reincarnation of the Old Testament prophet [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], one of [[Jacob]]'s twelve sons, and his followers thus refer to him as "Prophet Gad", "Brother Gad", or "Gadman".{{sfnm|1a1=Bedasse|1y=2010|1p=962|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=64}} It is commonly regarded as the most liberal form of Rastafari and the closest to Christianity in its beliefs;{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=36}} Barrett stated that there was "only a thin line dividing the sect from true Christianity".{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=231}} Practitioners are often dubbed "Christian Rastas" because they believe Jesus is the messiah and only saviour; Haile Selassie is accorded importance, but is not viewed as the second coming of Jesus.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=67}} The group divides its members into twelve groups according to which month in the [[Hebrew calendar]] they were born; each month is associated with a particular colour, body part, and mental function.{{sfnm|1a1=Barrett|1y=1997|1p=229|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=65}} Maintaining dreadlocks and an ital diet are considered commendable but not essential,{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=66–67}} while adherents are called upon to read a chapter of the Bible each day.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Some Rastas regarded the Twelve Tribes as a heretical group for its views.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=323}} 

The Twelve Tribes peaked in popularity during the 1970s, when it attracted artists, musicians, and many middle-class followers, resulting in the term "middle-class Rastas" and "uptown Rastas" being applied to members of the group.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} Marley was one such of these musicians belonging to the Twelve Tribes.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Barrett|2y=1997|2p=230}} Carrington died in 2005, since which time the Twelve Tribes of Israel have been led by an executive council.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=68}} As of 2010, it was recorded as being the largest of the centralized Rasta groups.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|p=961}} It remains headquartered in Kingston, although has followers outside Jamaica.{{sfn|Bedasse|2010|pp=961–962}}

====Church of Haile Selassie====
The Church of Haile Selassie, Inc was founded by Abuna Foxe, and operated much like a mainstream Christian church, with a hierarchy of functionaries, weekly services, and [[Sunday schools]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=68–69}} In [[New York (state)|New York]], the group have established prison chaplains.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} In adopting this broad approach, the Church seeks to develop Rastafari's respectability in wider society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}

====Fulfilled Rastafari====
Fulfilled Rastafari is a multi-ethnic movement that has spread in popularity during the twenty-first century, in large part through the [[Internet]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The Fulfilled Rastafari group accept Haile Selassie's statements that he was a man and that he was a devout Christian, and so place emphasis on worshipping Jesus Christ through the example set forth by Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}} The wearing of dreadlocks and the adherence to an ital diet are considered issues up to the individual.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=69}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Born in the ghettos of Kingston, Jamaica, the Rastafarian movement has captured the imagination of thousands of black youth, and some white youth, throughout Jamaica, the Caribbean, Britain, France, and other countries in Western Europe and North America. It is also to be found in smaller numbers in parts of Africa—for example, in Ethiopia, Ghana, and Senegal—and in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among the Maori.|source=— Sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], 1986{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=17}} }}

As of 2012, there were an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas worldwide.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}} They can be found in many different regions, including most of the world's major population centers.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}}
Rastafari's influence on wider society has been more substantial than its numerical size,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1986|1p=14|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=71}} particularly in fostering a racial, political, and cultural consciousness among the African diaspora, Africans themselves, and other dominated communities across the world.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=71}}

The Rasta message resonates with many people who feel marginalised and alienated by the values and institutions of their society.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} In valorising Africa and blackness, Rastafari provides a positive identity for youth in the African diaspora by allowing them to psychologically reject their social stigmatisation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} It then provides these disaffected people with the discursive stance from which they can challenge capitalism and consumerism, providing them with symbols of resistance and defiance.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=89}} Cashmore expressed the view that "whenever there are black people who sense an injust disparity between their own material conditions and those of the whites who surround them and tend to control major social institutions, the Rasta messages have relevance."{{sfn|Cashmore|1984|p=3}} Benard was of the view that because of its stances on capitalism, European hegemony, and white racism, Rastafari is "easily incorporated into other nations with similar histories of European oppression".{{sfn|Benard|2007|p=90}}
According to sociologist of religion [[Peter B. Clarke]], Rastafari "helped to provide many people of African descent with a deeper sense of their African identity".{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=13}}

Men dominate Rastafari.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} In the religion's early years, most of its followers were men, and the women who did adhere to it tended to remain in the background.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=94}} This picture of Rastafari's demographics has been confirmed by ethnographic studies conducted in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=94–95}}

===Conversion and deconversion===

Rastafari is a non-missionary religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} However, elders from Jamaica often go "trodding" to meet with newly converted Rastas in order to instruct them in the fundamentals of the religion.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=85}} On examining the Rasta movement in England during the 1970s, Cashmore noted that Rastas had not converted instantaneously to the belief system, but rather had undergone "a process of drift" through which they gradually adopted Rasta beliefs and practices, resulting in their ultimate acceptance of the central importance of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=55}}
Rastas often claim that—rather than [[religious conversion|converting]] to the religion—they were actually always a Rasta and that their actual embrace of its beliefs was merely the realisation of this.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=6}} There is no formal ritual carried out to mark an individual's entry into the Rastafari movement.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=128}}

They regard themselves as an exclusive and elite community, membership of which is restricted to those who have the "insight" to recognise the importance of Haile Selassie.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=9}} Rastas often regard themselves as being the "enlightened ones" who have "seen the light".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} Many see no point in establishing good relations with non-Rastas, believing that the latter will never accept Rastafari doctrine as truth.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=57–58}} English Rastas have for instance expressed criticism of black Britons who have not embraced the religion, stating that they have been "brainwashed", "misguided by European Christianity", and "blinded by Babylon".{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=38}}

Some Rastas have left the religion. Clarke noted that among the British Rastas whom he communicated with, he found that some returned to Pentecostalism and other forms of Christianity, while others embraced [[Islam]] or no religion.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some of these British ex-Rastas described disillusionment when the societal transformation promised by Rasta belief failed to appear, while others felt that while Rastafari would be appropriate for agrarian communities in Africa and the Caribbean, it was not suited to the industrialised and materialistic society in the UK.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Some experienced disillusionment after developing the view that Haile Selassie had been an oppressive leader of the Ethiopian people.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=59}} Cashmore found that some of British Rastas who had more militant views left the religion after finding its focus on reasoning and musical outlets insufficient for the struggle against white domination and racism.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=97}}

===Jamaica and the Caribbean===

Barrett described Rastafari as "the largest, most identifiable, indigenous movement in Jamaica."{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=viii}}
As of the mid-1980s, there were approximately 70,000 members and sympathisers of the Rastafari movement in Jamaica.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} The majority of these individuals were male, working-class, former Christians aged between 18 and 40.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}} Jamaica is often valorised by Rastas as the fountain-head of their faith, and many Rastas living elsewhere travel to the island on [[pilgrimage]] in order to "drink from the source".{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=87}}

In the 2011 Jamaican census, 29,026 individuals identified themselves as Rastafari.&lt;ref name="state2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90259.htm |title=Jamaica |publisher=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (US State Department)|date=September 14, 2007 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources estimated that in the 2000s they formed "about 5% of the population" of Jamaica.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters AlertNet ([[Reuters Foundation]]):[http://www.alertnet.org/thefacts/countryprofiles/216645.htm?v=details Jamaica] (citing "NI World Guide 2003/2004"); ''The world guide: a view from the south'', [[New Internationalist]] Publications, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=1ETNTK_bCtTNjAevpqzXBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=qertAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=rastafarians+per+cent#search_anchor p. 312] ("Rastafarians 5 per cent")&lt;/ref&gt; Jamaica's Rasta population were initially entirely from the Afro-Jamaican majority,{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} and although most Jamaican Rastas remain Afro-Jamaican, it has also gained members from the island's [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaicans|Indian]], Afro-Chinese, Afro-Jewish, [[mulatto]], and [[White Jamaican|white]] minorities.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|pp=2–3}} Until 1965 the vast majority were from the lower classes, although since that point it attracted many middle-class members.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} By the 1980s, there were Jamaican Rastas working as lawyers and university professors.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=241}} The majority are male.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=2}} These Rastas are predominantly ex-Christians.{{sfn|Barrett|1997|p=3}}

During the 1970s, Rastafari ideas were spread through much of the eastern Caribbean through the growing popularity of reggae.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} Rasta ideas complemented the anti-colonial and Afrocentric views then prevailing in countries like Trinidad, Grenada, Dominica, and St Vincent.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=81}} In these countries, the early Rastas often engaged in cultural and political movements to a greater extent than their Jamaican counterparts had.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}} A number of Rastas were involved in Grenada's 1979 [[New Jewel Movement]] and were given positions in the Grenadine government until it was overthrown and replaced following the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of 1983]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=82}}

Reggae was introduced to Cuba in the 1970s by Jamaican students.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}} By the 1980s, underground reggae parties were being held in Havana and Santiago.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}} Foreign Rastas who were studying in Cuba during the 1990s connected with this reggae scene and helped to ground it in Rasta beliefs.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=82–83}}

===Africa===

Since the founding of Rastafari, some practitioners have followed through with their belief in resettlement in Africa.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} The West African states of Ghana and Nigeria have been particularly favoured.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=78}} Ghana's status as the first African country to gain independence from European colonial rule (in 1957) made it an attractive place for members of the African diaspora to migrate to; its first post-independence President, [[Kwame Nkrumah]], encouraged this as part of his Pan-African ethos. Among the Caribbean immigrants to arrive in the country during the 1960s were Rastafarians, while some native Ghanaians also converting to the religion.{{sfn|White|2010|pp=304, 306–307}} When asked as to why they chose Ghana as a new home, several of the Rasta arrivals described it as the "gateway to the continent";{{sfn|White|2010|p=307}} others cited its political stability and affordability as making it ideal for settlement.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=160}} For his Pan-African efforts, Nkrumah has come to be regarded as a heroic figure among many Rastas, although other Ghanaians have been critical of what they perceive as excess idolisation of the former president.{{sfn|White|2010|p=313}} The largest congregation of Ghanaian Rastas has been in southern parts of the country, around [[Accra]], [[Tema]], and the [[Cape Coast]],{{sfn|White|2010|p=314}} although Rasta communities also exist in the Muslim-majority area of northern Ghana, especially in the towns of [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]] and [[Bolgatanga]].{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=152}} The Rasta migrants' wearing of dreadlocks was akin to that of the native [[fetish priest]]s, which may have assisted the presentation of these Rastas as having authentic African roots in Ghanaian society.{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=154–155}} Non-Ghanaian Rastas living in the country have nevertheless complained of social ostracism, unemployment, and legal prosecution for ganja possession;{{sfn|Middleton|2006|p=161}} Ghanaians who were not Rastas often accuse the Rastas of being "drop-outs", "too Western", and "not African enough".{{sfn|Middleton|2006|pp=161–162}}

[[File:Rasta Mural, Sheshemane (11417146756).jpg|thumb|left|Rasta mural in Ethiopia]]
In the 1960s, a Rasta community established itself in [[Shashamane]], Ethiopia, on land made available for members of the African diaspora by Haile Selassie's Ethiopian World Federation.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The community faced many problems; 500 acres were confiscated by the Marxist government of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]].{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} There were also conflicts with local Ethiopians, who largely regarded the incoming Rastas, and their Ethiopia-born children, as foreigners.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}} The Shashamane community peaked at a population of 2000, although subsequently declined to around 200.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=79}}

By the early 1990s, a Rasta community was present in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, whose approach to the religion was informed both by reggae and by traditional [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] religion.{{sfn|Turner|1991|p=82}}
Several Rastafari orders have also been established in Zimbabwe, all of which send representatives to the Rastafari Association of Zimbabwe.{{sfn|Sibanda|2016|p=182}}

At an [[African Union]]/[[Caribbean Diaspora]] conference in South Africa in 2005, a statement was released characterising Rastafari as a force for integration of Africa and the African diaspora.{{sfn|Newland|2013|p=225}}

===Western countries===

During the 1950s and 1960s, [[British African-Caribbean people|several thousand Caribbean migrants settled in the United Kingdom]], some of whom brought Rastafari with them.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1983|1p=54|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=72}} In 1955, a short-lived Rasta group was established in [[Brixton]], South London,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Cashmore|2y=1983|2p=54}} and by the latter part of the 1950s, a Rasta community had settled in the [[Notting Hill]] area of Northwest London.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} By the late 1960s, Rastafari had attracted converts from the second-generation of British Caribbean people, offering an outlet for the economic hardship, racial discrimination, and social isolation that many faced.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} It spread among the black working-classes not just of London, but also in [[Birmingham]], [[Leicester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], and [[Bristol]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} Its spread was aided by the [[gang]] structures that had been cultivated among black British youth by the [[rudeboy]] subculture; these gangs proved to be a breeding ground for Rastafari themes.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=56}} This social structure allowed for the promotion of in-gang associations and the restrictions of contacts with Babylon.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=57}} British Rastafari gained increasing attention in the 1970s as a result of reggae's popularity.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=176|2a1=Edmonds|2y=2012|2p=74}} In that same decade it also faced increasing opposition, being regarded as a criminal sub-culture by both much of the press,{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=58}} and by the police, resulting in complaints of police harassment.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|pp=74–75}} 

According to Clarke's research, the majority are from black working-class families who practiced Pentecostalism, although a small number are from white families.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|pp=53–54}} Cashmore found that the majority of British Rastas were male and that most had few or no educational qualifications.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|pp=76, 78}} He also found that around 50% of them were unemployed, and 45% employed in manual occupations; only 5% were in more skilled jobs or higher education.{{sfn|Cashmore|1983|p=70}} In 1986, there were an estimated 5000 Rastas living in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=14}} Clarke believed that there were "probably fewer members" at this time then there had been at the start of the 1980s, with the movement declining following Marley's death.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=61}} According to the [[2001 United Kingdom Census]] there are about 5000 Rastafari living in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/ataglance/glance.shtml |title=Rastafari at a glance |publisher=BBC |date=October 2, 2009 |accessdate=2012-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke described Rastafari as a numerically small but "extremely influential" component of black British life.{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=16}}

Rastafari was also established in various continental European countries, among them the Netherlands, Germany, Portugal, and France, gaining a particular foothold among black migrant populations but also attracting a growing number of white converts.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=83}}
Rasta communities were also established in two French cities that had substantial black populations, [[Paris]] and [[Bordeaux]].{{sfn|Clarke|1986|p=98}} In the Netherlands, it attracted converts within the [[Surinamese people in the Netherlands|Surinamese migrant community]].{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=173}}

Rastafari was introduced to the United States and Canada with the migration of Jamaicans to continental North America in the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=72}} As with the case in the UK, American police were often suspicious of Rastas and regarded their religion as a criminal sub-culture.{{sfn|Edmonds|2012|p=76}}

===Australasia and Asia===

Rastafari attracted membership from within the [[Māori people|Maori]] population of New Zealand,{{sfnm|1a1=Cashmore|1y=1981|1p=173|2a1=Benard|2y=2007|2p=90}} and the Aboriginal population of Australia.{{sfn|Cashmore|1981|p=173}}

A small Rasta community developed in [[Japan]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/history.shtml |title=Religions – Rastafari: Rastafarian history |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by a practitioner named Jah Hiro.{{sfn|King|2002|p=101}}

The '''Roof of the World''' or '''Top of the World''' is a metaphoric description of the high region in the world, also known as '''High Asia'''. The term usually refers to the mountainous interior of Asia, including the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], the [[Himalayas]], the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibet]], the [[Tian Shan]] and the [[Altai Mountains]].

== Attested usage ==
The British explorer [[John Wood (explorer)|John Wood]], writing in 1838, described ''Bam-i-Duniah'' (Roof of the World) as a "native expression" (presumably [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]]),&lt;ref&gt;Keay, John (1983) ''When Men and Mountains Meet'' {{ISBN|0-7126-0196-1}}; p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; and it was generally used for the Pamirs in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]]: In 1876 another British traveller, Sir [[Thomas Edward Gordon]], employed it as the title of a book&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/roworldanarrati00gordgoog/roworldanarrati00gordgoog_djvu.txt Sir Thomas Edward Gordon, ''The Roof of the World:''] '' being a narrative of a journey over the high plateau of Tibet to the Russian frontier and the Oxus sources on Pamir,''  Edinburgh: Edmonston and Douglas, 1876&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote in Chapter IX:
: '' "We were now about to cross the famous 'Bam-i-dunya','The Roof of the World' under which name the elevated region of the hitherto comparatively unknown Pamir tracts had long appeared in our maps.[...] Wood, in 1838, was the first European traveller of modern times to visit the Great Pamir,"''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, p. 121f.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Older encyclopedias also used "Roof of the World"  to describe the Pamirs:
*[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 11th ed. (1911): "PAMIRS, a mountainous region of central Asia...the Bam-i-dunya ('The Roof of the World')".&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/PAI_PAS/PAMIRS.html ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed.(1911)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spoons''' can be played as a makeshift [[percussion instrument]], or more specifically, an [[idiophone]] related to the [[castanets]]. They are played by hitting one spoon against the other.

== Techniques ==
# Fire [[tongs]] style : A pair of spoons is held tight with concave sides facing out and with index finger between their handles to space them apart. When the pair is struck, the spoons sharply hit each other and then spring back to their original position. The spoons are typically struck against the knee and the palm of the hand. The fingers and other body parts may also be used as striking surfaces to produce different sounds, rhythms, rattles and visual effects. 
# Salad serving style: one spoon between little, ring, and long finger; the other spoon between ring, thumb, and index finger in such a way that they can be rotated with ring finger as the common axis. They can be hit to each other at the convex sides by gathering the fingers (mostly middle and thumb).
# [[Castanets]] style, two in each hand one spoon held concave-side against the palm held down by the thumb, one between ring and middle fingers with finger tips in the concave side balancing the handle. They can be hit to each other at the convex sides by gripping with the middle and ring fingers.
# One spoon held concave-side against the palm, and handle jammed tight under the [[wrist watch]] belt, another in between ring and middle fingers of the left hand hitting the latter castanet style, and a third spoon in the right hand hitting both spoons in the left hand, [[drum stick]] style.

== American folk music ==
In the United States spoons as instrument are associated with [[American folk music]], [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]], and [[jugband|jug and spasm bands]]. These musical genres make use of other everyday objects as instruments, such as the [[washboard (musical instrument)|washboard]] and the [[Jug (musical instrument)|jug]]. In addition to common tableware, spoons that are joined at the handle are available from musical instrument suppliers.

==British folk music==
As percussion, spoons accompany [[fiddle]] playing and other folk sets. An example is seen in ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' Series 6, episode 2, where Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy plays the spoons at a house party joining a fiddle player who is entertaining the guests. He uses the first technique. The guests also contribute percussion by hand clapping in time with the music.

The song "[[This Old Man]]" refers to a related concept, except with [[Bones (instrument)|sheep bones]] (hence [[paddywhack]]) instead of spoons.

==Canadian folk music==
In Canada, the spoons accompany fiddle playing in Québecois and Acadian music. Also, Newfoundland and the Atlantic Provinces popularly play the spoons at family gatherings. Playing the spoons is rarely seen in Western Canada.

==Greek folk music==
The spoons in [[Greece]], as a percussion instrument are known as ''koutalakia'' ({{lang-el|κουταλάκια}}), which means also, spoon. The dancers hold the wooden koutalakia, to accompany with a variety of knocks their dance rhythms. The most of them, are very beautifully sculpted or painted.

== Russian folk music ==
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:WoodSpoon.jpg|thumb|250px|Russian Wooden Spoon {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;
Spoons are often used in [[ethnic Russian music]] and are known as ''lozhki'' ({{lang-ru|Ло́жки}} ''[plural]''; ''Pronunciation'': {{Audio|Ru-ложка.ogg|Ложка}} ''[singular]''). The use of ''spoons'' for music dating at least from the 18th century (and probably older).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.folkmusic.ru/logka.php| title= Wooden Spoons|publisher= FolkMusic.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, three or more wooden spoons are used. The convex surfaces of the bowls are struck together in different ways. For example, two spoons are held by their handles in the left hand, and the third, held in the right hand, is used to hit the two spoons in the left hand. The hit, in a sliding motion, produces a typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=44|title= Russian Folk Instruments -&gt; Lozhki|publisher= Slavyane.Nnov.ru|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090716014626/http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=44|archivedate= 2009-07-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=95|title= Russian Folk Instruments -&gt; Lozhki (maple)|publisher= Slavyane.Nnov.ru|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090716014630/http://slavyane.nnov.ru/index.phtml?lng=ru&amp;id=95|archivedate= 2009-07-16|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can also hold three spoons in the left hand and put a fourth into the bot or the pocket. A fifth spoon is then held in the right hand and used to hit the other four. Finally, one can hold the bowl of a single spoon in the left hand and hit it with another spoon. In this style, different sounds can be emitted by holding the bowl more or less tightly.

These wooden spoons are commonly used in performances of Russian folk music and sometimes even in Russian orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://folkinst.narod.ru/lozki.html| title=Ложки |publisher=Folkinst@narod.ru }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of a choir performing a Russian folk song with spoon and [[balalaika]] accompaniment can be found below.

==Turkish folk music==
[[Image:Satz Holzloeffeltanz-Kasiklar.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Dursunbey Barana ekibi.jpg|thumb|[[Balıkesir]] [[zeybek dance]]]]

Kaşık (spoon) is a Turkish and [[Uzbekistan]] percussion instrument. The ones made from [[Buxus|boxwood]] are particularly favoured. There are also different holding styles.
# The handle of one is taken between the long finger and ring finger, fingertips into the concave part, The Concave part of the second spoon is leaned against the base of the thumb in a back to back position with the first spoon. This is the most popular method used mostly with two spoons in each hand, hands up, dancing. Closing the fist clashes the pairs of spoons to each other. Sometimes the tips of the spoon handles in either hand are brushed against each other to get a different sound.
# The handle of one spoon is held by the ring finger, thumb, and pointing finger, the handle of the other spoon is placed behind the ring finger, but on the inside of the little finger and the long finger in a back to back position with the first spoon. The ring finger works like a hinge and helps to hold both spoons. clasping the fingers lightly causes the spoons to hit each other. This holding style is essentially the same as holding salad spoons for single hand serving; except for this purpose the spoons should not be back to back.
# The two spoons are held back to back on either side of the right hands index finger, the tips of the spoon handles are held lightly with the little and ring figers the spoons are then hit down to the leg, up to the inside of the left hand, left thumb and index finger hold lightly and let both handles slip through to get several spoon sounds in one up down movement,  spoon tips are allowed to skip over several left hand fingers or folds of the left sleeve to get a repetitive roll. This is the most popular method when sitting.
# The left hand holds spoons as in the first style, a third spoon is pushed under the strap of the watch, and the right hand holds the fourth spoon. This is used when sitting.

A '''star tracker''' is an optical device that measures the positions of [[star]]s using [[photocell]]s or a camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Star Camera |url=http://nmp.nasa.gov/st6/TECHNOLOGY/star_camera.html|publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 May 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054014/http://nmp.nasa.gov/st6/TECHNOLOGY/star_camera.html |archivedate=July 21, 2011 |date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the positions of many stars have been measured by astronomers to a high degree of accuracy, a star tracker on a [[satellite]] or [[spacecraft]] may be used to determine the orientation (or [[Attitude (geometry)|attitude]]) of the spacecraft with respect to the stars. In order to do this, the star tracker must obtain an image of the stars, measure their apparent position in the reference frame of the spacecraft, and identify the stars so their position can be compared with their known absolute position from a star catalog. A star tracker may include a processor to identify stars by comparing the pattern of observed stars with the known pattern of stars in the sky.

== History ==

Star trackers were{{when|date=July 2018}} an important part of early long-range [[ballistic missile]]s, in the era when [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) were not sufficiently accurate for intercontinental ranges. Selecting a guide star depends on the time, due to the Earth's rotation, and the location of the target. Generally, a selection of several bright stars would be used. For systems based solely on star tracking, some sort of recording mechanism, typically a [[magnetic tape]], was pre-recorded with a signal that represented the angle of the star over the period of a day. At launch, the tape was forwarded to the appropriate time. During the flight, the signal on the tape was used to roughly position a telescope so it would point at the expected position of the star. At the telescope's focus was a photocell and some sort of signal-generator, typically a spinning disk known as a ''chopper''. The chopper caused the star to repeatedly appear and disappear on the photocell, producing a signal that was then smoothed to produce an [[alternating current]] output. The phase of that signal was compared to the one on the tape to produce a guidance signal. The system could be further improved by combining it with an INS, in which case additional circuitry on the INS generated the reference signal, eliminating the need for the separate tape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Marvin |last=Hobbs |title= Basics of Missile Guidance and Space Techniques |publisher= [[Wildside Press]] |date=2010 |pages=1–104 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=a0TxaTq2rQIC&amp;pg=SA1-PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "stellar inertial" systems were especially common from the 1950s through the 1980s, although some systems use it to this day.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Star trackers, which require high sensitivity, may become confused by sunlight reflected from the spacecraft, or by exhaust gas plumes from the spacecraft thrusters (either sunlight reflection or contamination of the star tracker window). Star trackers are also susceptible to a variety of errors (low spatial frequency, high spatial frequency, temporal, ...) in addition to a variety of optical sources of error ([[spherical aberration]], [[chromatic aberration]], etc.). There are also many potential sources of confusion for the star identification [[algorithm]] ([[planets]], [[comets]], [[supernovae]], the [[bimodal]] character of the [[point spread function]] for adjacent stars, other nearby satellites, point-source light pollution from large cities on Earth, ...). There are roughly 57 bright [[List of selected stars for navigation|navigational stars]] in common use. However, for more complex missions, entire [[Ephemeris|star field databases]] are used to determine spacecraft orientation. A typical [[star catalog]] for high-fidelity attitude determination is originated from a standard base catalog (for example from the [[United States Naval Observatory]]) and then filtered to remove problematic stars, for example due to [[apparent magnitude]] variability, [[color index]] uncertainty, or a location within the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] implying unreliability. These types of star catalogs can have thousands of stars stored in memory on board the spacecraft, or else processed using tools at the [[ground station]] and then uploaded.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''The Erotic''' is a specialized term coined by writer and educator [[Audre Lorde]] in her essay "Uses of the Erotic: Erotic as Power". The Erotic is described as a source of personal power and political power. According to her it is often confused with the [[Pornography|pornographic]] and often seen as suspicious in a [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. The word 'erotic' is derived from the Greek word [[Eros (concept)|eros]]. Eros personifies "love in all its aspects".

== Beyond pornography==
According to Lorde, the erotic has often been confused with the pornographic, resulting in the terms being used interchangeably within western societies. Lorde dismantles this idea and explains that the two are opposites of each other. According to Lorde, "pornography is a direct denial of the power of the erotic, for it represents the suppression of true feeling". The erotic is defined by our deepest feelings within ourselves while the pornographic "emphasizes sensation" and completely dismisses feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lorde|first1=Audre|title=The Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power|url=http://uk.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/11881_Chapter_5.pdf|website=uk.sagepub|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catharine MacKinnon]] takes Lorde’s concept of pornography being used as a form of oppression and adds to it by asserting that pornography not only works to oppress the erotic power of women, but that it also suppresses women’s freedom of speech. Pornography eroticizes “the unspeakable abuse: the rape, the battery, the sexual harassment, the prostitution, and the sexual abuse of children. Only in the pornography it is called something else: sex, sex, sex, sex, and sex, respectively” which thus contributes to the perpetuation of inequality between men and women and leads to the normalization of these kinds of atrocities. 
The erotic power that Lorde claims “lies in a deeply female and spiritual plane” becomes twisted, perverted and used against women to maintain female subordination. MacKinnon connects these images and words to actual cases of rape and sexual assault in that it men take what they have seen in porn and then apply it to their own sexual interactions with women. She quotes a study that claims that men who watched pornography that depicted rape and sexual assault were more inclined towards aggressive behavior towards women and self-reported a greater likelihood that they would engage in acts of rape or sexual assault. These images desensitize men to this kind of aggressive behavior and therefore, when women claim to have been sexually assaulted or raped, their voices are not heard because being sexually assaulted or raped is an accepted part of culture represented in pornography. Pornography silences women because it steals their credibility and replaces it with mere “eroticism” which was originally a female ascribed power. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine|title=Pornography, Civil Rights, and Speech|journal=Readings in Moral Philosophy|date=2018|page=|pages=268-278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[macroeconomics]], the '''triangle model''' employed by [[new Keynesian economics]] is a model of inflation derived from the [[Phillips Curve]] and given its name by [[Robert J. Gordon]]. The model views inflation as having three root causes: [[built-in inflation]], [[demand-pull inflation]], and [[cost-push inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Gordon (1988), ''Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy'', 2nd ed., Chap. 22.4, 'Modern theories of inflation'. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the earliest theories of the Phillips Curve, the triangle model attempts to account for the phenomenon of [[stagflation]].

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held that true threats are not protected under the [[U.S. Constitution]] based on three justifications: preventing fear, preventing the disruption that follows from that fear, and diminishing the likelihood that the threatened violence will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|volume=81|publisher=N.Y.U.

The true threat doctrine was established in the 1969 Supreme Court case ''[[Watts v. United States]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{citation|volume=72|publisher=Fordham L.

District Court for violating a statute prohibiting persons from knowingly and willfully making threats to harm or kill the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The conviction was based on a statement made by Watts, in which he said, "[i]f they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is [[Lyndon B. Johnson|L.B.J.]]"&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; Watts appealed, leading to the Supreme Court finding the statute constitutional on its face, but reversing the conviction of Watts. 

In reviewing the lower court's analysis of the case, the Court noted that "a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech."&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; The Court recognized that "uninhibited, robust, and wideopen" political debate can at times be characterized by "vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials." In light of the context of Watts' statement - and the laughter that it received from the crowd - the Court found that it was more "a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President" than a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt; In so holding, the Court established that there is a "true threat" exception to protected speech, but also that the statement must be viewed in its context and distinguished from protected hyperbole. The opinion, however, stopped short of defining precisely what constituted a "true threat." &lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''type safety''' is the extent to which a [[programming language]] discourages or prevents '''[[type error]]s'''. A type error is erroneous or undesirable program behaviour caused by a discrepancy between differing [[data type]]s for the program's constants, variables, and methods (functions), e.g., treating an integer ('''int''') as a floating-point number ('''float'''). Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of a computer program rather than the language in which that program is written; that is, some languages have type-safe facilities that can be circumvented by programmers who adopt practices that exhibit poor type safety. The formal [[type theory|type-theoretic]] definition of type safety is considerably stronger than what is understood by most programmers.

[[Type enforcement]] can be static, catching potential errors at [[compile time]], or dynamic, associating type information with values at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] and consulting them as needed to detect imminent errors, or a combination of both.

The behaviors classified as type errors by a given programming language are usually those that result from attempts to perform operations on [[value (computer science)|values]] that are not of the appropriate [[data type]].  This classification is partly based on opinion; it may imply that any operation not leading to program crashes, security flaws or other obvious failures is legitimate and need not be considered an error, or it may imply that any contravention of the programmer's explicit intent (as communicated via typing annotations) to be erroneous and not "type-safe".

In the context of static (compile-time) type systems, type safety usually involves (among other things) a guarantee that the eventual value of any [[expression (programming)|expression]] will be a legitimate member of that expression's static type. The precise requirement is more subtle than this — see, for example, [[subtype]] and [[polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] for complications.

Type safety is closely linked to ''[[memory safety]]'', a restriction on the ability to copy arbitrary bit patterns from one memory location to another.  For instance, in an implementation of a language that has some type &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, such that some sequence of bits (of the appropriate length) does not represent a legitimate member of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, if that language allows data to be copied into a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] of type &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, then it is not type-safe because such an operation might assign a non-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; value to that variable.  Conversely, if the language is type-unsafe to the extent of allowing an arbitrary integer to be used as a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]], then it is not memory-safe.

Most statically typed languages provide a degree of type safety that is strictly stronger than memory safety, because their type systems enforce the proper use of [[abstract data type]]s defined by programmers even when this is not strictly necessary for memory safety or for the prevention of any kind of catastrophic failure.

==Definitions==
Type-safe code accesses only the memory locations it is authorized to access. (For this discussion, type safety specifically refers to memory type safety and should not be confused with type safety in a broader respect.) For example, type-safe code cannot read values from another object's private fields.

[[Robin Milner]] provided the following slogan to describe type safety:
:Well-typed programs cannot "go wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

  | volume = 17

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The appropriate formalization of this slogan depends on the style of formal semantics used for a particular language.  In the context of [[denotational semantics]], type safety means that the value of an expression that is well-typed, say with type τ, is a ''bona fide'' member of the set corresponding to τ.

In 1994, Andrew Wright and [[Matthias Felleisen]] formulated what is now the standard definition and proof technique for type safety in languages defined by [[operational semantics]].  Under this approach, type safety is determined by two properties of the semantics of the programming language:

;(Type-) preservation or [[subject reduction]]: "Well typedness" ("typability") of programs remains invariant under the transition rules (i.e. evaluation rules or reduction rules) of the language.
;Progress: A well typed (typable) program never gets "stuck", which means the [[Expression (computer science)|expressions]] in the program will either be evaluated to a [[Value (computer science)|value]], or there is a transition rule for it; in other words, the program never gets into an undefined state where no further transitions are possible.

These properties do not exist in a vacuum; they are linked to the semantics of the programming language they describe, and there is a large space of varied languages that can fit these criteria, since the notion of "well typed" program is part of the static semantics of the programming language and the notion of "getting stuck" (or "going wrong") is a property of its [[dynamic semantics]].

Vijay Saraswat provides the following definition:
:"A language is type-safe if the only operations that can be performed on data in the language are those sanctioned by the type of the data." &lt;ref name=saraswat-java&gt;{{cite web|last=Saraswat |first=Vijay | date=1997-08-15 |title=Java is not type-safe |url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/courses/629/papers/Saraswat-javabug.html |accessdate=2008-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other forms of safety==
Type safety is ultimately aimed at excluding other problems, e.g.:-
* Prevention of illegal operations. For example, we can identify an expression &lt;code&gt;3 / "Hello, World"&lt;/code&gt; as invalid, because the rules of [[arithmetic]] do not specify how to divide an [[integer]] by a [[string (computer science)|string]].
* [[Memory safety]]
** [[Wild pointer]]s can arise when a pointer to one type object is treated as a pointer to another type. For instance, the size of an object depends on the type, so if a pointer is incremented under the wrong credentials, it will end up pointing at some random area of memory.
** [[Buffer overflow]] - Out-of bound writes can corrupt the contents of objects already present on the heap. This can occur when a larger object of one type is crudely copied into smaller object of another type.
* [[Logic error]]s originating in the [[semantics]] of different types. For instance, inches and millimeters may both be stored as integers, but should not be substituted for each other or added. A type system can enforce two different types of integer for them.

==Type-safe and type-unsafe languages==
Type safety is usually a requirement for any [[toy language]] proposed in academic programming language research. Many languages, on the other hand, are too big for human-generated type safety proofs, as they often require checking thousands of cases. Nevertheless, some languages such as [[Standard ML]], which has rigorously defined semantics, have been proved to meet one definition of type safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smlnj.org/sml.html Standard ML]. Smlnj.org. Retrieved on 2013-11-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Some other languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] are ''believed''{{discuss}} to meet some definition of type safety, provided certain "escape" features are not used (for example Haskell's &lt;tt&gt;unsafePerformIO&lt;/tt&gt;, used to "escape" from the usual restricted environment in which I/O is possible, circumvents the type system and so can be used to break type safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/base/System-IO-Unsafe.html#v:unsafePerformIO |title=System.IO.Unsafe |work=GHC libraries manual: base-3.0.1.0 |accessdate=2008-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Type punning]] is another example of such an "escape" feature. Regardless of the properties of the language definition, certain errors may occur at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] due to bugs in the implementation, or in linked [[library (computer science)|libraries]] written in other languages; such errors could render a given implementation type unsafe in certain circumstances. An early version of Sun's [[Java virtual machine]] was vulnerable to this sort of problem.&lt;ref name=saraswat-java /&gt;

== Strong and weak typing ==
{{Main|Strong and weak typing}}
Programming languages are often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (also loosely typed) to refer to certain aspects of type safety. In 1974, [[Barbara Liskov|Liskov]] and Zilles defined a strongly-typed language as one in which "whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.136.3043 | title = Programming with abstract data types | first1 = B | last1 = Liskov | first2 = S | last2 = Zilles | journal = ACM SIGPLAN Notices | year = 1974 | doi=10.1145/942572.807045}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1977, Jackson wrote, "In a strongly typed language each data area will have a distinct type and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = Parallel processing and modular software construction | first1 = K. | last1 = Jackson | journal = Design and Implementation of Programming Languages | year = 1977 | volume = 54 | pages = 436–443 | doi = 10.1007/BFb0021435 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/wq02703237400667/ | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | isbn = 3-540-08360-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, a weakly typed language may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ | title =CS1130.

==Type safety in object oriented languages==
In [[object oriented]] languages type safety is usually intrinsic in the fact that a [[type system]] is in place. This is expressed in terms of class definitions.

A [[Class (computer science)|class]] essentially defines the structure of the objects derived from it and an [[Api#API in object-oriented languages|API]] as a ''contract'' for handling these objects.
Each time a new object is created it will ''comply'' with that contract.

Each function that exchanges objects derived from a specific class, or implementing a specific [[Interface (computer science)|interface]], will adhere to that contract: hence in that function the operations permitted on that object will be only those defined by the methods of the class the object implements.
This will guarantee that the object integrity will be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Type safety is hence also a matter of good class definition: public methods that modify the internal state of an object shall preserve the object itegrity&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions to this are object oriented languages that allow dynamic modification of the object structure, or the use of reflection to modify the content of an object to overcome the constraints imposed by the class methods definitions.

==Type safety issues in specific languages==

=== Ada ===

{{wikibooks|Ada Programming|Type System}}
[[Ada programming language|Ada]] was designed to be suitable for [[embedded system]]s, [[device driver]]s and other forms of [[system programming]], but also to encourage type-safe programming.  To resolve these conflicting goals, Ada confines type-unsafety to a certain set of special constructs whose names usually begin with the string &lt;tt&gt;Unchecked_&lt;/tt&gt;. Unchecked_Deallocation can be effectively banned from a unit of Ada text by applying &lt;tt&gt;pragma Pure&lt;/tt&gt; to this  unit. It is expected that programmers will use &lt;tt&gt;Unchecked_&lt;/tt&gt; constructs very carefully and only when necessary; programs that do not use them are type-safe.

The [[SPARK programming language]] is a subset of Ada eliminating all its potential ambiguities and insecurities while at the same time adding [[design by contract|statically checked contracts]] to the language features available. SPARK avoids the issues with [[dangling pointer]]s by disallowing allocation at run time entirely.

Ada2012 adds [[design by contract|statically checked contracts]] to the language itself (in form of pre-, and post-conditions, as well as type invariants).

=== C ===

{{Wikibooks|C Programming}}
The [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] is type-safe in limited contexts; for example, a compile-time error is generated when an attempt is made to convert a pointer to one type of structure to a pointer to another type of structure, unless an explicit cast is used.  However, a number of very common operations are non-type-safe; for example, the usual way to print an integer is something like &lt;code&gt;printf("%d", 12)&lt;/code&gt;, where the &lt;code&gt;%d&lt;/code&gt; tells &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; at run-time to expect an integer argument. (Something like &lt;code&gt;printf("%s", 12)&lt;/code&gt;, which erroneously tells the function to expect a pointer to a character-string, may be accepted by compilers, but will produce undefined results.) This is partially mitigated by some compilers (such as gcc) checking type correspondences between printf arguments and format strings.

In addition, C, like Ada, provides unspecified or undefined explicit conversions; and unlike in Ada, idioms that use these conversions are very common, and have helped to give C a type-unsafe reputation. For example, the standard way to allocate memory on the heap is to invoke a memory allocation function, such as &lt;code&gt;[[malloc]]&lt;/code&gt;, with an argument indicating how many bytes are required. The function returns an untyped pointer (type &lt;code&gt;void *&lt;/code&gt;), which the calling code must explicitly or implicitly cast to the appropriate pointer type. Pre-standardized implementations of C required an explicit cast to do so, therefore the code &lt;code&gt;(struct foo *) malloc(sizeof(struct foo))&lt;/code&gt; became the accepted practice.&lt;ref name="knr"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kernighan | author1-link = Brian Kernighan | author2 = Dennis M. Ritchie | authorlink2 = Dennis Ritchie | title = The C Programming Language | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | date = March 1988 | location = [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]] | url = http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/ | isbn = 0-13-110362-8 | quote = In C, the proper method is to declare that malloc returns a pointer to void, then explicitly coerce the pointer into the desired type with a cast. | page = 116 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081106175456/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/ | archivedate = 2008-11-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this practice is discouraged in ISO C as it can mask a failure to include the header file in which &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; is defined, resulting in downstream errors on machines where the int and pointer types are of different sizes, such as most common implementations of C for the now-ubiquitous [[x86-64]] architecture.&lt;ref name="stackdiscussion"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://stackoverflow.com/questions/605845/do-i-cast-the-result-of-malloc/605858#605858|title= Do I cast the result of malloc?|date=7 November 2012|publisher=[[Stack Overflow]]|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A conflict arises in code that is required to compile as C++, since the cast is necessary in that language.

===C++===
Some features of C++ that promote more type-safe code:
* The [[new (C++)|new]] operator returns a pointer of type based on operand, whereas [[malloc]] returns a void pointer.
* C++ code can use virtual functions and [[Template (programming)|templates]] to achieve polymorphism without void pointers.
* Safer casting operators, such as [[dynamic cast]] that performs run-time type checking.
* [[C++11#Strongly_typed_enumerations|C++11 strongly typed enumerations]] cannot be implicitly converted to or from integers or other enumeration types.
* [[C++11#Explicit_conversion_operators|C++ explicit constructors and C++11 explicit conversion operators]] prevent implicit type conversions.

===C#===
[[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] is type-safe (but not statically type-safe). It has support for untyped pointers, but this must be accessed using the "unsafe" keyword which can be prohibited at the compiler level. It has inherent support for run-time cast validation. Casts can be validated by using the "as" keyword that will return a null reference if the cast is invalid, or by using a C-style cast that will throw an exception if the cast is invalid. See [[C Sharp Syntax#Conversion operators|C Sharp conversion operators]].

Undue reliance on the [[C Sharp syntax#object class|object]] type (from which all other types are derived) runs the risk of defeating the purpose of the C# type system. It is usually better practice to abandon object references in favour of [[Generic programming#Generic programming in .NET|generics]], similar to templates in C++ and [[generics in Java]].

===Java===
{{Wikibooks|Java Programming}}
The [[Java language]] is designed to enforce type safety. 
Anything in Java ''happens'' inside an [[Object (computer science)|object]]
and each object is an instance of a [[Class (computer programming)|class]].

To implement the ''type safety'' enforcement, each object, before usage, needs to be [[Memory allocation|allocated]].
Java allows usage of [[Primitive data type|primitive types]] but only inside properly allocated objects.

Sometimes a part of the type safety is implemented indirectly: e.g. the class BigDecimal represents a floating point number of arbitrary precision, but handles only numbers that can be expressed with a finite representation.
The operation BigDecimal.divide() calculates a new object as the division of two numbers expressed as BigDecimal.

In this case if the division has no finite representation, as when one computes e.g. 1/3=0.33333..., the divide() method can raise an exception if no rounding mode is defined for the operation.
Hence the library, rather than the language, guarantees that the object respects the contract implicit in the class definition.

===Standard ML===
{{Wikibooks|Standard ML Programming}}
[[Standard ML|SML]] has rigorously defined semantics and is known to be type-safe.  However, some implementations of SML, including [[Standard ML of New Jersey]] (SML/NJ), its syntactic variant [[Mythryl]] and [[Mlton]], provide libraries that offer certain unsafe operations.  These facilities are often used in conjunction with those implementations' [[foreign function interface]]s to interact with non-ML code (such as C libraries) that may require data laid out in specific ways.  Another example is the SML/NJ [[read-eval-print loop|interactive toplevel]] itself, which must use unsafe operations to execute ML code entered by the user.

=== Modula-2 ===
Modula-2 is a strongly typed language with a design philosophy to require any unsafe facilities to be explicitly marked as unsafe. This is achieved by "moving" such facilities into a built-in pseudo-library called SYSTEM from where they must be imported before they can be used. The import thus makes it visible when such facilities are used. Unfortunately, this was not consequently implemented in the original language report and its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Niklaus Wirth|title=Programming in Modula-2|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; There still remained unsafe facilities such as the type cast syntax and variant records (inherited from Pascal) that could be used without prior import.&lt;ref name="knightsoftype.blogspot.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Separation of Safe and Unsafe Facilities|url=http://knightsoftype.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-separation-of-safe-and-unsafe.html|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in moving these facilities into the SYSTEM pseudo-module was the lack of any identifier for the facility that could then be imported since only identifiers can be imported, but not syntax.

&lt;source lang="modula2"&gt;
IMPORT SYSTEM; (* allows the use of certain unsafe facilities: *)
VAR word : SYSTEM.WORD; addr : SYSTEM.ADDRESS;
addr := SYSTEM.ADR(word);

(* but type cast syntax can be used without such import *)
VAR i : INTEGER; n : CARDINAL;
n := CARDINAL(i); (* or *) i := INTEGER(n);
&lt;/source&gt;

The ISO Modula-2 standard corrected this for the type cast facility by changing the type cast syntax into a function called CAST which has to be imported from pseudo-module SYSTEM. However, other unsafe facilities such as variant records remained available without any import from pseudo-module SYSTEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO Modula-2 Language Reference|url=http://www.excelsior-usa.com/doc/xds/isom2.html|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="modula2"&gt;
IMPORT SYSTEM;
VAR i : INTEGER; n : CARDINAL;
i := SYSTEM.CAST(INTEGER, n); (* Type cast in ISO Modula-2 *)
&lt;/source&gt;

A recent revision of the language applied the original design philosophy rigorously. First, pseudo-module SYSTEM was renamed to UNSAFE to make the unsafe nature of facilities imported from there more explicit. Then all remaining unsafe facilities where either removed altogether (for example variant records) or moved to pseudo-module UNSAFE. For facilities where there is no identifier that could be imported, enabling identifiers were introduced. In order to enable such a facility, its corresponding enabling identifier must be imported from pseudo-module UNSAFE. No unsafe facilities remain in the language that do not require import from UNSAFE.&lt;ref name="knightsoftype.blogspot.com"/&gt;

&lt;source lang="modula2"&gt;
IMPORT UNSAFE;
VAR i : INTEGER; n : CARDINAL;
i := UNSAFE.CAST(INTEGER, n); (* Type cast in Modula-2 Revision 2010 *)

FROM UNSAFE IMPORT FFI; (* enabling identifier for foreign function interface facility *)
&lt;*FFI="C"*&gt; (* pragma for foreign function interface to C *)
&lt;/source&gt;

===Pascal===
{{Wikibooks|Pascal Programming}}
[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] has had a number of type safety requirements, some of which are kept in some compilers.  Where a Pascal compiler dictates "strict typing", two variables cannot be assigned to each other unless they are either compatible (such as conversion of integer to real) or assigned to the identical subtype.  For example, if you have the following code fragment:

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
type
  TwoTypes = record
     I: Integer;
     Q: Real;
  end;

  DualTypes = record
    I: Integer;
    Q: Real;
  end;

var
  T1, T2:  TwoTypes;
  D1, D2:  DualTypes;
&lt;/source&gt;

Under strict typing, a variable defined as &lt;tt&gt;TwoTypes&lt;/tt&gt; is ''not compatible'' with &lt;tt&gt;DualTypes&lt;/tt&gt; (because they are not identical, even though the components of that user defined type are identical) and an assignment of &lt;tt&gt; T1 := D2; &lt;/tt&gt; is illegal.  An assignment of &lt;tt&gt;T1 := T2; &lt;/tt&gt; would be legal because the subtypes they are defined to ''are'' identical.  However, an assignment such as &lt;tt&gt;T1.Q := D1.Q;&lt;/tt&gt; would be legal.

===Common Lisp===
In general, [[Common Lisp]] is a type-safe language. A Common Lisp compiler is responsible for inserting dynamic checks for operations whose type safety cannot be proven statically. However, a programmer may indicate that a program should be compiled with a lower level of dynamic type-checking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Lisp HyperSpec|url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/d_optimi.htm|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program compiled in such a mode cannot be considered type-safe.

== C++ Examples ==
The following examples illustrates how C++ cast operators can break type safety when used incorrectly. The first example shows how basic data types can be incorrectly casted:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main () {
    int   ival = 5;                              // integer value
    float fval = reinterpret_cast&lt;float&amp;&gt;(ival); // reinterpret bit pattern
    cout &lt;&lt; fval &lt;&lt; endl;                        // output integer as float
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, &lt;code&gt;reinterpret_cast&lt;/code&gt; explicitly prevents the compiler from performing a safe conversion from integer to floating-point value.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reinterpret_cast&lt;/ref&gt; When the program runs it will output a garbage floating-point value. The problem could have been avoided by instead writing &lt;code&gt;float fval = ival;&lt;/code&gt;

The next example shows how object references can be incorrectly downcasted:
&lt;source lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

class Parent {
public:
    virtual ~Parent() {} // virtual destructor for RTTI
};

class Child1 : public Parent {
public:
    int a;
};

class Child2 : public Parent {
public:
    float b;
};

int main () {
    Child1 c1;
    c1.a = 5;
    Parent &amp; p = c1;                     // upcast always safe
    Child2 &amp; c2 = static_cast&lt;Child2&amp;&gt;(p); // invalid downcast
    cout &lt;&lt; c2.b &lt;&lt; endl;          // will output garbage data
    return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The two child classes have members of different types. When downcasting a parent class pointer to a child class pointer, then the resulting pointer may not point to a valid object of correct type. In the example, this leads to garbage value being printed. The problem could have been avoided by replacing &lt;code&gt;static_cast&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;dynamic_cast&lt;/code&gt; that throws an exception on invalid casts.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/dynamic_cast&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase title}}
The '''van Genuchten–Gupta model''' is an inverted [[Sigmoid function|S-curve]] applicable to [[crop yield]] and [[soil salinity]] relations.&lt;ref&gt;M. Th. van Genuchten and S.K. Gupta, 1993. '''USDA-ARS, U.S. Salinity Laboratory 4500 Glenwood Drive, Riverside, California, USA, 92501.''' ''A reassessment of the Crop Tolerance Response Function.'' Journal of the Indian Society of Soil Science, Vol. 41, No. 4, pp 730–737.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Genugten-Gupta model.png|thumb|300px|Van Genuchten-Gupta model for crop response to soil salinity.]]

==Equation==

The mathematical expression is:

: Y = Ym &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; [ 1 + {C / C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;} &lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;P&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ]

where Y = yield, Ym = maximum yield of the model, C = salt concentration of the soil, C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = C value at 50% yield, P = an exponent to be found by [[optimization]] and maximizing the model's [[goodness of fit]] to the data.

In the figure: Ym = 3.1, C&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.4, P = 3.75

==Alternative 1==
[[File:S-curve model.png|thumb|300px|Logistic S-curve model for the relation between crop yield and soil salinity]]

As an alternative, the '''[[Logistic function|logistic S-function]]''' can be used.

The mathematical expression is:

: Y&lt;big&gt;^&lt;/big&gt; = 1 &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; { 1 + &lt;big&gt;e&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt; (A.X&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt; + B)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; }

where:

: Y&lt;big&gt;^&lt;/big&gt; = (Y - Yn) &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; (Ym - Yn)

with Y =Yield, Yn = minimum Y, Ym = maximum Y, X = salt concentration of the soil, while A, B and C are constants to be determined by [[optimization]] and maximizing the model's [[goodness of fit]] to the data.

If the minimum Yn=0 then the expression can be simplified to:

: Y = Ym &lt;big&gt;/&lt;/big&gt; { 1 + &lt;big&gt;e&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt; (A.X&lt;big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt; + B)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; }

In the figure: Ym = 3.43, Yn = 0.47, A = 0.112, B = -3.16, C = 1.42.

==Alternative 2==
[[File:Cubic regression.png|thumb|300px|Cubic regression to find the relation between crop yield and soil salinity]]

The third degree or '''[[Polynomial regression|cubic regression]]''' also offers a useful alternative.

The equation reads:

: Y = A.X&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + B.X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + C.X + D

with Y =Yield, X = salt concentration of the soil, while A, B, C and D are constants to be determined by the regression.

In the figure: A = 0.0017, B = 0.0604, C=0.3874, D = 2.3788. These values were calculated with [[Microsoft Excel]]

The curvature is more pronounced than in the other models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8972">The '''Vipassanā-ñāṇas''' ([[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]]: Vipaśyanā-jñāna) or  '''insight knowledges''' are various stages that a practitioner of Buddhist [[Vipassanā]] ("insight", "clear-seeing") meditation is said to pass through on the way to [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt; This "progress of insight" (''Visuddhiñana-katha'') is outlined in various traditional [[Theravada Buddhist]] commentary texts such as the [[Patisambhidamagga]], the [[Vimuttimagga]] and the [[Visuddhimagga]]. In [[Sarvastivadin]] [[abhidharma]] texts, the "path of insight" (darśana-mārga) one of the [[Bh%C5%ABmi_(Buddhism)#Five_Paths|five paths]] of progress in the dharma and is made up of several ''jñānas'' also called "thought moments".

==Vimuttimagga==
The [[Vimuttimagga]] (Path to liberation, 解脫道論) is an early meditation manual by the [[arahant]] Upatissa preserved only in a sixth century Chinese translation. The stages of insight outlined by the Vimuttimagga are:&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Comprehension (廣觀)
#Rise and fall (起滅)
#Dissolution (滅)
#Fear &amp; disadvantage &amp; disenchantment (畏 &amp; 過患 &amp; 厭離)
#Delight in deliverance &amp; equanimity (樂解脫 &amp; 捨)
#Conformity (相似)

A similar presentation of these stages can be found in the [[Patisambhidamagga]] (dated between the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE), an [[Abhidhamma]] work included in the fifth Nikāya of the [[Pāli Canon]]. In the [[Patisambhidamagga]], there are only 5 stages presented. The first three stages are the same and the last two are "fear &amp; disadvantage" (bhaya &amp; ādīnava) and "wish for deliverance &amp; equanimity towards formations" (muñcitukamyatā &amp; saṅkhārupekkhā).&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visuddhimagga==
[[Buddhagosa]]'s [[Visuddhimagga]] (Path of purification) (ca. 430 CE), while seemingly influenced by the [[Vimuttimagga]], divides the insight knowledges further into sixteen stages:&lt;ref&gt;Vipassanadhura meditation society http://www.vipassanadhura.com/sixteen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Namarupa pariccheda ñana'' - Knowledge of mental and physical states, analytical knowledge of body and mind.
#''Paccaya pariggaha ñana'' - Discerning Conditionality, knowledge of cause and effect between mental and physical states.
#''Sammasana ñana'' - Knowledge of the [[three characteristics]] of mental and physical processes.
#''Udayabbaya ñana'' - Knowledge of arising and passing away. Accompanied by possible mental images/lights, [[Pīti|rapture]], [[sukha|happiness]], tranquility and strong [[mindfulness]] so that "there is no body-and-mind process in which mindfulness fails to engage."  &lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Bhanga ñana'' - Knowledge of the dissolution of formations, only the "vanishing," or "passing away" is discernible.
#''Bhaya ñana'' - Knowledge of the fearful nature of mental and physical states. The meditator's mind "is gripped by fear and seems helpless."&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Adinava ñana'' - Knowledge of mental and physical states as [[dukkha]]. "So he sees, at that time, only suffering, only unsatisfactoriness, only misery." &lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Nibbida ñana'' - Knowledge of disenchantment/disgust with conditioned states.
#''Muncitukamayata ñana'' - Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance, the desire to abandon the worldly state (for nibbana) arises.
#''Patisankha ñana'' - Knowledge of re-investigation of the path. This instills a decision to practice further.
#''Sankharupekha ñana'' - Knowledge which regards mental and physical states with [[upekkha|equanimity]].
#''Anuloma ñana'' - Knowledge in conformity with the [[Four Noble Truths]].
#''Gotrabhu ñana''- Knowledge which is void of [[sankhara|conditioned formations]], "maturity Knowledge".
#''Magga ñana'' - Knowledge by which [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] are abandoned and are overcome by destruction.
#''Phala ñana'' - Knowledge which realizes the fruit of the path ([[nibbana]]).
#''Paccavekkhana ñana'' - Knowledge which reviews the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] still remaining.

==Abhidhammattha-sangaha==
In the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]] (11th to 12th century), another widely used Buddhist commentarial text, there are only ten insight knowledges.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Comprehension - ''sammasana''
#Rise and fall - ''udayabbaya''
#Dissolution - ''bhaṅga''
#Fear - ''bhaya''
#Disadvantage - ''ādīnava''
#Disenchantment - ''nibbidā''
#Wish for deliverance - ''muñcitukamyatā''
#Reflection - ''paṭisaṅkhā''
#Equanimity towards formations - ''saṅkhārupekkhā''
#Conformity - ''anuloma
