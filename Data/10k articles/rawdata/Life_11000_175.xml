'''A.P. Williams Funeral Home''' is a historic African-American [[funeral home]] located at [[Columbia, South Carolina]]. It was built between 1893 and 1911 as a single-family residence, and is a two-story frame building with a hipped roof with gables and a columned porch. At that time, it was one of six funeral homes that served black customers. Archie Preston Williams, II was a leader in the city's black community.&lt;ref name = nrhpinv&gt;{{Cite web |author = Lauren Ham| title =A.P.

'''Abel''' (''fl''. 744–747) was a saint and [[suffragan bishop|suffragan]] [[bishop of Reims]] in [[Francia]], modern-day France.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Costambeys, "Abel (''fl''. 744–747)"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the late 10th century, [[Folcuin]] wrote that Abel had been a monk of [[Lobbes Abbey]] when Bishop Ermino (d. 737) was abbot. Boniface, in a letter to a Mercian priest, states that Abel was born and raised in England, as were the other four bishops who previously addressed King Æthelbald by letter (see below). Folcuin, however, believed that Abel was Irish. Historian [[Wilhelm Levison]] has argued therefore that the monk must have been a different Folcuin, but Eugen Ewig accepts the identification. If Folcuin's late testimony has any basis in reality, it may be that Abel, like his near contemporary [[Ecgberht of Ripon|Ecgberht]] (d. 729), had once visited Ireland.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; St. Abel is one of the most well known saints in the world. He was commemorated as patron saint of the blind and lame.

==Bishop of Reims==
[[Boniface]] (d. 754) presided over the [[Council of Soissons]] in March 744. The conciliar acts record that Abel was elected archbishop of an unspecified see, as was a certain Hartbert. Later that year, [[Pope Zacharias]] recalled that with the support of [[Pippin III]], Boniface had "suspended from their sacred functions certain false priests as unworthy of their office" and instead promoted Grimo, Abel and Hartbert to the metropolitan sees of [[bishopric of Rouen|Rouen]], [[bishopric of Reims|Reims]] and [[Bishopric of Sens|Sens]] respectively.&lt;ref name=Bon58&gt;Letter by Pope Zacharias to Boniface, dated Nov. 5, 744, ed. Tangl (no. 58), tr. Emerton.&lt;/ref&gt; The event has been interpreted as a return to the provincial system of Gaul, by which Boniface intended to prevent that powerful laymen obtained the office of archbishop for their own, secular ends. [[Milo (bishop of Trier)|Milo]] (d. 762/3), for instance, who probably was a layman rather than a consecrated bishop, had held the sees of Trier and Reims since ''c''. 722.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

However, Abel's tenure of archiepiscopal office never appears to have been confirmed by papal authority. In June, Pope Zacharias gave his approval by sending Abel the [[pallium]]. He did the same for Hartbert, bishop of Sens, and Grimo, bishop of Rouen.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt; In August, however, Boniface wrote again to request a pallium for Grimo alone, to which Zacharias replied asking why Hartbert and Grimo had not been included in his request.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bon58 /&gt;

What followed is uncertain. The next time one hears of Abel is when he is named as one of Boniface's 'fellow bishops' who in ''c''. 746 sent a letter of exhortation to [[Æthelbald of Mercia|Æthelbald, king of Mercia]]. It would seem that Milo controlled the three sees, while Abel, Hartbert and Grimo remained in office only as suffragan bishops. In 751, Boniface once more addressed a letter to Pope Zacharias, in which he lamented the injustices of lay control over the church, but his erstwhile ambitions were never realised.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

It is unknown when Abel gave up his position or died. The 9th-century ''Life'' of St [[Saint Remigius|Remigius]], written by [[Hincmar]], Archbishop of Rheims, claims that Milo had driven Abel from the see in favour of [[Tilpin]], Abel's successor. The date given is 748, but it now appears that Tilpin succeeded in 762 or 763, when Milo died.&lt;ref name=ODNB /&gt;

==Commemoration==
In the early modern period, Abel's name was inserted in a number of martyrologies, under a variety of dates. Examples are the 17th-century martyrology of [[Gabriel Bucelin]], the ''Martyrologium Gallicanum'' (1637) of [[André du Saussay]], and [[John Mabillon]]. The [[Bollandists]] include a ''Life'' of Abel under 5 August, compiled by John Pinius.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hanlon, ''Lives of the Irish saints'', 5 August.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5194">[[file:American Kestrel and American Pipit (2256510207).jpg|thumb|[[American kestrel]] eating bird.]]
An '''avivore''' is a specialized predator of [[bird]]s, with birds making up a large proportion of its diet. Such bird-eating animals come from a range of groups.

==Birds==
Birds that are specialized predators of other birds include certain [[accipiter]]s and [[falcon]]s. General features of avian avivores include a skull form which is well adapted for grasping and crushing with the beak, although not especially well structured for neck twisting motions.&lt;ref name = "Hertel"/&gt; Bird-eating [[bird of prey|raptor]]s also tend to show greater sexual dimorphism than other raptors, with the females being larger than the males.&lt;ref name = "Temeles"/&gt;

Some avian avivores such as the [[shikra]], [[besra]], [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], and [[sharp-shinned hawk]] catch their prey by flying from cover in a tree or bush, taking their prey unawares. In contrast, the [[lanner falcon]] hunts in open country taking birds by horizontal pursuit. The [[aplomado falcon]] will use both ambush and more extended flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/species/fsheets/af.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511000254/http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/species/fsheets/af.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-05-11 |title=Northern Aplomado Falcon |publisher=Pima.gov |date=1986-03-27 |accessdate=2013-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[peregrine falcon]] dives on flying birds from a great height at speeds that can exceed 300&amp;nbsp;km/h.

The extinct [[Haast's eagle]] of [[New Zealand]] preyed on the large flightless bird species of the region such as the [[moa]].

==Mammals==
In certain [[biotope]]s, birds constitute the bulk of the diet of various carnivorans, e.g., of adult [[leopard seal]]s that mostly prey on [[penguins]], the [[Arctic fox]] living in coastal areas where colonies of [[murre]]s, [[auk]]s, [[gull]]s and other [[seabird]]s abound and [[stoats]] in New Zealand against whom flightless birds like the [[takahē]] and [[kiwi]] are defenseless. Other avivore mammals who occasionally prey on birds include most [[carnivora]]; a number of [[primate]]s ranging from [[loris]]es and [[night monkey]]s over [[baboon]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s to [[human]]s; [[orca]]s; [[opossum]]s and other [[marsupial]]s; [[rat]]s and other [[rodent]]s; [[hedgehog]]s and other [[insectivora]] and [[bat]]s.

A number of mammal species are specialized predators of birds. The [[caracal]] and the [[serval]], both medium-sized cats, are known for their leaping ability which they use to catch flying birds, sometimes two at a time. [[Domestic cat]]s may at times become specialists as bird-killers if other prey is unavailable. Some carnivora, including the [[red fox]] and [[marten]]s, are known for engaging in [[surplus killing]] of birds. Kruuk (1972) observed that four red foxes killed 230 [[black-headed gull]]s in one night in a single colony at the Cumberland coast while fewer than 3% of the gulls showed any sign of being eaten.[https://books.google.cz/books?id=WyuGvS66mLwC&amp;pg=PA736&amp;lpg=PA736&amp;dq=fox+terns+surplus+killing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eesa7zEG1j&amp;sig=2a6juqBkjFWWT6wBneBm1KXUc-k&amp;hl=cs&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=19H7VPNRjcA8ru-A4A4&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=fox%20terns%20surplus%20killing&amp;f=false] The [[greater noctule bat]] is believed to predate small migrating birds on the wing in the skies of [[Southern Europe]].

Many mammals, such as [[squirrel]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[pine marten]]s, also feed on bird eggs and young when they get the chance.

==Reptiles==
The [[Egg-eating snake (disambiguation)|egg-eating snake]] specializes in eating birds eggs, swallowing them whole and then breaking them using a protrusion from its spine.

==Amphibians==
The [[fanged frog]] ''[[Limnonectes megastomias]]'' preys on birds and insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/09/25/tech/main5338998.shtml |title=Bird-Eating Fanged Frog Found in Thailand |publisher=CBS News |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2013-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arachnids==
The [[Goliath birdeater]] (''Theraphosa blondi'') was named by explorers who saw it eating a [[hummingbird]].

The dichotomy between income and capital breeders was introduced in 1980 by R. H. Drent and S. Daan&lt;ref name="WinklerAllen1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winkler|first1=David W.|last2=Allen|first2=Paul E.|title=The seasonal decline in tree swallow clutch size: physiological constraint or strategic adjustment?|journal=Ecology|volume=77|issue=3|year=1996|pages=922–932|issn=00129658|doi=10.2307/2265512}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain why birds usually laid their eggs later than the time that would maximize nestling survival for the population.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"/&gt;

[[Ectotherm]]s are generally capital breeders, whereas [[endotherm]]s rely on income breeding more often. This difference is likely due to the difference in maintenance costs, and thus in the energy that can be allocated to stores.&lt;ref name="BonnetBradshaw1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonnet|first1=Xavier|last2=Bradshaw|first2=Don|last3=Shine|first3=Richard|title=Capital versus income breeding: An ectothermic perspective|journal=Oikos|volume=83|issue=2|year=1998|pages=333|issn=00301299|doi=10.2307/3546846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants of capital versus income breeding==
In organisms that breed multiple times and live in places where food availability and mortality change significantly on the basis of season, it is predicted that capital breeding will be more prevalent, as the time when the organism is not breeding but when conditions are still favourable will be dedicated to rebuilding stores, therefore allowing them to achieve higher rates of reproduction. Capital breeding also increases with size (at least in organisms with optimal storage and indeterminate growth), as the energy dedicated to growth gives less and less return, thus meaning that energy dedicated to storage will have more return compared to that dedicated to growth.&lt;ref name="EjsmondVarpe2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ejsmond|first1=Maciej Jan|last2=Varpe|first2=Øystein|last3=Czarnoleski|first3=Marcin|last4=Kozłowski|first4=Jan|title=Seasonality in offspring value and trade-offs with growth explain capital breeding|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=186|issue=5|year=2015|pages=E111–E125|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/683119}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in [[eastern grey kangaroo]]s, capital breeding is used during times of food scarcity, whereas income breeding is used during times of normal food availability.&lt;ref name="MacKayForsyth2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacKay|first1=Allison E.|last2=Forsyth|first2=David M.|last3=Coulson|first3=Graeme|last4=Festa-Bianchet|first4=Marco|title=Maternal resource allocation adjusts to timing of parturition in an asynchronous breeder|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=72|issue=1|year=2017|issn=0340-5443|doi=10.1007/s00265-017-2419-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Income breeding, on the other hand, will generally be favoured in non-seasonal environments, as holding off breeding will not increase the chances that the offspring will survive.&lt;ref name="SainmontAndersen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sainmont|first1=Julie|last2=Andersen|first2=Ken H.|last3=Varpe|first3=Øystein|last4=Visser|first4=André W.|title=Capital versus income breeding in a seasonal environment|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=184|issue=4|year=2014|pages=466–476|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/677926}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, high or unpredictable demands during reproduction, which would cause the energy needed to exceed the energy provided by an income breeding strategy, may encourage capital breeding. Similarly, the possibility of decreased agility or increased conspicuity associated with, for example, egg-carrying could increase predation on reproducing individuals, making a strategy based on capital breeding more favourable, so as to avoid having to forage while reproducing.&lt;ref name="Jönsson1997"/&gt;

This model does not hold for organisms that have a feeding season right after the breeding season.&lt;ref name="EjsmondVarpe2015"/&gt; [[Copepod]]s, for example, have their breeding season just before the feeding season, and are primarily divided into mainly capital or mainly income breeders on the basis of geography.&lt;ref name="SainmontAndersen2014"/&gt;

==In endotherms==
[[Endotherm]]s have a higher level of energy that needs to be dedicated to maintenance, thus explaining their increased reliance on income breeding.&lt;ref name="BonnetBradshaw1998"/&gt;
===In birds===
The terms capital breeding and income breeding originated to explain why most individuals lay after the time when nestlings are most likely to survive. Both systems fit with the optimal time of laying for low-quality and high-quality individuals. High-quality individuals may choose to hold off laying until another egg is produced, as the decrease in the likelihood of survival for each egg is compensated by the additional egg. This is the opposite in low-quality individuals, in which the time to make an extra egg decreases the survival of each egg to the point where an additional egg cannot compensate for this loss.&lt;ref name="DrentDaan1980"/&gt;
===In pinnipeds===
The reliance of capital and income breeding in [[pinniped]]s primarily depends on the availability of food, with more food favouring an increased reliance on capital breeding. This is because increase food availability allows for the accumulation of capital, which allows for a species to use capital breeding, which is more efficient as there are less energetic costs associated with it. Increased seasonality is another factor in capital versus income breeding, with higher seasonality associated with an increased reliance on income breeding, for the reasons discussed previously. Increased unpredictability also affects a pinnipeds reliance on capital breeding; less predictability increase reliance on capital breeding, as a species can use its accumulated stores to breed when there is less food available, whereas an income breeder cannot.&lt;ref name="StephensHouston2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Philip A.|last2=Houston|first2=Alasdair I.|last3=Harding|first3=Karin C.|last4=Boyd|first4=Ian L.|last5=McNamara|first5=John M.|title=Capital and income breeding: the role of food supply|journal=Ecology|volume=95|issue=4|year=2014|pages=882–896|issn=0012-9658|doi=10.1890/13-1434.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ectotherms==
[[Ectotherm]]s are generally capital breeders, likely because of the fact that they have a lower level of body maintenance, meaning that more energy can be converted to body stores.&lt;ref name="BonnetBradshaw1998"/&gt;
===In copepods===
Copepods generally have their reproduction strategy influenced by geography, with those at higher latitudes usually being capital breeders, and those in waters closer to the equator conforming to the income breeding strategy. This is because more temperate waters allow for a longer feeding season, which allows for multiple generations in income breeders (who reproduce during the feeding season), whereas colder seas with shorter feeding seasons favour capital breeders, who are not as much affected compared to income breeders by having to get their offspring to maturity before the feeding season ends. The length of the feeding season also selects for size in these organisms; income breeders are as small as possible so they can take advantage of having multiple generations per breeding season, in contrast with capital breeders, which are as large as possible so as to catch the most food to put into their reserves.&lt;ref name="SainmontAndersen2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15106">The '''cat gap''' is a period in the [[fossil record]] of approximately [[Miocene|25 to 18.5 million years ago]] in which there are few fossils of [[Feliformia|cats or cat-like species]] found in [[North America]]. The cause of the "cat gap" is disputed, but may have been caused by changes in the climate ([[global cooling]]), changes in the habitat and [[Environment (biophysical)|environmental]] [[ecosystem]], the increasingly [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] trend of the cats (especially the [[nimravids]]), [[volcanic activity]], [[evolution]]ary changes in [[Tooth|dental]] [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the [[Canidae]] species present in North America, or a periodicity of extinctions called [[Extinction event#Patterns in frequency|van der Hammen cycles]].&lt;ref name=Meehan&gt;{{cite journal |author1=T.

==Cat evolution==
[[File:Feliform Timeline.svg|right|300px|thumbnail|Feliform evolutionary timeline]]
{{main|Felidae#Evolution}}
All modern [[carnivora]]ns, including cats, evolved from [[Miacoidea|miacoids]], which existed from approximately 66 to 33 million years ago. There were other earlier cat-like species but ''[[Proailurus]]'' (meaning "before the cat"; also called "Leman's Dawn Cat"), which appeared about 30&amp;nbsp;million years ago, is generally considered the first "true cat".&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cats of Africa: Behaviour, Ecology, and Conservation |last=Hunter |first=Luke |authorlink= |author2=Hinde, Gerald |year=2005 |publisher=Struik |location=Cape Town |isbn=1-77007-063-X |pages=40–42 |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Following the appearance of the dawn cat, there is little in the fossil record for 10 million years to suggest that cats would prosper. In fact, although ''Proailurus'' persisted for at least 14&amp;nbsp;million years, there are so few felid fossils towards the end of the dawn cat's reign that paleontologists refer to this as the "cat gap". The turning point for cats came about with the appearance of a new genus of felids, ''[[Pseudaelurus]]''&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt;}}

The increase in disparity through the early Miocene occurs during a time when few feliform fossils have been found in North America. The hypercarnivorous nimravid feliforms were extinct in North America after 26 [[Myr#Debate|Ma]] and felids did not arrive in North America until the [[Middle Miocene]] with the appearance of ''Pseudaelurus''. ''Pseudaelurus'' crossed over to North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]] from surviving populations in [[Asia]] 18.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. All modern-day cats are descended from ''Pseudaelurus''.

Nimravids and barbourofelids were [[saber-toothed cat]]-like animals of the families [[Nimravidae]] and [[Barbourofelidae]], respectively. Although not "true cats" of the family [[Felidae]], they are closely related to felids. The Nimravidae are either basal feliforms or a sister group to both feliforms and caniforms, while the [[Barbourofelidae]] are a sister group to the Felidae. Physically, some Nimravidae and Barbourofelidae resembled the saber-toothed cat ''[[Smilodon]]'', which would not appear until many millions of years later. Nimravidae also became extinct in North America during the "cat gap".&lt;ref name=Joeckela&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. M. Joeckel |author2=Stephane Peigneb |author3=Robert M.

==Possible causes==

===Hypercarnivorous tendency===
The history of carnivorous mammals is characterized by a series of rise-and-fall patterns of diversification, in which declining [[clades]] are replaced by [[phylogenetic]]ally distinct but functionally similar clades. Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of small and large carnivorous mammals diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the decline was energetic constraints and pervasive selection for larger size ([[Cope's rule]]) that lead to [[hypercarnivory]] dietary specialization. Hypercarnivory leads to increased vulnerability to extinction.

The [[nimravid]]s were large cat-like animals that occupied this ecomorphic niche in the [[ecosystem]] until 26 Ma. It is highly likely that their hypercarnivory led to their extinction in North America. After the extinction of the nimravids there were no other feliform or [[Felidae|felid]]-like species until other felids arrived from Eurasia after crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] 18.5 million years ago. During this time there was great diversity among the other carnivorous mammals in North America – both hypocarnivorous and hypercarnivorous species – and other hypercarnivorous species existed before, during, and after the cat gap.

===Changes in climate and habitat===
[[File:Leopard on the tree.jpg|right|thumbnail|Many cats tend to be [[arboreal]] hunters. The disappearance of forests in North America may have caused the mass extinction.]]

Another possible explanation for the extinction of feliforms in North America is [[Ecological succession|changes in the ecology]] of the continent. Evidence from the [[geologic temperature record]] shows that the earth was experiencing a period of [[global cooling]], causing [[forest]]s to give way to [[savanna]]s.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; Climatic changes to arid conditions that muted variation at about 25.8 Ma coincides with the first appearance of hoglike [[creodont]]s and of pocket gophers, and this also is the beginning of the "cat gap" and the "[[entelodont]] gap", a period of some 7 million years when there were no nimravids, felids, or entelodonts in North America. [[Fauna]]l overturn at 25.8 Ma is the basis for division of the [[Miocene|Arikareean]] time period (30.5–19 Ma), and the Arikareen NALMA (North American Land-Mammal Ages), into the [[Monroecreekian]] period (29.5–25.8 Ma), and then the [[Harrisonian]] period (25.8–23.5 Ma).&lt;ref name=Retallack&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gregory J.

{{quote|Why did these cat-like creatures die out in North America (while surviving in Eurasia) with no replacement by the true cats? Their fate may be owed to the same factors that created the diversity of herbivorous mammals, for most cats need forest or cover from which to hunt. In an increasingly open America the nimravids may have found themselves without an ecological perch to hunt from, particularly if the competition with dogs prevented them from colonising the savannas.&lt;ref name="Flannery"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Eternal Frontier: An Ecological History of North America and Its Peoples |last=Flannery |first=Tim |year=2002 |publisher=Grove Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8021-3888-8 |pages=113–114 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other===
Volcanic activity has also been promoted as a possible cause of the cat gap as well as other extinctions during this time period. The [[La Garita Caldera]] is a large volcanic [[caldera]] located in the [[San Juan Mountains]] in southwestern [[Colorado]], United States, and is one of a number of calderas that formed during a massive [[ignimbrite]] flare-up in Colorado, Utah, and Nevada during the [[Oligocene]] [[Series (stratigraphy)|Epoch]]. The La Garita Caldera was the site of the [[Fish Canyon eruption]], an enormous eruption about 27 million years ago. The scale of the Fish Canyon eruption was far beyond anything known in human history (erupting more than {{convert|10000|km3|cumi|abbr=on|disp=or}} for a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 8+ magnitude), and was possibly the most energetic event on Earth since the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact]], which is thought by many paleontologists to have caused the [[extinction]] of the [[dinosaurs]] in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]]. The resulting explosive volcanism probably ejected large amounts of dust and debris into the [[stratosphere]] causing major cooling (see [[volcanic winter]]). Climatic effects could also have been caused by [[sulphur]] ejected into the [[stratosphere]], which rapidly converts to [[sulphuric acid]], an [[aerosol]] which cools the [[troposphere]] by blocking incoming [[solar radiation]].

Another possible cause of the cat gap could have been the [[Late Cenozoic Ice Age]] that began 33.9 million years ago. This ice age caused [[glaciation]] in [[Antarctica]] that eventually spread to [[Arctic]] regions of southern [[Alaska]], [[Greenland]], and [[Iceland]]. Glaciers on the North American continent, as well as the cooling trend, could have made the ecosystem uninhabitable for feliformia cat-like species, although habitable for cold-weather [[caniformia]] species such as [[canids]] (dog-like species), [[mustelids]] (weasel-like species), and [[ursids]] (bear-like species).

{{quote|There is also evidence that during the Miocene a sill surrounding the Arctic Ocean, known as the Greenland–Scotland Ridge, subsided, allowing more cold polar water to escape into the North Atlantic. As the salinity of the North Atlantic grew and as outflow of cold polar water increased, so the [[thermohaline circulation]] increased in vigour, providing the mild winter temperatures and large amounts of moisture to the North Atlantic, which are prerequisites to the build-up of the large continental ice caps on the adjacent cold continents.&lt;ref name="Haggart"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Ice-age Theories |title=The Oxford Companion to the Earth |last=Haggart |first=B. A. |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn= |pages= |chapterurl=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O112-iceagetheories.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Evolution of caniforms during the gap==
[[File:Ysengrinia.jpg|right|thumbnail|Some paleontologists argue that caniforms like [[Amphicyonidae]] - "bear dogs" - responded to the cat gap by evolving to become more cat-like, to fill the [[hypercarnivore]] [[ecological niche]]&lt;ref name="Valkenburgh"/&gt;]]

It has been suggested by some that as a result of the cat gap [[Caniformia|caniforms]] (dog-like species including canids, bears, weasels, and other related taxa) evolved to fill more carnivorous and [[hypercarnivore|hypercarnivorous]] [[ecological niche]]s that would otherwise have been filled by cats.&lt;ref name="Valkenburgh"/&gt; This conclusion, however, is disputed.&lt;ref name=Hunt&gt;{{cite journal |author = Gina D. Wesley-Hunt | year = 2005 | title = The morphological diversification of carnivores in North America | journal = Paleobiology | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–55 | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/120516/the_morphological_diversification_of_carnivores_in_north_america/index.html | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031&lt;0035:TMDOCI&gt;2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=2008-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|During or just prior to this "cat gap," numerous caniform species evolve catlike features indicative of hypercarnivory, such as reduced snouts, somewhat enlarged canines, and fairly extreme reduction of their crushing [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s. In North America the first caniform group of moderate body size to move in the direction of hypercarnivory were the [[endemic]] [[Hesperocyoninae|hesperocyonine]] canids, with three genera (''[[Parenhydrocyon]]'', ''[[Enhydrocyon]]'', and ''[[Mesocyon]]''), ranging in size from jackals to small coyotes, appearing in the early [[Arikareean]] (circa 28 MYA). Notably, these three evolved alongside the last [[hyaenodont]] and the remaining three nimravids, two of which were [[Cougar|puma]]-sized. The small hypercarnivorous canids were soon joined by and ultimately replaced by numerous species from other families which also had evolved more specialized meat-eating teeth and skulls. These included at least three larger genera of similarly adapted [[amphicyonid]]s, one endemic (''[[Daphoenodon]]'') and two from the Old World (''[[Temnocyon]]'' and ''[[Mammocyon]]''), a leopard-sized [[Mustelidae|mustelid]] (''[[Megalictis]]'') as well as two hypercarnivorous bears, the [[hemicyonine]]s ''[[Cephalogale]]'' and ''[[Phoberocyon]]''.&lt;ref name=Valkenburgh&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Valkenburgh |first=Blaire |year=1999 |title=Major Patterns in the History of Carnivorous Mammals |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=463–493 | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463?journalCode=earth |doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.27.1.463 | accessdate=2008-11-28 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, other paleontologists take issue with this conclusions:

{{quote|It has been suggested that canids evolved hypercarnivorous morphologies because feliforms were absent during this period (the ‘cat-gap’’, 26–16 Ma). The data presented here do not support this hypothesis. In the calculated [[morphospace]]... Canids never occupy the area of morphospace in which felids, nimravids, and hypercarnivorous [[creodont]]s are found. More pertinent to the issue at hand, however, is that most of these hypercarnivorous canids were present before the disappearance of the nimravids, and all became extinct before the appearance of felids....There was a progressive and marked decrease in hypercarnivorous forms during the ‘‘cat-gap.’’ 28–20 Ma are characterized by above average extinction intensities and below average origination intensities. 20 Ma was marked by an increase in origination intensity, and 18 Ma showed a decrease in extinction intensity and a large increase in origination intensity. Nonetheless, despite increased origination intensities and decreased extinction intensities near the end of the ‘‘cat-gap’’ (20–16 Ma), there was still no substantial invasion of hypercarnivorous morphospace until the immigration of felids into North America."&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12497">The '''CernySmith Assessment''' ('''CSA''') is a comprehensive online questionnaire developed by Leonard J. Cerny II and David S. Smith that inquires about the impact of change and stress on productivity and resilience. This self-discovery assessment for personal growth, coaching, mentoring, and counseling helps answer three basic questions: 1) How am I doing? 2) What can I learn from how I am doing? and 3) What can I do about it?

==Description==
The CernySmith Assessment consists of 68 objective questions and 10 subjective write-in questions that measure and describe the impact of change and stress as it relates to the adjustment and well-being of people in their own culture or living and working cross-culturally. The assessment is online and is designed for people 14 years and older. The testing is self-managed, automated, and takes about 15 minutes to complete. After completion, the results are immediately generated for download in a personalized report. The self-discovery and coaching reports use nonjudgmental language and provide a balanced perspective of both strengths and challenges. The assessment includes strategies and tips on how to enhance transitions and adjustments.&lt;ref name="bare_url_a"&gt;Rosenbusch, K. (2010).

Retrieved April 26, 2012. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CSA provides a current stress-skills snapshot of adjustment during change and transition experiences. For overseas employees and/or family members, this assessment can be taken pre-field as a way to create baseline data that can be compared to any later CSA taken on-field/post-field. On-field and post-field assessments can be used for skill development tracking and re-entry assessing. It can be used once to assess adjustment, periodically (quarterly, annually), or whenever desired. It can also be used in debriefing settings including personal stresses, family stresses, and team stresses.&lt;ref name="icforangecounty"&gt;Stevenson, G. (2008, August).

The assessment is available in 6 versions.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;Rosenbusch, K. (2010).

CSA Reports come in three versions: The CSA-Brief, the CSA-Feedback, and the CSA-Team.

The CSA-Brief is a concise 6 page, self-discovery and coaching report.

The CSA-Feedback is a detailed 10 page report that provides personalized analysis of results for self-discovery and/or coaching by a certified CSA coach (mentor or counselor). The CSA-Feedback Report, when combined with performance based coaching can identify strengths and challenges and recommend practical steps in order to maximize performance and manage stress.

The CSA-Team (CSA-TR) is a 14-page report for teams and groups generated from 10 or more individualized reports. It can be used by companies, teams, and organizations to track company HR trends and progress. It provides data for analyzing group characteristics, tracking the impact of organizational policies, and assessing training needs.

==Development==
In 1995, psychologist Leonard Cerny II saw the need to assess the stress and well-being of international teams in regards to their intercultural adjustment and attrition problems. Consulting with psychologist Kelly O'Donnell, Cerny developed a pilot 100 item Likert assessment in a conceptual format parallel to the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90). The pilot questionnaire was called the CHOPS 100 and was made available to the missionary and humanitarian coaching community. For the next 5 years, improvements were made on the basis of coaching and clinical observations.

In 2000, Leonard Cerny II and David Smith submitted the assessment to international norming research and renamed it the CernySmith Adjustment Index (CSAI). The revised assessment later became known as the CernySmith Assessment (CSA).

==Research==
Starting in 2000 Cerny and Smith researched and normed the CHOPS 100 with major changes in item content and wording. They randomized the items and then developed four sector-oriented 100 item assessment versions of the CSAI: Business/Corporate (BC), Civil/Government (CG), Humanitarian/Relief (HR), and Military (M).[4]

From February 2003 to August 2004, a total of 1,133 expatriates participated in the validation of the assessment. The average age was 42 with the range encompassing ages 13 through 77. Collectively, participants lived and worked in 130 different countries representing 46 different passport countries.[4]

Emily Hervey of Regent University provided additional validity support for the CSA in her 2009 research focused on the cultural transitions and the adjustment to college of Third Culture students.[6] In 2010 Kathryn Rosenbush of George Washington University found the CSA to be a comprehensive measure of intercultural adjustment researching the impact of balanced family communication styles on the intercultural adjustment of employee families from a major multi-national corporation.[7]  She and Maria Cseh of George Washington University published results of the study in Human Resource Development International (2012).

Keith Edwards of Rosemead Graduate School of Biola University along with Kathryn Rosenbush of Townsend University and Carley Dodd of Abilene Christian University conducted a 2014 analysis of CSA data. Following is the abstract from their yet unpublished research article titled Development of CSA Expatriate Adjustment Measures. The manuscript is in the submission process for peer review and publication. The abstract reads:

"This study reports a psychometric analysis of the CernySmithTM Adjustment Survey (CSA) developed for use with expatriate workers and family members.  The CSA was designed to measure expatriate worker adjustment on 20 scales in 5 content domains (Organizational, Cultural, Relational, Resilience, and Foundational).  The present study reports a revision of the CSA based on data from 1,133 employees of non-profit and business organizations in 130 host countries from 46 passport countries.  The analyses were conducted in 3 phases.  First, uni-dimensionality of each  a priori content scale was established using Principle Components Analyses. Then, Cronbach’s alpha reliability coefficients were calculated for each scale.  Second, Principle Components Analyses were conducted to examine the discriminate validity of the scale items within each of the 5 domains. Finally, a second-order principle components analysis of the 15 scales scores identified 3 broad domains of adjustment identified as Work Management, Relationship Management, and Self-Management. The content and psychometric structure of the CSA are discussed in light of the three primary scales of expatriate employee adjustment identified by Black et al. (1991) and the four couple and spouse adjustment scales identified by Brown (2008).  The authors suggest that the CSA has the potential of increasing the robustness of expatriate adjustment assessment (Hippler et al., 2014) with the addition of the resilience (well-being, past stresses, and focus) and personal foundation (spirituality, health, and habits) domains."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbusch, K.

[[Image:DanielFreeman.gif|thumb]]
[[File:Daniel freeman beatrice NE 1863.jpg|thumb|Daniel Freeman]]
'''Daniel Freeman''' (April 26, 1826 – December 30, 1908) was an [[United States|American]] [[Homesteading|homesteader]] and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] veteran.  He was recognized as the first person to file a claim under the [[Homestead Act]] of 1862.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, Washington D.C., Daniel Freeman's Certificate of Eligibility&lt;/ref&gt;

Freeman was also the [[plaintiff]] in a landmark [[separation of church and state]] decision.

==Physician, Soldier==
Freeman was born in [[Preble County, Ohio]], but was raised in [[Genesee County, New York]], and [[Knox County, Illinois]].  While a young man, his family moved frequently, living in [[Iowa]] and [[Illinois]] and settling in Beatrice, [[Nebraska Territory]]. He was a graduate of a medical institute in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]; and practiced medicine in [[Ottawa, Illinois]]. He enlisted in the [[17th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

==Homesteader==
[[Image:Grave of Daniel Freeman.jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Daniel and Agnes Freeman at the Homestead National Monument of America.]]
On May 20, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act. This gave adults {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of land if they filed paperwork and paid a small fee. The homesteader was required to build a 12x14 dwelling and farm the land for five years, or plant trees. 

Although the land was cheap or free, many homesteaders did not last five years due to the blizzards, drought, disease, plagues of locusts, and loneliness on the open prairies.&lt;ref&gt;Badlands Homestead, South Dakota&lt;/ref&gt; January 1, 1863, was the day the Homestead Act went into effect. Freeman may have been a scouter for the Union Army, and said that he was leaving for St. Louis the morning of January 1, 1863, for military duty. Freeman convinced a clerk to open the land office just after midnight so he could file his claim.

When five years was up, the homesteader had to have two or three witnesses sign a document called "Proof Required Under Homestead Acts May 20, 1862 . . . "  Daniel Freeman had his neighbors, Joseph Graff and Samuel Kilpatrick, sign this first document.

==Marriages==
Freeman married Elizabeth Wilber, who may have died in 1861, though some sources indicate that they divorced. They had three children.

Daniel Freeman proposed marriage by mail to Agnes Suiter of [[LeClaire, Iowa]], and married her on February 8, 1865, in her parents' home. Agnes had been engaged to Daniel's younger brother, James, until he was killed in the Civil War. Daniel and Agnes had eight children, seven of whom survived to adulthood. Agnes lived on the Beatrice, Nebraska, [[homestead (buildings)|homestead]] until her death in 1931.

In addition to homesteading his claim, Freeman also worked as a [[physician]], and served as county [[coroner]] and county [[sheriff]]. During the period in which the Freemans lived on the homestead, several structures were built, including a [[log cabin]], a brick house and several frame houses. None of these structures survives today. In 1936, the Freeman homestead was recognized by [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] as the first homestead in the country and designated as [[Homestead National Monument of America]]. It is now maintained by the [[National Park Service]].

==Religious separation case==

[[Image:Homestead Freeman School.jpg|thumb|left|The Freeman school.]]Freeman was also the plaintiff in ''Daniel Freeman v. John Scheve, et al.'', a landmark case concerning the separation of church and state. In 1899, Edith Beecher, the teacher at the nearby Freeman School, was giving religious instruction, including reading passages from the [[Bible]], offering [[prayer]]s, and leading [[hymns]]. (It is not known if this school was named after Daniel Freeman or for Thomas Freeman, an unrelated brick maker and president of the local school board.) Freeman requested that Beecher stop, and she refused, claiming that she had permission from the [[school board]]. Freeman then took his complaint to the school board, which backed Beecher.

Freeman then filed suit in [[Gage County]] District Court, which found in favor of the school board. Freeman appealed, finally going to the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]], which found that the actions of Beecher and the school board were unconstitutional under the Nebraska Constitution provisions (Art. I-4) concerning the separation of church and state.

The Freeman school, a one-room brick and wood school house, continued to be used until 1967. It has been renovated and is now open to the public. It is located about a quarter of a mile from the national monument.

== The role of the embryo ==
[[File:Haeckel's Evolution of Man Wellcome L0032934.jpg|thumb|Evolution occur through alterations in development]]
In modern evolutionary biology, the idea of developmental bias is embedded into a current of thought called ''[[Structuralism (biology)|Structuralism]]'' (also “internalism” or “variational structuralism”) focused on the role of the organism as a ''causal'' force of evolutionary change&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1005108561|title=HOMOLOGY, GENES, AND EVOLUTIONARY INNOVATION.|last=P.|first=WAGNER, GUNTER|date=2014|publisher=PRINCETON UNIVERSITY PRES|year=|isbn=0691180679|location=|pages=|oclc=1005108561}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the Structuralist view, phenotypic evolution is the result of the action of [[natural selection]] on previously ‘filtered’ variation during the course of [[ontogeny]]&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberch|first=Pere|date=1989|title=The logic of monsters: Evidence for internal constraint in development and evolution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0016-6995(89)80006-3|journal=Geobios|volume=22|pages=21–57|doi=10.1016/s0016-6995(89)80006-3|issn=0016-6995|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/biased-embryos-and-evolution/50D5C7174074E980B8A2AB4BC1A55819|title=Biased Embryos and Evolution|last=Arthur|first=Wallace|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780511606830|location=Cambridge|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511606830}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It contrasts with the ''Functionalist'' (also “adaptationist”, “pan-selectionist” or “externalist”) view in which phenotypic evolution result only from the interaction between the deterministic action of natural selection and variation caused by mutation&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

The rationale behind the role of the organism, or more specifically the embryo, as a causal force in evolution and for the existence of bias is as follows: The traditional, [[Neo-darwinian synthesis|neo-Darwinian]], approach to explain the process behind evolutionary change is natural selection acting upon heritable variation caused by genetic [[Mutation|mutations]]&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1051973071|title=Evolution: Making sense of life|last=Zimmer, Carl., Emlen D. and Perkins, Alison EH|first=|publisher=Greenwood Village, CO: Roberts|year=2013|isbn=9781319202590|location=|pages=|oclc=1051973071}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, natural selection acts on [[Phenotype|phenotypes]] and mutation does not in itself produce phenotypic variation, thus, there is a conceptual gap regarding the connection between a mutation and the potential change in phenotype&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. For a mutation to readily alter a phenotype, and hence be visible to natural selection, it has to modify the ontogenetic trajectory, a process referred to as ''developmental reprogramming''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arthur|first=Wallace|date=2000|title=The concept of developmental reprogramming and the quest for an inclusive theory of evolutionary mechanisms|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00028.x|journal=Evolution and Development|volume=2|issue=1|pages=49–57|doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2000.00028.x|issn=1520-541X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some kinds of reprogramming are more likely to occur than others given the nature of the genotype-phenotype map, which determines the propensity of a system to vary in a particular direction&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=Günter P.|last2=Altenberg|first2=Lee|date=1996|title=PERSPECTIVE: COMPLEX ADAPTATIONS AND THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLVABILITY|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02339.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=50|issue=3|pages=967–976|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02339.x|issn=0014-3820|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, thus, creating a bias. In other words, the underlying architecture of the developmental systems influences the kinds of possible phenotypic outcomes. 

However, developmental bias can evolve through natural selection, and both processes simultaneously influence phenotypic evolution. For example, developmental bias can affect the rate or path to an adaptive peak (high-fitness phenotype)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, and conversely, strong directional selection can modify the developmental bias to increase the phenotypic variation in the direction of selection&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uller|first=Tobias|last2=Moczek|first2=Armin P.|last3=Watson|first3=Richard A.|last4=Brakefield|first4=Paul M.|last5=Laland|first5=Kevin N.|date=2018|title=Developmental Bias and Evolution: A Regulatory Network Perspective|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/209/4/949|journal=Genetics|language=en|volume=209|issue=4|pages=949–966|doi=10.1534/genetics.118.300995|issn=0016-6731|pmc=6063245|pmid=30049818|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:DevelopmentalBiasContinuousTrait.jpeg|thumb|340x340px|Developmental bias for continuous characters.

=== Types of bias ===
'''Developmental constraint'''

Developmental constraints refer to the limitations on phenotypic variability (or absence of variation) caused by the inherent structure and dynamics of the developmental system&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Constraints are a bias '''''against''''' a certain ontogenetic trajectory, and consequently are thought to limit adaptive evolution&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

'''Developmental drive'''

Developmental drive refers to the inherent natural tendencies of organisms and their ontogenetic trajectories to change in a particular direction (i.e. a bias '''''towards''''' a certain ontogenetic trajectory)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;. This type of bias is thought to facilitate adaptive evolution by aligning phenotypic variability with the direction of selection&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.

The morphospace is a quantitative representation of phenotypes in a multidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a trait. The phenotype of each organism or species is then represented as a point in that space that summarizes the combination of values or states at each particular trait&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chartier|first=Marion|last2=Jabbour|first2=Florian|last3=Gerber|first3=Sylvain|last4=Mitteroecker|first4=Philipp|last5=Sauquet|first5=Hervé|last6=von Balthazar|first6=Maria|last7=Staedler|first7=Yannick|last8=Crane|first8=Peter R.|last9=Schönenberger|first9=Jürg|date=2014|title=The floral morphospace - a modern comparative approach to study angiosperm evolution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.12969|journal=New Phytologist|volume=204|issue=4|pages=841–853|doi=10.1111/nph.12969|issn=0028-646X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Nonrandom (anisotropic) distribution of phenotypic variation ===
Describing and understanding the drivers of the distribution of phenotypic variation in nature is one of the main goals in [[evolutionary biology]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. One way to study the distribution of phenotypic variation is through depicting the volume of the morphospace occupied by a set of organisms or species. Theoretically, there can exist a natural process that generates an almost-evenly (quasi stochastic) distributed pattern of phenotypes in the morphospace, regarding that new species necessary tend to occupy a point in the morphospace that is close to those of its phylogenetic relatives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199691883.001.0001|title=The Origin of Higher Taxa: Palaeobiological, developmental and ecological perspectives|last=Kemp|first=T.S.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199691883|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, it is now widely acknowledged that organisms are not evenly distributed along the morphospace, i.e. isotropic variation, but instead are nonrandomly distributed, i.e. anisotropic variation&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jablonski|first=D.|date=2017|title=Approaches to Macroevolution: 1.

In other words, there exists a discordance between the apparent (or theoretical) possible phenotypes and their actual accessibility&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;.
[[File:Friedrich-Johann-Justin-Bertuch Mythical-Creature-Dragon 1806-détouré.png|thumb|Ontogenetically impossible creature]]
Thus, some phenotypes are inaccessible (or impossible) due to the underlying architecture of the developmental trajectory, while others are accessible (or possible)&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=M.E.|date=2012|title=The developmental renaissance in adaptationism|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534712000031|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=27|issue=5|pages=278–287|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.12.005|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, of the possible phenotypes, some are ‘easier’ or more probable to occur than others&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;. For example, a phenotype such as the classical figure of a dragon (i.e. a giant reptile-like creature with two pairs of limbs and an anterior pair of wings) may be ''impossible'' because in vertebrates the fore-limbs and the anterior pair of wings are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] characters (e.g. birds and bats), and, thus, are mutually exclusive. On the other hand, if two phenotypes are possible (and equally fit), but one form of reprogramming requires only one mutation while the other requires two or more, the former will be more likely to occur (assuming that genetic mutations occur randomly)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.

An important distinction between structuralism and functionalism regards primarily with the interpretation of the causes of the empty regions in the morphospace (that is, the inexistent phenotypes): Under the functionalist view, empty spaces correspond to phenotypes that are both ontogenetically possible and equally probable but are eliminated by natural selection due to their low [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;. In contrast, under the structuralist view, empty spaces correspond to ontogenetically impossible or improbable phenotypes&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;, thus, implying a bias in the types of phenotypes that can be produced assuming equal amounts of variation (genetic mutations) in both models&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;.

=== Classical examples of anisotropic variation ===
[[File:Theba geminata variability.jpg|thumb|287x287px|Shell variation in nature]]
In a classical natural example of bias it was shown that only a small proportion of all possible snail shell shapes was realized in nature and actual species were confined to discrete regions of the shell-morphospace rather than being continuously distributed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raup|first=D.M.|date=1966|title=Geometric Analysis of Shell Coiling: General Problems|url=|journal=J Paleontol.|volume=|pages=1178-1190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In another natural example, it was shown that [[Geophilomorpha|soil-dwelling centipedes]] have an enormous variation in the number of pairs of legs, the lowest being 27 and the highest 191 pairs; however, there are no species with an even number of leg pairs, which suggests that either these phenotypes are somehow restricted during development or that there is a developmental drive into odd numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arthur|first=W|date=2002|title=The interaction between developmental bias and natural selection: from centipede segments to a general hypothesis|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/6800139|journal=Heredity|language=En|volume=89|issue=4|pages=239–246|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800139|issn=0018-067X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Conversely, developmental abnormalities (or [[Teratology|teratologies]]) have also been used as a classic example to understand the logic behind the mechanisms that produce variation&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1058406207|title=Freaks of Nature What Anomalies Tell Us About Development and Evolution.|last=Blumberg,|first=M.S.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=|isbn=9780199750641|location=|pages=|oclc=1058406207}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in a wide range of animals, from fish to humans, two-headed organisms are much more common than three-headed organisms; similarly, Siamese twins theoretically could ‘fuse’ through any region in the body but the fusion occurs more frequently in the abdominal region&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. This trend was referred to as ''transpecific parallelism'', suggesting the existence of profound historical rules governing the expression of abnormal forms in distantly related species&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;.

[[File:Gmatrix.jpeg|thumb|305x305px|Representation of the relationship between two traits. Left: No trait covariation. Each trait changes independently of the other.

Integration or covariation among traits during development has been suggested to constrain phenotypic evolution to certain regions of the morphospace and limit adaptive evolution&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goswami|first=A.|last2=Smaers|first2=J.

Under this approach, phenotype is seen as an integrated system where each trait develops and evolves in concert with the other traits, and thus, a change in one trait affects the interacting parts in a correlated manner&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pigliucci|first=M|date=2003|title=Phenotypic integration: studying the ecology and evolution of complex phenotypes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00428.x|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–272|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00428.x|issn=1461-023X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The correlation between traits is a consequence of the architecture of the genotype-phenotype map, particularly the [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effects of underlying genes&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;. This correlated change between traits can be measured and analyzed through a phenotypic variance-covariance matrix (P-matrix) which summarizes the dimensions of phenotypic variability and the main axis of variation&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;.

=== Quantitative genetics and the G-matrix ===
[[Quantitative genetics]] is a statistical framework mainly concerned with modeling the evolution of continuous characters &lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;. Under this framework, correlation between traits could be the result of two processes: 1) natural selection acting simultaneously on several traits ensuring that they are inherited together (i.e. [[linkage disequilibrium]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lande|first=Russell|last2=Arnold|first2=Stevan J.|date=1983|title=The Measurement of Selection on Correlated Characters|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2408842|journal=Evolution|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1210–1226|doi=10.2307/2408842}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or 2) natural selection acting on one trait causing correlated change in other traits due to pleiotropic effects of genes&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;. For a set of traits, the equation that describe the variance among traits is the multivariate breeder’s equation Δz = β x G, where Δz is the vector of differences in trait means, β is a vector of selection coefficients, and G is a matrix of the [[additive genetic variance]] and covariance between traits&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=S.J.|date=1992|title=Constraints on phenotypic evolution|url=|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=140|pages=S85-S107|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steppan, Scott J., Patrick C.

Thus, a population’s immediate ability to respond to selection is determined by the G-matrix, in which the variance is a function of standing genetic variation, and the covariance arises from pleiotropy and linkage disequilibrium&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=Adam G.|last2=Arnold|first2=Stevan J.|last3=Bürger|first3=Reinhard|date=2007|title=THE MUTATION MATRIX AND THE EVOLUTION OF EVOLVABILITY|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00071.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=727–745|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00071.x|issn=0014-3820|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although the G-matrix is one of the most relevant parameters to study evolvability&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;, the mutational matrix (M-matrix), also known as the distribution of mutational effects, has been shown to be of equivalent importance&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;. The M-matrix describes the potential effects of new mutations on the existing genetic variances and covariances, and these effects will depend on the epistatic and pleiotropic interactions of the underlying genes&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cheverud|first=James M.|date=1984|title=Quantitative genetics and developmental constraints on evolution by selection|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022519384800508|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=110|issue=2|pages=155–171|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(84)80050-8|issn=0022-5193|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In other words, the M-matrix determines the G-matrix, and thus, the response to selection of a population&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;. Similarly to the P-matrix, the G-matrix describes the main axis of variation.
=== Paths of least resistance ===
[[File:Morphospace&amp;FitnessLandscape.jpeg|thumb|325x325px|Morphospace and fitness landscape with a single fitness optimum. For a population undergoing directional selection, the main axis of variation (largest axis of the white ellipse) will bias the main direction of the trajectory toward the fitness optimum (arrow). The rate and of the trajectory through the morphospace will be inversely proportional to the angle (beta) formed between the direction of selection (dashed line) and the main axis of variation.]]A general consequence of the P-matrices and G-matrices is that evolution will tend to follow the ‘path of least resistance’. In other words, if the main axis of variation is aligned with the direction of selection, covariation (genetic or phenotypic) will facilitate the rate of adaptive evolution; however, if the main axis of variation is orthogonal to the direction of selection, covariation will constrain the rate of adaptive evolution&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;. In general, for a population under the influence of a single fitness optimum, the rate of morphological divergence (from an ancestral to a new phenotype or between pairs of [[species]]) is inversely proportional to the angle formed by the main axis of variation and the direction of selection, causing a curved trajectory through the morphospace&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schluter|first=Dolph|date=1996|title=Adaptive Radiation Along Genetic Lines of Least Resistance|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2410734|journal=Evolution|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1766–1774|doi=10.2307/2410734}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From the P-matrix for a set of characters, two broadly important measures of the propensity of variation can be extracted: 1) Respondability: ability of a developmental system to change in any direction, and 2) [[Evolvability]]: ability of a developmental system to change in the direction of natural selection&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;. In the latter, the main axis of phenotypic variation is aligned with the direction of selection. Similarly, from the G-matrix, the most important parameter that describes the propensity of variation is the lead [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvector]] of G (g&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), which describes the direction of greatest [[additive genetic variance]] for a set of continuous traits within populations&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;. For a population undergoing directional selection, g&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; will bias the main direction of the trajectory&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;.

[[Gene regulatory network|GRNs]] are modular, multilayered, and semi-hierarchically systems of genes and their products: each [[transcription factor]] provides multiple inputs to other genes, creating a complex array of interactions&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erwin|first=Douglas H.|last2=Davidson|first2=Eric H.|date=2009|title=The evolution of hierarchical gene regulatory networks|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2499|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|language=En|volume=10|issue=2|pages=141–148|doi=10.1038/nrg2499|issn=1471-0056|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and information regarding the timing, place and amount of gene expression generally flows from few high-level control genes through multiple intermediate genes to peripheral gene batteries that ultimately determine the fate of each cell&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;. This type of architecture implies that high-level control genes tend to be more [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] affecting multiple downstream genes, whereas intermediate and peripheral genes tend to have moderate to low pleiotropic effects, respectively&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;.

In general, it is expected that newly arisen mutations with higher dominance and fewer pleiotropic and [[Epistasis|epistatic]] effects are more likely to be targets of evolution&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/762460688|title=Evolution, development, &amp; the predictable genome|last=Stern|first=D.L.|date=2011|publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers|year=|isbn=1936221012|location=Greenwood Village, Colorado|pages=|oclc=762460688}}&lt;/ref&gt;, thus, the hierarchical architecture of developmental pathways may bias the genetic basis of evolutionary change. For instance, genes within GRNs with “optimally pleiotropic” effects, that is, genes that have the most widespread effect on the trait under selection but few effects on other traits, are expected to accumulate a higher proportion of mutations that cause evolutionary change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kopp|first=A.|date=2009|title=Metamodels and phylogenetic replication: A systematic approach to the evolution of developmental pathways|url=|journal=Evolution|volume=63|pages=2771–2789|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These ''strategically-positioned'' genes have the potential to filter random genetic variation and translate it to nonrandom functionally integrated phenotypes, making adaptive variants effectively accessible to selection&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;, and, thus, many of the mutations contributing to phenotypic evolution may be concentrated in these genes&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=D.L.|last2=Orgogozo|first2=V.|date=2008|title=THE LOCI OF EVOLUTION: HOW PREDICTABLE IS GENETIC EVOLUTION?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00450.x|journal=Evolution|language=en|volume=62|issue=9|pages=2155–2177|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00450.x|issn=0014-3820|pmc=2613234|pmid=18616572|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Given this architecture, the probability of mutating from one phenotype to another will depend on the number of neutral-neighbors relative to non-neutral neighbors for a particular GRN&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;, and thus, phenotypic change will be influenced by the position of a GRN within the network and will be biased towards changes that require few mutations to reach a neighboring non-neutral GRN&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
A '''digital organism''' is a [[Self-replication|self-replicating]] [[computer program]] that [[Mutation (genetic algorithm)|mutates]] and [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolves]].  Digital [[organism]]s are used as a tool to study the dynamics of Darwinian [[evolution]], and to test or verify specific hypotheses or [[mathematical model]]s of evolution.  The study of digital organisms is closely related to the area of [[artificial life]].

== History ==
Digital organisms can be traced back to the game [[Darwin (programming game)|Darwin]], developed in 1961 at Bell Labs, in which computer programs had to compete with each other by trying to stop others from [[Execution (computing)|executing]] .&lt;ref&gt;Aleph-Null, "Computer Recreations", Software: Practice and Experience, vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–96, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; A similar implementation that followed this was the game [[Core War]]. In Core War, it turned out that one of the winning [[strategy|strategies]] was to replicate as fast as possible, which deprived the opponent of all [[resource (computer science)|computational resources]].  Programs in the Core War game were also able to mutate themselves and each other by overwriting instructions in the simulated "memory" in which the game took place.  This allowed competing programs to embed damaging instructions in each other that caused errors (terminating the process that read it), "enslaved processes" (making an enemy program work for you), or even change strategies mid-game and heal themselves.

[[Steen Rasmussen]] at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] took the idea from Core War one step further in his core world system by introducing a genetic algorithm that automatically wrote programs. However, Rasmussen did not observe the evolution of complex and stable programs. It turned out that the [[programming language]] in which core world programs were written was very brittle, and more often than not mutations would completely destroy the functionality of a program.

The first to solve the issue of program brittleness was [[Thomas S. Ray]] with his [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system, which was similar to core world. Ray made some key changes to the programming language such that mutations were much less likely to destroy a program. With these modifications, he observed for the first time computer programs that did indeed evolve in a meaningful and complex way.

Later, [[Chris Adami]], Titus Brown, and [[Charles Ofria]] started developing their [[Avida]] system,&lt;ref&gt;http://avida.devosoft.org/&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by Tierra but again had some crucial differences. In Tierra, all programs lived in the same [[address space]] and could potentially overwrite or otherwise interfere with each other. In Avida, on the other hand, each program lives in its own address space. Because of this modification, experiments with Avida became much cleaner and easier to interpret than those with Tierra. With Avida, digital organism research has begun to be accepted as a valid contribution to evolutionary biology by a growing number of evolutionary biologists.  Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Lenski]] of [[Michigan State University]] has used Avida extensively in his work.  Lenski, Adami, and their colleagues have published in journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (USA).

In 1996, Andy Pargellis created a Tierra-like system called ''Amoeba'' that evolved self-replication from a randomly seeded initial condition.

'''Susan Cox Powell''' (October 16, 1981 - {{circa}} December 6, 2009) was an American [[missing person]] from [[West Valley City, Utah]]. Her disappearance and presumed murder, as well as the subsequent investigation and events garnered significant media attention.

On December 14, 2009, Susan's husband, Joshua "Josh" Powell, was named a [[person of interest]] in the investigation into her disappearance. However, Joshua was never charged; on February 5, 2012, Joshua killed himself and the couple's two young sons, Charles Joshua Powell (b.&amp;nbsp;January 19, 2005) and Braden Timothy Powell (b.&amp;nbsp;January 2, 2007) in a [[murder–suicide]] after custody of the boys had been awarded to Susan's parents, Charles and Judy Cox.

On May 21, 2013, West Valley City police closed their active investigation into Susan's disappearance, stating that they believed Joshua murdered her and that his brother Michael had assisted him in concealing her body.&lt;ref name=daily/&gt; Since then, there are ongoing calls to have Susan [[Declared death in absentia|legally declared dead]].&lt;ref name="sltrib"/&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Susan Powell family portrait.jpeg|thumb|right|Joshua and Susan Powell and sons Charles and Braden Powell]]
Susan Cox married Joshua Powell (b. January 20, 1976) at the [[Portland Oregon Temple]] of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in April 2001. They relocated to [[West Valley City]], [[Utah]], a suburb of [[Salt Lake City]], in 2004. Joshua had a bachelor's degree in business and worked for a number of different companies over the years,&lt;ref name="Mulick2012"/&gt; while Susan, a trained [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]], took up a job with [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Investments]] after the family's relocation.

Susan's [[emails]] to her friends indicated the presence of marital discord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rogers|first1=Melinda|title=In her own words: Susan Cox Powell wrote of fear in emails|url=https://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54004579-78/findsusan-susan-wrote-emails.html.csp|accessdate=15 January 2014|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=28 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116230710/http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=54004579&amp;itype=CMSID|archivedate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends attributed these problems both to financial stress brought upon by Joshua's extravagant spending habits and to his "very, very controlling" behavior towards Susan. Joshua filed for [[bankruptcy]] in 2007, declaring over $200,000 in debts.&lt;ref&gt;Adams B. and McFarland S. [http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14000824 "Susan Powell case: Police take DNA from missing West Valley City woman's husband."] ''Salt Lake Tribune''  December 6, 2009. Accessed January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Susan was expressing fears and frustrations about her marriage to friends. She recorded a video in July 2008, surveying property damage she attributed to Joshua and wrote a secret [[will and testament|will]] that included the statements, "I want it documented that there is extreme turmoil in our marriage" and, "If I die, it may not be an accident, even if it looks like one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vedder|first=Tracy|title=Chilling video Susan Powell made before disappearance released|url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Police-release-chilling-video-Susan-Powell-made-before-disappearance-208583251.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522010101/http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Police-release-chilling-video-Susan-Powell-made-before-disappearance-208583251.html|work=KOMO News|publisher=komonews.com|accessdate=6 January 2014|dead-url=yes|archivedate=22 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
The morning of December 6, 2009, Susan and her two sons, Charles (4) and Braden (2), attended church services at the Hunter 36th Ward. A neighbor visited them at home in the afternoon, leaving about 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.

At first, the entire Powell family were reported [[missing person|missing]] on December 7 by relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bergreen |first=Jason |url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_13954018 |title=West Valley City police looking for missing woman |newspaper=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua's mother Terrica and sister Jennifer Graves went looking for the family at their house shortly after being informed that the children had not been dropped off at daycare that morning. They called the police when they failed to make contact with Joshua and Susan. The police broke into the house, fearing that they might be victims of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. They found no one inside, but noticed two fans blowing on a wet spot on a carpet in the house.&lt;ref name="DN Timeline"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700222406/Timeline-of-events-surrounding-Josh-Powell-Susan-Cox-Powell.html |title=Detailed timeline of events surrounding Josh Powell, Susan Cox Powell |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan did not show up at her job on December 7; her purse, cell phone, and car were all found at the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/12/11/earlyshow/main5966103.shtml |title=Desperate Search for Missing Mom in Utah |publisher=CBS News |date=December 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that day, at about 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Joshua returned home with the two boys and was taken to the police station for questioning. He claimed he had left Susan sleeping at home shortly after midnight on December 7, and had taken his boys on a camping trip to [[Simpson Springs]] in western Utah.&lt;ref name="DN Timeline"/&gt; Police visited Simpson Springs on December 10, but found no evidence of the campsite that Joshua had described.&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt;

==Investigation==
Upon searching the Powell residence on December 9,&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fox13now.com/news/kstu-timeline-missing-west-valley-city-woman,0,1473366.story |title=Timeline of Susan Powell's disappearance |publisher=Fox 13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091218063444/http://www.fox13now.com/news/kstu-timeline-missing-west-valley-city-woman,0,1473366.story |archivedate=December 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; investigators found traces of Susan's blood on the floor, [[life insurance]] policies on Susan for {{US$|1.5 million}}, and a handwritten letter from Susan expressing fear for her life.&lt;ref name="AP March 30"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/30/10945991-court-documents-susan-powells-blood-hand-written-note-expressing-fear-were-found-in-utah-home |title=Court documents: Susan Powell's blood, hand-written note expressing fear were found in Utah home |publisher=MSNBC |agency=Associated Press |date=March 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA test]] results, released in 2013, matched one blood sample with Susan, while another sample was determined to have come from an "unknown male contributor".&lt;ref name="KSL May 23"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://img.ksl.com/slc/2507/250730/25073008.pdf |title=West Valley City photos, documents relating to the Susan Powell case |publisher=KSL |date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, West Valley City police released documents showing that Joshua took actions that were regarded as highly suspicious following her disappearance. He "did not appear to be concerned about [Susan's] welfare" when first questioned by police; liquidated her retirement accounts; cancelled her regularly scheduled [[chiropractic]] sessions; withdrew his children from daycare; and spoke to coworkers about how to hide a body in an abandoned [[mineshaft]] in the western Utah desert.&lt;ref&gt;Reavy, Pat (2012).

Investigators informed the media that they planned to question Joshua again,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,580166,00.html?test=latestnews | publisher=Fox News | title=Police to Question Husband of Missing Utah Mom Again | date=December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[subpoena]]ed all footage and interviews (aired and unaired) of Joshua from local television stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nathan |last=Carlisle |url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14033069?source=rss |title=Missing mom case: Cops subpoena TV interviews with Susan Powell's husband |newspaper=Salt Late Tribune |date=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, Joshua retained an attorney in connection with the investigation,&lt;ref name="Timeline"/&gt; and police said that he grew increasingly uncooperative.&lt;ref name = "JenDob1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Lisa |last1=Fletcher |first2=Sarah |last2=Netter |url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/susan-powell-husband-named-person-interest-wifes-disappearance/story?id=9349672#.TzGuoa6IOBU |title=Husband Named Person of Interest in Susan Powell Disappearance |publisher=ABC News |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, he took his sons to his hometown of [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], to stay with his father Steven for the holidays. By December 24, Joshua was considered a [[person of interest]] in the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reavy|first=Pat|title=Powell took his time getting home, neighbor says |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705353673/Powell-took-his-time-getting-home-neighbor-says.html?s_cid=s10 |accessdate=February 5, 2012 |newspaper=Deseret News|date=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, he returned with his brother Michael to pack the family's belongings, indicating he was moving permanently to Puyallup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Susan Powell timeline|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/53037060-78/powell-josh-susan-police.html.csp|work=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards, the website SusanPowell.org was established. Described as "the official website of Susan Powell," the site's anonymous entries defended Joshua &lt;!-- the remainder of this sentence is paraphrased from the cited blog, not a direct quote; please don't enclose the paraphrase in quotation marks --&gt; as the victim of a [[smear campaign]] by Susan's family, his sister Jennifer, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (archived) "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100830040453/http://susanpowell.org/Pages/Response/MormonsMobilize.aspx Mormons Mobilize Against The Powell Family]"&lt;/ref&gt; Additional posts also speculated that Susan's disappearance was connected to that of Steven Koecher, a ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' journalist who vanished the same week as Susan, and that the two had run off to [[Brazil]] together.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20101208042643/http://susanpowell.org/Pages/Response/Steven-Koecher-Susan-Powell/Steven-Koecher-Susan-Powell-Parallel-Utah-Disappearances-Connection.aspx Utah's Parallel Disappearances:  Susan Powell and Steven Koecher (archived)]", dated December 8, 2010, URL retrieved February 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua and Steven were widely believed to have written these posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hunsaker |first=Brent |url=http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top%20stories/story/Josh-Powell-leaving-Mormonism/erv_Gs8yBE6Uir_DAE_2lg.cspx |title=Josh Powell leaving Mormonism |date=June 2, 2010 |publisher=ABC 4 News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2010, both men claimed that Susan had abandoned her family due to [[mental illness]] and that she had left with another man.

Investigators' scrutiny extended to Joshua's father, Steven "Steve" Powell, upon learning that he had been obsessively infatuated with his son's wife. Computer images seized from Steven's house in 2010 turned up 4,500 images of Susan taken without her knowledge, including close-ups of specific body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/stephen-powell-took-thousands-of-images-of-in-law-susan-powell/|title=Stephen Powell Took Thousands of Images of In-Law Susan Powell|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=26 January 2015|first=Colleen|last=Curry|work=[[ABC News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512003828/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/12/stephen-powell-took-thousands-of-images-of-in-law-susan-powell/|archivedate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of her friends asserted that her move to Utah was motivated by a desire to avoid Steven's advances, which included love songs posted online under a [[pseudonym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Strange Twist in Susan Powell Case: Father-in-Law's Love Songs|url=http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/2972-strange-twist-in-susan-powell-case-father-in-laws-love-songs|accessdate=8 May 2016|work=Inside Edition|agency=Inside Edition Inc.|publisher=CBS Television Distribution|date=31 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504135437/http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/2972-strange-twist-in-susan-powell-case-father-in-laws-love-songs|archivedate=4 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Susan's disappearance, the friend reported Steven's apparent obsession with Susan to the police.&lt;ref name="People 09-26-2011" /&gt;

On September 14, 2011, Utah authorities discovered a possible gravesite while searching [[Topaz Mountain]], a desert area near [[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]] that Joshua had frequented as a campsite.&lt;ref name = "JenDob1"/&gt; There were signs of recent soil disturbance and shoveling, but after digging a few feet down, police were unable to find any remains, in spite of careful sifting of the soil. Federal [[anthropologist]]s also ruled out the possibility of the site being an ancient burial ground. Police continued to examine the site for a time, but offered no explanation as to why they previously announced the finding of remains when none had actually been confirmed. Authorities said they were following a scent detected by their [[sniffer dog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police: '50–50' Chance Powell's Remains Could Be Found |url=http://www.kirotv.com/news/news/police-50-50-chance-powells-remains-could-be-found/nDrtd/ |newspaper=KIRO-TV |date=September 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between and within the Powell and Cox families became increasingly hostile. After a police raid in their home in 2011, both Joshua and Steven spoke to major news outlets regarding [[Diary|journals]] that Susan had allegedly written about the relationship between Steven and herself. Steven claimed that he and Susan had been falling in love prior to her disappearance, and he cited the content of the journals (written when Susan was a teenager) as evidence to support his theory that she was mentally unstable and could have run away with another man. A judge issued a permanent [[injunction]] forbidding Joshua and Steven from publishing any material from Susan's journals, ordering the pair to either return or destroy any journals already published.&lt;ref name= "ABCNewsPorn1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Susan Powell's Dad-in-Law Took Naked Photos of Young Girls: Police |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/susan-powells-father-law-arrested-child-porn-voyeurism/story?id=14590503 |first1=Colleen |last1=Curry |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=September 25, 2011 |publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 22, Steven was arrested on charges of [[voyeurism]] and [[child pornography]] after police found evidence that he had secretly videotaped numerous women and young girls, including Susan. John Long, assistant Attorney General for Washington State, said that Joshua was a "subject" in the child porn investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Silverman |first=Stephen M. |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20532410,00.html |title=Josh Powell Now Subject of Child-Porn Investigation |publisher=People.com |date=September 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friend of Steven claimed that he was preoccupied with [[pornography]] and "was hung up on [Susan] sexually".&lt;ref name="People 09-26-2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Nudd |first=Tim |date=September 26, 2011 |title=Susan Powell's Father-in-Law Was Obsessed With Her, Says Friend |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20531765,00.html |publisher=People.com |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles "Chuck" Cox, Susan's father, filed for custody of her children the day after Steven was arrested. A Washington court eventually granted Cox temporary custody of the boys.&lt;ref name="custody"&gt;Adams, Brooke (2011). "[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52657756-78/powell-josh-steve-noose.html.csp Photo of Powell 'noose'; More porn allegations emerge]". ''Salt Lake Tribune'', September 29, 2011; URL accessed October 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled that Joshua would have to move out of his father's home if he wanted to regain custody, so he rented a house in [[Graham, Washington]]. However, authorities later alleged that he had never actually moved into that house, merely making it appear as if he had satisfied the court's instructions while continuing to reside at his father's home.&lt;ref name="TNT 02-14-2012"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/2012/02/14/2026058/investigators-josh-powell-used.html |title=Investigators: Josh Powell used house in Graham area as ruse |first=Kathleen |last=Merryman |newspaper=The News Tribune |date=February 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2011, Joshua's sister Jennifer stated that she believed Joshua was "responsible for his wife Susan Powell's disappearance".&lt;ref&gt;KOMO Staff (2011). "[http://www.komonews.com/news/local/130734733.html Sister: Children should be kept away from Josh Powell]", September 28, 2011; URL retrieved October 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His other sister Alina had also been suspicious of him as well; however, she later withdrew her suspicions and felt that Joshua had been unduly harassed by the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/josh-powells-sister-believes-innocent-wifes-disappearance/story?id=15545887#.TzxQ104geQw |title=Josh Powell Was Victim, His Sister Claims |date=February 9, 2012 |publisher=ABC News |first1=Abbie |last1=Boudreau |first2=Colleen |last2=Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, West Valley City had spent more than half a million dollars on the case. On September 28, Mayor Mike Winder indicated that he felt that the case was worth the expense, stating, "We feel that we are getting to that tipping point where we have more hot evidence than we have had in the past two years", and that the case was moving forward.&lt;ref name= "ABCNews4_1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Susan Powell case is at a "tipping point"|url=http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/Susan-Powell-case-is-at-a-tipping-point/UKndT35q0kSO43n678Qesw.cspx?rss=20|date=September 28, 2011|accessdate=September 29, 2011|publisher=ABC News 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2011, Joshua underwent a series of court-ordered evaluations in Washington. While the evaluations by James Manley determined that Joshua had adequate parenting skills, a steady employment history and no criminal record or history of [[domestic violence]], they also raised issues concerning the ongoing criminal investigations, Joshua's failure to admit normal personal shortcomings, his overbearing behavior with his sons, and his persistent defensiveness and [[paranoia]] (attributed to the police and media attention in conjunction with underlying [[Narcissistic Personality Disorder|narcissistic traits]]). The initial recommendation was for Joshua to have visitation with his sons several times a week, supervised by a [[social worker]].&lt;ref name="Mulick2012"&gt;Mulick, Stacey (2012). [http://blog.thenewstribune.com/crime/2012/02/17/psychologists-report-on-josh-powell-released/ Psychologist's report on Josh Powell released], Feb 2012, accessed 22 Aug 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last week of January 2012, Utah police discovered about 400 images of simulated child pornography, [[bestiality]] and [[incest]] on Joshua's computer. The images, while not illegal due to their being in a hand-drawn, or cartoonish 3-D format, were cause for "great concern" to Manley, particularly given Joshua's earlier denial of possessing any such material. Joshua was recommended to receive a more thorough psychosexual evaluation and [[polygraph test]], but Manley suggested no change in the visitation schedule with the Powell boys.&lt;ref name="Mulick2012"/&gt; Meanwhile, Michael established a [[Google Sites]] page which claimed that Susan's parents were abusing and neglecting the boys in collusion with [[child welfare]] authorities, and that West Valley Utah police had both mishandled the investigation into Susan's disappearance and were harassing Joshua. Lawyers for the Cox family disputed the allegations, and Google removed the site after a few days due to [[terms of use]] violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/sltrib/news/53405740-78/powell-website-josh-police.html.csp|title=Website supporting Josh Powell launches as custody case nears|first=Melinda|last=Rogers|date=January 31, 2012|website=www.sltrib.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 5, 2012, a social worker called [[9-1-1]] after bringing Charlie and Braden to a supervised visit at Joshua's house in [[South Hill, Washington]]. The woman, who was supposed to monitor the visit between Joshua and the boys, said he grabbed them and would not let her in the door.&lt;ref name="Chilling 911 calls from Powell home explosion released"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://mynorthwest.com/11/624009/Chilling-911-calls-from-Powell-home-explosion-released | title= Chilling 911 calls from Powell home explosion released | work=MyNorthwest.com | date=February 8, 2012 | accessdate=February 8, 2012 | author=MyNorthwest.com staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the house exploded, killing Joshua and the two children.

After a relatively brief investigation, officials confirmed that the explosion had been deliberately planned. The official cause of death for Joshua and the two boys was determined to be carbon monoxide poisoning, though the coroner also noted that both children had significant chopping injuries on the head and neck. A [[hatchet]] was recovered near Joshua's body, indicating that he had attacked the boys with it before being overwhelmed by smoke and fumes.&lt;ref name="komo-2012-02-06"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Autu-138825199.html | title=Autopsies: Powell children suffered 'chop injuries' | date=February 6, 2012 | accessdate=February 6, 2012 | author=KOMO Staff &amp; news services | quote=Seven-year-old Charles Powell and 5-year-old Braden Powell died of carbon monoxide poisoning, but an autopsy also showed that both boys were attacked by a hatchet, according to the Pierce County Medical Examiner.

Friends and relatives of Joshua told authorities that he had contacted them by email minutes before the incident to say goodbye. Some of them, including his pastor, received instructions about finding his money and shutting off his utilities.&lt;ref name="komo-2012-02-06-relatives"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.komonews.com/news/local/Autu-138825199.html | title=Autopsies: Powell children suffered 'chop injuries' | date=February 6, 2012 | accessdate=February 6, 2012 | author=KOMO Staff &amp; news services | quote=[...] Troyer said that minutes before the fire, Powell sent emails to several people saying, "I'm sorry.

Charles and Braden are buried at Woodbine Cemetery, which also contains a memorial for their mother. Joshua's remains were [[cremation|cremated]].

== Aftermath ==
On February 11, 2013, approximately one year after the death of Joshua and his sons, Michael took his own life in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], where he had moved for [[graduate school]]. He jumped from the roof of a parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Brooke|title=Josh Powell's brother, Michael Powell, commits suicide in Minneapolis|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/55817229-78/powell-josh-michael-sltrib.html.csp|work=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police had questioned Michael several times in 2012 after discovering &amp;ndash; two years after the fact &amp;ndash; that he had abandoned his car in a junkyard in [[Oregon]] several weeks after Susan's disappearance; Michael was "evasive" about the incident.&lt;ref name=daily/&gt; Utah authorities have since said they believe that Joshua and Michael were accomplices in the murder of Susan.&lt;ref name=daily&gt;{{cite web|title=Susan Powell's husband and his brother likely killed Utah mom: police|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/utah-man-brother-suspects-susan-powell-case-article-1.1350372|work=New York Daily News|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a February 2013 interview, Manley, who had conducted the 2011-2012 evaluations of Joshua for Washington authorities, expressed suspicion that he was possibly involved in his wife's disappearance. However, he did not mention these suspicions in his report because they were beyond the scope of his duties and because Joshua had not been charged with any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;Honda, Kirk (2013).

On May 21, 2013, West Valley City police announced that they had closed the active investigation into Susan's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlisle|first=Nate|title=Susan Powell case closed, files open|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=26790540&amp;itype=storyID|work=Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, a handwritten will assumed to have been written by Susan was found in a [[safety deposit box]]. It contained the line: "If I die, it may not be an accident, even if it looks like one," and instructed the reader not to show her husband the will. A video also surfaced of Susan surveying her home and documenting property damage she attributed to Joshua.&lt;ref name=Karlinsky&gt;{{cite news|last=KARLINSKY|first=NEAL|title=U.S. Susan Powell Case: Video of Missing Mom Surfaces as Case is Closed|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/susan-powell-case-video-missing-mom-surfaces-case/story?id=19240676|newspaper=ABC News|date=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua's sister Jennifer and co-author Emily Clawson wrote a [[memoir]] about the Powell family's tumultuous history. The memoir was published in June 2013 as ''A Light In Dark Places''. Jennifer was inspired to write the book, she says, "to help other people to recognize abuse in either their own relationships or relationships around them, because it's not always completely apparent."

In March 2015, Cox won a protracted court battle over the control of Susan's estate. Joshua's mother, Terrica, and his sister, Alina, had sought to have Susan declared [[legally dead]] to collect life insurance, but Cox ultimately gained full control of the estate.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Ben (2015).

Steven was released from prison on July 11, 2017, after serving a total of seven years following his voyeurism and child pornography convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox13now.com/2015/08/21/josh-powells-father-sentenced-for-child-porn-says-son-an-innocent-man-up-until-day-he-died/|title=Josh Powell's father sentenced; says son was 'innocent man' up until day he died|author=|date=22 August 2015|website=fox13now.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven passed away of natural causes on Monday, July 23, 2018 in Tacoma, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ksl.com/article/46365511/steven-powell-father-in-law-of-missing-utah-woman-dies|title=Steven Powell, father-in-law of missing Utah woman, dies|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan remains a missing person, but given the fates of her sons, it is widely believed that she was murdered by her husband. There are calls {{as of|2018|March|lc=y}} to have her declared dead, with the cause being homicide.&lt;ref name="sltrib"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=1899660&amp;itype=CMSID|title=Newest Susan Powell legal fight: When to declare her dead|author=Nate Carlisle|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=December 5, 2014|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Media==
Dave Cawley, a reporter for a news radio station in Salt Lake City, Utah, began a podcast on the Susan Powell case in November of 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://thecoldpodcast.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast, titled "Cold," offers evidence and information from the case that has never before been made public, such as voice and video recordings, interviews, and more.

An '''ethical decision''' is one that engenders trust, and thus indicates responsibility, fairness and caring to an individual. To be ethical, one has to demonstrate respect, and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Ethical Decisions|last=Josephson|first=Michael|publisher=Wes Hanson|year=2002|isbn=1-888689-13-7|location=Los Angeles|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical [[decision-making]] requires a review of different options, eliminating those with an unethical standpoint, and then choosing the best ethical alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson Institute of Ethics (2002). ''Making Ethical Decisions: Process''. Retrieved February 10, 2017, from http://blink.ucsd.edu/finance/accountability/ethics/process.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics vs. morals ==

The words "[[ethics]]" and "[[morals]]" are frequently used interchangeably and relate to the "wrong" and "right" conduct. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.diffen.com/difference/Ethics_vs_Morals|title=Ethics vs Morals - Difference and Comparison {{!}} Diffen|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics refer to behavior customary in a culture or society. Morals refer to personal standards of right and wrong. Morals do not change as a person moves from one society to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics: Ethical Decision Making and Cases|last=Ferrell|first=O.C.|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=9781305500846|location=Canada|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business ethics is associated with the creation and application of moral standards in a business setting. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbnonline.com/article/understanding-ethics-and-morality-in-business-there-are-distinct-differences-between-ethics-and-morality/|title=Understanding ethics and morality in business|work=Smart Business Magazine|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of ethical decision-making ==
{{Further|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
Ethical decisions come from a place of [[conscience]]. For many, conscience is simply an internal source of [[reward system|reward]] and [[punishment]].&lt;ref name="coon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coon|first=Dennis|title=Introduction to psychology: exploration and application|year=1986|publisher=West Pub. Co.|location=St. Paul|isbn=0-314-93167-8|pages=476–478|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; But according to researcher [[Lawrence Kohlberg]], conscience is only one of several ways in which ethical values are represented in the [[personality]].&lt;ref name="coon" /&gt; Kohlberg believes there are higher levels of [[moral development]] and these are [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|acquired in three stages]].&lt;ref name="coon" /&gt;

== Ethical decision-making in eastern religions ==

Traditions, such as [[Confucianism]], [[animism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Taoism]], have had a similar impact on their cultures. However, they all tend to emphasize different aspects of decisions than does Western academic ethics, which is said to suffer badly from a "[[Eye of Providence|God's Eye view]]" problem. By contrast, these non-Western traditions have emphasized the following:

=== Trust relationships ===

Trust relationships are the foundations of all ethical decisions. One must learn what is good and ethical from some [[role model]] or [[moral example]]. [[Religion]] often raises certain stories about certain people to this level deliberately.

=== Consistent description ===

All ethical and moral judgement attempts to make consistent descriptions of complex situations and difficult decisions.  It is considered to be important because, to those who practice the [[ethical tradition]] in which the descriptions are applied, it answers the big question: "How should we live?"

The very questions presupposes that we can define "how" (method), "should" (ambition), "we" (a group seeking consensus), "live" (beings with bodies).

Without this context, ethics is generally just talk implying moral judgement ''- called [[normative ethics]], and covered again in separate article.''

The remainder of this article is about practical approaches to '''ethical decision'''s that are observed in ordinary people's daily lives and in [[politics]] in particular:

=== De-escalating ===

An ethical decision is often thought of as the one that reduces future conflict.  In [[sociology]] and [[political science]], practical and [[applied ethics]] itself is often defined as a process of de-escalating moral conflicts to the point of:
* [[non-violence|non-violent]] resolution,
* [[harms reduction|reducing harm]], and
* [[education|educating]] as required so that each participant in a conflict can effectively see the other's [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]
At this point the conflict is unlikely to recur.

=== Avoiding right vs. wrong ===

Without this, we fall back to the simplistic view, which is "I am right and you are wrong and you do what I say." (''This is usually called [[moral absolutism]]'').  This kind of assertion, backed by force, is the basis of much authority and it leads to violence very often.  So much so that it turns out not to be the simplest way to live among humans in the long run, even if it is accepted by small groups (say a whole [[family]]) in the short run.

=== Right versus right ===

A simple, practical view is that ethics balances "right versus right":  if there's a dispute we care to hear, then each side must have some right on it.  However, this presupposes some instinctive moral core of the individual that must recognize right and wrong, else we do not have two individuals asserting "right" and requiring ethical help:  if either in fact secretly believes themselves "wrong" then they are engaging in tactics to reduce the chance of getting caught or alerting others to it, neither of which is studied by ethics.

=== An environment or context ===

Ethics can thus be viewed as a lever but one that rests on a moral fulcrum of pre-existing assumptions, like the bodies of the beings in conflict, placed there by circumstances, environments, situations, mostly out of their control&amp;nbsp;– only the choice of resolution is under their own control.  When the environment or context has some status in the decision, as in [[ecological ethics]], there is said to be a [[situated ethics]]. This is not the same as [[situational ethics]] which is about single decisions unlikely to recur.

== Basis for ethical decisions ==
Various factors are in play when making decisions. In terms of ethics, the following are significant:

;Organizational or group codes

Castes or groups in society may have their own [[moral syndrome]]s that simplify the types of decisions they make, e.g. as professionals in a commercial or governmental field.  [[Jane Jacobs]] claims there are two irreconcilable moral syndromes that arise from those contrasting views:
* [[Guardian Syndrome|Guardian syndrome]]
* [[Trader Syndrome|Trader syndrome]]

[[Paul Adler]] defined markets, hierarchies, and communities as three different ways to resolve and make an ethical decision.  While Jacobs denied that collusion or collaboration between the syndromes could be constructive, and called any confusion of the two a "monstrous moral hybrid", Adler thought that "Communities" could do this without corruption.  By Jacobs' definition the community itself might be a source of corruption.

;Family influences

[[George Lakoff]]'s theory of moral politics states that these arise from [[family role]] differences ultimately, with a [[moral code]] emphasizing the [[logos]] or "rule" of the father as being the source of the motivations of the political "right", and one emphasizing the more merciful moderns or mother-like view as being moral source for the "left".

;Castes

One solution is [[caste]]s:  people are raised to make decisions in particular ways based on their family traditions which are drawn from professional traditions.  Then people take on the profession for which they are best prepared.  This addresses the problem raised above, that the simplest ways to make '''ethical decision''s tend to conflict.  But of course then the choice of profession is not up to the person but the family or the society around them.

;Political parties

Without such a system, differences may evolve into some full system of community consensus or [[politics]]:

Politics, as [[Bernard Crick]] put it, is "ethics carried out in public".  His list of [[political virtues]] is an attempt to frame politics as a form of ethics, and ethics as a form of conflict resolution.

A [[political party]] for instance in [[democracy]] helps those who see ethical decisions the same way, form groups to promote those criteria for decisions that they see as most important.

;Commonalities

Most surviving societies recognize certain acts that are usually bad for the society, such as lying, stealing, murder of people, adultery, and impiety (to God or Nature which in early societies was often the same).

;Seeking safety

Sociologists and anthropologists believe that there is a tendency in most societies to support:
* belief and safety over doubt and risk,
* [[Social justice|fairness]], [[consent]] and [[duty]] over [[dissent]],
* [[knowledge]] instead of [[ignorance]],
* [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] and [[honesty]] over [[Lie|lying]]
* to be against what the culture considers [[evil]].

It is actually not possible to use any of those words without moral judgements&amp;nbsp;– possibly judgments inherited from the dictionary&amp;nbsp;– this is studied in [[meta-ethics]] and in [[descriptive ethics]] also.

Since all surviving societies must protect helpless people like elders, children, and pregnant women, it is likely that these concepts are defined more with reference to those helpless people than to others&amp;nbsp;– that is, those with power have a duty to protect the helpless.

;Right to thrive

One nearly-universal moral principle is some form of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|golden rule]]: "Act towards other people as you would want others to act towards you."  Another principle is that a person can only be blamed or praised if they could choose to act or refuse to act.  Another is that there seems to be something good about helping living things in general, or [[compassion]] or [[empathy]].

It is useful to distinguish "good from bad" in our actions just as we might distinguish "good from evil" morally in our thoughts.  It's also useful to recognize that we use the word "right" to assert what we are due and to judge what is correct.  To anything that's alive, it's "right" for it to live, that too is built into the body.  If a creature is physically fit and capable of thriving in its environment, it takes a lot to overcome a preference to live:

'''Ewoks''' are a fictional species of small, mammaloid bipeds that appear in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. They are [[hunter-gatherer]]s resembling [[teddy bear]]s that inhabit the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] and live in various arboreal huts and other simple dwellings. They first appeared in the 1983 film ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and have since appeared in two [[Television film|made-for-television films]], ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure|The Ewok Adventure]]'' (1984) and ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' (1985), as well as a short-lived [[Ewoks (TV series)|animated series]] and several books and games.

==Concept and creation==
[[George Lucas]] created the Ewoks because he wanted ''Return of the Jedi'' to feature a tribe of some primitive creatures that bring down the technological Empire. He had originally intended the scenes to be set on the [[Kashyyyk|Wookiee home planet]], but as the film series evolved, the [[Wookiees]] became technologically skilled. Lucas designed a new species instead, and as Wookiees were tall, he made Ewoks short.&lt;ref&gt;George Lucas, commentary track on the ''Return of the Jedi'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he also based the Ewoks' defeat of the Galactic Empire on the actions of the [[Viet Cong]] guerrillas who menaced American soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;George Lucas, "making of" documentary on the ''Return of the Jedi'' 2004 DVD release.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ewoks are named after the [[Miwok]], a Native American tribe, indigenous to the [[Redwood National and State Parks|Redwood forest]] in which the [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]] scenes were filmed for ''Return of the Jedi'', near the San Rafael location of Lucas' [[Skywalker Ranch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/26/movies/the-names-came-from-earth.html|title=The Names Came From Earth|author=Eric P. Nash|work=The New York Times|date=26 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the image of the [[Griffon Bruxellois]], a dog breed which Lucas owned, the Ewok was developed by renowned make-up artist [[Stuart Freeborn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/story/1048965/star-wars-make-up-artist-stuart-freeborn-dies "Star Wars Make-Up Artist Stuart Freeborn Dies"]. Sky News. Retrieved February 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/06/showbiz/obit-star-wars-stuart-freeborn/index.html "Makeup master Stuart Freeborn of 'Star Wars' dead at age 98"]. CNN. Retrieved February 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As presented in the films, Ewoks appear as stocky, [[sapience|sapient]] bipeds which stand about one metre tall. They have flat faces, are completely covered in fur, and have large jewel-like eyes. Both their fur and their eyes come in a variety of earth tones, primarily brown, white, grey, gold, and black. Despite their small size, Ewoks are strong; in the climactic battle scene of ''Return of the Jedi'', they are shown physically overpowering and once even throwing [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Imperial Stormtroopers]], though this detail is not consistent throughout the film. Ewoks live high among the trees of their home moon's forests, in villages built on platforms between the closely spaced trees.

An "Ewokese" language was created for the films by ''Return of the Jedi''{{'s}} [[sound designer]] [[Ben Burtt]]. On the commentary track for the DVD of ''Return of the Jedi'', Burtt explains that the language is based on [[Kalmyk language|Kalmyk]], a [[Mongolic language]] spoken by the [[Kalmyk people]] of [[Russia]]. Burtt heard the language in a [[Documentary film|documentary]] and liked its sound, which seems very alien to [[Western world|Western]] ears. After some research, he identified an 80-year-old Kalmyk [[refugee]]. Burtt recorded her telling folk stories in her native language, and then used the recordings as a basis for sounds that became the Ewok language and were performed by voice actors who imitated the old woman's voice in different styles. For the scene in which [[C-3PO]] speaks Ewokese, actor [[Anthony Daniels]] worked with Burtt and invented words, based on the Kalmyk recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Burtt, DVD commentary on ''The Return of the Jedi''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

===''Return of the Jedi''===
[[File:Ewok village 3.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ewok Village, [[Star Tours: The Adventures Continue]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in [[Florida]]]]
The Ewoks are involved in a large portion of the final installment in Lucasfilm's ''Star Wars'' trilogy. When the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] begins operations on the moon of Endor, prior to the events depicted in the film, it ignores the primitive Ewoks. [[Princess Leia]], part of a Rebel strike team, then befriends the Ewok [[Wicket W. Warrick]], a scout from Bright Tree village, and is taken to meet the other Ewoks. The Ewoks capture Han Solo, Chewbacca, Luke and the droids in a trap, and take them back to the village. As Ewoks are a carnivorous race that considers humanoid flesh a delicacy, they prepare fires in anticipation of eating Han, Luke and Chewbacca to absorb their power.

The Ewoks worship the protocol droid [[C-3PO]], thinking he is a [[deity|god]] due to his golden, metallic body and later display of power arranged by [[Luke Skywalker]] through [[the Force]]. C-3PO tells the Council of Elders the adventures of the rebel heroes Skywalker, Princess Leia, and [[Han Solo]]. The Ewoks accept the Rebels into their tribe and ally themselves to their cause. They then help in the ground battle to destroy the Imperial shield generator on the forest floor, and their primitive weapons fell the [[Imperial Stormtroopers]] and the [[Walker (Star Wars)#All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST)|AT-ST walkers]] of the Empire. This assistance paves the way to victory at the Battle of Endor. Later that night, the Ewoks are shown holding a huge celebration.

Ewoks speak their native language of Ewokese, a fictional language created for the film. This language is understood by C-3PO, but not the humans in the film.

The word ''Ewok'' is not mentioned anywhere in the film, nor are any individuals referred to by name, except in the end titles, where names of the more prominent characters (Wicket, Paploo, Teebo, Logray and Chirpa) are shown, while the others are just listed as Ewoks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Return of the Jedi (1983) Trivia"|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/trivia|accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-''Return of the Jedi''===

After the release of ''Return of the Jedi'', the Ewoks starred in two [[Television film|made-for-TV movies]], both of which starred [[Warwick Davis]] reprising his role as Wicket from ''Return of the Jedi''.&lt;ref name=EwokTV&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alter|first1=Ethan|title='Star Wars': How the Ewoks Came to TV 31 Years Ago|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/star-wars-ewoks-caravan-of-courage-the-battle-190346641.html|website=Yahoo|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film, ''[[Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure|The Ewok Adventure]]'', was released in November 1984, followed by ''[[Ewoks: The Battle for Endor]]'' the next year.&lt;ref name=EwokTV/&gt; The Ewoks also starred in cartoon series on ABC known simply as ''[[Ewoks (TV series)|Ewoks]]''.&lt;ref name=Ewokscartoon&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alter|first1=Ethan|title='Star Wars': How 'Ewoks' and 'Droids' Arrived on Saturday Morning TV|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/paul-dini-ewoks-droids-star-wars-175933375.html|website=Yahoo|accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The Ewoks were a controversial addition to ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and the ''Star Wars'' universe in general, and are seen by some to be the weakest link of the original trilogy. According to Tami Katzoff of [[MTV News]], "a prevailing theory among Ewok-haters is that the creatures were originally conceived as a sure way to appeal to small children and sell plush toys to their parents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1707918/star-wars-return-of-jedi-30-years-ewoks/|title=FANS STILL LOVE TO HATE EWOKS 30 YEARS LATER |author= TAMI KATZOFF | publisher=www.mtv.com |accessdate=March 16, 2017 |date = 
May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ewoks have some defenders, and have proven to be very popular with children from their introduction in the 1980s to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/star-wars-episode-vi--the-return-of-the-jedi/ewoks-hate-defence/|title=Cute but deadly: why Ewoks deserve your respect |publisher=www.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=March 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Ewoks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary|last=Reynolds|first=David|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=256, 257}}&lt;/ref&gt;==

===Wicket===
{{main|Wicket W. Warrick}}
Wicket is the most prominently featured Ewok in ''Return of The Jedi''. During his travels, he encounters Princess Leia in the [[forest]]. He helps her to the relative safety of his village, and notices her [[kindness]] and good spirit. Wicket has good knowledge of the [[terrain]] of Endor, leading him to be essential during the Rebellion's attack on the Imperial forces.
Wicket was portrayed by actor [[Warwick Davis]].

===Teebo===
Teebo is described by the ''Star Wars: The Complete Visual Dictionary'' as being '''A watcher of the stars and a poet at heart.''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' His ability to make a sound practical [[judgement]] has caused him to have a position as a [[Leadership|leader]] within the [[tribe]]. He wears a Gurreck [[skull]] headdress.
Teebo was portrayed by Jack Purvis.

===Chief Chirpa===
Chief Chirpa has been the leader of the Ewok tribe for a total of 42 seasons. He has a large amount of [[wisdom]] and good judgement, but he has become [[Forgetting|forgetful]] due to his old age. He allows the Ewok tribe the [[authority]] to fight against the Empire. Chief Chirpa has a [[medal]]lion signifying he is the chief of the Ewoks.
Chirpa was played by [[Jane Busby]].

===Logray===
Logray is the Ewok tribal shaman, who relies on ancient magic in order to assist his tribe. He is suspicious of all outsiders, which is reinforced due to the arrival of Imperial [[troop]]s.
Logray was portrayed by [[Mike Edmonds]] who also was "tail-puppeteer" for [[Jabba the Hutt]].

===Paploo===
Paploo is Chief Chirpa's nephew and a scout who, along with Wicket, helps lead the Rebels to the shield generator protecting the Death Star. Although his effort to lure four Imperial scouts away from the bunker could have compromised the attack, it was relatively successful as he stole a speeder bike and forced three of the scouts to give chase, allowing the rebels to overpower the last guard and gain entrance. Paploo is seen later helping the Ewoks fight the Empire.

=== Nippet ===
Nippet is a baby Ewok who gets her name in the vintage era. Nippet is the daughter of Lumat.&lt;ref name="StarWars.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/meet-the-ewoks-from-endor|title=Meet the Ewoks from Endor {{!}} StarWars.com|date=2014-10-30|work=StarWars.com|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lumat ===
Lumat is the chief woodcutter of the tribe, and is the father of Nippet.&lt;ref name="StarWars.com"/&gt;

The '''Family Violence Prevention and Services Act''' (FVPSA) is a [[United States]] law, first authorized as part of the Child Abuse Amendments of 1984 (PL 98–457), that provides federal funding to help victims of [[domestic violence]] and their dependent children by providing shelter and related help, offering violence prevention programs, and improving how service agencies work together in communities. 
* The 24-hour, confidential, toll-free [[National Domestic Violence Hotline]] provides support, information, referrals, safety planning, and [[crisis intervention]] in more than 170 languages to hundreds of thousands of domestic violence victims each year.
* The Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancements and Leadership Through Alliances (DELTA) Program teaches people ways to prevent violence.
* Formula Grants. This money helps states, territories, and tribes create and support programs that work to help victims and prevent family violence. The amount of money is determined by a formula based partly on population. The states, territories, and tribes distribute the money to thousands of domestic violence shelters and programs.&lt;ref name=US-DHHS&gt;[http://www.womenshealth.gov/violence-against-women/laws-on-violence-against-women/ ''Laws on violence against women.''] Office on Women's Health, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

{{Fiji Expeditions}}

The '''First Fiji Expedition''' undertaken by the [[United States]] occurred in October 1855 during the [[civil war]] on the islands. In response to the alleged [[arson]] attacks on the American [[commercial agent]] in [[Lautoka]], [[Viti Levu]], the navy sent a warship to demand compensation for the attack from [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau]] and self-proclaimed [[Tui Viti]] (King of Fiji).&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Casualties: U.

==Expedition==
The first incident that led to the American expedition was in 1849 when the house owned by agent [[John Brown Williams]] was hit by [[cannon]] fire and burned. The Fijians were allegedly celebrating [[Fiji Day|Independence Day]]{{Clarify|date=January 2017}} when cannonballs fell on the building. The second incident happened the same year as the expedition when, again, fire was to interrupt John Williams's duties. After another accidental fire on [[Nukulau]] destroyed his store and some Fijians looted it. {{USS|John Adams|1799|2}}, under [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] [[Edward B. Boutwell]], was sent to monitor the unrest in October and her crew were landed on more than one occasion to protect American interests. When Commander Boutwell heard of the incidents involving William's house and store, he demanded [[United States dollar|US$]]5,000 in compensation from King Cakobau. This initial claim was supplemented by further claims totalling $45,000. The natives received a deadline saying if they failed to pay, a landing party of [[United States Marine Corps|marine]]s and [[United States Navy|sailor]]s would be sent ashore to capture the king in the island's village. Fijian [[warrior]]s put up some resistance and one American service man was killed and two were wounded. Ultimately the men of ''John Adams'' were successful in routing a contingent of natives from Lautoka but Cakobau and the survivors escaped capture.

Cakobau's claim to be King of Fiji was by no means universally recognized by his fellow-[[ratu|chiefs]], who jealously guarded the independence of their fiefdoms. His dilemma was that if he acknowledged the debt, he did not have sufficient funds to pay it, but that if he disclaimed it by saying that it fell under the jurisdiction of another chief, he would jeopardize his claim to the kingship, which he wanted foreign powers to recognize. He decided to bide his time, hoping that the Americans were only bluffing.

A second [[Second Fiji Expedition|expedition]] in 1858, involving the crew of {{USS|Vandalia|1828|2}}, achieved clearer results but in the end, Cakobau never paid the debt.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;&lt;ref name=State/&gt;&lt;ref name=cooney&gt;{{cite book| title=A Chronology of the U.

'''Forest reproductive material''' is a part of a tree that can be used for reproduction such as seed, cutting or seedling.  Artificial [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], carried out through [[Sowing|seeding]] or planting, typically involves transferring forest reproductive material to a particular site from other locations while natural regeneration relies on genetic material that is already available on the site.&lt;ref name="konnert15"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konnert, M.; Fady, B.;Gömöry, D.; A’Hara, S.; Wolter, F.; Ducci, F.; Koskela, J.; Bozzano, M.; Maaten, T. &amp; Kowalczyk, J.|title=Use and transfer of forest reproductive material in Europe in the context of climate change |publisher=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme, [[Bioversity International]], Rome, Italy|date=2015|pages=xvi and 75 pp |url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/EUFORGEN_FRM_use_transfer.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical opportunities and challenges to ensure quality and quantity of forest reproductive material can be found in the activities of identification, selection, procurement, propagation, conservation, improvement and sustained production of reproductive material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus, A. &amp; Robbins, J.|title=Forest reproductive material: Future opportunities and challenges|date=2003|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/ARTICLE/WFC/XII/0864-B4.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of low quality or poorly adapted forest reproductive material can have very negative impact on the vitality and resilience of a forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koskela, J.; Buck, A. &amp; Teissier du Cros, E.

In Europe, much of the material used for artificial regeneration is produced and transferred within a single country. However, forest reproductive material, usually in the form of seeds or cuttings, is increasingly traded across national borders, especially within the European Union.&lt;ref name="konnert15"/&gt;

This will most likely increase the future demand for imported forest reproductive material as forest managers and owners try to identify tree species and provenances that will be able to grow in their land under new climatic conditions.&lt;ref name="konnert15"/&gt; Especially, forest reproductive material with high plasticity will be increasingly useful for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mátyás, C.|title=What do field trials tell about the future use of forest reproductive material?|journal=In: Koskela, J., Buck, A. and Teissier du Cros, E., (eds).

{{LGBT rights}}
The '''gay panic defense&lt;ref&gt;''Gay panic defence'' in UK and NZ. Also known as the ''homosexual advance defence'' strategy in Australia. See [[American and British English differences]].&lt;/ref&gt;''' is an attempted legal defense, usually against charges of [[assault]] or [[murder]]. A defendant using the defense claims they acted in a state of violent [[Insanity defense|temporary insanity]] because of unwanted same-sex sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chuang HT, Addington D.|date=October 1988|title=Homosexual panic: a review of its concept|journal=[[The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry]]|volume=33|issue=7|pages=613–7|pmid=3197016|doi=10.1177/070674378803300707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant alleges to find the same-sex sexual advances so offensive and frightening that it brings on a psychotic state characterized by unusual violence.

'''Trans panic''' is a similar defense applied in cases of assault, manslaughter, or murder of a [[transgender]] individual, with whom the assailant(s) engaged in sexual relations unaware that the victim is transgender until seeing them naked, or further into or post sexual activity.

==Jurisdictions==
===Australia===
In Australia, it is known as the homosexual advance defense (HAD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/clrd/ll_clrd.nsf/vwPrint1/CLRD_had|title=Homosexual Advance Defence: Final Report of the Working Party|date=September 1998|accessdate=7 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027130927/http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/clrd/ll_clrd.nsf/vwPrint1/CLRD_had|archivedate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[The Australian]]''|date=23 October 1995|title=Gay rally puts 'panic defence' on trial|author=Amanda Meade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the status of the HAD in Australia, Kent Blore wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the homosexual advance defence cannot be found anywhere in legislation, its entrenchment in case law gives it the force of law. [...] Several Australian states and territories have either abolished the umbrella defence of provocation entirely or excluded non-violent homosexual advances from its ambit. Of those that have abolished provocation entirely, Tasmania was the first to do so in 2003.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Homosexual Advance Defence and the Campaign to Abolish it in Queensland: The Activist's Dilemma and the Politician's Paradox|author=Kent Blore|journal=QUT Law &amp; Justice Journal|volume=12|number=2|year=2012|url=https://lr.law.qut.edu.au/article/view/489|doi=10.5204/qutlr.v12i2.489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed similar reforms in 2005, followed by [[Western Australia]] in 2008 and [[Queensland]] in 2017 (with a clause to allow it in 'exceptional circumstances' to be determined by a magistrate).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/gay-panic-laws-pass-queensland-parliament-removing-partial-defence-20170321-gv32j8.html|title=Gay panic laws pass Queensland Parliament, removing partial defence|last=Caldwell|first=Felicity|work=Brisbane Times|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a differing approach, [[New South Wales]], the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] and [[Northern Territory]] have implemented changes to stipulate that non-violent sexual advances (of any kind, including homosexual) aren't a valid defence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[South Australia]] was the first Australian jurisdiction to legalise consensual homosexual acts in 1975; however, {{As of|April 2017|lc=y}} it was the only Australian jurisdiction not to have repealed or overhauled the gay panic defence.&lt;ref name="SALRI Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Provoking Operation of Provocation |url=https://law.adelaide.edu.au/research/law-reform-institute/documents/provocation_stage_1_report.pdf |publisher=South Australian Law Reform Institute |accessdate=9 March 2018 |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the South Australian state government was awaiting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timebase.com.au/news/2017/AT04291-article.html|title=Overview of Homosexual Advance Defence Laws Across Australia: South Australia Still to Enact Change|date=5 July 2017|work=Time Base|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-22/sa-becomes-last-state-to-allow-gay-panic-defence/8376948.html|title=South Australia Becomes Last State to Allow Gay Panic Defence for Murder|last=Jones|first=Ruby|date=22 March 2017|work=ABC News|access-date=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the report from the South Australian Law Reform Institute and the outcome of the appeal to the High Court from the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia. In 2011 Andrew Negre was killed by Michael Lindsay bashing and stabbing him. Lindsay's principle defence was that he stabbed Negre in the chest and abdomen but Negre's death was the result of someone else slitting Negre's throat. The secondary defence was that Lindsay's action in stabbing Negre was because he had lost self-control after Negre made sexual advances towards him and offered to pay Lindsay for sex. The jury convicted Lindsay of murder and he was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 23-year non-parole period. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the conviction finding that the directions to the jury on the gay panic defence were flawed, but that every reasonable jury would have found that an ordinary person could not have to lost self-control and acted in the way Lindsay did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|SASCFC|56|2014|litigants=R v Lindsay |date=3 June 2014 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (SA, Australia)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court held that a properly instructed jury might have found that an offer of money for sex made by a Caucasian man to an Aboriginal man in the latter's home and in the presence of his wife and family may have had a pungency that an unwelcome sexual advance made by one man toward another in other circumstances would not have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|17|2015|litigants=Lindsay v the Queen}} {{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/assets/publications/judgment-summaries/2015/hca-16-2015-05-06.pdf |title=judgment summary |publisher=[[High Court of Australia]] |date=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay was re-tried and was again convicted of murder. The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the conviction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|SASCFC|129|2016|litigants=R v Lindsay |date=8 December 2016 |courtname=[[Supreme Court of South Australia|Court of Criminal Appeal]] (SA, Australia)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCATrans|131|2017|litigants=Lindsay v The Queen |date=16 June 2017 |courtname=auto}}.)&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017 the South Australian Law Reform Institute recommended that the law of provocation be reformed to remove discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and / or gender, but that the removal of a non-violent sexual advance as a partial defence to murder be deferred until stage 2 of the report was produced.&lt;ref name="SALRI Report"/&gt;

===New Zealand===
* In 2003, a gay interior designer and former television host, David McNee, was killed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3515038|title=Homicide detectives continue inquiry into designer's death|publisher=NZ Herald News|date=28 July 2003|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a part-time sex worker, Phillip Layton Edwards. Edwards said at his trial that he told McNee he was not gay, but would masturbate in front of him on a "no-touch" basis for money. The defense successfully argued that Edwards, who had 56 previous convictions and had been on parole for 11 days, was provoked into beating McNee after he violated their "no touching" agreement. Edwards was jailed for nine years for manslaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Dominion Post (Wellington, New Zealand)|date=17 February 2005|title=McNee's killer appeals against sentence|page=3|quote=Phillip Layton Edwards has appealed against his nine-year prison sentence for the manslaughter of television interior designer David McNee, claiming other young men who killed in similar circumstances received shorter jail terms. In the Court of Appeal at Auckland yesterday, his lawyer Roy Wade pointed to two cases in which young men who killed an older man who made homosexual advances received terms of four and three years ... Mr McNee, 55, the star of television show 'My House, My Castle', died in the bedroom of his St Mary's Bay home in July 2003 after choking on his own vomit while unconscious. Edwards had hit him 30 to 40 times in the head and face in a beating a pathologist described as severe.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Sunday Star-Times (Auckland, New Zealand)|date=9 July 2006|title=Move to end provocation defence for gay murders|author=Boland Mary Jane|page=8|quote=The McNee case was a classic example of the law not protecting gay men, Lambert said.

* In July 2009, Ferdinand Ambach, 32, a Hungarian tourist, was convicted of killing Ronald Brown, 69, by hitting him with a banjo and shoving the instrument's neck down Brown's throat. Ambach was initially charged with murder, but the charge was downgraded to manslaughter after Ambach's lawyer successfully invoked the gay panic defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10583823|title=Gay MP calls for change to law|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=11 July 2009|accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10583689|title=Gay community calls for justice over banjo killing|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=10 July 2009|accessdate=4 August 2009|author=Andrew Koubaridis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On November 26, 2009, the New Zealand Parliament voted to abolish Section 169 of the [[Crimes Act 1961]], removing the provocation defence from New Zealand law, although it was argued by some that this change was more a result of the failed provocation defence in the [[Murder of Sophie Elliott|Sophie Elliott murder trial]] by her ex-boyfriend.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3101491"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3101491/Parliament-scraps-provocation-defence-law|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130223072440/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/3101491/Parliament-scraps-provocation-defence-law|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 February 2013|title=Parliament scraps partial defence of provocation|author=Hartevelt, John|date=27 November 2009|work=[[The Press]]|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Guidance given to counsel by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] of [[England and Wales]] states: "The fact that the victim made a sexual advance on the defendant does not, of itself, automatically provide the defendant with a defence of self-defence for the actions that they then take." In the UK, it has been known for decades as the "Portsmouth defence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letters/no-portsmouth-defence-father-and-child-let-down-and-others-734697.html|title=No 'Portsmouth defence' Father and child let down and others|date=6 November 2003|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204000638/http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/letters/no-portsmouth-defence-father-and-child-let-down-and-others-734697.html|archivedate=4 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Queer Verdict; It happens time and again.

===United States===

====Bans of the defense====
The gay panic defense in the United States has been banned explicitly only within [[California]], [[Rhode Island]] and [[Illinois]], but the [[American Bar Association]] suggested in 2013 that other states follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/resolution_on_gay_panic|title='Gay panic' criminal defense strategies should be curtailed by legislation, ABA House resolves|last=Carter|first=Terry|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, California amended its penal code to include jury instructions to ignore bias, sympathy, prejudice, or public opinion in making their decision, and a directive was made to educate district attorneys' offices about panic strategies and how to prevent bias from affecting trial outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite California statute|year=2006|chapter=550|page=4617|title=The Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act|ex=|res=|HR=AB 1160|quote=[http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/2006/1755_2006_Volume4.pdf An act to add Section 1127h to the Penal Code, relating to crime.]&lt;br/&gt;[Approved by Governor September 28, 2006.

Nothing in this section shall preclude the jury from considering all relevant facts to determine whether the defendant was in fact provoked for purposes of establishing subjective provocation.&lt;br/&gt;(2) For purposes of this subdivision, "gender" includes a person’s gender identity and gender-related appearance and behavior regardless of whether that appearance or behavior is associated with the person's gender as determined at birth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, [[Bruce Rauner]], Governor of [[Illinois]], signed a bill eliminating the gay and trans panic defenses in that state.&lt;ref name="metro-28aug2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riley|first1=John|title=Illinois governor signs "gay panic" and trans birth certificate bills into law|url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2017/08/illinois-governor-signs-gay-panic-trans-birth-certificate-bills-law|accessdate=31 August 2017|newspaper=Metro Weekly|date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, a bill to repeal the gay and trans panic defense passed the [[Rhode Island Assembly]] (House vote 68–2 passed and Senate [[voice vote]] 27-0 passed). The [[Governor of Rhode Island]] signed the bill into law a month later in July 2018. The law went into effect immediately.&lt;ref&gt;[https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/H7066/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://legiscan.com/RI/bill/S3014/2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gregg|first1=Katherine|title=R.I.

====Uses of the defense====
The gay panic defense is generally invoked in cases where the guilt of the defendant is unquestioned, but only to strengthen a more "traditional criminal law defense such as insanity, diminished capacity, provocation, or self-defense" and is not meant to provide justification of the crime on its own.&lt;ref name=Lee2008/&gt; While using the gay panic defense to explain insanity has typically not been successful in winning a complete acquittal, diminished capacity, provocation, and self-defense have all been used successfully to reduce charges and sentences.&lt;ref name=Lee2008/&gt; Historically, in US courts, use of the gay panic defense has not typically resulted in the acquittal of the defendant; instead, the defendant was usually found guilty, but on lesser charges, or judges and juries may have cited homosexual solicitation as a mitigating factor, resulting in reduced culpability and sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bottoms.honors.uic.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Salerno-Najdowski-bottoms-kemner-dave-harrington-2014-Gay-Panic-PPPL.pdf |title=Excusing Murder? Conservative Jurors' Acceptance of the Gay-panic defense|author1=Salerno, Jessica M.|author2=Najdowski, Cynthia J.|author3=Harrington, Evan|author4=Kemner, Gretchen|author5=Dave, Reetu|date=April 2016|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago|accessdate=22 March 2017|quote=The gay-panic defense is a specific type of provocation defense in which the defendant claims that the crime in question was the result of a sudden and intense passion provoked by the victim’s unwanted same-gender sexual advance. It is primarily used by straight men claiming that they found the experience of an unwanted same-gender sexual advance so upsetting that they temporarily became enraged and lost control of their own behavior (Lee, 2008). Chen (2000) argues that the acceptance of a gay-panic defense implies acceptance of a nonviolent same-gender sexual advance as an adequate trigger to cause a person to fall into an uncontrollable state of panic. If jurors collectively agree that the reaction was reasonable, they can find the defendant guilty of a lesser offense, which often results in a lesser sentence (Lee, 2008).}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous case in which this occurred was the "[[Jenny Jones (presenter)|Jenny Jones]]" case, in which Jonathan Schmitz was tried for the first-degree murder of Scott Amedure and was instead found guilty of the lesser offense of second-degree murder.&lt;ref name=PeoplevSchmitz/&gt; Some instances where the gay panic defense has been invoked include:

* In August 1954, William T. Simpson, a 27-year-old [[flight attendant|air steward]] for [[Eastern Air Lines]], was murdered by Charles W. Lawrence and Lewis Richard Killen in a "[[lovers' lane]]" area of [[North Miami, Florida]]. For months, Lawrence had been posing as a [[hitchhiking|hitchhiker]] on [[Biscayne Boulevard]]; after he was picked up, Killen would trail the car in a green Chevrolet and rob the driver who had picked up Lawrence. During the course of the investigation, Milt Sosin, a reporter for ''[[The Miami News]]'', wrote that Lawrence and Killen had chosen the area deliberately to target homosexual victims. Lawrence confessed to shooting Simpson while "resisting his advances" and stated that "Simpson started to get nervous ... I didn't mean to shoot him. I mean[t] to fire through the windshield and frighten him and keep him there. I must have hit him."&lt;ref name=LAT-101120&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2010/11/death-in-miami.html|title=Death in Miami|date=20 November 2010|publisher=Los Angeles Times|website=The Daily Mirror: Los Angeles History [blog]|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence and Killen were convicted of manslaughter instead of first-degree murder, possibly due to negative local press coverage of homosexuality and the characterization of Simpson as "a pervert" during the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=73031|title=LGBT History Month: 1954 Miami murder leads to 'homosexual panic'|author=Brunk, Graham|date=19 October 2017|newspaper=The Bay Area Reporter|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* James Bierley was stabbed to death by Robert James Thornton on January 8, 1970 in [[Columbia, Missouri]]. Bierley and Thornton were neighbors residing in the same apartment building; in a statement he gave four days later, Thornton said he had been drinking when Bierley invited him upstairs to his room to watch television. After watching for half an hour, in Thornton's statement, "[Bierley] started playing with me and put his arm around me ... he started kissing me on the jaw ... I told him three or four times to quit what he was doing and he just kept on like he didn't hear me." When Thornton attempted to leave, Bierley grabbed him and pulled him back into the room, where Thornton felt "that he was trying to queer me and I just blew up and started stabbing him.

Thornton was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. In an appeal ruling, the Missouri Court of Appeals noted that since the victim was attempting to commit a felony upon Thornton (sodomy was a felony offense under §&amp;nbsp;563.230 RSMo 1969), homicide could be justifiable (under §&amp;nbsp;559.040 RSMo 1969), but instead, because Thornton tried to hide the knife and denied the crime when questioned by police on the evening of January 8, that indicated a consciousness of guilt rather than justifiable homicide. The Appeals Court rejected the defense that Thornton was in a state of "homosexual panic" as the pair had been sitting in a small room together with the door open, there were no signs of a physical struggle, Bierley had no weapon and according to Thornton's statement, had not made any threats, and no other residents reported unusual noises or shouts.&lt;ref name="532SW2d37"/&gt;

Shelley visited Dubbels at his home with some friends near midnight on September 2 and after drinking and joking for several hours, the friends departed, leaving Shelley and Dubbels alone. At some point during the evening, Dubbels had expressed his physical attraction to Shelley, but it was not taken seriously in the joking context of the gathering; after they were alone, Dubbels suggested that Shelley spend the rest of the night to help him open the store in the morning. Shelley agreed, and after taking a shower, got into bed with Dubbels. Dubbels made sexual advances, but was rebuffed. Shelley, upset, went downstairs to retrieve a meat cleaver and roasting fork from the kitchen. After returning to the upstairs bedroom, Dubbels reportedly put his arm around Shelley, and Shelley responded by attacking and killing Dubbels. Shelley was arrested, found guilty of first-degree murder in 1976, and sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="373NE2d951"/&gt; At his trial, Shelley produced a psychiatrist as an expert witness, who testified that Shelley suffered a "[[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative reaction]]" brought on from a "homosexual panic;" an expert witness from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed the dissociative reaction was brought on by homosexual panic, but stated the consumption of alcohol was a contributing factor.&lt;ref name="373NE2d951"/&gt; The first trial was overturned for overaggressive prosecution, but Shelley was again convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in a second trial in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Commonwealth v.

The defense instead asserted that Dunkin invited Williamson and a friend outside to "do some [[Quaalude]]s" and despite a warning from the bartender about Dunkin, Williamson left with Dunkin in Dunkin's car. When Williamson dropped his lighter, he felt a gun, and Dunkin proceeded to drive Williamson at gunpoint to a remote area where he attempted to force Williamson to perform fellatio, which Williamson resisted. During the course of the ensuing struggle, Williamson located another gun in the vehicle and shot Dunkin with it. Williamson was convicted of two counts of tampering with physical evidence and manslaughter and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for each count of tampering and fifteen years for manslaughter.&lt;ref name="692P2d965"/&gt; However, an appeals court ruled that hearsay testimony from Williamson's co-defendant was improperly admitted and evidence of Dunkin's sexually aggressive behavior had been suppressed; on appeal, the conviction for manslaughter was set aside and a second trial was granted.&lt;ref name="692P2d965"/&gt;

According to Lang's testimony, Anderson said something about being afraid of catching venereal disease and having had sex with two men before, and as Lang was looking through a set of binoculars, Anderson grabbed Lang by the leg and attempted to kiss him. When Lang pushed him away angrily, Anderson turned his back on Lang and swung his rifle down from his shoulder; Lang was fearful that Anderson was loading the rifle, so he shot Anderson with a handgun he owned and was carrying.&lt;ref name="782P2d627"/&gt; During rebuttal, the prosecution presented testimony from Lang's former roommate, a known homosexual who had propositioned Lang without a violent reaction. Lang was convicted of first-degree murder and robbery with the special circumstance where the murder was committed in perpetration of the robbery, and he was sentenced to death. The Supreme Court of California, in upholding the verdict, found that remarks attributed to Anderson by Lang about venereal disease were characteristic of a certain subgroup of homosexuals who had very few sexual contacts with men and a morbid fear of venereal disease. Because this subgroup was not widely known, it was likely that Lang himself was part of that subgroup.&lt;ref name="782P2d627"/&gt;

* In the 1998 murder of university student [[Matthew Shepard]], the defendants claimed in court that the young man's homosexual proposition enraged them to the point of murder. However, Judge Barton Voigt barred this strategy, saying that it was "in effect, either a temporary insanity defense or a diminished capacity defense, such as irresistible impulse, which are not allowed in [[Wyoming]], because they do not fit within the statutory insanity defense construct." After their conviction, Shepard's attackers recanted their story in a ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' interview with [[Elizabeth Vargas]], saying that the murder was a robbery attempt gone awry under the influence of drugs. This claim was denied by the defendants' girlfriends.

He also wrote the lyrics to a number of popular songs. He became a United States citizen in 1939.&lt;ref name="TCE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.ancestrylibrary.com/1629/30849_120539-03329/8442324?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestrylibrary.com%2f%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fgss%3dangs-c%26new%3d1%26rank%3d1%26msT%3d1%26gsfn%3dEugene%2b%26gsfn_x%3d0%26gsln%3dLockhart%26gsln_x%3d0%26msbdy%3d1891%26MSAV%3d0%26uidh%3d57k%26pcat%3dIMG_CITIZENSHIP%26h%3d8442324%26recoff%3d5%2b6%26db%3dUSnatindex_awap%26indiv%3d1%26ml_rpos%3d1&amp;ssrc=&amp;backlabel=ReturnRecord Naturalization info re Gene Lockhart], ancestry.com; accessed October 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[London, Ontario]], the son of John Coats Lockhart and Ellen Mary (née Delaney) Lockhart, he made his professional debut at the age of six when he appeared with the Kilties Band of Canada. He later appeared in sketches with [[Beatrice Lillie]].&lt;ref name=osb&gt;{{cite news|title=Heart Seizure Is Fatal To Gene Lockhart|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&amp;dat=19570401&amp;id=8wUkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xAQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5279,106073|accessdate=30 November 2015|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=April 1, 1957|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockhart was educated in various Canadian schools and at the [[London Oratory School]] in [[London]], England. He also played football for the [[Toronto Argonauts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Nick|title=June Lockhart remembers "A Christmas Carol" as a family affair|url=http://www.thelondoner.ca/2014/12/15/june-lockhart-remembers-a-christmas-carol-as-a-family-affair|accessdate=19 May 2017|work=The Londoner|date=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stage==
Lockhart had a long stage career; he also wrote professionally and taught acting and stage technique at the [[Juilliard School of Music]] in [[New York City]]. He had also written theatrical sketches, radio shows, special stage material, song lyrics and articles for stage and radio magazines.

He made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut in 1916, in the musical '' The Riviera Girl''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eugene Lockhart|url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Person/Detail/6286/Eugene-Lockhart|website=Playbill Vault|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the traveling play ''The Pierrot Players'' (for which he wrote the book and lyrics). This play introduced the song, ''[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]'', for which Lockhart wrote the lyrics along with Canadian composer [[Ernest Seitz]].  (The song was subsequently made popular by [[Les Paul and Mary Ford]] in the 1950s.) He wrote and directed the Broadway musical revue ''Bunk of 1926''. He sang in ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' for the [[San Francisco Opera]] Association. On Broadway, Lockhart originated the role of Uncle Sid in [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s only comedy, ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' (1933), and took over from [[Lee J. Cobb]] as [[Willy Loman]], during the original run of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949).

==Film work==
However, Lockhart is mostly remembered for his film work. He made his film debut in the 1922 version of ''[[Smilin' Through (1922 film)|Smilin' Through]]'', as the Rector, but did not make his sound debut until 1934 in the film ''By Your Leave'', where he played the playboy Skeets. Lockhart subsequently appeared in more than 300 motion pictures. He often played villains, including a role as the treacherous informant Regis in ''[[Algiers (film)|Algiers]]'', the American remake of ''[[Pepe le Moko]]'', which gained him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]. He also played the suspicious Georges de la Trémouille, the Dauphin's chief counselor, in the famous 1948 film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'', starring [[Ingrid Bergman]]. He had a great succession of "good guy" supporting roles including [[Bob Cratchit]] in ''[[A Christmas Carol (1938 film)|A Christmas Carol]]'' (1938) and the judge in ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]'' (1947).

Upon the arrival of [[Orson Welles]] in Hollywood in 1940, Lockhart became well known as the author of a short poem satirizing Welles entitled "Little Orson Annie":

{{poemquote|
Little Orson Annie's come to our house to play
An' josh the motion pitchurs up an' skeer the stars away
An' shoo the [[Charles Laughton|Laughtons]] off the lot an' build the sets an' sweep
An' wind the film an' write the talk an' earn her board and keep;
An' all of us other actors, when our pitchur work is done,
We sit around the [[Brown Derby]] bar an' has the mostest fun,
A-listenin' to the me-tales 'at Annie tells about,
An' the Gobblewelles'll git YOU
Ef you DON'T WATCH OUT!
}}

The poem is a parody of the 1885 poem "[[Little Orphant Annie]]" by [[James Whitcomb Riley]].

==Other==
Lockhart is remembered as the Starkeeper in ''[[Carousel (1956 film)|Carousel]]'' (1956). Playing a bumbling sheriff, he appeared in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940) opposite [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]].  He also appeared in the movie ''[[The Sea Wolf (1941 film)|The Sea Wolf]]'' (1941), adapted from the novel by [[Jack London]], as a ship's doctor. His last film role was that of the Equity Board President in the film ''[[Jeanne Eagels (film)|Jeanne Eagels]]'' (1957).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Recognition==
Lockhart has two stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]—one for motion pictures, at 6307 [[Hollywood Boulevard]], and one for television at 6681 Hollywood Boulevard. Both were dedicated February 8, 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gene Lockhart|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/gene-lockhart|website=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Lockhart was married to [[Kathleen Lockhart]] from 12 June 1924 until his death. They had one child together, [[June Lockhart]], through whom he is the grandfather of [[Anne Lockhart (actress)|Anne Lockhart]].

==Death==
Lockhart died April 1, 1957, from a [[coronary thrombosis]] at the age of 65 in St. John's Hospital, [[Santa Monica, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gene Lockhart|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&amp;dat=19570401&amp;id=h5gtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9JgFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3048,212927|accessdate=1 December 2015|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=April 1, 1957|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried next to his wife in  [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7304">A '''growing self-organizing map (GSOM)''' is a growing variant of a [[self-organizing map]] (SOM). The GSOM was developed to address the issue of identifying a suitable map size in the [[Self Organizing Map|SOM]]. It starts with a minimal number of nodes (usually 4) and grows new nodes on the boundary based on a heuristic. By using the value called Spread Factor (SF), the data analyst has the ability to control the growth of the GSOM.

All the starting nodes of the GSOM are boundary nodes, i.e. each node has the freedom to grow in its own direction at the beginning. (Fig. 1) New Nodes are grown from the boundary nodes. Once a node is selected for growing all its free neighboring positions will be grown new nodes. The figure shows the three possible node growth options for a rectangular GSOM.

[[Image:GSOM-new-node-growth.gif|thumb|Node growth options in GSOM: (a) one new node, (b) two new nodes and (c) three new nodes.]]

==The algorithm==
The GSOM process is as follows:
#Initialization phase:
##Initialize the weight vectors of the starting nodes (usually four) with random numbers between 0 and 1.
##Calculate the growth threshold (&lt;math&gt;GT&lt;/math&gt;) for the given data set of dimension &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; according to the spread factor (&lt;math&gt;SF&lt;/math&gt;) using the formula &lt;math&gt;GT = - D \times \ln ( SF )&lt;/math&gt;
#Growing Phase:
##Present input to the network.
##Determine the weight vector that is closest to the input vector mapped to the current feature map (winner), using Euclidean distance (similar to the [[Self Organizing Map|SOM]]). This step can be summarized as: find &lt;math&gt;q'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\left | v - w_{q'} \right \vert \le \left | v - w_q \right \vert \forall q \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are the input and weight vectors respectively, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector for nodes and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of natural numbers.
##The weight vector adaptation is applied only to the neighborhood of the winner and the winner itself. The neighborhood is a set of neurons around the winner, but in the GSOM the starting neighborhood selected for weight adaptation is smaller compared to the SOM (localized weight adaptation). The amount of adaptation (learning rate) is also reduced exponentially over the iterations. Even within the neighborhood, weights that are closer to the winner are adapted more than those further away. The weight adaptation can be described by &lt;math&gt;w_j ( k + 1 ) = \begin{cases} w_j ( k ) &amp; \text{if }j \notin \Nu_{k+1} \\ w_j ( k ) + LR ( k ) \times (x_k - w_j ( k ) ) &amp; \text{if }j \in \Nu_{k+1} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt; where the Learning Rate &lt;math&gt;LR ( k )&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of positive parameters converging to zero as &lt;math&gt;k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;w_j ( k )&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w_j ( k + 1 )&lt;/math&gt; are the weight vectors of the node &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; before and after the adaptation and &lt;math&gt;\Nu_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the neighbourhood of the winning neuron at the &lt;math&gt;( k + 1 )&lt;/math&gt;th iteration. The decreasing value of &lt;math&gt;LR ( k )&lt;/math&gt; in the GSOM depends on the number of nodes existing in the map at time &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;.
##Increase the error value of the winner (error value is the difference between the input vector and the weight vectors).
##When &lt;math&gt;TE_i &gt; GT&lt;/math&gt;(where &lt;math&gt;TE_i&lt;/math&gt;  is the total error of node &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;GT&lt;/math&gt; is the growth threshold). Grow nodes if i is a boundary node. Distribute weights to neighbors if &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is a non-boundary node.
##Initialize the new node weight vectors to match the neighboring node weights.
##Initialize the learning rate (&lt;math&gt;LR&lt;/math&gt;) to its starting value.
##Repeat steps 2 – 7 until all inputs have been presented and node growth is reduced to a minimum level.
#Smoothing phase.
##Reduce learning rate and fix a small starting neighborhood.
##Find winner and adapt the weights of the winner and neighbors in the same way as in growing phase.

The [[Fraction of variance unexplained]] is: a) 4.68% (SOM, 50 nodes); b) 1.69% (SOM, 100 nodes); c) 4.20% (GSOM, 50 nodes); d) 2.32% (GSOM, 100 nodes). The initial approximation for SOM was equidistribution of nodes in a segment on the first principal component with the same variance as for the data set. The initial approximation for GSOM was the mean point.&lt;ref&gt;The illustration is prepared using free software: E.M. Mirkes, [http://www.math.le.ac.uk/people/ag153/homepage/PCA_SOM/PCA_SOM.html Principal Component Analysis and Self-Organizing Maps: applet]. University of Leicester, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

== Applications ==

The GSOM can be used for many preprocessing tasks in [[Data mining]], for [[Nonlinear dimensionality reduction]], for approximation of principal curves and manifolds, for [[cluster analysis|clustering]] and [[classification in machine learning|classification]]. It gives often the better representation of the data geometry than the SOM (see the classical benchmark for principal curves on the left).

[[File:Gunnel_Gummeson.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Gunnel Gummeson. An undated photograph.]]
'''Gunnel Gummeson''' (born 1930, [[declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']] 8 February 1977), was a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[school teacher]], last seen travelling in Northern Afghanistan with her [[United States|American]] fiancé Peter Winant in 1956. The extensive investigations were hampered by official corruption and codes of loyalty to clan chiefs. None of the later sightings were confirmed, and the case has never been solved.

== Disappearance ==
Gunnel Gummeson was a teacher from [[Hultsfred]] in [[Småland]] who moved to [[Nora, Sweden|Nora]] in [[Bergslagen]] when she was 2 years old. After having worked as a volunteer social worker in [[India]], she decided to return to Sweden by land travel together with her boyfriend Peter Winant, who had previous experience in travelling in Afghanistan. On 20 May 1956, she posted a letter to her parents in the post office of [[Kabul]], where she informed them about her travelling plans. A couple of days later, the couple was seen disembarking a truck in the city of [[Shibarghan]] in the Northern provinces. According to witness statements, they followed one of their fellow passengers, who rented out rooms. The last confirmed information was when they were seen entering a doorway in the city.&lt;ref name="Mortimer1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Mortimer|title=Women confidential|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2toPAQAAMAAJ|year=1960|publisher=J. Messner|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First investigation ==
The father of Peter Winant, Frederick Winant, made investigations which indicated that they had been seen continuing on their way to [[Herat]]. He complained to the government, which instigated an investigation. Three governors were fired, 10,000 riders were sent out and so many people were arrested that the jails became overcrowded, according to the reports of the Swedish embassy advisor [[Lennart Petri]]. None of the information after they left Shibarghan was confirmed, however, and reports that they had been seen in [[Qaisar]] were disregarded by Afghan authorities. In 1961, the investigations was finally finished and the foreign minister of Afghanistan gave a formal statement concluding that both were likely to have been murdered in Shibarghan.&lt;ref name= Gunnel&gt;[http://forsvunnapersoner.blogspot.com/2014/05/gunnel-gummeson.html Gunnel Gummeson at Forsvunnapersoner blogspot.com] (In Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second investigation ==
In May 1963, the cabinet secretary of the Swedish foreign office, [[Leif Belfrage]], received a confidential, personal letter from the USA ambassador, [[J. Graham Parsons]], with the information that Gunnel Gummeson was likely being kept in captivity as the daughter-in-law of a wealthy clan chief in Qaisar, Kala Khan; she was also to have given birth to a son. The source of this information was a [[Pashtun people|pashtun]], a secret Christian convert, who had acquired the information during his military service and passed it on to an American priest. According to the pashtun, who was referred to in the diplomatic correspondence as “Joe”, it was common knowledge in [[Maimana]] that Winant had been killed and that Gummeson had been sold to the khan. The public was loyal to the khan, and the province governor had been [[bribe]]d. Asked by the American priest, “Joe” travelled to Maimana territory dressed as a toy merchant, entered the summer camp of Kala Khan and there met a blond boy with European features. His attempts to contact the mother failed and he was forced to flee.&lt;ref name= Gunnel/&gt;

The Swedish foreign office and ambassador [[Dick Hichens-Bergström]] took the information seriously and discussed a rescue operation by [[helicopter]]. In June, King [[Zahir Shah]] sent a team of 175 elite soldiers dressed as road workers to search through every village and nomad camp for Gummeson. The only blonde western woman they found, however, was a Russian who assured them that she was voluntarily and happily married.&lt;ref name= Gunnel/&gt;

The Gummeson case attracted a lot of attention and media coverage and was also mentioned in contemporary travel guides. The newspaper ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' sent crime reporter [[Börje Heed]] to Afghanistan to track Gummeson. The last report about the case was an article in ''Aftonbladet'' from 1967, in which two tourists, who had read about the case, reported that they had seen an unusually blond boy in north west Afghanistan.&lt;ref name= Gunnel/&gt;

The fate of Gunnel Gummeson and Peter Winant remains unknown. On 8 February 1977, Gummeson was officially declared [[presumed dead]] by the court of [[Lindesberg]].&lt;ref name= Gunnel/&gt;&lt;ref name= Sarasota &gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=A7-hzOuI2KQC&amp;dat=19561130&amp;printsec=frontpage|title=Search For Pair In Afghanistan Fails|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=November 30, 1956|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
The Gunnel Gummeson case was the inspiration of a novel by [[Gert Holmertz]]: ''Muren i Maimana'' (Maimana Wall) SAK förlag/Premiss förlag (2004)

A '''gunshot wound''' ('''GSW'''), also known as '''ballistic trauma''', is a form of [[physical trauma]] sustained from the discharge of [[weapon|arms]] or [[Ammunition|munitions]].&lt;ref name="mahoney_1"&gt;Mahoney, P. F., et al. (2004). ''Section 1 : Introduction, Background and Science'' p4&lt;/ref&gt; The most common forms of ballistic trauma stem from [[firearm]]s used in armed conflicts, civilian sporting, recreational pursuits and criminal activity.&lt;ref name="mahoney_2"&gt;Mahoney, P. F., et al. (2004). ''The International Small Arms Situation'' p6&lt;/ref&gt; Damage is dependent on the firearm, bullet, velocity, entry point, and trajectory. Management can range from observation and local wound care to urgent surgical intervention.

==Signs and symptoms==
Trauma from a gunshot wound varies widely based on the bullet, velocity, entry point, trajectory, and affected anatomy. Gunshot wounds can be particularly devastating compared to other [[Penetrating trauma|penetrating injuries]] because the trajectory and fragmentation of bullets can be unpredictable after entry. Additionally, gunshot wounds typically involve a large degree of nearby tissue disruption and destruction due to the physical effects of the projectile correlated with the bullet velocity classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamb|first=C. M.|last2=Garner|first2=J. P.|date=April 2014|title=Selective non-operative management of civilian gunshot wounds to the abdomen: a systematic review of the evidence |journal=Injury|volume=45|issue=4|pages=659–666|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2013.07.008|issn=1879-0267|pmid=23895795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate damaging effect of a gunshot wound is typically severe bleeding, and with it the potential for [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]], a condition characterized by inadequate delivery of oxygen to vital organs. In the case of traumatic hypovolemic shock, this failure of adequate oxygen delivery is due to blood loss, as blood is the means of delivering oxygen to the body's constituent parts. Devastating effects can result when a bullet strikes a vital organ such as the heart, lungs or liver, or damages a component of the central nervous system such as the spinal cord or brain.

Common causes of death following gunshot injury include bleeding, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] caused by [[pneumothorax]], catastrophic injury to the heart and larger blood vessels, and damage to the brain or central nervous system. Non-fatal gunshot wounds frequently have severe and long-lasting effects, typically some form of major disfigurement and/or permanent disability.

==Classification==

Gunshot wounds are classified according to the speed of the projectile:
* Low-velocity: &lt; {{cvt|1,100|ft/s|m/s}} 
* Medium-velocity: {{cvt|1,100|ft/s|m/s}} to {{cvt|2,000|ft/s|m/s}}
* High-velocity: &gt; {{cvt|2,000|ft/s|m/s}}
Bullets from [[handgun]]s are generally less than {{cvt|1,000|ft/s|m/s}}, while bullets from [[rifle]]s exceed {{cvt|2,500|ft/s|m/s}}. The US military commonly uses 5.56-mm bullets, which have a relatively low mass as compared with other bullets; however, the speed of these bullets is relatively fast. As a result, they produce a larger amount of kinetic energy, which is transmitted to the tissues of the target.&lt;ref name="jtacs20160601"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1097/TA.0000000000001037| issn = 2163-0755| volume = 80| issue = 6| pages = 853–867 |authorlink1=Peter M.

==Physics==
The degree of tissue disruption caused by a [[projectile]] is related to the [[Penetrating trauma#Cavitation|cavitation]] the projectile creates as it passes through tissue. A bullet with sufficient energy will have a cavitation effect in addition to the penetrating track injury. As the bullet passes through the tissue, initially crushing then lacerating, the space left forms a cavity; this is called the '''[[Penetrating trauma#Permanent cavitation|permanent cavity]]'''. Higher-velocity bullets create a pressure wave that forces the tissues away, creating not only a permanent cavity the size of the caliber of the bullet but also a '''[[Penetrating trauma#Temporary cavitation|temporary cavity]]''' or secondary cavity, which is often many times larger than the bullet itself.&lt;ref name="jtacs20160601" /&gt;  The temporary cavity is the radial stretching of tissue around the bullet’s wound track, which momentarily leaves an empty space caused by high pressures surrounding the projectile that accelerate material away from its path.&lt;ref name=forensic200909/&gt; The extent of cavitation, in turn, is related to the following characteristics of the projectile:
*[[Kinetic energy]]: KE = 1/2''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (where ''m'' is [[mass]] and ''v'' is [[velocity]]). This helps to explain why wounds produced by projectiles of higher mass and/or higher velocity produce greater tissue disruption than projectiles of lower mass and velocity. The velocity of the bullet is a more important determinant of tissue injury. Although both mass and velocity contribute to the overall energy of the projectile, the energy is proportional to the mass while proportional to the ''square'' of its velocity. As a result, for a constant velocity, if the mass is doubled, the energy is doubled; however, if the velocity of the bullet is doubled, the energy increases four times. The initial velocity of a bullet is largely dependent on the firearm. The US military commonly uses 5.56-mm bullets, which have a relatively low mass as compared with other bullets; however, the speed of these bullets is relatively fast. As a result, they produce a larger amount of kinetic energy, which is transmitted to the tissues of the target.&lt;ref name="jtacs20160601" /&gt;&lt;ref name=injury20150701&gt;{{cite journal |title=Firearms, bullets, and wound ballistics: An imaging primer |first1=Tarek N. |last1=Hanna |first2=Waqas |last2=Shuaib |first3=Tatiana |last3=Han |first4=Ajeet |last4=Mehta |first5=Faisal |last5=Khosa |journal=[[Injury (journal)|Injury]] |date=July 1, 2015 |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=1186–1196 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pmid=25724396 |quote=Each bullet has its intrinsic mass, but the initial velocity is largely a function of the firearm. Due to short barrel length, handguns produce a low-velocity projectile that usually deposits all of its kinetic energy within the target, thus creating an entry but no exit wound. Rifles have longer barrel lengths that produce a high velocity, high-energy projectile.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the temporary cavity is approximately proportional to the kinetic energy of the bullet and depends on the resistance of the tissue to stress.&lt;ref name=forensic200909&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology |date=September 2009 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=204–209 |title=Ballistics reviews: mechanisms of bullet wound trauma |first=Nicholas |last=Maiden |pmid=19644779 |quote=...the temporary cavity is the most important factor in wound ballistics of high velocity rifle bullets...the importance of the temporary cavity is recognized by all other contemporary researchers...The temporary cavity also has little or no wounding potential with handgun bullets because the amount of kinetic energy deposited in the tissue is insufficient to cause remote injuries. The size of the temporary cavity is approximately proportional to the kinetic energy of the striking bullet and also the amount of resistance the tissue has to stress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muzzle energy]], which is based on muzzle velocity, is often used for sake of ease of comparison.
*[[Yaw (rotation)|Yaw]] Handgun bullets will generally travel in a relatively straight line or make one turn if a bone is hit. Upon travel through deeper tissue, high-energy rounds may become unstable as they decelerate, and may tumble (pitch and yaw) as the energy of the projectile is absorbed, causing stretching and tearing of the surrounding tissue.&lt;ref name="jtacs20160601" /&gt;
*[[Fragmentation (weaponry)|Fragmentation]] Most commonly, bullets do not fragment, and secondary damage from fragments of shattered bone is a more common complication than bullet fragments.&lt;ref name="jtacs20160601" /&gt;

== Management ==

===Workup===
Initial workup for a gunshot wound is approached in the same way as any acute trauma case. A rapid first pass of the person is conducted using [[advanced trauma life support]] (ATLS) protocol in order to ensure that the most vital functions are intact.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) Student Course Manual (9th Edition)|last=|first=|publisher=American College of Surgeons|year=2012|isbn=1880696029|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* A) [[Respiratory tract|Airway]] - Assess and protect airway and cervical spine
* B) [[Breathing]] - Maintain adequate ventilation and oxygenation
* C) Circulation - Assess for and control bleeding to maintain organ perfusion including [[Focused assessment with sonography for trauma|focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST)]]
* D) Disability - Perform basic neurological exam including [[Glasgow Coma Scale|Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)]]
* E) Exposure - Expose entire body and search for any missed injuries, entry points, and exit points while maintaining body temperature
Depending on the extent of injury, management can range from urgent surgical intervention to observation. As such, any history from the scene such as gun type, shots fired, shot direction and distance, blood loss on scene, and pre-hospital vitals signs can be very helpful in directing management. Unstable people with signs of bleeding that cannot be controlled during the initial evaluation require immediate [[Exploratory surgery|surgical exploration]] in the operating room.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Otherwise, management protocols are generally dictated by anatomic entry point and anticipated trajectory.

=== Neck ===
A gunshot wound to the neck can be particularly dangerous because of the high number of vital anatomical structures contained within a small space. The neck contains the [[larynx]], [[trachea]], [[pharynx]], [[esophagus]], vasculature ([[Common carotid artery|carotid]], [[Subclavian artery|subclavian]], and [[Vertebral artery|vertebral arteries]]; [[Jugular vein|jugular]], [[Brachiocephalic vein|brachiocephalic]], and [[vertebral vein]]s; thyroid vessels), and nervous system anatomy ([[spinal cord]], [[cranial nerves]], peripheral nerves, [[Sympathetic trunk|sympathetic chain]], [[brachial plexus]]). Gunshots to the neck can thus cause severe bleeding, airway compromise, and nervous system injury.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tisherman|first=Samuel A.|last2=Bokhari|first2=Faran|last3=Collier|first3=Bryan|last4=Cumming|first4=John|last5=Ebert|first5=James|last6=Holevar|first6=Michele|last7=Kurek|first7=Stanley|last8=Leon|first8=Stuart|last9=Rhee|first9=Peter|date=2008-05-01|title=Clinical Practice Guideline: Penetrating Zone II Neck Trauma|url=https://insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00005373-200805000-00042|journal=The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care|language=ENGLISH|volume=64|issue=5|pages=1392–1405|doi=10.1097/ta.0b013e3181692116|issn=0022-5282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial assessment of a gunshot wound to the neck involves non-probing inspection of whether the injury is a penetrating neck injury (PNI), classified by violation of the [[Platysma muscle|platsyma]] muscle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the platsyma is intact, the wound is considered superficial and only requires local wound care. If the injury is a PNI, surgery should be consulted immediately while the case is being managed. Of note, wounds should not be explored on the field or in the emergency department given the risk of exacerbating the wound.
[[File:PNI Protocol.jpg|thumb|Penetrating Neck Injury Protocol. Adapted from {{PMID|23317595}}.]]
Due to the advances in diagnostic imaging, management of PNI has been shifting from a "zone-based" approach, which uses anatomical site of injury to guide decisions, to a "no-zone" approach which uses a symptom-based algorithm.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shiroff|first=Adam M.|last2=Gale|first2=Stephen C.|last3=Martin|first3=Niels D.|last4=Marchalik|first4=Daniel|last5=Petrov|first5=Dmitriy|last6=Ahmed|first6=Hesham M.|last7=Rotondo|first7=Michael F.|last8=Gracias|first8=Vicente H.|date=January 2013|title=Penetrating neck trauma: a review of management strategies and discussion of the 'No Zone' approach |journal=The American Surgeon|volume=79|issue=1|pages=23–29|issn=1555-9823|pmid=23317595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The no-zone approach uses a hard signs and imaging system to guide next steps. Hard signs include airway compromise, unresponsive shock, diminished pulses, uncontrolled bleeding, expanding [[hematoma]], [[bruit]]s/thrill, air bubbling from wound or extensive [[Subcutaneous emphysema|subcutaneous air]], stridor/hoarseness, neurological deficits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If any hard signs are present, immediate surgical exploration and repair is pursued alongside airway and bleeding control. If there are no hard signs, the person receives a [[Computed tomography angiography|multi-detector CT angiography]] for better diagnosis. A directed [[angiography]] or [[endoscopy]] may be warranted in a high-risk trajectory for the gunshot. A positive finding on CT leads to operative exploration. If negative, the person may be observed with local wound care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Chest ===
Important anatomy in the chest includes the [[Thoracic wall|chest wall]], [[Rib cage|ribs]], spine, spinal cord, [[Intercostal nerves|intercostal neurovascular bundles]], [[lung]]s, [[Bronchus|bronchi]], [[heart]], [[aorta]], major vessels, esophagus, [[thoracic duct]], and [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. Gunshots to the chest can thus cause severe bleeding ([[hemothorax]]), respiratory compromise ([[pneumothorax]], hemothorax, [[pulmonary contusion]], tracheobronchial injury), cardiac injury ([[Cardiac tamponade|pericardial tamponade]]), esophageal injury, and nervous system injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853286850|title=Rosen's emergency medicine : concepts and clinical practice|others=Marx, John A.,, Hockberger, Robert S.,, Walls, Ron M.,, Biros, Michelle H.,, Danzl, Daniel F.,, Gausche-Hill, Marianne,|isbn=9781455749874|edition= Eighth |location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=853286850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial workup as outlined in the Workup section is particularly important with gunshot wounds to the chest because of the high risk for direct injury to the lungs, heart, and major vessels. Important notes for the initial workup specific for chest injuries are as follows. In people with pericardial tamponade or tension pneumothorax, the chest should be evacuated or decompressed if possible prior to attempting [[tracheal intubation]] because the positive pressure ventilation can cause [[Hypotension|hypotention]] or cardiovascular collapse.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karmy-Jones|first=Riyad|last2=Namias|first2=Nicholas|last3=Coimbra|first3=Raul|last4=Moore|first4=Ernest E.|last5=Schreiber|first5=Martin|last6=McIntyre|first6=Robert|last7=Croce|first7=Martin|last8=Livingston|first8=David H.|last9=Sperry|first9=Jason L.|date=December 2014|title=Western Trauma Association critical decisions in trauma: penetrating chest trauma |journal=The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery|volume=77|issue=6|pages=994–1002|doi=10.1097/TA.0000000000000426|issn=2163-0763|pmid=25423543}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with signs of a tension pneumothorax (asymmetric breathing, unstable blood flow, respiratory distress) should immediately receive a [[chest tube]] (&gt; French 36) or needle decompression if chest tube placement is delayed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; FAST exam should include extended views into the chest to evaluate for [[hemopericardium]], pneumothorax, hemothorax, and [[peritoneal fluid]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Those with cardiac tamponade, uncontrolled bleeding, or a persistent air leak from a chest tube all require surgery.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meredith|first=J. Wayne|last2=Hoth|first2=J. Jason|date=February 2007|title=Thoracic trauma: when and how to intervene |journal=The Surgical Clinics of North America|volume=87|issue=1|pages=95–118, vii|doi=10.1016/j.suc.2006.09.014|issn=0039-6109|pmid=17127125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cardiac tamponade can be identified on FAST exam.

However, not all gunshot to the chest require surgery. Asymptomatic people with a normal [[Chest radiograph|chest X-ray]] can be observed with a repeat exam and imaging after 6 hours to ensure no delayed development of pneumothorax or hemothorax.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If a person only has a pneumothorax or hemothorax, a chest tube is usually sufficient for management unless there is large volume bleeding or persistent air leak as noted above.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Additional imaging after initial chest X-ray and ultrasound can be useful in guiding next steps for stable people. Common imaging modalities include chest [[CT scan|CT]], formal [[echocardiography]], angiography, [[Esophagogastroduodenoscopy|esophagoscopy]], esophagography, and [[bronchoscopy]] depending on the signs and symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mirvis|first=Stuart E.|date=April 2004|title=Diagnostic imaging of acute thoracic injury |journal=Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR|volume=25|issue=2|pages=156–179 |pmid=15160796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abdomen ===
[[File:Abdominal Gunshot Wound.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Abdominal gunshot wound]]
Important anatomy in the abdomen includes the [[stomach]], [[Small intestine|small bowel]], [[Large intestine|colon]], [[liver]], [[spleen]], [[pancreas]], [[kidney]]s, spine, diaphragm, descending aorta, and other abdominal vessels and nerves. Gunshots to the abdomen can thus cause severe bleeding, release of bowel contents, [[peritonitis]], organ rupture, respiratory compromise, and neurological deficits.

The most important initial evaluation of a gunshot wound to the abdomen is whether there is uncontrolled bleeding, inflammation of the [[peritoneum]], or spillage of bowel contents. If any of these are present, the person should be transferred immediately to the operating room for [[laparotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jansen|first=Jan O.|last2=Inaba|first2=Kenji|last3=Resnick|first3=Shelby|last4=Fraga|first4=Gustavo P.|last5=Starling|first5=Sizenando V.|last6=Rizoli|first6=Sandro B.|last7=Boffard|first7=Kenneth D.|last8=Demetriades|first8=Demetrios|date=May 2013|title=Selective non-operative management of abdominal gunshot wounds: survey of practise |journal=Injury|volume=44|issue=5|pages=639–644|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2012.01.023 |pmid=22341771}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is difficult to evaluate for those indications because the person is unresponsive or incomprehensible, it is up to the surgeon's discretion whether to pursue laparotomy, exploratory [[laparoscopy]], or alternative investigative tools.

Although all people with abdominal gunshot wounds were taken to the operating room in the past, practice has shifted in recent years with the advances in imaging to non-operative approaches in more stable people.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pryor|first=John P.|last2=Reilly|first2=Patrick M.|last3=Dabrowski|first3=G.

[[Diagnostic peritoneal lavage]] (DPL) has become largely obsolete with the advances in MDCT, with use limited to centers without access to CT to guide requirement for urgent transfer for operation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Extremities ===
[[File:Shotgun wound.JPG|thumb|Acute penetrating trauma from a close-range shotgun blast injury to knee. Birdshot pellets are visible in the wound, within the shattered patella. The powder wad from the shotgun shell has been extracted from the wound, and is visible at the upper right of the image.]]
The four main components of extremities are [[bone]]s, [[Blood vessel|vessels]], [[nerve]]s, and [[soft tissue]]s. Gunshot wounds can thus cause severe bleeding, [[Bone fracture|fractures]], nerve deficits, and soft tissue damage. The Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS) is used to classify the severity of injury and evaluates for severity of skeletal and/or soft tissue injury, limb [[ischemia]], shock, and age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansen|first=K.|last2=Daines|first2=M.|last3=Howey|first3=T.|last4=Helfet|first4=D.|last5=Hansen|first5=S.

Vital sign stability and vascular assessment are the most important determinants of management in extremity injuries. As with other traumatic cases, those with uncontrolled bleeding require immediate surgical intervention.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; If surgical intervention is not readily available and direct pressure is insufficient to control bleeding, [[tourniquet]]s or direct clamping of visible vessels may be used temporarily to slow active bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Nicole|last2=Rajani|first2=Ravi R.|last3=Bokhari|first3=Faran|last4=Chiu|first4=William C.|last5=Kerwin|first5=Andrew|last6=Seamon|first6=Mark J.|last7=Skarupa|first7=David|last8=Frykberg|first8=Eric|last9=Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma|date=November 2012|title=Evaluation and management of penetrating lower extremity arterial trauma: an Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice management guideline |journal=The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery|volume=73|issue=5 Suppl 4|pages=S315–320|doi=10.1097/TA.0b013e31827018e4 | pmid=23114487}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with hard signs of vascular injury also require immediate surgical intervention. Hard signs include active bleeding, expanding or pulsatile hematoma, bruit/thrill, absent distal pulses and signs of extremity ischemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facs.org/~/media/files/quality%20programs/trauma/ntdb/ntdb%20annual%20report%202012.ashx|title=National Trauma Data Bank 2012 Annual Report |website=American College of Surgeons 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For stable people without hard signs of vascular injury, an injured extremity index (IEI) should be calculated by comparing the blood pressure in the injured limb compared to an uninjured limb in order to further evaluate for potential vascular injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://westerntrauma.org/algorithms/PeripheralVascularInjuryPart1/NoteE.html|title=WESTERN TRAUMA ASSOCIATION|website=westerntrauma.org|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the IEI or clinical signs are suggestive of vascular injury, the person may undergo surgery or receive further imaging including CT angiography or conventional arteriography.

In addition to vascular management, people must be evaluated for bone, soft tissue, and nerve injury. Plain films can be used for fractures alongside CTs for soft tissue assessment. Fractures must be [[Debridement|debrided]] and stabilized, nerves repaired when possible, and soft tissue debrided and covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facs.org/~/media/files/quality%20programs/trauma/publications/mancompexttrauma.ashx|title=Management of Complex Extremity Trauma|last=|first=|date=|website=American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process can often require multiple procedures over time depending on the severity of injury.

==History==
[[Hieronymus Brunschwig]] argued that infection of gunshot wounds was a result of poisoning by [[gunpowder]], which provided the rationale for [[Cauterization|cauterizing]] wounds. [[Ambroise Paré]] wrote in his 1545 book, ''The Method of Curing Wounds Caused by Arquebus and Firearms,'' that wounds should be sealed rather than cauterized.&lt;ref name=historypmc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pruitt2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pruitt|first1=Basil A.|title=Combat Casualty Care and Surgical Progress|journal=Annals of Surgery|volume=243|issue=6|year=2006|pages=715–729|issn=0003-4932|doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000220038.66466.b5|pmc=1570575|pmid=16772775}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] argued that infection was not caused by poisoning.

Until the 1880s, the standard practice for treating a gunshot wound called for physicians to insert their [[Asepsis|unsterilized]] fingers into the wound to probe and locate the path of the bullet.&lt;ref name="Schaffer"&gt;{{Cite news|ref=Schaffer |first=Amanda |last=Schaffer |title=A president felled by an assassin and 1880’s medical care |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/25/health/25garf.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=[[New York City|New York]], [[New York State|New York]] |date=25 July 2006 |accessdate=29 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgically opening abdominal cavities to repair gunshot wounds,&lt;ref name=crane&gt;{{cite web |last=Crane |first=Michael A. |title=Dr. Goodfellow: gunfighter's surgeon |url=http://www.doc-holliday.com/article.pdf |accessdate=10 March 2013 |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019153647/http://www.doc-holliday.com/article.pdf |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germ theory of disease|germ theory]], and [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]]'s technique for antiseptic surgery using diluted [[carbolic acid]], first demonstrated in 1865, had not yet been accepted as standard practice.

Garfield]] after he was shot, and most probed the wound with their fingers or dirty instruments.&lt;ref name=eyewitness&gt;{{cite web|title=The death of President Garfield, 1881 |url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/gar.htm |accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in [[Assassination of James A.

Today's surgeons consider any projectile with a velocity of 330 m/s to be low or subsonic and practically all modern weapons have bullet speeds that are considerably higher.  By contrast, mid-nineteenth-century handguns such as the Colt revolvers used during the American Civil War had muzzle velocities of just 230-260 m/s and their powder and ball predecessors had velocities of 167 m/s or less.  Many of these weapons were still in circulation in America during the 1860s.  Unlike today's high-velocity bullets, nineteenth-century balls produced almost little or no cavitation (a kinetic shockwave that causes serious tissue damage) and, being slower moving, they were liable to lodge in unusual locations at odds with their trajectory. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennerk, Barry|title=In Danger and Distress - Presentation of Gunshot Cases to Dublin Hospitals during the Height of Fenianism, 1866-1871 in ''Social History of Medicine'', vol. 24, no. 3, Dec. 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|issn=0951-631X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s discovery of [[X-ray]]s in 1895 led to the use of radiographs to locate bullets in wounded soldiers.&lt;ref name="historypmc"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manring MM, Hawk A, Calhoun JH, Andersen RC | title=Treatment of war wounds: a historical review. | journal=Clin Orthop Relat Res | year= 2009 | volume= 467 | issue= 8 | pages= 2168–91 | pmid=19219516 | doi=10.1007/s11999-009-0738-5 | pmc=2706344 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survival rates for gunshot wounds improved among US military personnel during the [[Korean War|Korean]] and [[Vietnam War]]s, due in part to helicopter evacuation, along with improvements in resuscitation and battlefield medicine.&lt;ref name="historypmc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/MedSpt/chpt3.htm|title=Chapter 3 - Medical Support 1965-1970|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar improvements were seen in US trauma practices during the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/iraq-war-10-year-anniversary-survival-rate-of-wounded-soldiers-better-than-previous-wars|title=Iraq War 10 year anniversary: Survival rate of wounded soldiers better than previous wars|first=Lee Bowman, Scripps Howard News|last=Service|date=16 March 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some military trauma care practices are disseminated by citizen soldiers who return to civilian practice.&lt;ref name="historypmc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/military-medical-techniques-saving-lives-at-home|title=Military medical techniques saving lives at home - News stories - GOV.UK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunbabygun.com/role-gun-advancement-medicine/|title=The role of the gun in the advancement of medicine|date=8 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such practice is to transfer major trauma cases to an operating theater as soon as possible, to stop [[internal bleeding]].

==Research==
Research into gunshot wounds is hampered by lack of funding. Federal-funded research into firearm injury, [[epidemiology]], [[Gun violence in the United States|violence]], and prevention is minimal. Pressure from the [[National Rifle Association]], the gun lobby, and some gun owners, expressing concerns regarding increased government controls on freedom and guns, is highly effective in preventing related research.&lt;ref name=jtacs20160601/&gt;

The [[enzyme]] binds as a homodimer; one subunit is depicted in yellow, the other in pink.  The enzyme is shown in surface representation; DNA molecule is shown as a collection of spheres, each colored according to its [[chemical element]].]]

The '''homing endonucleases''' are a collection of [[endonuclease]]s encoded either as freestanding [[gene]]s within [[intron]]s, as fusions with host proteins, or as self-splicing [[intein]]s. They catalyze the hydrolysis of genomic [[DNA]] within the cells that synthesize them, but do so at very few, or even singular, locations. Repair of the hydrolyzed DNA by the host cell frequently results in the gene encoding the homing endonuclease having been copied into the cleavage site, hence the term 'homing' to describe the movement of these genes. Homing endonucleases can thereby transmit their genes [[Horizontal gene transfer|horizontally]] within a host population, increasing their [[allele]] frequency at greater than Mendelian rates.

==Origin and mechanism==
Although the origin and function of homing endonucleases is still being researched, the most established hypothesis considers them as [[selfish DNA|selfish genetic elements]],&lt;ref name="pmid19211047"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Edgell DR | title = Selfish DNA: homing endonucleases find a home | journal = Curr Biol | volume = 19 | issue = 3 |date=February 2009 | pages = R115–R117 | pmid = 19211047 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2008.12.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to [[transposon]]s, because they facilitate the perpetuation of the genetic elements that encode them independent of providing a functional attribute to the host organism.

Homing endonuclease recognition sequences are long enough to occur randomly only with a very low probability (approximately once every {{val|7|e=9|u=[[base pair|bp]]}}),&lt;ref name="pmid8928227"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jasin M | title = Genetic manipulation of genomonth with rare-cutting endonucleases | journal = Trends Genet | issue = 6 | pages = 224–8 |date=Jun 1996 | pmid = 8928227 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(96)10019-6 | volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are normally found in one or very few instances per [[genome]].  Generally, owing to the homing mechanism, the gene encoding the endonuclease (the HEG, "homing endonuclease gene") is located within the recognition sequence which the enzyme cuts, thus interrupting the homing endonuclease recognition sequence and limiting DNA cutting only to sites that do not (yet) carry the HEG.

Prior to transmission, one [[allele]] carries the gene (HEG&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) while the other does not (HEG&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and is therefore susceptible to being cut by the enzyme. Once the enzyme is synthesized, it breaks the chromosome in the HEG&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; allele, initiating a response from the cellular [[DNA repair]] system. The damage is repaired using [[genetic recombination|recombination]], taking the pattern of the opposite, undamaged DNA allele, HEG&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, that contains the gene for the endonuclease. Thus, the gene is copied to the allele that initially did not have it and it is propagated through successive generations.&lt;ref name="pmid15531154"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burt A, Koufopanou V | title = Homing endonuclease genes: the rise and fall and rise again of a selfish element | journal = Curr Opin Genet Dev | issue = 6 | pages = 609–15 |date=December 2004 | pmid = 15531154 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2004.09.010 | volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called "homing".&lt;ref name="pmid15531154" /&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Homing endonucleases are always indicated with a prefix that identifies their genomic origin, followed by a hyphen: "I-" for homing endonucleases encoded within an intron, "PI-" (for "protein insert") for those encoded within an intein.  Some authors have proposed using the prefix "F-" ("freestanding") for viral enzymes and other natural enzymes not encoded by introns nor inteins,&lt;ref name="pmid9254693" /&gt; and "H-" ("hybrid") for enzymes synthesized in a laboratory.&lt;ref name="pmid12419232"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chevalier BS, Kortemme T, Chadsey MS, Baker D, Monnat RJ, Stoddard BL | title = Design, activity, and structure of a highly specific artificial endonuclease | journal = Mol. Cell | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages=895–905 |date=October 2002 | pmid=12419232 | doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(02)00690-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Next, a capital letter is derived from the first letter of the name of the [[genus]] of the natural source organism, and two lower case letters are derived from the name of the [[species]] of that organism.  Finally, a Roman numeral distinguishes different enzymes found in the same organism.

For example, we can mention the enzyme [[PI-TliII]]&lt;ref name="pmid2139027"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hirata R, Ohsumk Y, Nakano A, Kawasaki H, Suzuki K, Anraku Y | title = Molecular structure of a gene, VMA1, encoding the catalytic subunit of H(+)-translocating adenosine triphosphatase from vacuolar membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = J Biol Chem | pmid = 2139027 | volume = 265 | issue = 12 |date=April 1990 | pages = 6726–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2146742"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kane PM, Yamashiro CT, Wolczyk DF, Neff N, Goebl M, Stevens TH | title = Protein splicing converts the yeast TFP1 gene product to the 69-kD subunit of the vacuolar H(+)-adenosine triphosphatase | journal = Science | pmid = 2146742 | volume = 250 | issue = 4981 |date=November 1990 | pages = 651–7 | doi = 10.1126/science.2146742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid1608969"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perler FB, Comb DG, Jack WE, Moran LS, Qiang B, Kucera RB, Benner J, Slatko BE, Nwankwo DO, Hempstead SK, Carlow CK, Jannasch H | title = Intervening sequences in an Archaea DNA polymerase gene | journal = PNAS | pmid = 1608969 | volume = 89 | issue = 12 |date=June 1992 | pages = 5577–81 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.89.12.5577 | pmc=49335}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the second enzyme encoded by an [[intein]] found in the [[archaea]] ''[[Thermococcus litoralis]]'', and [[H-DreI]],&lt;ref name="pmid12419232" /&gt; the first synthetic homing endonuclease, created in a laboratory from the enzymes [[I-DmoI]] and [[I-CreI]],&lt;ref name="pmid9809068"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jurica MS, Monnat RJ, Stoddard BL | title = DNA recognition and cleavage by the LAGLIDADG homing endonuclease I-CreI | journal = Mol.

==Comparison to restriction enzymes==
Homing endonucleases differ from [[Restriction enzyme#Type II|Type II restriction enzymes]] in the several respects:&lt;ref name="pmid9254693"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Belfort M, Roberts RJ| title = Homing endonucleases: keeping the house in order | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 25 | issue = 17 |date=September 1995 | pages = 3379–88 | pmid = 9254693 | doi = 10.1093/nar/25.17.3379 | pmc = 146926}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Whereas Type II restriction enzymes bind short, usually symmetric, [[recognition sequence]]s of 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;[[base pair|bp]], homing endonucleases bind very long and in many cases asymmetric recognition sequences spanning 12 to 40&amp;nbsp;bp.
* Homing endonucleases are generally more tolerant of substitutions in the recognition sequence.

Currently there are six known structural families.  Their conserved [[structural motif]]s are:&lt;ref name="pmid9254693"/&gt;
* '''LAGLIDADG:''' Every polypeptide has 1 or 2 LAGLIDADG motifs. The sequence LAGLIDADG is a conserved sequence of [[amino acid]]s where each letter is a code that identifies a specific residue. This sequence is directly involved in the DNA cutting process. Those enzymes that have only one motif work as homodimers, creating a saddle that interacts with the [[DNA#Grooves|major groove]] of each DNA half-site. The LAGLIDADG motifs contribute amino acid residues to both the protein-protein interface between protein domains or subunits, and to the enzyme's active sites. Enzymes that possess two motifs in a single protein chain act as monomers, creating the saddle in a similar way.  The first structures to be determined of homing endonucleases (of PI-SceI and I-CreI, both reported in 1997) were both from the LAGLIDADG structural family.,&lt;ref name="pmid9187655"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heath, P. | title = The structure of I-Crel, a group I intron-encoded homing endonuclease | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 |date=June 1997 | pages = 468–476 | pmid = 9187655 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1038/nsb0697-468 | last2 = Stephens | first2 = KM | last3 = Monnat Jr | first3 = RJ | last4 = Stoddard | first4 = BL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9160747"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Duan, X. | title = Crystal structure of PI-SceI, a homing endonuclease with protein splicing activity | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 4 |date=May 1997 | pages = 555–564 | pmid = 9160747  | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80237-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, the first structure of a homing endonuclease (I-CreI) bound to its DNA target site was also reported.&lt;ref name="pmid9809068" /&gt;
* '''GIY-YIG:''' These have only one GIY-YIG motif, in the [[N-terminal]] region, that interacts with the DNA in the cutting site. The prototypic enzyme of this family is I-TevI which acts as a monomer.  Separate structural studies have been reported of the DNA-binding and catalytic domains of I-TevI, the former bound to its DNA target and the latter in the absence of DNA.,&lt;ref name="pmid11447104"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Roey | title = Intertwined structure of the DNA-binding domain of intron endonuclease I-TevI with its substrate | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 20 | issue = 14 |date=July 2001 | pages = 3631–3637 | pmid = 11447104 | doi=10.1093/emboj/20.14.3631 | pmc=125541 |first=P. | display-authors = 2 | last2 = Fox | first2 = KM | last3 = Belfort | first3 = M | last4 = Derbyshire | first4 = V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12379841"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Van Roey | title = Catalytic domain structure and hypothesis for function of GIY-YIG intron endonuclease I-TevI | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 11 |date=July 2002 | pages = 806–811 | pmid = 12379841 | doi=10.1038/nsb853 |first=P. | display-authors = 2 | last2 = Kowalski | first2 = Joseph C. | last3 = Belfort | first3 = Marlene | last4 = Derbyshire | first4 = Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''His-Cys box:''' These enzymes possess a region of 30 amino acids that includes 5 conserved residues: two [[histidine]]s and three [[cystein]]s. They [[coordination chemistry|co-ordinate]] the metal cation needed for catalysis. I-PpoI is the best characterized enzyme of this family and acts as a homodimer.  Its structure was reported in 1998.&lt;ref name="pmid9665136"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Flick, K. | title = DNA binding and cleavage by the nuclear intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-PpoI | journal = Nature | volume = 394 | issue = 6688 |date=July 1998 | pages = 96–101 | pmid = 9665136 | doi=10.1038/27952 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Flick | first2 = Karen E. | last3 = Jurica | first3 = Melissa S. | last4 = Monnat | first4 = Raymond J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''H-N-H:''' These have a [[consensus sequence]] of approximately 30 amino acids. It includes two pairs of conserved [[histidine]]s and one [[asparagine]] that create a [[zinc finger]] domain.  I-HmuI is the best characterized enzyme of this family, and acts as a monomer.  Its structure was reported in 2004.&lt;ref name="pmid15313606"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shen, B.W. | title = DNA binding and cleavage by the HNH homing endonuclease I-HmuI | journal = J. Mol.

* '''PD-(D/E)xK:''' These enzymes contain a canonical nuclease catalytic domain typically found in type II restriction endonucleases.  The best characterized enzyme in this family, I-Ssp6803I, acts as a tetramer.  Its structure was reported in 2007.&lt;ref name="pmid17410205"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhao, L. | title = The restriction fold turns to the dark side: a bacterial homing endonuclease with a PD-(D/E)-XK motif | journal = EMBO Journal | volume = 26 | issue = 9 |date=May 2007 | pages = 2432–2442 | pmid =  17410205 | doi=10.1038/sj.emboj.7601672 | pmc=1864971 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Bonocora | first2 = Richard P | last3 = Shub | first3 = David A | last4 = Stoddard | first4 = Barry L}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Vsr-like:''' These enzymes were discovered in the Global Ocean Sampling Metagenomic Database and first described in 2009. The term 'Vsr-like' refers to the presence of a C-terminal nuclease domain that displays recognizable homology to bacterial Very Short Patch Repair (Vsr) endonucleases.&lt;ref name="pmid19264795"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dassa, B. | title = Fractured genes: a novel genomic arrangement involving new split inteins and a new homing endonuclease family | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 8 |date=March 2009 | pages = 2560–2573 | pmid =  19264795 | doi=10.1093/nar/gkp095 | pmc=2677866 | display-authors = 1 | last2 = London | first2 = N. | last3 = Stoddard | first3 = B.

'''Impalefection''' is a method of [[gene delivery]] using [[nanomaterial]]s, such as [[carbon nanofiber]]s, [[carbon nanotube]]s, [[nanowire]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tracking gene expression after DNA delivery using spatially indexed nanofiber arrays | author = [[Tim McKnight|McKnight, T.E.]], A.V. Melechko, D.K. Hensley, D.G.J. Mann, G.D. Griffin, and M.L. Simpson | journal = Nano Letters | date = 2004 | volume = 4| issue = 7 | pages = 1213–1219 | doi=10.1021/nl049504b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Needle-like nanostructures are synthesized perpendicular to the surface of a substrate. Plasmid DNA containing the gene, intended for intracellular delivery, is attached to the nanostructure surface. A chip with arrays of these needles is then pressed against cells or tissue. Cells that are impaled by nanostructures can express the delivered gene(s).

As one of the types of [[transfection]], the term is derived from two words – [[impalement]] and [[infection]].

==Applications==
One of the features of impalefection is spatially resolved [[gene delivery]] that holds potential for such [[tissue engineering]] approaches in [[wound healing]] as [[gene activated matrix]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Bonadio J. | date = 2000 | title =  Local gene delivery for tissue regeneration | journal = J Regener Med | volume = 1| pages = 25–29 | doi=10.1089/152489000414552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though impalefection is an efficient approach ''in vitro'', it has not yet been effectively used ''in vivo'' on live organisms and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nonviral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Physical Methods and Medical Translation|first1=Leaf|last1=Huang|first2=Dexi|last2=Liu|publisher=Academic Press|pages=7|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carrier materials==
Vertically aligned [[carbon nanofiber]] arrays prepared by [[photolithography]] and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition are one of the suitable types of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Transfer of Vertically Aligned Carbon Nanofibers to Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) While Maintaining their Alignment and Impalefection Functionality|first1=Ryan C. |last1=Pearce|first2= Justin G. |last2=Railsback|first3= Bryan D. |last3=Anderson|first4=Mehmet F. |last4=Sarac|first5= Timothy E. |last5=McKnight|first6= Joseph B. |last6=Tracy|first7=Anatoli V.|last7= Melechko|journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=5|issue=3|date=2013|pages=878–882|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/am302501z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon nanowires are another choice of [[nanoneedle]]s that have been utilized for impalefection.

'''Georg Henri Anton "Joris" Ivens''' (18 November 1898 – 28 June 1989) was a [[Dutch documentary film]]maker. Among the notable films he directed or co-directed are ''[[A Tale of the Wind]]'', ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', ''[[Rain (1929 film)|Rain]]'', ''...A Valparaiso'', ''[[Misère au Borinage]]'' (''Borinage''), ''[[17th Parallel: Vietnam in War]]'', ''[[The Seine Meets Paris]]'', ''[[Far from Vietnam]]'', ''Pour le Mistral'' and ''[[How Yukong Moved the Mountains]]''.

==Early life and career==
Born Georg Henri Anton Ivens&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;{{cite news |title=Joris Ivens, 90, Dutch Documentary Film Maker |first=Peter |last=Flint |newspaper=New York Times |date= 30 June 1989|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/30/obituaries/joris-ivens-90-dutch-documentary-film-maker.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; into a wealthy family, Ivens went to work in one of his father's photo supply shops and from there developed an interest in film. Under the direction of his father, he completed his first film at 13; in college he studied economics with the goal of continuing his father's business, but an interest in class issues distracted him from that path. He met photographer [[Germaine Krull]] in Berlin in 1923, and entered into a [[marriage of convenience]] with her between 1927 and 1943 so that Krull could hold a Dutch passport and could have a "veneer of married respectability without sacrificing her autonomy."&lt;ref&gt;Sichel, Kim. ''Germaine Krull: Photographer of Modernity''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1999. Pages 41 and 70.  {{ISBN|0-262-19401-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally his work focused on technique, especially in ''[[Rain (1929 film)|Rain]]'' (''Regen'', 1929), a 10-minute short filmed over 2 years, and in ''[[De brug|The Bridge]]''  (''De Brug'', 1928).  Around this time, along with [[Menno ter Braak]] and others, he was involved in the creation of the Dutch Film League ([[:nl:De Nederlandsche Filmliga|''De Nederlandsche Filmliga'']]) based in Amsterdam.  The League drew foreign filmmakers to the Netherlands such as [[Alberto Cavalcanti]], [[René Clair]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]], and [[Dziga Vertov]], who also became his friends.

In 1929, Ivens went to the Soviet Union and was invited to direct a film on a topic of his own choosing which was the new industrial city of [[Magnitogorsk]].  Before commencing work, he returned to the Netherlands to make ''Industrial Symphony'' for Philips Electric which is considered to be a film of great technical beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Barnouw. Documentary. New York: Oxford University Press, 2nd revised edition, 1993. pp.: 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the Soviet Union to make the film about Magnitogorsk, ''Song of Heroes '' in 1931 with music composed by [[Hanns Eisler]]. This was the first film on which Ivens and Eisler worked together. It was a propaganda film about this new industrial city where masses of forced laborers and communist youth worked for Stalin´s Five Year Plan.
With [[Henri Storck]], Ivens made ''[[Misère au Borinage]]'' (''Borinage'', 1933), a documentary on life in a coal mining region. In 1943, he also directed two Allied propaganda films for the [[National Film Board of Canada]], including ''Action Stations'', about the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]'s escorting of convoys in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].[http://www.nfb.ca/collection/films/resultat.php?type=fonction&amp;idFcr=7845&amp;idFct=01&amp;nom=Joris+Ivens&amp;nomfunc=Director]

==U.S. and World War II-era career==

From 1936 to 1945, Ivens was based in the United States.  For [[Pare Lorentz]]'s [[U.S. Film Service]], in the year 1940, he made a documentary film on [[rural electrification]] called ''Power and the Land''. It focused on a family, the Parkinsons, who ran a business providing milk for their community. The film showed the problem in the lack of electricity and the way the problem was fixed. Ivens was, however, known for his anti-[[fascism|fascist]] and other [[propaganda film]]s, including ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'', for the Spanish [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]], co-written with [[Ernest Hemingway]] and music by [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Virgil Thomson]].  [[Jean Renoir]] did the French narration for the film and Hemingway did the English version only after [[Orson Welles]]'s sounded too theatrical.. This film was financed by [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Fredric March]], [[Florence Eldridge]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Luise Rainer]], [[Dudley Nichols]], [[Franchot Tone]] and other Hollywood movie stars, moguls, and writers who composed a group known as the [[Contemporary Historians]].  '' Spanish Earth '' was shown at the [[White House]] on July 8, 1937 after Ivens, Hemingway, [[Martha Gellhorn]], had had dinner with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and [[Harry Hopkins]]. The Roosevelts loved the film but said that it needed more propaganda.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} This 1937 documentary was considered his masterpiece.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

In 1938 he traveled to China. ''[[The 400 Million]]'' (1939) depicted the history of modern China and the Chinese resistance during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], including dramatic shots of the [[Battle of Taierzhuang]]. [[Robert Capa]] did camerawork, [[Sidney Lumet]] worked on the film as a reader, [[Hanns Eisler]] wrote the musical score, and [[Fredric March]] provided the narration. It, too, had been financed by the same people as those of  ''Spanish Earth''.  Its chief fundraiser was [[Luise Rainer]], recipient of the best actress [[Academy Award|Oscar]] two years in a row; and the entire group called themselves this time, ''History Today, Inc ''. The [[Guomindang]] government censored the film, fearing that it would give too much credit to left-wing forces.&lt;ref&gt;European Foundation Joris Ivens. [http://www.ivens.nl/film39.htm Joris Ivens Filmography. ''The 400 Million''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220021535/http://www.ivens.nl/film39.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivens was also suspected of being a friend of [[Mao Zedong]] and especially [[Zhou Enlai]].&lt;ref&gt;Martha Gellhorn. ''A Memoir: Travels with Myself and Another''. New York: Penguin Putnam, Inc, 1978. p.:52&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1943, [[Frank Capra]] hired Ivens to supervise the production of ''Know Your Enemy: Japan '' for his U.S. War Department film series ''[[Why We Fight]]''. The film's commentary was written largely by [[Carl Foreman]].  Capra fired Ivens from the project because he felt that his approach was too sympathetic toward the Japanese.  The film's release was held up because there were concerns that [[Emperor Hirohito]] was being depicted as a war criminal, and there was a policy shift to portray the Emperor more favorably after the war as a means of maintaining order in post-war Japan.

With the emerging "Red Scare" of the late 1940s, Ivens was forced to leave the country in the early months of the Truman administration.  Ivens' leftist politics also put the kibosh on his first feature film project which was to have starred [[Greta Garbo]].  In fact, [[Walter Wanger]], the film's producer, was adamant about "running him {Ivens} out of town {Hollywood}."

== Return to Europe ==

In 1946, commissioned to make a Dutch film about Indonesian 'independence', Ivens resigned in protest over what he considered ongoing [[imperialism]]; the Dutch were in his view resisting decolonization. Instead, Ivens filmed ''[[Indonesia Calling]]'' in secret. For around a decade Ivens lived in Eastern Europe, working for several studios there. His position concerning Indonesia and his taking sides for the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the [[Cold War]] annoyed the Dutch government. Over a period of many years, he was obliged to renew his passport every three or four months. According to later mythology however, he lost his passport for ten years, which is not true, as demonstrated by the fact that he was able to travel to New York City to sit by the bedside of his old friend [[Paul Robeson]] when he was ill.

From 1965 to 1970 he filmed two propaganda films about North Vietnam during the war: he made ''[[17e parallèle: La guerre du peuple]]'' ''(17th Parallel: Vietnam in War)'' and he participated in the collective work ''[[Loin du Vietnam]]'' (''Far from Vietnam''). He was awarded the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] for the year 1967.

From 1971 to 1977, he shot ''[[How Yukong Moved the Mountains]]'', a 763-minute propaganda documentary about the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China. He was given unprecedented access because of his pro-communist views and his old personal friendships with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Mao Zedong]].

In 1988 Ivens received the [[Golden Lion|Golden Lion Honorary Award]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://ivens.nl/en/biographie|website=Joris Ivens Archive|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then received the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]] in January 1989, and died on 28 June that year.  Shortly before his death he released the last of more than 40 films ''[[Une histoire de vent]]'' (''A Tale of the Wind'').  A statue of Ivens by sculptor [[Bryan McCormack]] was erected in the [[Parc de Saint-Cloud]] in Paris in 2010.

'''{{Lang|de|Kindertotenlieder}}''' (''Songs on the Death of Children'') is a [[song cycle]] (1904) for voice and orchestra by [[Gustav Mahler]]. The words of the songs are poems by [[Friedrich Rückert]].

==Text and music==

[[File:Friedrich Rückert.jpg|thumb| [[Friedrich Rückert]], as portrayed by Bertha Froriep in 1864]]
The original {{Lang|de|Kindertotenlieder}} were a group of 428 poems written by Rückert in 1833–34&lt;ref name=P174&gt;Painter (2002, 174)&lt;/ref&gt; in an outpouring of grief following the illness ([[scarlet fever]]) and death of two of his children. Karen Painter describes the poems thus: "Rückert's 428 poems on the death of children became singular, almost manic documents of the psychological endeavor to cope with such loss. In ever new variations Rückert's poems attempt a poetic resuscitation of the children that is punctuated by anguished outbursts. But above all the poems show a quiet acquiescence to fate and to a peaceful world of solace."&lt;ref name=P174 /&gt; These poems were not intended for publication,&lt;ref name=P174 /&gt; and they appeared in print only in 1871, five years after the poet's death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512096/Friedrich-Ruckert&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahler selected five of Rückert's poems to set as [[Lied]]er, which he composed between 1901 and 1904. The songs are written in Mahler's [[Romantic music#Late Romantic Era (1850–1900)|late-romantic]] idiom, and like the texts reflect a mixture of feelings: anguish, fantasy resuscitation of the children, resignation. The final song ends in a major key and a mood of transcendence.

The cello melody in the postlude to "{{Lang|de|In diesem Wetter, in diesem Braus}}" ([[Bar (music)|mm.]] 129–133) alludes to the first subject of the finale of Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 3]] (1895/96), a movement titled "What love tells me" ("{{Lang|de|Was mir die Liebe erzählt}}"). "Musically, then, this is the last word of the {{Lang|de|Kindertotenlieder}}: that death is powerful, yet love is even stronger."&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, "{{Lang|de|Trost für die Untröstlichen. Mahlers Kindertotenlieder und Bergs Violinkonzert}}", in: ''Musikfreunde'' 25 (2012/13), no. 5, pp. 34–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and premiere==
Hefling indicates that Mahler composed the first, third, and fourth songs in 1901 (he played them for his friend [[Natalie Bauer-Lechner]] on 10 August). There followed a long break, and the remaining songs were composed in the summer of 1904.

The work was premiered in Vienna on 29 January 1905. [[Friedrich Weidemann]], a leading baritone at the [[Vienna Court Opera]], was the soloist, and the composer conducted. The hall was selected as a relatively small one, compatible with the intimacy of the lied genre, and the orchestra was a chamber orchestra consisting of players drawn from the [[Vienna Philharmonic]].&lt;ref name="Tunbridge 2010:77"&gt;Tunbridge (2010:77)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scoring and performance ==
The work is scored for a vocal soloist (the notes lie comfortably for a [[baritone]] or [[mezzo-soprano]]) and an orchestra consisting of [[piccolo]], 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]], 2 [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]] (English horn), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horn]]s, [[timpani]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tam-tam]], [[celesta]], [[harp]], and [[string section|strings]]. There are no trumpets. Deployed at chamber-orchestra scale, this instrumentation permitted Mahler to explore a wide variety of timbres within a smaller-scale sound; Tunbridge sees this as a new precedent adopted by later composers; for instance [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] in ''[[Pierrot Lunaire]]''.&lt;ref name="Tunbridge 2010:77"/&gt;

Concerning the performance of the work, the composer wrote "these five songs are intended as one inseparate unit, and in performing them their continuity should not be interfered with".&lt;ref&gt;This instruction is reproduced on page 3 of the piano score (IMC, New York, c.1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work takes about 25 minutes to perform.

==The ''Kindertotenlieder'' and Mahler's life history==
At the time he wrote the work Mahler was no stranger to the deaths of children. Hefling writes, "Such tragedy was familiar to Mahler, eight of his siblings died during their childhood. Among all of them, the death of his closest younger brother Ernst in 1874 had affected him most deeply, and he confided to [his friend] Natalie [Bauer-Lechner] that "such frightful sorrow he had never again experienced, as great a loss he had nevermore borne."&lt;ref&gt;Hefling (2009:218)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, when Mahler resumed the composition of the interrupted work (see above), it was only two weeks after the birth of his own second child, upsetting his wife [[Alma Mahler|Alma]], who "found it incomprehensible and feared Mahler was tempting Providence."&lt;ref&gt;Hefling (2009:318-319) Hefling also discusses the possibility that the timing of Mahler's resumption of work was not accidental: "Birth and death had been closely paired for Mahler since his infancy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Alma's fears proved all too prescient, as four years after the work had been completed the Mahlers' daughter Maria, aged four, died of scarlet fever. Mahler wrote to [[Guido Adler]]: "I placed myself in the situation that a child of mine had died. When I really lost my daughter, I could not have written these songs any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Haunting Melody: Psychoanalytic Experiences in Life and Music|last=Reik|first=Theodor|authorlink=Theodor Reik|year=1953|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Young|location=New York|isbn=978-0-306-76138-6|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Wenn dein Mütterlein'''" ([[C minor]])
:Wenn dein Mütterlein

:ihr entgegen sehe,
:fällt auf ihr Gesicht
:erst der Blick mir nicht,
:sondern auf die Stelle,

:Wenn du freudenhelle

"'''Oft denk' ich, sie sind nur ausgegangen'''" ([[E-flat major]])

"'''Now the sun wants to rise as brightly'''"
:Now the sun wants to rise as brightly
:as if nothing terrible had happened during the night.
:The misfortune had happened only to me,
:but the sun shines equally on everyone.

:You must not enfold the night in you.
:You must sink it in eternal light.
:A little star went out in my tent!
:Greetings to the joyful light of the world.

"'''Now I see well, why with such dark flames'''"
:Now I see well, why with such dark flames
:in many glances you flash upon me
:O Eyes: as if in one look
:to draw all your strength together.

:I didn't realise, because a mist surrounded me
:woven of tangled destinies
:that your beam was already returning homewards to the place
:from which all rays emanate.

:You would tell me with your brightness:
:We would gladly stay with you!
:Now that is denied to us by Fate.

:Look at us, soon we will be far away!
:What are only eyes to you in these days,
:in the coming night shall be your stars.

"'''When your mama'''"
:When your mama
:steps in through the door
:and I turn my head
:to see at her,
:on her face
:my gaze does not first fall,
:but at the place
:nearer the doorstep,
:there, where your
:dear little face would be,
:when you with bright joy
:step inside,
:as you used to, my little daughter.

:When your mama
:steps in through the door
:with the glowing candle,
:it seems to me, as if you always
:came in with her too,
:hurrying behind her,
:as you used to come into the room.
:Oh you, of a father's cell,
:ah, too soon
:extinguished joyful light!

"'''I often think: they have only just gone out'''"
:I often think: they have only just gone out,
:and now they will be coming back home.
:The day is fine, don't be dismayed,
:They have just gone for a long walk.

:Yes indeed, they have just gone out,
:and now they are making their way home.
:Don't be dismayed, the day is fine,
:they have simply made a journey to yonder heights.

:They have just gone out ahead of us,
:and will not be thinking of coming home.
:We go to meet them on yonder heights
:In the sunlight, the day is fine
:On yonder heights.

"'''In this weather'''"
:In this weather, in this windy storm,
:I would never have sent the children out.
:They have been carried off,
:I wasn't able to warn them!

:In this weather, in this gale,
:I would never have let the children out.
:I feared they sickened:
:those thoughts are now in vain.

:In this weather, in this storm,
:I would never have let the children out,
:I was anxious they might die the next day:
:now anxiety is pointless.

:In this weather, in this windy storm,
:I would never have sent the children out.
:They have been carried off,
:I wasn't able to warn them!

:In this weather, in this gale, in this windy storm,
:they rest as if in their mother's house:
:frightened by no storm,
:sheltered by the Hand of God.

Oates, afflicted with gangrene and frostbite, walked from his tent into a blizzard. His death is seen as an act of self-sacrifice when, aware that his ill health was compromising his three companions' chances of survival, he chose certain death.

==Early life==
Oates was born in [[Putney]], London in 1880, the son of William and Caroline Oates. His family was wealthy, having had land at [[Gestingthorpe]], Essex, for centuries; his father moved the family there when his children were small after succeeding to the [[Manor]] of Over Hall, Gestingthorpe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Article by Andrew Robinson in Eton College News and Events Lent 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His sister Lillian, a year older,&lt;ref name="1881 British Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/census/household_record.asp?HOUSEHOLD_CODE=1881BR_4735550&amp;HOUSEHOLD_SUB=1&amp;frompage=5 |title=1881 British Census Household Record |publisher=Familysearch.org |date= |accessdate=8 October 2011}}{{better source|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; married the Irish baritone and actor [[Frederick Ranalow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roll-of-honour.com/Surrey/GodalmingCharthouseSchoolWW2.html |title=Surrey - Godalming, Charterhouse School - World War 2 |publisher=Roll of Honour |date= |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An uncle was the naturalist and African explorer [[Frank Oates]].

Oates lived in Putney from 1885{{ndash}}1891. He was one of the first pupils to attend the nearby [[Willington School]]. He went on to [[Eton College]] but left after less than two years owing to ill health.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He then attended an army "[[crammer]]", South Lynn School, [[Eastbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' ''Correspondence relating to Henry van Esse Scott, founder of South Lynn'' July 1927&lt;/ref&gt; His father died of typhoid fever in [[Madeira]] in 1896.

==Military career==
In 1898, Oates was commissioned into the 3rd ([[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]]) Battalion of the [[West Yorkshire Regiment]]. He saw active service during the [[Second Boer War]] as a junior officer in the [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons]], having been transferred to that cavalry regiment as a [[second lieutenant]] in May 1900. He took part in operations in the [[Transvaal Republic|Transvaal]], the [[Orange River Colony]], and [[Cape Colony]]. In March 1901 a gunshot wound shattered his left thigh bone, leaving it an inch shorter than the right. Twice called upon to surrender in that engagement, he replied, "We came to fight, not to surrender."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He was recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]] for his actions and was brought to public attention.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-18769958 | work=BBC News | title=How the last words of Titus Oates still inspire his regiment | date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] in 1902, and left [[Cape Town]] for England after peace was signed in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Troops returning home|day_of_week=Tuesday |date=10 June 1902 |page_number=14 |issue=36790| }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[mentioned in despatches]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] in his final despatch dated 23 June 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27459 |date=29 July 1902 |pages=4835–4838  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[Captain (BARM)|captain]] in 1906, and served in Ireland, Egypt, and India. He was often referred to by the nickname "[[Titus Oates]]", after the historical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roland |last=Huntford|authorlink=Roland Huntford|title=Scott and Amundsen|publisher=Atheneum|year= 1984|isbn=978-0-6897-0-656-1|page=345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terra Nova Expedition==
{{Main|Terra Nova Expedition}}
{{further|Comparison of the Amundsen and Scott Expeditions}}

[[File:Lawrence Oates photo.jpg|thumb|Lawrence Oates tending horses during the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]]]
In 1910, he applied to join [[Robert Falcon Scott]]'s expedition to the [[South Pole]], and was accepted mainly on the strength of his experience with horses and, to a lesser extent, his ability to make a financial contribution of £1,000 (2018 approximation £110,000&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-1633409/Historic-inflation-calculator-value-money-changed-1900.html|title=Historic inflation calculator: how value of money changed since 1900|work=This is Money|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) towards the expedition. Nicknamed "the soldier" by his fellow expedition members, his role was to look after the nineteen ponies that Scott intended to use for sledge hauling during the initial food depot-laying stage and the first half of the trip to the South Pole. Scott eventually selected him as one of the five-man party who would travel the final distance to the Pole.

Oates disagreed with Scott many times on issues of management of the expedition. 'Their natures jarred on one another,' a fellow expedition member recalled. When he first saw the ponies that Scott had brought on the expedition, Oates was horrified at the £5 animals, which he said were too old for the job and 'a wretched load of crocks.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17269397|title=Antarctic mission: Who was Captain Lawrence Oates?|publisher=BBC news|author= Dhruti Shah|date=10 March 2012|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said: 'Scott's ignorance about marching with animals is colossal.' He also wrote in his diary "Myself, I dislike Scott intensely and would chuck the whole thing if it were not that we are a British expedition.{{nbsp}}...He is not straight, it is himself first, the rest nowhere{{nbsp}}..." However, he also wrote that his harsh words were often a product of the hard conditions. Scott, less harshly, called Oates "the cheery old pessimist" and wrote "The Soldier takes a gloomy view of everything, but I've come to see that this is a characteristic of him".

===South polar journey===
Captain Scott, Captain Oates and 14 other members of the expedition set off from their [[Cape Evans]] base camp for the South Pole on 1 November 1911. At various pre-determined latitude points during the {{convert|895|mi|km|adj=on}} journey, the support members of the expedition were sent back by Scott in teams until on 4 January 1912, at latitude 87° 32' S, only the five-man polar party of Scott, [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Edward A. Wilson]], [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Henry R. Bowers]], [[Edgar Evans]] and Oates remained to walk the last {{convert|167|mi|km}} to the Pole. On 18 January 1912, 79&amp;nbsp;days after starting their journey, they finally reached the Pole only to discover a tent that Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] and his four-man team had left behind at their [[Polheim]] camp after beating them in the race to be first to the Pole. Inside the tent was a note from Amundsen informing them that his party had reached the South Pole on 14 December 1911, beating Scott's party by 35&amp;nbsp;days.

===The return journey===
[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en.svg|thumb|250px|left|alt=Map of a segment of [[Antarctica]], identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen. The track of Scott's journey shows the approximate locations of the deaths of the members of his polar party.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]
Scott's party faced extremely difficult conditions on the return journey, mainly due to the exceptionally adverse weather, poor food supply, injuries sustained from falls, and the effects of [[scurvy]] and [[frostbite]]. On 17 February 1912, near the foot of the [[Beardmore glacier]], [[Edgar Evans]] died, perhaps from a blow to the head suffered in a fall days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=52372&amp;pageno=300 |title=Online Reader – Project Gutenberg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date= |accessdate=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oates' feet had become severely frostbitten and it has been suggested (but never evidenced) that scurvy had reopened his war wound. He was certainly weakening faster than the others. Scott wrote in his diary on 5 March: "Oates' feet are in a wretched condition{{nbsp}}... The poor soldier is very nearly done."
Oates' slower progress was causing the party to fall behind schedule. With an average of {{convert|65|mi|km}} between the pre-laid food depots{{snd}}which each provided a week's food and fuel{{snd}}they needed to cover {{convert|9|mi|km}} per day to have full rations for the final {{convert|400|mi|km}} across the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. However, {{convert|9|mi|km}} was about their best progress on any day and this had lately reduced to sometimes only {{convert|3|mi|km}} due to Oates' worsening condition. On 15 March, Oates told his companions that he could not go on and proposed that they leave him in his sleeping-bag, which they refused to do. He managed a few more miles that day but his condition worsened that night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd2rnQDIjUUC&amp;q=he+could+go+no+farther |title=Shadows of death - Time-Life Books |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 16 March (or possibly 15 March{{snd}}Scott was unsure) Oates walked out of the tent into a {{convert|-40|°F|°C|abbr=on}} blizzard to his death. Scott wrote in his diary: "We knew that poor Oates was walking to his death, but though we tried to dissuade him, we knew it was the act of a brave man and an English gentleman."&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;
According to Scott's diary, as Oates left the tent he said, "I am just going outside and may be some time",&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Captain R.F. ''Scott's Last Expedition: The Journals of Captain R.F. Scott''. Pan Books, 2003, p.462.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hous"&gt;Paul Simpson-Housley (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=9dq_rnxmvR0C&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q=i%20am%20just%20going%20outside%20and%20may%20be%20some%20time Antarctica: exploration, perception, and metaphor] p. 36. Routledge, 1992. "I am just going outside and may be some time."&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Edward Adrian Wilson]], who was also present, made no reference to this in his own diary or the letters to Oates' mother.&lt;ref name="Huntford"&gt;Roland Huntford (1979) ''Scott and Amundsen: The last place on Earth'' p. 523 "Wilson was writing a very personal letter and, if Oates had expressed heroic intent, he would have told Mrs Oates so, including presumably his last words"&lt;/ref&gt; Oates most likely died on March 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gilbertwhiteshouse.org.uk/10-facts-about-lawrence-oates/|title=10 facts about Lawrence Oates - Gilbert Whites House|website=gilbertwhiteshouse.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott, Wilson and Bowers continued onwards for a further {{convert|20|mi|km}} towards the 'One Ton' food depot that could save them but were halted at latitude 79°40'S by a fierce blizzard on 20 March. Trapped in their tent and too weak and cold to continue, they died nine days later, eleven miles short of their objective. Their frozen bodies were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912; Oates' body was never found. Near where he was presumed to have died, the search party erected a [[cairn]] and cross bearing the inscription; "Hereabouts died a very gallant gentleman, Captain L. E. G. Oates, of the Inniskilling Dragoons. In March 1912, returning from the Pole, he walked willingly to his death in a blizzard, to try and save his comrades, beset by hardships."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BIKSfHT6hjsC&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q=Hereabouts%20died%20a%20very%20gallant%20gentleman%2C%20Captain%20L.%20E.%20G.%20Oates%2C%20of%20the%20Inniskilling%20Dragoons |title=Journals : Captain Scott's Last Expedition: Captain Scott's Last Expedition |author=Robert Falcon Scott |page=454 |website=Books.google.com |date=2006-10-12 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oates' reindeer-skin sleeping bag was recovered and is now displayed in the museum of the [[Scott Polar Research Institute]] in [[Cambridge]] with other items from the expedition.

The Oates Museum at [[Selborne#Museum and Field Studies Centre|Gilbert White's House]], [[Selborne]], Hampshire focuses on the lives of Lawrence Oates and his uncle Frank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilbertwhiteshouse.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=Gilbert Whites House |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Dragoon Guards]], the successor to the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, have a regimental day to remember Oates.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Asquith, Stuart. Regiment Issue 34.

In 1913 his brother officers erected a brass memorial plaque to him in the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in [[Gestingthorpe]], Essex, which his mother, Caroline, faithfully polished weekly for the rest of her life. The church is opposite his family home of Gestingthorpe Hall.

In May 1914 a memorial to Oates was placed in the cloister of the newly built School Library at [[Eton College]], itself part of the Boer War Memorial Buildings. It was executed by [[Kathleen Scott]], the widow of the expedition's leader.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Lawrence Oates school in [[Meanwood]], Leeds (closed 1992), was named after him. On the 100th anniversary of his death, a blue plaque was unveiled in his honour at Meanwood Park, Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-17406132 |title=Plaque to mark South Pole explorer Captain Oates - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2007 The Putney Society unveiled a blue plaque at the site of Oates' childhood home of 263 Upper Richmond Road, Putney, London.

* [[Brenda Clough]]'s 2001 science fiction novella "[[May Be Some Time]]" has Oates transported to the year 2045, where he is healed via advanced medicine. This novella formed the basis for her later novel ''Revise the World'', which also centred on Oates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/05a/rw319.htm Featured Review: Revise the World], by [[Steven H Silver]], at the [[SF Site]]; published 2010; retrieved January 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Geraldine McCaughrean]]'s 2005 book ''[[The White Darkness]]'', a teenage girl, Symone Wates, has an obsession with Captain Titus Oates; she even creates an imaginary friend of him.
* In [[Frank Capra]]'s movie ''[[Dirigible (film)|Dirigible]]'', depicting an American expedition to the South Pole in the 1930s, a fictional character played by [[Roscoe Karns]] incurs injuries similar to those of the real-life Oates, and chooses to sacrifice himself in a manner clearly inspired by the circumstances of Oates' death.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* The 1985 [[villanelle]] "Antarctica" by [[Derek Mahon]] details the last moments and sacrifice of Oates. It uses the quotation "I am just going outside and may be some time" as the basis of one of the refrains, and modulates it to "He is just going outside and may be some time".
* [[Terry Pratchett]] uses Captain Oates' last words at least three times in his [[Discworld|Discworld Series]] in similar situations.

* In [[Tom Stoppard]]'s 1972 play ''[[Jumpers]]'', Stoppard describes two fictional British astronauts named "Oates" and "Captain Scott" whose lunar landing craft is damaged when setting down on the moon, such that the rockets appear to have only enough lift to carry one of the astronauts off the surface. Stoppard has Scott and Oates fight to be the one to get back in the landing craft. Scott wins the fight and closes the hatch to the craft with the words "I am going up now. I may be gone for some time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Purse |first= Nigel |title= Tom Stoppard's Plays: Patterns of Plenitude and Parsimony |location= Leiden |publisher= Brill |year= 2016 |page= 155 |ISBN= 9789004318366 |quote= The significance of the moon landing for interweaving the vehicle of the play into the ideas it discusses is two-fold. First of all, 'Millions of viewers saw the two astronauts struggling at the foot of the ladder until Oates was knocked to the ground by his commanding officer... Captain Scott has maintained radio silence since pulling up the ladder and closing the hatch with the remark, 'I am going up now. I may be gone for some time.' Apart from being an inverse pun on the famous scene on Scott's Antarctic journey in which Oates sacrifices himself with the words, 'I am just going outside and may be some time', it demonstrates the chaotic world of relativism in which the morality of one's actions depends upon one's point of view.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* He is a character in [[Beryl Bainbridge]]'s novel ''[[The Birthday Boys]]'' (1991) in which Bainbridge writes about the ill-fated expedition from the point of view of Scott and the four men he took to the Pole. 
* In [[Margaret Atwood]]'s 2009 novel ''[[The Year of the Flood]]'' the character Adam One makes reference to "Saint Laurence 'Titus' Oates of the Scott Expedition" in a speech made to the followers of the God's Gardeners eco-fanatic religious group. One of the characters is also named after Oates.
* Spanish heavy metal band [[WarCry (band)|WarCry]] song "Capitán Lawrence" of ''[[El Sello De Los Tiempos]]'' album tells of his sacrifice to save his comrades.
* In [[China Miéville]]'s SF novel ''[[Embassytown]]'' (2011), several human characters 'take the Oates Road' when they walk out in the alien city that surrounds them, where they hope to die. Oates-like brave polar explorers are also mentioned earlier in the novel when humans trade with the aliens.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
* In the 1991 episode of ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', "[[White Hole (Red Dwarf)|White Hole]]", and in [[Rob Grant]]'s ''Red Dwarf'' novel ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'', Kryten attempts to persuade Rimmer to make a sacrifice (specifically, turning himself off so that the power-deprived ship will have more energy) in the manner of the brave Captain Oates, to which Rimmer replies, "How do we know that Oates went out for this legendary walk? From the only surviving document: Scott's diary. And he's hardly likely to have written down, "February the First, bludgeoned Oates to death while he slept, then scoffed him along with the last packet of instant mash." How's that going to look when he gets rescued, eh? No, much better to say, "Oates made the supreme sacrifice", while you're dabbing up his gravy with the last piece of crusty bread." Rimmer concludes, "If that'd been me, I'd've stayed in the tent, whacked Scott over the head with a frozen [[Siberian Husky|husky]], and then eaten him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0684187/quotes|title=White Hole|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=6 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the original version of the 1999 [[Robbie the Reindeer]] cartoon ''[[Hooves of Fire]]'', Robbie quotes Oates' last words when telling Blitzen that he's leaving Santa's sleigh team. In the American dub of the special, the line is changed.
* In the song "Héroes de la Antártida" by the Spanish pop group [[Mecano]] on their album ''[[Descanso Dominical]]''.
* Australian post-rock band We Lost the Sea song "A Gallant Gentleman" on their album ''Departure Songs'' pays homage to Oates' sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Lost The Sea – Departure Songs, an Analysis Of|url=http://canthisevenbecalledmusic.com/we-lost-the-sea-departure-songs/|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the third episode of the seventh series of ''[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]'', Mark likens Jeremy's expedition to read ''Wuthering Heights'' on their balcony to Oates' death. "There goes the Captain Oates of having to read a relatively short book."

'''Lucy Gwynne Branham''' (1892 in [[Kempsville, Virginia]] - 1966) was an American suffragist associated with the [[National Women's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/pages/2794 |title=Women's history |publisher=Learnnc.org |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/suffrage/nwp/profiles7.html |title=Photographs from the Records of the National Woman's Party - Profiles: Selected Leaders of the National Woman's Party - (American Memory from the Library of Congress) |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Education==
She earned degrees in history from [[Washington College]] in Maryland, and [[Johns Hopkins University]] (Master's degree).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; 

==Career==
While teaching in Florida, she received a [[Carnegie Hero Fund|Carnegie Medal]] for saving Dema T. Nelson from drowning in the ocean in 1915.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegiehero.org/search-awardees/ |title=Search Awardees &amp;#124; Carnegie Hero Fund Commission |publisher=Carnegiehero.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began work on a Ph.D. at [[Columbia University]] under [[Charles A. Beard]], but, in the words of historian Julia L. Mickenberg, Branham "turned from academia to activism, becoming a field organizer for the NWP."&lt;ref&gt;Julia L. Mickenberg, "Suffragettes and Soviets: American Feminists and the Specter of Revolutionary Russia," ''Journal of American History'' vol. 100, no. 4 (2014): 1039.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Katherine A. S. Siegel notes that, "In 1916, Branham put her studies aside to begin work in the National Woman's Party."&lt;ref&gt;Katherine A. S. Siegel, "The Women's Committee for the Recognition of Russia: Progressives in the Age of 'Normalcy,'" ''Peace &amp; Change'' vol. 21, no. 3 (1996): 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Siegel writes that Branham "worked tirelessly for suffrage and, when she could, on the readings Beard assigned her," and she began teaching history in Columbia's adult extension program in the fall of 1920, but she left within a year to go to Russia as a representative of the ''New York Herald'' - [[Armand Hammer]] described her as the "suffragette history professor."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, 293-294.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the dissertation she was working on ("The History of Labor and Politics in New York") was listed as being "in progress" with an expected completion date of 1922,&lt;ref&gt;"Eighteenth List of Doctoral Dissertations in Political Economy in Progress in American Universities and Colleges Source," ''American Economic Review'' vol. 11 no.2 (1921): 393, accessed via [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1808694 JSTOR], 11 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia University "has no record that Branham ever finished her Ph.D."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, 311, note 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Her Johns Hopkins master's thesis ("An Outline of the Political History of Georgia, During the Revolutionary War") is the ''only'' thesis or dissertation listed under her name in WorldCat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3Alucy+branham&amp;fq=mt%3Adeg&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 WorldCat], accessed 11 Oct. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; so Branham must have been [[All but dissertation|ABD]] and never finished her doctorate, concentrating on activism rather than academe.

In 1916, she was a [[National Women's Party]] organizer in Utah, and in September of the following year she was arrested for picketing the White House as part of the [[Silent Sentinels]], a NWP campaign for women's suffrage, for which she served two months in the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]] and the District jail.&lt;ref name="suffragistmemorial1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suffragistmemorial.org/Suffragist_of_the_Month.html |title=Suffragist of the Month |publisher=Suffragistmemorial.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919235717/http://www.suffragistmemorial.org/Suffragist_of_the_Month.html |archivedate=September 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Branham lobbied in Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama for a federal amendment in the Senate that would legalize women's suffrage.&lt;ref name="suffragistmemorial1"/&gt; She traveled around America speaking of her experiences in prison as part of the NWP's "Prison Special" tour of 1919.&lt;ref name="suffragistmemorial1"/&gt; Also in 1919, Branham burned a letter from President Woodrow Wilson in [[Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.|Lafayette Square]] to protest for women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/data/80812975 |title=ArchiveGrid |publisher=Beta.worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After women's suffrage was obtained, she led the [[Inez Milholland]] Memorial Fund Committee, which created an ongoing endowment fund for the NWP.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Branham worked for Russian relief with the American Women's Emergency Committee, and lobbied Congress against the Allied blockade of Russia; worked with the [[American Friends Service Committee]]; served as field secretary for Russian Reconstruction Farms; headed the Women's Committee for the Recognition of Russia, which was under the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]; and was executive secretary of the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Mickenberg, 1039-1040, note 41.&lt;/ref&gt; She also worked with the World Woman's Party in Geneva and lobbied the League of Nations on equal rights issues.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In the late 1950s she lived at [[Sewall-Belmont House]] and served on the NWP's Congressional Committee to lobby for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Branham's mother, Lucy Fisher Gwynne Branham, was also a suffragist, and was arrested for her part in the watch fire demonstrations in January 1919 and served three days in the District jail.&lt;ref name="suffragistmemorial1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="worldcat1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n2004-115513 |title=Branham, Lucy Gwynne 1892-1966 |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dom (title)|Dona]] '''Maria Manuela''' (15 October 1527 &amp;ndash; 12 July 1545&lt;ref&gt;Kamen p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;) was the eldest daughter and second child of King [[John III of Portugal]] and his wife [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]]. She was [[Princess of Asturias]] and [[Duchess of Milan]] as the first wife of the future [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Prince of Portugal|Princess of Portugal]] as heir presumptive to the Portuguese throne between 1527 and 1535.

== Early life ==
Maria was born in [[Coimbra]] on 15 October 1527 and was one of the few children of John III to survive childhood. In her youth, Maria received a humanistic education that was considered typical for a princess of her time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Self-Fashioning and Assumptions of Identity in Medieval and Early Modern Iberia|last=Delbrugge|first=Laura|publisher=Brill|year=2015|isbn=9789004250482|location=Netherlands|pages=230|quote=¨¨|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marriage and later life ==
She married her cousin [[Philip II of Spain]] on 12 November 1543 at [[Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamen p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; As she was to be married to the Prince of Asturias, [[heir apparent]] to the Spanish crown, and being an [[Infanta]] of Portugal, their wedding became one of the most remarkable in the history of Spain due to its opulence. Contemporary writers have left detailed descriptions of the journey from [[Madrid]] to [[Badajoz]] to Salamanca to receive the princess and of the luxuries she was given by the [[Duke of Medina Sidonia]] in Badajoz.

She gave birth to their son [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias|Carlos]] on 8 July 1545 in [[Valladolid]], but died four days later due to a [[haemorrhage]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamen p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; She was initially buried in the [[Royal Chapel of Granada]] on 30 March 1549 but was later transferred to [[El Escorial|Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial]].

'''Mortuary temples''' (or '''funerary temples''') were [[Egyptian temple|temples]] that were erected adjacent to, or in the vicinity of, royal [[tomb]]s in [[Ancient Egypt]]. The temples were designed to commemorate the reign of the [[Pharaoh]] under whom they were constructed, as well as for use by the king's [[imperial cult|cult]] after death.

==History==
[[File:S10.08 Deir-El-Bahari, image 9931.jpg|thumbnail|[[Deir el-Bahari]]]]
Mortuary temples were built around pyramids in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]. However, once the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] pharaohs began constructing tombs in the [[Valley of the Kings]], they built their mortuary temples separately. These New Kingdom temples were called "mansions of millions of years" by the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2000). The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The mortuary temples were also used as a resting place for the boat of [[Amun]] at the time of the [[Beautiful Festival of the Valley]], during which the cult statue of the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] visited the west bank of Thebes.

The first mortuary temple was built for [[Amenhotep I]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] during the New Kingdom. Several other rulers of this [[dynasty]] built temples for the same purpose, the best known being those at [[Deir el-Bahari]], where [[Hatshepsut]] built beside the funerary temple of [[Mentuhotep II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/od/archaeologicalsites/a/deir_el_bahri.htm|title=Pharaoh Hatshepsut's Deir el-Bahri|accessdate=2008-04-20|author=K. Kris Hirst}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of [[Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|Amenhotep III]], of which the only major extant remains are the [[Colossi of Memnon]].

Later rulers of the 18th Dynasty either failed to build here at all or, in the case of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ay]] and [[Horemheb]], their construction was not completed. The [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th Dynasty]] ruler [[Seti I]] constructed his [[Mortuary Temple of Seti I|temple]] at what is now known as [[Kurna|Gurna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/694/he1.htm|accessdate=2007-02-15|title=Creatness eclipsed by magnitude|publisher=Al-Ahram Weekly|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210190548/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/694/he1.htm|archivedate=2006-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of his "Glorious temple of Seti Merenptah in the field of Amun which resides at the West of Thebes" was dedicated to his father [[Ramesses I]], whose short reign prevented him from building his own, and was completed by his son [[Ramesses II]].

Ramesses II constructed his own temple, referred to as the [[Ramesseum]] (a name given to it by [[Champollion]] in 1829): "Temple of a million years of Usermaatre Setepenre which is linked with Thebes-the-Quoted in the Field of Amun, in the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archeo.ens.fr/8546-5Gren/clrweb/7dguylecuyot/GLRamesseumWeb.html|title=THE RAMESSEUM (EGYPT), RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH|author=Guy Lecuyot|accessdate=2007-03-07|publisher=Archéologies d'Orient et d'Occident |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061127051309/http://www.archeo.ens.fr/8546-5Gren/clrweb/7dguylecuyot/GLRamesseumWeb.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, during the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th Dynasty]], [[Ramesses III]] constructed his own temple at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Uvo Hölscher|title=Medinet Habu 1924-1928.

NhaB homologues are usually about 500 amino acyl residues (aas) in length and possess about 12 transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs), although some members differ in their number of TMSs. NhaB homologues also exhibit a region with limited sequence similarity to a 46 kDa membrane protein of unknown function from ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' (spP46838) which is also homologous to a member of arsenate resistance pumps of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=3.a.4 TC# 3.A.4]). Only [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] bacterial proteins have been functionally characterized.

The ''E. coli'' NhaB is 58% identical to the orthologous ''[[Vibrio alginolyticus]]'' Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pinner|first=E.|last2=Padan|first2=E.|last3=Schuldiner|first3=S.|date=1992-06-05|title=Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the nhaB gene, encoding a Na+/H+ antiporter in Escherichia coli|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=267|issue=16|pages=11064–11068|issn=0021-9258|pmid=1317851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the latter protein is predicted to exhibit 10 TMSs, construction of ''NhaB-phoA'' fusions led to evidence for a 9 TMS model with the N-terminus in the cytoplasm and the C-terminus in the [[periplasm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enomoto|first=H.|last2=Unemoto|first2=T.|last3=Nishibuchi|first3=M.|last4=Padan|first4=E.|last5=Nakamura|first5=T.|date=1998-03-06|title=Topological study of Vibrio alginolyticus NhaB Na+/H+ antiporter using gene fusions in Escherichia coli cells|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|volume=1370|issue=1|pages=77–86|issn=0006-3002|pmid=9518558|doi=10.1016/s0005-2736(97)00245-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A centrally located aspartyl residue in the 3rd TMS is conserved in all members of the family and important for activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakamura|first=T.|last2=Fujisaki|first2=Y.|last3=Enomoto|first3=H.|last4=Nakayama|first4=Y.|last5=Takabe|first5=T.|last6=Yamaguchi|first6=N.|last7=Uozumi|first7=N.|date=2001-10-01|title=Residue aspartate-147 from the third transmembrane region of Na(+)/H(+) antiporter NhaB of Vibrio alginolyticus plays a role in its activity|journal=Journal of Bacteriology|volume=183|issue=19|pages=5762–5767|doi=10.1128/JB.183.19.5762-5767.2001|issn=0021-9193|pmc=95471|pmid=11544242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|g|oʊ|g|æ̃}}, {{IPAc-en|US|g|oʊ|ˈ|g|æ̃}}; {{IPA-fr|øʒɛn ɑ̃ʁi pɔl ɡoɡɛ̃|lang}}; 7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a French [[post-Impressionist]] artist. Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental use of color and [[Synthetism|Synthetist]] style that were distinctly different from [[Impressionism]]. Toward the end of his life, he spent ten years in [[French Polynesia]], and most of his paintings from this time depict people or landscapes from that region.

His work was influential to the French [[avant-garde]] and many modern artists, such as [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Henri Matisse]]. Gauguin's art became popular after his death, partially from the efforts of [[art dealer]] [[Ambroise Vollard]], who organized exhibitions of his work late in his career and assisted in organizing two important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/cataloguedesouvr1903salo#page/68 |author=Salon d'Automne |author-link=Salon d'Automne |year=1903 |title=Catalogue de peinture, dessin, sculpture, gravure, architecture et arts décoratifs: exposés au Grand Palais des Champs-Élysées |publisher=Ch.

His expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the [[Cloisonnism|cloisonnist style]], paved the way to [[Primitivism]] and the return to the [[pastoral]]. He was also an influential proponent of [[wood engraving]] and [[woodcut]]s as art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rubens.anu.edu.au/htdocs/surveys/prints/bysubject/display00087.html |title=Prints by Paul Gauguin |publisher=ArtServe |work=[[The Australian National University]] |access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://columbia.thefreedictionary.com/woodcut+and+wood+engraving |title=Woodcut and Wood Engraving |work=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Family history and early life ===
[[File:Gauguin La mère de l'artiste.jpg|thumb|upright|''Aline Marie Chazal Tristán, (1825–1867) "The Artist's Mother"'', 1889, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].]]
[[File:Flora Tristan 1838.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Gauguin's maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan (1803–1844) in 1838]] 
Gauguin was born in Paris to Clovis Gauguin and Alina Maria Chazal on June 7, 1848. His birth coincided with [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary upheavals]] throughout Europe that year. His father, a 34-year-old liberal journalist, came from a family of [[petite bourgeoisie|petits bourgeois]] entrepreneurs residing in Orléans.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=Clovis came from Orléans, and there is nothing in the Gauguin family history of market gardeners and small businessmen to suggest an artistic temperament.}} He was compelled to flee France when the newspaper for which he wrote was suppressed by French authorities.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=His father, Clovis Gauguin, was a 34-year-old journalist, who worked for a liberal newspaper that was soon to be suppressed.}}{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3-4|loc=Like many other European intellectuals, Clovis was forced by the failure of the 1848 revolutions to look to the new world [Western Hemisphere]. There was no future for a liberal journalist in the France of [[Louis Napoleon|Napoleon III]].}} Gauguin's mother was the 22-year-old daughter of André Chazal, an engraver, and [[Flora Tristan]], an author and activist in early socialist movements. Their union ended when André assaulted his wife Flora and was sentenced to prison for attempted murder.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=Flora Tristan, author and social reformer…" and "Theirs had been an ill-matched, short-lived marriage; it culminated in Chazal attempting to murder his wife and being sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.}}

Paul Gauguin's maternal grandmother, Flora Tristan, was the illegitimate daughter of Thérèse Laisnay and Don Mariano de Tristan Moscoso. Details of Thérèse's family background are not known; her father, Don Mariano, came from an aristocratic Spanish family from the Peruvian city of Arequipa. He was an officer of the [[Dragoon#Early history and role|Dragoons]].{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=… Thérèse Laisnay, whose background nothing whatever is known…whether she was an aristocrat or adventuress, it is impossible to say.}} Members of the wealthy Tristan Moscoso family held powerful positions in Peru.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=The Tristan Moscoso family belonged to the old Aragonese nobility, and was among the early Spanish settlers in Peru, where they had become powerful and extremely wealthy.}} Nonetheless, Don Mariano's unexpected death plunged his mistress and daughter Flora into poverty.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=They moved to Paris where Flora was born in 1803: the liaison was a stable one, but Don Mariano died suddenly before bringing himself to marry his mistress. This catapulted [Thérèse] from luxury to penury, and the rest of her miserable life was spent pleading the claims for herself and her daughter.}} When Flora's marriage with André failed, she petitioned for and obtained a small monetary settlement from her father's Peruvian relatives.  She sailed to Peru in hopes of enlarging her share of the Tristan Moscoso family fortune. This never materialized; but she successfully published a popular travelogue of her experiences in Peru which launched her literary career in 1838. An active supporter of early socialist societies, Gauguin's maternal grandmother helped to lay the foundations for the 1848 revolutionary movements. Placed under surveillance by French police and suffering from overwork, she died in 1844.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3|loc=Followed by police spies, she travelled France addressing meetings of the urban proletariat whom she called upon to unite. Physically exhausted by such activities, she collapsed and died in Bordeaux in November 1844, less than four years before the revolution of 1848 toward which she had made such a signal contribution.}} Her grandson Paul "idolized his grandmother, and kept copies of her books with him to the end of his life."{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=3}}

In 1850, Clovis Gauguin departed for Peru with his wife Alina and young children in hopes of continuing his journalistic career under the auspices of his wife's South American relations.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=4|loc=…impressed with his wife's South American connections, he decided to emigrate to Peru and start a newspaper there.}} He died of a heart attack en route, and Alina arrived in Peru a widow with the 18-month-old Paul and his 2½ year-old sister, Marie. Gauguin's mother was welcomed by her paternal granduncle, whose son-in-law would shortly assume the presidency of Peru.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=4|loc=…Alina was well received by her Spanish grandfather's younger brother, Don Pio Tristan Moscoso. His position in Peruvian society is indicated by the fact that, only a few months after Alina's arrival, Don Pio's son-in-law, Echenique, became President of Peru.}} To the age of six, Paul enjoyed a privileged upbringing, attended by nursemaids and servants. He retained a vivid memory of that period of his childhood which instilled "indelible impressions of Peru that haunted him the rest of his life."{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=4|loc=Alina and her two small children consequently found themselves in a tropical paradise where every material need was met and every sense was indulged…Aline and her two children were looked after by a Negro nursemaid and a Chinese manservant; and the racial diversity of Peru was matched by a rich extravagance of dress and by the brightly painted buildings everywhere in the city.}}{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=4|loc=I have a remarkable visual memory, and I remember that period, our house and a whole lot of events.}}

Gauguin's idyllic childhood ended abruptly when his family mentors fell from political power during Peruvian civil conflicts in 1854. Aline returned to France with her children, leaving Paul with his paternal grandfather, Guillaume Gauguin, in Orléans. Deprived by the Peruvian Tristan Moscoso clan of a generous annuity arranged by her granduncle, Alina settled in Paris to work as a dressmaker.{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=4|loc=…[C]ivil war in Peru resulted in Don Pio's family losing political power." And "[Aline returned] to France anticipating grandfather Gauguin's death, life with Clovis's bachelor brother in Orleans, a small legacy from the Gauguins, and  a large annuity from  Don Pio, which [the Tristan Moscoso clan] prevented Aline from ever receiving. Eventually she established herself as a dressmaker in Paris…}}

=== Education and first job ===
After attending a couple of local schools, Gauguin was sent to the prestigious Catholic boarding school Petit Séminaire de [[La Chapelle-Saint-Mesmin]].{{sfn|Gayford|2006|pp=99–100}} He spent three years at the school. At age fourteen, he entered the Loriol Institute in Paris, a naval preparatory school, before returning to Orléans to take his final year at the Lycée Jeanne D'Arc. Gauguin signed on as a [[maritime pilot|pilot]]'s assistant in the [[merchant marine]]. Three years later, he joined the French navy in which he served for two years.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=14}} His mother died on 7 July 1867, but he did not learn of it for several months until a letter from his sister Marie caught up with him in India.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=18}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perruchot |first=Henri |title=La Vie de Gauguin |year=1961 |publisher= [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]] |language=fr |ASIN=B0014QL91I |page=44 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=LxpAAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, Gauguin returned to Paris where he secured a job as a stockbroker. A close family friend, Gustave Arosa, got him a job at the [[Paris Bourse]]; Gauguin was 23. He became a successful Parisian businessman and remained one for the next 11 years. In 1879 he was earning 30,000 [[French franc|francs]] a year (about $125,000 in 2008 US dollars) as a stockbroker, and as much again in his dealings in the art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Don|title=The $12 Million Stuffed Shark: The Curious Economics of Contemporary Art|date=2010|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|isbn=978-0-230-62059-9|page=49|url={{Google books|ORHdSqeDPlsC|title|page=49|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Business of Art: Evidence from the Art Market|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/business/|website=getty.edu|publisher=[[J.

Gauguin's earnings deteriorated sharply and he eventually decided to pursue painting full-time.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=27}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=48–49}}

=== Marriage ===
In 1873, he married a [[Danes|Danish]] woman, Mette-Sophie Gad (1850–1920). Over the next ten years, they had five children: Émile (1874–1955); Aline (1877–1897); Clovis (1879–1900); [[Jean René Gauguin|Jean René]] (1881–1961); and Paul Rollon (1883–1961). By 1884, Gauguin had moved with his family to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], where he pursued a business career as a [[tarpaulin]] salesman. It was not a success: He could not speak Danish, and the Danes did not want French tarpaulins.  Mette became the chief breadwinner, giving French lessons to trainee diplomats.&lt;ref&gt;Januszczak, ''Full Story''.&lt;/ref&gt;

His middle-class family and marriage fell apart after 11 years when Gauguin was driven to paint full-time. He returned to Paris in 1885, after his wife and her family asked him to leave because he had renounced the values they shared.{{clarify|date=February 2015}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=62}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=38}} Gauguin's last physical contact with them was in 1891, Mette eventually breaking with him decisively in 1894.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=210}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=29}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=182}}

In 1873, around the same time as he became a stockbroker, Gauguin began painting in his free time. His Parisian life centred on the [[9th arrondissement of Paris]]. Gauguin lived at 15, rue la Bruyère.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bain-Smith|first1=Priscilla|title=Gauguin: Where he lived and loved|url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/gauguin-where-he-lived-and-loved/|website=bonjourparis.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6X9nkWkMb?url=http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/gauguin-where-he-lived-and-loved/|archivedate=20 March 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paris locations"&gt;Jean-François Staszak {{Google books|id_AUj-DycAC|Géographies de Gauguin|page=32|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby were the cafés frequented by the Impressionists. Gauguin also visited galleries frequently and purchased work by emerging artists. He formed a friendship with [[Camille Pissarro]]&lt;ref name="met" /&gt; and visited him on Sundays to paint in his garden. Pissarro introduced him to various other artists. In 1877 Gauguin "moved downmarket and across the river to the poorer, newer, urban sprawls" of [[w:fr:Vaugirard|Vaugirard]]. Here, on the third floor at 8 rue Carcel, he had the first home in which he had a [[studio]].&lt;ref name="Paris locations" /&gt; His close friend [[Émile Schuffenecker]], a former stockbroker who also aspired to become an artist, lived close by. Gauguin showed paintings in [[Impressionist]] exhibitions held in 1881 and 1882 (earlier, a sculpture of his son Émile had been the only sculpture in the 4th Impressionist Exhibition of 1879). His paintings received dismissive reviews, although several of them, such as ''The Market Gardens of Vaugirard'', are now highly regarded.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=22}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=38–40}}

In 1882, the stock market crashed and the art market contracted. [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], the Impressionists' primary art dealer, was especially affected by the crash and for a period of time stopped buying pictures from painters such as Gauguin. Gauguin's earnings contracted sharply and over the next two years he slowly formulated his plans to become a full-time artist.&lt;ref name="met"&gt;Cindy Kang, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/gaug/hd_gaug.htm Gauguin Biography], Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The following two summers, he painted with Pissarro and occasionally [[Paul Cézanne]]. In October 1883, he wrote to Pissarro saying that he had decided to make his living from painting at all cost and asked for his help, which Pissarro at first readily provided. The following January, Gauguin moved with his family to [[Rouen]], where they could live more cheaply and where he thought he had discerned opportunities when visiting Pissarro there the previous summer. However, the venture proved unsuccessful, and by the end of the year Mette and the children moved to Copenhagen, Gauguin following shortly after in November 1884, bringing with him his art collection, which subsequently remained in Copenhagen.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=27–29}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=52–56}}

Life in Copenhagen proved equally difficult and their marriage grew strained. At Mette's urging, supported by her family, Gauguin returned to Paris the following year.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=56}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=57–62}}

=== France 1885–1886 ===
[[File:Paul Gauguin 036.jpg|thumb| ''Four Breton Women'', 1886, [[Neue Pinakothek| Neue Pinakothek, Munich]]]]
Gauguin returned to Paris in June 1885, accompanied by his six-year-old son Clovis. The other children remained with Mette in Copenhagen, where they had the support of family and friends while Mette herself was able to get work as a translator and French teacher. Gauguin initially found it difficult to re-enter the art world in Paris and spent his first winter back in real poverty, obliged to take a series of menial jobs. Clovis eventually fell ill and was sent to a boarding school, Gauguin's sister Marie providing the funds.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=63–67}} During this first year, Gauguin produced very little art. He exhibited nineteen paintings and a wood relief at the eighth (and last) Impressionist exhibition in May 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gersh-Nesic|first1=Berth|title=The Eighth Impressionist Exhibition – 1886|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/first_eight_exhibitions/a/eighth_Impressionism_exhibition.htm|website=arthistory.about.com|publisher=[[About.com]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906032942/http://arthistory.about.com/od/first_eight_exhibitions/a/eighth_Impressionism_exhibition.htm|archivedate=6 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these paintings were earlier work from Rouen or Copenhagen and there was nothing really novel in the few new ones, although his ''Baigneuses à Dieppe'' ("Women Bathing") introduced what was to become a recurring motif, the woman in the waves. Nevertheless, [[Félix Bracquemond]] did purchase one of his paintings. This exhibition also established [[Georges Seurat]] as leader of the ''[[avant-garde]]'' movement in Paris. Gauguin contemptuously rejected Seurat's [[Neo-impressionism|Neo-Impressionist]] [[Pointillism|Pointillist]] technique and later in the year broke decisively with Pissarro, who from that point on was rather antagonistic towards Gauguin.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=39–41}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=67–68}}

Gauguin spent the summer of 1886 in the artist's colony of [[Pont-Aven School|Pont-Aven]] in Brittany. He was attracted in the first place because it was cheap to live there. However, he found himself an unexpected success with the young art students who flocked there in the summer. His naturally pugilistic temperament (he was both an accomplished boxer and fencer) was no impediment in the socially relaxed seaside resort. He was remembered during that period as much for his outlandish appearance as for his art. Amongst these new associates was [[Charles Laval]], who would accompany Gauguin the following year to [[Panama]] and [[Martinique]].{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=70–73}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=42–49}}

That summer, he executed some pastel drawings of nude figures in the manner of Pissarro and those by Degas exhibited at the 1886 eighth Impressionist exhibition. He mainly painted landscapes such as ''La Bergère Bretonne'' ("The Breton Shepherdess"), in which the figure plays a subordinate role. His ''Jeunes Bretons au bain'' ("Young Breton Boys Bathing"), introducing a theme he returned to each time he visited Pont-Aven, is clearly indebted to Degas in its design and bold use of pure color. The naive drawings of the English illustrator [[Randolph Caldecott]], used to illustrate a popular guide-book on Brittany, had caught the imagination of the ''avant-garde'' student artists at Pont-Aven, anxious to free themselves from the conservatism of their academies, and Gauguin consciously imitated them in his sketches of Breton girls.&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn (1880)&lt;/ref&gt; These sketches were later worked up into paintings back in his Paris studio. The most important of these is ''Four Breton Women'', which shows a marked departure from his earlier Impressionist style as well as incorporating something of the naive quality of Caldecott's illustration, exaggerating features to the point of caricature.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=42–49}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=74–75}}

Gauguin, along with [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]], Charles Laval, Émile Schuffenecker and many others, re-visited [[Pont-Aven]] after his travels in Panama and Martinique. The bold use of pure color and [[Symbolist]] choice of subject matter distinguish what is now called the [[Pont-Aven School]]. Disappointed with [[Impressionism]], Gauguin felt that traditional European painting had become too imitative and lacked symbolic depth. By contrast, the art of Africa and Asia seemed to him full of mystic symbolism and vigour. There was a vogue in Europe at the time for the art of other cultures, especially that of Japan ([[Japonism]]). He was invited to participate in the [[Paul Gauguin's exhibit at Les XX, 1889|1889 exhibition]] organized by [[Les XX]].

=== Cloisonnism and synthetism ===
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]].]]
Under the influence of [[folk art]] and [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese prints]], Gauguin's work evolved towards [[Cloisonnism]], a style given its name by the critic [[Édouard Dujardin]] to describe [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Émile Bernard]]'s method of painting with flat areas of color and bold outlines, which reminded Dujardin of the Medieval [[cloisonné]] enameling technique. Gauguin was very appreciative of Bernard's art and of his daring with the employment of a style which suited Gauguin in his quest to express the essence of the objects in his art.&lt;ref name=twsJun10b&gt;{{cite news

 |quote= With the artist Emile Bernard, Gauguin invented a method of rendering pictoral space that uses large patches of flat color and thick line; these techniques influenced early 20th-century artists. Gauguin's works include Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888), Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (1814), and Savage Tales (1902).

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Gauguin's ''[[The Yellow Christ]]'' (1889), often cited as a quintessential Cloisonnist work, the image was reduced to areas of pure color separated by heavy black outlines. In such works Gauguin paid little attention to classical perspective and boldly eliminated subtle gradations of color, thereby dispensing with the two most characteristic principles of post-[[Renaissance]] painting. His painting later evolved towards [[Synthetism]] in which neither form nor color predominate but each has an equal role.

=== Martinique ===
[[File:Tropical Vegetation.jpg|thumb|''Martinique Landscape'' 1887, [[Scottish National Gallery]]]]
In 1887, after having visited [[Panama]], Gauguin spent the time from June to November near [[Saint-Pierre, Martinique|Saint Pierre]] on the Caribbean island of [[Martinique]], accompanied by his friend the artist Charles Laval. His thoughts and experiences during this time are recorded in his letters to his wife Mette and his artist friend Emile Schuffenecker.&lt;ref&gt;"Gauguin and Martinique," Karen Kristine Reichnitzer Pope, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in Martinique by way of Panama where he had found himself broke and without a job. At the time France had a policy of [[right of return|repatriation]] where if a citizen became broke or stranded on a French colony, the state would pay for the boat ride back. Upon leaving Panama protected by the repatriation policy, Gauguin and Laval decided to get off the boat at the Martinique port of St. Pierre. Scholars are in disagreement if Gauguin intentionally or spontaneously decided to stay on the island. At first, the 'negro hut' in which they lived suited him, and he enjoyed watching people in their daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Vickers, "Martinique in Gauguin's Footsteps", ''Contemporary Review'', 1 June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the weather in the summer was hot and the hut leaked in the rain. Gauguin also suffered [[dysentery]] and [[marsh fever]]. While in Martinique, he produced between 10 and 20 works (12 being the most common estimate), traveled widely and apparently came into contact with a small community of [[Hinduism in Martinique|Indian]] immigrants; a contact that would later influence his art through the incorporation of Indian symbols. During his stay, the writer [[Lafcadio Hearn]] was also on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/twoyearsinfrench00hearrich Lafcadio Hearn, ''Two Years in the French West Indies'', Harper &amp; brothers, New York, 1900]&lt;/ref&gt; His account provides an historical comparison to accompany Gauguin's images.

Gauguin finished 11 known paintings during his stay in Martinique, many of which seem to be derived from his hut. His letters to Schuffenecker express an excitement about the exotic location and natives represented in his paintings. Gauguin asserted that four of his paintings on the island were better than the rest.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters to his Wife and Friends," Paul Gauguin, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The works as a whole are brightly colored, loosely painted, outdoor figural scenes. Even though his time on the island was short, it surely was influential. He recycled some of his figures and sketches in later paintings, like the motif in ''Among the Mangoes''&lt;ref name="vangoghmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/nl/collectie/s0221V1962|title=De mangobomen, Martinique|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is replicated on his fans. Rural and indigenous populations remained a popular subject in Gauguin's work after he left the island.

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - Paul Gauguin (Man in a Red Beret).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Paul Gauguin (Man in a Red Beret)'', 1888, [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam]]
Gauguin's Martinique paintings were exhibited at his color merchant Arsène Poitier's gallery. There they were seen and admired by [[Vincent van Gogh]] and his art dealer brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]], whose firm [[Goupil &amp; Cie]] had dealings with Portier. Theo purchased three of Gauguin's paintings for 900 francs and arranged to have them hung at Goupil's, thus introducing Gauguin to wealthy clients. At the same time Vincent and Gauguin became close friends (on van Gogh's part it amounted to something akin to adulation) and they corresponded together on art, a correspondence that was instrumental in Gauguin formulating his philosophy of art.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1987, pp. 52–54, 65 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews 2001, pp. 113–117&lt;/ref&gt; The arrangement with Goupil's continued past Theo's death in January 1891.

Gauguin's relationship with Vincent proved fraught. In 1888, at Theo's instigation, Gauguin and Vincent spent nine weeks painting together at Vincent's [[The Yellow House (painting)|Yellow House]] in [[Arles]]. Their relationship deteriorated and eventually Gauguin decided to leave. On the evening of 23 December 1888 according to a much later account of Gauguin's, van Gogh confronted Gauguin with a razor blade. Later the same evening, van Gogh cut off his own left ear. He wrapped the severed tissue in newspaper and handed it to a woman who worked at a brothel both Gauguin and van Gogh had visited, and asked her to "keep this object carefully, in remembrance of me." Van Gogh was [[Hospital in Arles (Van Gogh series)|hospitalized]] the following day and Gauguin left Arles.{{sfn|Gayford|2006|p=284}} They never saw each other again, but they continued to correspond and in 1890 Gauguin went so far as to propose they form an artist studio in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Pickvance, Ronald.

[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York), Abrams, New York 1986. {{ISBN|0-87099-477-8}} p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; An 1889 sculptural self-portrait ''[[Jug in the form of a Head, Self-portrait]]'' appears to reference Gauguin's traumatic relationship with van Gogh.

Gauguin later claimed to have been instrumental in influencing van Gogh's development as a painter at Arles. While van Gogh did briefly experiment with Gauguin's theory of painting from the imagination in paintings such as ''[[Memory of the Garden at Etten (Ladies of Arles)|Memory of the Garden at Etten]]'', it did not suit him and he quickly returned to painting from nature.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=76–77}}&lt;ref name="Avant et après" /&gt;

Although Gauguin made some of his early strides in the world of art under Pissarro, [[Edgar Degas]] was Gauguin's most admired contemporary artist and a great influence on his work from the beginning, with his figures and interiors as well as a carved and painted medallion of singer Valérie Roumi.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|pp=16, 19, 123}} He had a deep reverence for Degas' artistic dignity and tact.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=17}} It was Gauguin's healthiest, longest lasting friendship, spanning his entire artistic career until his death.

In addition to being one of his earliest supporters, including buying Gauguin's work and persuading dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]] to do the same, there was never a public support for Gauguin more unwavering than from Degas.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=16}} Gauguin also purchased work from Degas in the early to mid-1870s and his own [[monotyping]] predilection was probably influenced by Degas' advancements in the medium.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 26&lt;/ref&gt; Gauguin's Durand-Ruel exhibition in November 1893, which Degas chiefly organized, received mixed reviews. Among the mocking were [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and former friend Pissarro. Degas, however, praised his work, purchasing ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Te faaturuma|es|3=La Melancolía}}'' and admiring the exotic sumptuousness of Gauguin's conjured folklore.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|pp=85, 95}}&lt;ref&gt;Stuckey p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Dumas (ed.) {{Google books|NZt2oj5S-wQC|The Private Collection of Edgar Degas, Volume 1|page=57|plainurl=}} At n. 252 the text says Degas said he purchased it later at Vollard's gallery.&lt;/ref&gt; In appreciation, Gauguin presented Degas with ''The Moon and the Earth'', one of the exhibited paintings that had attracted the most hostile criticism.&lt;ref name= Dumas /&gt; Gauguin's late canvas ''Riders on the Beach'' (two versions) recalls Degas' horse pictures which he started in the 1860s, specifically ''Racetrack'' and ''Before the Race'', testifying to his enduring effect on Gauguin.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=123}} Degas later purchased two paintings at Gauguin's 1895 auction to raise funds for his final trip to Tahiti. These were ''Vahine no te vi (Woman with a Mango)'' and Gauguin's copy of Manet's '' [[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]''.&lt;ref name= Dumas&gt;Ann Dumas (ed.) {{Google books|NZt2oj5S-wQC|The Private Collection of Edgar Degas, Volume 1|page= 56|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuckey p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First visit to Tahiti ===
By 1890, Gauguin had conceived the project of making [[Tahiti]] his next artistic destination. A successful auction of paintings in Paris at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in February 1891, along with other events such as a banquet and a benefit concert, provided the necessary funds.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=125}} The auction had been greatly helped by a flattering review from [[Octave Mirbeau]], courted by Gauguin through [[Camille Pissarro]].{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=125|loc=Thomson notes that Gauguin was alert to the potential for self-publicity. Camille Pissarro, no admirer of Gauguin, later scathingly observed that Gauguin had set out to "get himself elected … as a man of genius}} After visiting his wife and children in Copenhagen, for what turned out to be the last time, Gauguin set sail for Tahiti on 1 April 1891, promising to return a rich man and make a fresh start.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=127}} His avowed intent was to escape European civilization and "everything that is artificial and conventional".&lt;ref&gt;Mathhews pp.157–167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The painter who invented his own brand of artistic license," Arifa Akbar, ''The Independent'', 20 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he took care to take with him a collection of visual stimuli in the form of photographs, drawings and prints.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=143}}{{efn| He described his collection in a letter to [[Odilon Redon]] as "a whole little world of friends". They included Redon's lithograph ''La Mort'' as well as photographs of subjects such as [[:commons:File:Siddharta Gautama Borobudur.jpg|a temple frieze]] at [[Borobudur]] and an [[:commons:File:Nebamun-Bankett.JPG|Egyptian fresco]] from an XVIIIth dynasty tomb at [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=143, 145, 152}}

He spent the first three months in [[Papeete]], the capital of the colony and already much influenced by French and European culture. His biographer [[Belinda Thomson]] observes that he must have been disappointed in his vision of a primitive idyll. He was unable to afford the pleasure-seeking life-style in Papeete, and an early attempt at a portrait, ''[[Suzanne Bambridge]]'', was not well liked.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=133}} He decided to set up his studio in Mataiea, [[Papeari]], some forty-five kilometres from Papeete, installing himself in a native-style bamboo hut. Here he executed paintings depicting Tahitian life such as ''[[Fatata te Miti]] (By the Sea)'' and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ia Orana Maria|ca}} (Ave Maria)'', the latter to become his most prized Tahitian painting.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=182|loc=Thomson notes that Gauguin offered ''Ia Orana Maria'' to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]], whose officials turned it down unceremoniously, "thus confirming and reinforcing Gauguin's hatred of officialdom"}}

[[File:Paul Gauguin 040.jpg|thumb|180px|''Vahine no te tiare (Woman with a Flower)'', 1891, [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]]]]
Many of his finest paintings date from this period. His first portrait of a Tahitian model is thought to be ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vahine no te tiare|ca|3=Dona amb una flor}} (Woman with a Flower)''. The painting is notable for the care with which it delineates [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] features. He sent the painting to his patron [[George-Daniel de Monfreid]], a friend of Schuffenecker, who was to become Gauguin's devoted champion in Tahiti. By late summer 1892 this painting was being displayed at Goupil's gallery in Paris.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=92, 136–138}} Art historian [[Nancy Mowll Mathews]] believes that Gauguin's encounter with exotic sensuality in Tahiti, so evident in the painting, was by far the most important aspect of his sojourn there.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=187}}

Gauguin was lent copies of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout|fr|3=Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout|lt=Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout's}} 1837 ''Voyage aux îles du Grand Océan'' and {{Interlanguage link multi|Edmond de Bovis|fr|3=Edmond de Bovis|lt=Edmond de Bovis'}} 1855 ''État de la société tahitienne à l'arrivée des Européens'', containing full accounts of Tahiti's forgotten culture and religion. He was fascinated by the accounts of ''[[Arioi]]'' society and their god [['Oro]]. Because these accounts contained no illustrations and the Tahitian models were in any case long disappeared, he could give free rein to his imagination. He executed some twenty paintings and a dozen woodcarvings over the next year. The first of these was ''Te aa no areois (The Seed of the Areoi)'', representing Oro's terrestrial wife Vairaumati, now held by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. His illustrated notebook of the time, ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Ancien Culte Mahorie|it}},'' is preserved in the Louvre and was published in facsimile form in 1951.{{sfn|Danielsson|1969|p=24}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=156}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=174}}

In all, Gauguin sent nine of his paintings to Monfreid in Paris. These were eventually exhibited in Copenhagen in a joint exhibition with the late Vincent van Gogh. Reports that they had been well received (though in fact only two of the Tahitian paintings were sold and his earlier paintings were unfavourably compared with van Gogh's) were sufficiently encouraging for Gauguin to contemplate returning with some seventy others he had completed.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=193}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=166}} He had in any case largely run out of funds, depending on a state grant for a free passage home. In addition he had some health problems diagnosed as heart problems by the local doctor, which Mathews suggests may have been the early signs of [[cardiovascular syphilis]].{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=188}}

Gauguin later wrote a travelogue (first published 1901) titled ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Noa Noa|ca}}'', originally conceived as commentary on his paintings and describing his experiences in Tahiti. Modern critics have suggested that the contents of the book were in part fantasized and plagiarized.&lt;ref name="www.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news  |first=Holland | title = The Self-Invented Artist| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/25/arts/design/25gaugin.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 | date =  | accessdate =9 December 2010 | work=[[The New York Times]] | last=Cotter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau pp. 326, 328&lt;/ref&gt; In it he revealed that he had at this time taken a thirteen-year-old girl as native wife or ''vahine'' (the [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] word for "woman"), a marriage contracted in the course of a single afternoon. This was [[Teha'amana]], called Tehura in the travelogue, who was pregnant by him by the end of summer 1892.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=179–182}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gauguin (1903) [https://archive.org/stream/noanoatranslated00gauguoft#page/62/mode/2up ''Noa Noa'' pp. 63–69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smart|first1=Alastair|title=Is it wrong to admire Paul Gauguin's art?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/8011066/Is-it-wrong-to-admire-Paul-Gauguins-art.html|issue=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WBubV1xh?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/8011066/Is-it-wrong-to-admire-Paul-Gauguins-art.html|archivedate=8 February 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=180|loc=Mathews notes that Gauguin certainly emphasised the youth of the girl for dramatic effect.

Mathews estimates it was probably adopted in keeping with Tahitian custom}} Teha'amana was the subject of several of Gauguin's paintings, including ''[[Merahi metua no Tehamana]]'' and the celebrated ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching]]'', as well as a notable woodcarving ''[[Tehura (woodcarving)|Tehura]]'' now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tehura|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/notice.html?nnumid=15289|website=musee-orsay.fr|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The theme of ''Oviri'' is death, savagery, wildness. Oviri stands over a dead she-wolf, while crushing the life out of her cub." Perhaps, as Gauguin wrote to [[Odilon Redon]], it is a matter of "not death in life but life in death".&lt;ref name= Orsay&gt;{{cite web|title=Oviri|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/sculpture/commentaire_id/oviri-11308.html?cHash=f88883513c|website=musee-orsay.fr|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dario Gamboni, {{Google books|v7fgpBJM_nQC|Potential Images: Ambiguity and Indeterminacy in Modern Art|page= 96|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In August 1893, Gauguin returned to France, where he continued to execute paintings on Tahitian subjects such as ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Mahana no atua|it|3=Giorno di dio}} (Day of the God)'' and ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Nave nave moe|pl|3= Nave nave moe}} (Sacred spring, sweet dreams)''.&lt;ref name="Examination"&gt;The Art Institute of Chicago. (2005). "Examination: Gauguin's Day of the God (Mahana No Atua)". Art Explorer. Retrieved 10 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=181}} An exhibition at the [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]] gallery in November 1894 was a moderate success, selling at quite elevated prices eleven of the forty paintings exhibited. He set up an apartment at 6 rue Vercingétorix on the edge of the [[Montparnasse]] district frequented by artists, and began to conduct a weekly ''[[Salon (gathering)|salon]]''. He affected an exotic ''persona'', dressing in Polynesian costume, and conducted a public affair with a young woman still in her teens, "half Indian, half Malayan", known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Annah the Javanese|ca|3=Annah la javanesa}}.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=197–199}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Gauguin's Faithless Javanese|magazine=[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]]|date=11 September 1950|url={{Google books|9U0EAAAAMBAJ|page=112|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the moderate success of his November exhibition, he subsequently lost Durand-Ruel's patronage in circumstances that are not clear. Mathews characterises this as a tragedy for Gauguin's career. Amongst other things he lost the chance of an introduction to the American market.&lt;ref&gt;Mathhews p.200&lt;/ref&gt; The start of 1894 found him preparing woodcuts using an experimental technique for his proposed travelogue ''Noa Noa''. He returned to Pont-Aven for the summer. In February 1895 he attempted an auction of his paintings at Hôtel Drouot in Paris, similar to the one of 1891, but this was not a success. The dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], however, showed his paintings at his gallery in March 1895, but they unfortunately did not come to terms at that date.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=208}}

He submitted a large ceramic sculpture he called ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' he had fired the previous winter to the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] 1895 ''salon'' opening in April.&lt;ref name="Orsay" /&gt; There are conflicting versions of how it was received: his biographer and ''Noa Noa'' collaborator, the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] poet {{Interlanguage link multi|Charles Morice (writer)|fr|3=Charles Morice|lt=Charles Morice}}, contended( 1920) the work was "literally expelled" from the exhibition, while Vollard said (1937) the work was only admitted when Chaplet threatened to withdraw all his own work.&lt;ref&gt;Frèches-Thory p. 372 n. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Gauguin took the opportunity to increase his public exposure by writing an outraged letter on the state of modern ceramics to ''[[Le Soir]]''.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=208–209}}

By this time it had become clear that he and his wife Mette were irrevocably separated. Although there had been hopes of a reconciliation, they had quickly quarrelled over money matters and neither visited the other. Gauguin initially refused to share any part of a 13,000-franc inheritance from his uncle Isidore he had come into shortly after returning. Mette was eventually gifted 1,500 francs, but she was outraged and from that point on kept in contact with him only through Schuffenhecker, doubly galling for Gauguin as his friends thus knew the true extent of his betrayal.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=194, 210}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=182}}

By mid 1895 attempts to raise funds for Gauguin's return to Tahiti had failed, and he began accepting charity from friends.  In June 1895 [[Eugene Carriere]] arranged a cheap passage back to Tahiti, and Gauguin never saw Europe again.&lt;ref&gt;Wright p.194-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residence in Tahiti ===

Note the sculpture of a nude woman.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=230|loc=Mathews records an anecdote that a Catholic priest asked him to remove a provocative sculpture of a nude woman from his grounds. Not only did Gauguin refuse, but he threatened to sue the priest. In a note (n. 71) Mathews casts doubt on the source of the story because she can't find a record for the priest named as Michel Béchu, but the priest in question would appear to be Léonard Pierre Béchu, originally entered as "Michel" in cathedral records}}]]
Gauguin set out for Tahiti again on 28 June 1895. His return is characterised by Thomson as an essentially negative one, his disillusionment with the Paris art scene compounded by two attacks on him in the same issue of ''[[Mercure de France]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mercure de France|date=June 1895|author= Emile Bernard|title= Lettre ouverte à M. Camille Mauclair|pages=332–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Mercure de France|date=June 1895|author= Camille Mauclair|title= Choses d'art|page=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; one by [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Emile Bernard]], the other by [[Camille Mauclair]]. Mathews remarks that his isolation in Paris had become so bitter that he had no choice but to try to reclaim his place in Tahiti society.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=185–186}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=209–210}}

He arrived in September 1895 and was to spend the next six years living, for the most part, an apparently comfortable life as an artist-''[[:Wiktionary:colon#Etymology 3|colon]]'' near, or at times in, Papeete. During this time he was able to support himself with an increasingly steady stream of sales and the support of friends and well-wishers, though there was a period of time 1898–1899 when he felt compelled to take a desk job in Papeete, of which there is not much record. He built a spacious reed and thatch house at [[Punaauia]] in an affluent area ten miles east of Papeete, settled by wealthy families, in which he installed a large studio, sparing no expense. Jules Agostini, an acquaintance of Gauguin's and an accomplished amateur photographer, [[:Commons:File:Agostini – Tahiti, plate page 0080.png|photographed the house]] in 1896.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=215}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jules Agostini, fonctionnaire et photographe|url=http://histoire.assemblee.pf/articles.php?id=332|website=histoire.assemblee.pf|publisher=Histoire de l'Assemblée de la Polynésie française|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WXLaP9m0?url=http://histoire.assemblee.pf/articles.php?id=332|archivedate=22 February 2015|deadurl=no|language=French|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|geyMBgAAQBAJ|Antimodernism and Artistic Experience: Policing the Boundaries of Modernity|page=PT6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later a sale of land obliged him to build a new one in the same neighbourhood.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=188}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=212–213}}

He maintained a [[Trap (carriage)|horse and trap]], so was in a position to travel daily to Papeete to participate in the social life of the colony should he wish. He subscribed to the ''Mercure de France'' (indeed was a shareholder), by then France's foremost critical journal, and kept up an active correspondence with fellow artists, dealers, critics, and patrons in Paris.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=214–215}} During his year in Papeete and thereafter, he played an increasing role in local politics, contributing abrasively to a local journal opposed to the colonial government, ''Les Guêpes (The Wasps)'', that had recently been formed, and eventually edited his own monthly publication ''[[Le Sourire|Le Sourire: Journal sérieux]] (The Smile: A Serious Newspaper)'', later titled simply ''Journal méchant (A Wicked Newspaper)''.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=232–235}} A certain amount of artwork and woodcuts from his newspaper survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Head Piece for "Le Sourire" (Monkey—Caricature of Governor Gallet)|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/66094|website=artic.edu|publisher=[[Art Institute of Chicago]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1900 he became the editor of ''Les Guêpes'' itself, for which he drew a salary, and he continued as editor until he left Tahiti in September 1901. The paper under his editorship was noted for its scurrilous attacks on the governor and officialdom in general, but was not in fact a champion of native causes, although perceived as such nevertheless.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=233}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=223–226}}

For the first year at least he produced no paintings, informing Monfreid that he proposed henceforth to concentrate on sculpture. Few of his wooden carvings from this period survive, most of them collected by Monfreid. Thomson cites ''Oyez Hui Iesu (Christ on the Cross)'', a wooden cylinder half a metre tall featuring a curious hybrid of religious motifs. The cylinder may have been inspired by similar symbolic carvings in Brittany, such as at [[Pleumeur-Bodou]], where [[:commons:File:Menhir von St. Uzec.jpg|ancient menhirs have been Christianised]] by local craftsmen.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=188–190}} When he resumed painting, it was to continue his long-standing series of sexually charged nudes in paintings such as ''Te tamari no atua (Son of God)'' and ''O Taiti (Nevermore)''. Thomson observes a progression in complexity.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=190}} Mathews notes a return to Christian symbolism that would have endeared him to the colonists of the time, now anxious to preserve what was left of native culture by stressing the universality of religious principles. In these paintings, Gauguin was addressing an audience amongst his fellow colonists in Papeete, not his former ''avant-garde'' audience in Paris.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=217–219}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nikkah|first1=Roya|title=Gauguin's Nevermore voted Britain's most romantic painting|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/7231391/Gauguins-Nevermore-voted-Britains-most-romantic-painting.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=[[Daily Telegraph]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WXpg8tK1?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/7231391/Gauguins-Nevermore-voted-Britains-most-romantic-painting.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His health took a decided turn for the worse and he was hospitalised several times for a variety of ailments. While he was in France, he had his ankle shattered in a drunken brawl on a seaside visit to [[Concarneau]].{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=163}} The injury, an [[bone fracture|open fracture]], never healed properly. Now painful and debilitating sores that restricted his movement were erupting up and down his legs. These were treated with arsenic. Gauguin blamed the tropical climate and described the sores as "eczema", but his biographers agree this must have been the progress of syphilis.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=188}}{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=222–223}}{{efn|There is no direct evidence that Gauguin suffered from syphilis and none that he infected any of his lovers, as is sometimes asserted.&lt;ref name=Rodgers&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodgers|first1=Paul|title=Gauguin's British relative disputes artist's notoriety|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/gauguins-british-relative-disputes-artists-notoriety-2191988.html|website=independent.co.uk|publisher=[[The Independent]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WLT0UBhi?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/gauguins-british-relative-disputes-artists-notoriety-2191988.html|archivedate=14 February 2015|date=23 January 2011|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In April 1897 he received word that his favorite daughter Aline had died from pneumonia. This was also the month he learned he had to vacate his house because its land had been sold. He took out a bank loan to build a much more extravagant wooden house with beautiful views of the mountains and sea. But he overextended himself in so doing, and by the end of the year faced the real prospect of his bank foreclosing on him.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=193–195}} Failing health and pressing debts brought him to the brink of despair. At the end of the year he completed his monumental ''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', which he regarded as his masterpiece and final artistic testament (in a letter to Monfreid he explained that he tried to kill himself after finishing it).{{sfn|Thomson|1987|pp=194–200}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=225–229}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n103/mode/2up|title=The Letters of Paul Gauguin to Georges Daniel de Monfreid – Letter XXXI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was exhibited at Vollard's gallery in November the following year, along with eight thematically related paintings he had completed by July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gauguin – Tahiti, The Workshop of the Tropics|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/archives/exhibitions-archives/browse/16/article/gauguin-tahiti-latelier-des-tropiques-4206.html?S=&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=252&amp;cHash=f5ab50f1b9&amp;print=1&amp;no_cache=1&amp;|website=musee-orsay.fr|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was his first major exhibition in Paris since his Durand-Ruel show in 1893 and it was a decided success, critics praising his new serenity. ''Where do we come from?'', however, received mixed reviews and Vollard had difficulty selling it. He eventually sold it in 1901 for 2,500 francs (about $10,000 in year 2000 US dollars) to {{Interlanguage link multi|Gabriel Frizeau|fr}}, of which Vollard's commission was perhaps as much as 500 francs.

Georges Chaudet, Gauguin's Paris dealer, died in the fall of 1899. Vollard had been buying Gauguin's paintings through Chaudet and now made an agreement with Gauguin directly.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Mowll Mathews|Mathews, Nancy Mowll]]. (2001) ''Paul Gauguin, an Erotic Life''. New Haven, Connecticut: [[Yale University Press]], pp. 225–9.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=194-200}} The agreement provided Gauguin a regular monthly advance of 300 francs against a guaranteed purchase of at least 25 unseen paintings a year at 200 francs each, and in addition Vollard undertook to provide him with his art materials. There were some initial problems on both sides, but Gauguin was finally able to realise his long cherished plan of resettling in the [[Marquesas Islands]] in search of a yet more primitive society. He spent his final months in Tahiti living in considerable comfort, as attested by the liberality with which he entertained his friends at that time.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=227–228}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=234}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Rewald|title=The genius and the dealer|journal=[[Art News]]|date=May 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin was unable to continue his work in ceramics in the islands for the simple reason that suitable clay was not available.{{sfn|Danielsson|1969|p=18}} Similarly, without access to a printing press (''Le Sourire'' was [[hectograph]]ed),{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=209}} he was obliged to turn to the [[monotype]] process in his graphic work.&lt;ref name=Metamorphoses&gt;{{cite web|title=Gauguin: Metamorphoses|url=http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2014/gauguin/home|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150227064259/http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2014/gauguin/home|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-02-27|website=moma.org|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving examples of these prints are rather rare and command very high prices in the saleroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Truong|first1=Alain R.|title=Record for Any Paul Gauguin Print Sold at Auction Established Today at Sotheby's|url=http://www.alaintruong.com/archives/2011/03/31/20773802.html|website=alaintruong.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WYXgSIr4?url=http://www.alaintruong.com/archives/2011/03/31/20773802.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|deadurl=no|date=31 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin's ''vahine'' during all this time was Pahura (Pau'ura) a Tai, the daughter of neighbours in Punaauia and aged fourteen and a half when he took her in.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=182}} She gave him two children, of which a daughter died in infancy. The other, a boy, she raised herself. His descendants still inhabited Tahiti at the time of Mathews' biography. Pahura refused to accompany Gauguin to the Marquesas away from her family in Punaauia (earlier she had left him when he took work in Papeete just 10 miles away).{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=228}} When the English writer [[W. Somerset Maugham|Willam Somerset Maugham]] visited her in 1917, she could offer him no useful memory of Gauguin and chided him for visiting her without bringing money from Gauguin's family.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=213–214}}

Gauguin had nurtured his plan of settling in the Marquesas ever since seeing a collection of intricately carved Marquesan bowls and weapons in Papeete during his first months in Tahiti.{{sfn|Danielsson|1969|p=25}} However, he found a society that, as in Tahiti, had lost its cultural identity. Of all the Pacific island groups, the Marquesas were the most affected by the import of Western diseases (especially [[tuberculosis]]).&lt;ref name= newadvent /&gt; An eighteenth century population of some 80,000 had declined to just 4,000.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=232}} Catholic missionaries held sway and, in their effort to control drunkenness and promiscuity, obliged all native children to attend missionary schools into their teens. French colonial rule was enforced by a [[gendarmerie]] noted for its malevolence and stupidity, while traders, both western and Chinese, exploited the natives appallingly.{{sfn|Danielsson|1969|p=26}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=234}}

Gauguin settled in [[Atuona]] on the island of [[Hiva-Oa]], arriving 16 September 1901.{{efn| Danielsson (1965, p. 235) notes that the day before his boat had put in at [[Nuku Hiva]] island, scene of [[Herman Melville]]'s celebrated ''[[Typee]]'' some 60 years earlier, championing exactly the sort of primitive society for which Gauguin yearned. However, Gauguin was apparently unaware of Melville's book.}} This was the administrative capital of the island group, but considerably less developed than Papeete although there was an efficient and regular steamer service between the two. There was a military doctor but no hospital. The doctor was relocated to Papeete the following February and thereafter Gauguin had to rely on the island's two health care workers, the Vietnamese exile Nguyen Van Cam (Ky Dong), who had settled on the island but had no formal medical training, and the Protestant pastor Paul Vernier, who had studied medicine in addition to theology.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=249}}{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=235–236}} Both of these were to become close friends.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=236, 250}}

He bought a plot of land in the center of the town from the Catholic mission, having first ingratiated himself with the local bishop by attending mass regularly. This bishop was Monseigneur Joseph Martin, initially well disposed to Gauguin because he was aware that Gauguin had sided with the Catholic party in Tahiti in his journalism.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=239}}

[[File:Paul Gauguin - Père Paillard - NGA 1963.10.238.jpg|thumb|''Père Paillard (Father Lechery)'', 1902, [[National Gallery of Art]]. Gauguin's lampoon of Bishop Martin.]]
Gauguin built a two-floor house on his plot, sturdy enough to survive a later cyclone which washed away most other dwellings in the town. He was helped in the task by the two best Marquesan carpenters on the island, one of them called Tioka, tattooed from head to toe in the traditional Marquesan way (a tradition suppressed by the missionaries). Tioka was a deacon in Vernier's congregation and became Gauguin's neighbour after the cyclone when Gauguin gifted him a corner of his plot. The ground floor was open-air and used for dining and living, while the top floor was used for sleeping and as his studio. The door to the top floor was decorated with a polychrome wood-carved lintel and jambs that still survive in museums. The lintel named the house as ''Maison du Jouir'' (i.e. ''House of Pleasure''), while the jambs echoed his earlier 1889 wood-carving ''[[Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses]]'' (i.e. ''Be in Love, You Will Be Happy''). The walls were decorated with, amongst other things, his prized collection of forty-five pornographic photographs he had purchased in Port Said on his way out from France.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=238}} In the early days at least, until Gauguin found a ''vahine'', the house drew appreciative crowds in the evenings from the natives, who came to stare at the pictures and party half the night away.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=240}} Needless to say, all this did not endear Gauguin to the bishop, still less when Gauguin erected two sculptures he placed at the foot of his steps lampooning the bishop and a servant reputed to be the bishop's mistress,{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=256}} and yet still less when Gauguin later attacked the unpopular missionary school system.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture of the bishop, ''Père Paillard'', is to be found at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, while its pendant piece ''Thérèse'' realized a record $30,965,000 for a Gauguin sculpture at a Christie's New York 2015 sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/features/modigliani-nu-couche-reclining-nude-leads-a-night-of-records-in-new-york-6782-3.aspx ''Modigliani’s Nu couché (Reclining Nude) leads a night of records in New York''], Christie's New York, 10 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/sculptures-statues-figures/paul-gauguin-therese-5946111-details.aspx?from=salesummary&amp;intObjectID=5946111&amp;sid=5d33e98a-1288-4c63-8fef-f82544cbfbe3 Paul Gauguin, ''Thérèse''], Christie's New York, 9 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; These were among at least eight sculptures that adorned the house according to a posthumous inventory, most of which are lost today.

State funding for the missionary schools had ceased as a result of the [[Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau#Associations Bill of 1901|1901 Associations Bill]] promulgated throughout the French empire.&lt;ref name= newadvent&gt;web Catholic encyclopaedia&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=239}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vicariate Apostolic of Marquesas Islands|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09688a.htm|website=newadvent.org|publisher=[[New Advent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools continued with difficulty as private institutions, but these difficulties were compounded when Gauguin established that attendance at any given school was only compulsory within a catchment area of some two and a half miles radius. This led to numerous teenage daughters being withdrawn from the schools (Gauguin called this process "rescuing"). He took as ''vahine'' one such girl, Vaeoho (also called Marie-Rose), the fourteen-year-old daughter of a native couple who lived in an adjoining valley six miles distant.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=240–241}} This can scarcely have been a pleasant task for her as Gauguin's sores were by then extremely noxious and required daily dressing.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|pp=235–236}} Nevertheless, she lived willingly with him and the following year gave birth to a healthy daughter whose descendants continue to live on the island.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=241}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=255}}

[[File:Paul Gauguin - Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa.jpg|thumb|''Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa (Marquesan Man in a Red Cape)'', 1902, Musée d'art moderne et d'art contemporain de Liège]]
By November he had settled into his new home with Vaeoho, a cook (Kahui), two other servants (nephews of Tioka), his dog, Pegau (a play on his initials ''PG''), and a cat. The house itself, although in the center of the town, was set amongst trees and secluded from view. The partying ceased and he began a period of productive work, sending twenty canvases to Vollard the following April.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=241–255}} He had thought he would find new motifs in the Marquesas, writing to Monfreid:&lt;ref name =S243&gt;Szech p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n151/mode/2up Monfreid ''LII'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text= I think in the Marquesas, where it is easy to find models (a thing that is growing more and more difficult in Tahiti), and with new country to explore – with new and more savage subject matter in brief – that I shall do beautiful things.

Thus, in the second of two versions of ''Cavaliers sur la Plage (Riders on the Beach)'', gathering clouds and foamy breakers suggest an impending storm while the two distant figures on grey horses echo similar figures in other paintings that are taken to symbolise death.&lt;ref name =S243 /&gt;

Gauguin chose to paint landscapes, still lifes, and figure studies at this time, with an eye to Vollard's clientele, avoiding the primitive and lost paradise themes of his Tahiti paintings.&lt;ref name= C312&gt;Childs p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; But there is a significant trio of pictures from this last period that suggest deeper concerns. The first two of these are ''Jeune fille à l'éventail (Young Girl with Fan)'' and  ''Le Sorcier d'Hiva Oa (Marquesan Man in a Red Cape)''. The model for ''Jeune fille'' was the red-headed Tohotaua, the daughter of a chieftain on a neighbouring island. The portrait appears to have been taken from [[:commons: File:Louis Grelet – Tohotaua.jpg|a photograph that Vernier later sent to Vollard]]. The model for ''Le sorcier'' may have been Haapuani, an accomplished dancer as well as a feared magician, who was a close friend of Gauguin's and, according to Danielsson, married to Tohotau.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=244}} Szech notes that the white color of Tohotau's dress is a symbol of power and death in Polynesian culture, the sitter doing duty for a [[Maohi]] culture as a whole threatened with extinction.&lt;ref name =S243 /&gt; ''Le Sorcier'' appears to have been executed at the same time and depicts a long-haired young man wearing an exotic red cape. The [[androgynous]] nature of the image has attracted critical attention, giving rise to speculation that Gauguin intended to depict a ''[[māhū]]'' (i.e. a [[third gender]] person) rather than a ''taua'' or priest.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=243}}&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman pp. 140–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Llosa|first1=Mario Vargas|authorlink1=Mario Vargas Llosa|title=The men-women of the Pacific|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/men-women-pacific|website=tate.org.uk|publisher=[[Tate Britain]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WpIsllud?url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/men-women-pacific|archivedate=6 March 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third picture of the trio is the mysterious and beautiful ''Contes barbares (Primitive Tales)'' featuring Tohotau again at the right. The left figure is [[Meijer de Haan|Jacob Meyer de Haan]], a painter friend of Gauguin's from their Pont-Aven days who had died a few years previously, while the middle figure is again androgynous, identified by some as Haapuani. The Buddha-like pose and the lotus blossoms suggests to Elizabeth Childs that the picture is a meditation on the perpetual cycle of life and the possibility of rebirth.&lt;ref name= C312 /&gt; As these paintings reached Vollard after Gauguin's sudden death, nothing is known about Gauguin's intentions in their execution.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=246}}

In March 1902, the governor of French Polynesia, {{Interlanguage link multi|Édouard Petit|fr|3=Édouard Petit (écrivain)}}, arrived in the Marquesas to make an inspection. He was accompanied by Édouard Charlier as head of the judicial system. Charlier was an amateur painter who had been befriended by Gauguin when he first arrived as magistrate at Papeete in 1895.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=179}} However their relationship had turned to enmity when Charlier refused to prosecute Gauguin's then ''vahine'' Pau'ura for a number of trivial offences, allegedly housebreaking and theft, she had committed at Punaauia while Gauguin was away working in Papeete. Gauguin had gone so far as to publish an open letter attacking Charlier about the affair in ''Les Guêpes''.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=211}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=212}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=213}} Petit, presumably suitably forewarned, refused to see Gauguin to deliver the settlers' protests (Gauguin their spokesman) about the invidious taxation system, which saw most revenue from the Marquesas spent in Papeete.  Gauguin responded in April by refusing to pay his taxes and encouraging the settlers, traders and planters, to do likewise.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=248}}

At around the same time, Gauguin's health began to deteriorate again, revisited by the same familiar constellation of symptoms involving pain in the legs, heart palpitations, and general debility. The pain in his injured ankle grew insupportable and in July he was obliged to order a [[Trap (carriage)|trap]] from Papeete so that he could get about town.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=249}} By September the pain was so extreme that he resorted to [[morphine]] injections. However he was sufficiently concerned by the habit he was developing to turn his syringe set over to a neighbour, relying instead on [[laudanum]]. His sight was also beginning to fail him, as attested by the spectacles he wears in his last known self-portrait. This was actually a portrait commenced by his friend Ky Dong that he completed himself, thus accounting for its uncharacteristic style.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=258}} It shows a man tired and aged, yet not entirely defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-portrait with glasses, 1903 – Paul Gauguin: Self-Portraits at the Tate Modern|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/8008607/Paul-Gauguin-Self-Portraits-at-the-Tate-Modern.html?image=6|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while he considered returning to Europe, to Spain, to get treatment. Monfreid advised him:{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=258–259}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n179/mode/2up|title=The Letters of Paul Gauguin to Georges Daniel de Monfreid – O'Brien (letters to Monfreid) |page=160|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|text= In returning you will risk damaging that process of incubation which is taking place in the public's appreciation of you.

In July 1902, Vaeoho, by then seven months pregnant, left Gauguin to return home to her neighbouring valley of Hekeani to have her baby amongst family and friends. She gave birth in September, but did not return. Gauguin did not subsequently take another ''vahine''. It was at this time that his quarrel with Bishop Martin over missionary schools reached its height. The local gendarme Désiré Charpillet, at first friendly to Gauguin, wrote a report to the administrator of the island group, who resided on the neighbouring island of [[Nuku Hiva]], criticising Gauguin for encouraging natives to withdraw their children from school as well as encouraging settlers to withhold payment of their taxes. As luck would have it, the post of administrator had recently been filled by François Picquenot, an old friend of Gauguin's from Tahiti and essentially sympathetic to him. Picquenot advised Charpillet not to take any action over the schools issue, since Gauguin had the law on his side, but authorised Charpillet to seize goods from Gauguin in lieu of payment of taxes if all else failed.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=255–258}} Possibly prompted by loneliness, and at times unable to paint, Gauguin took to writing.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=202}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=259}}

In 1901, the manuscript of ''Noa Noa'' that Gauguin had prepared along with woodcuts during his interlude in France was finally published with Morice's poems in book form in the ''[[La Plume]]'' edition (the manuscript itself is now lodged in the Louvre museum). Sections of it (including his account of Teha'amana) had previously been published without woodcuts in 1897 in ''[[La Revue Blanche]]'', while he himself had published extracts in ''Les Guêpes'' while he was editor. The ''La Plume'' edition was planned to include his woodcuts, but he withheld permission to print them on smooth paper as the publishers wished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Noa Noa|url=http://data.bnf.fr/12079829/paul_gauguin_noa_noa/|website=bnf.fr|publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In truth he had grown disinterested in the venture with Morice and never saw a copy, declining an offer of one hundred complimentary copies.&lt;ref&gt;Goddard p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, its publication inspired him to consider writing other books.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=247}} At the beginning of the year (1902), he had revised an old 1896–97 manuscript ''L'Esprit Moderne et le Catholicisme (The Modern Spirit and Catholicism)'' on the Roman Catholic church, adding some twenty pages containing insights gleaned from his dealings with Bishop Martin. He sent this text to Bishop Martin, who responded by sending him an illustrated history of the church. Gauguin returned the book with critical remarks he later published in his autobiographical reminisces.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=259–262}}&lt;ref&gt;Gauguin (1921) {{Google books|vQsLza-zO10C|Intimate Journals|page= 87|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He next prepared a witty and well-documented essay ''Racontars de Rapin (Tales of a Dabbler)'' on critics and art criticism, which he sent for publication to [[André Fontainas]], art critic at the ''Mercure de France'' whose favourable review of ''Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?'' had done much to restore his reputation. Fontainas, however, replied that he dared not publish it. It was not subsequently published until 1951.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=247}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=262}}&lt;ref&gt;Gauguin [https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n183/mode/2up Letter ''LXI'' to Monfreid]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racontars de Rapindata|url=http://data.bnf.fr/13021324/paul_gauguin_racontars_de_rapin/|website=bnf.fr|publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bertrand|first1=Anne|title=Gauguin le rapin : ""Racontars de rapin, suivi de Art de Papou &amp; chant de Rossignoou"" et ""La lutte pour les peintres""|url=http://www.liberation.fr/livres/1995/02/02/gauguin-le-rapin-racontars-de-rapin-suivi-de-art-de-papou-chant-de-rossignoou-et-la-lutte-pour-les-p_124875|website=liberation.fr|publisher=[[Libération]]|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 May that year, the steamer service ''Croix du Sud'' was shipwrecked off the [[Apataki]] atoll and for a period of three months the island was left without mail or supplies.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=252}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand|url=http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/unionnz.shtml|website=theshipslist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mail service resumed, Gauguin penned an angry attack on Governor Petit in an open letter, complaining amongst other things about the way they had been abandoned following the shipwreck. The letter was published by ''L'Indepéndant'', the successor newspaper to ''Les Guêpes'', that November in Papeete. Petit had in fact followed an independent and pro-native policy, to the disappointment of the Roman Catholic Party, and the newspaper was preparing an attack on him. Gauguin also sent the letter to ''Mercure de France'', which published a redacted version of it after his death.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=262}} He followed this with a private letter to the head of the ''gendarmerie'' in Papeete, complaining about his own local gendarme Charpillet's excesses in making prisoners labour for him. Danielsson notes that, while these and similar complaints were well-founded, the motivation for them all was wounded vanity and simple animosity. As it happened, the relatively supportive Charpillet was replaced that December by another gendarme Jean-Paul Claverie from Tahiti, much less well disposed to Gauguin and who in fact had fined him in his earliest Mataiea days for public indecency, having caught him bathing naked in a local stream following complaints from the missionaries there.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=264}}

His health further deteriorated in December to the extent that he was scarcely able to paint. He began an autobiographical memoir he called ''[[Avant et après]] (Before and After)'' (published in translation in the US as ''Intimate Journals''), which he completed over the next two months.&lt;ref name="Avant et après"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://archive.org/details/avanteta00gaug|title = Avant et après: avec les vingt-sept dessins du manuscrit original (1923)|publisher  = [[Internet Archive]]|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was supposed to reflect his experiences before and after coming to Tahiti and as tribute to his own grandmother's unpublished memoir ''Past and Future''. His memoir proved to be a fragmented collection of observations about life in Polynesia, his own life, and comments on literature and paintings. He included in it attacks on subjects as diverse as the local ''gendarmerie'', Bishop Martin, his wife Mette and the [[Danes]] in general, and concluded with a description of his personal philosophy conceiving life as an [[existential]] struggle to reconcile opposing binaries.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=247-252}}{{efn| In his 2008 book ''Revelation of Modernism: Responses to Cultural Crises in Fin-de-Siècle Painting'', [[Albert Boime]] argued that Gauguin was influenced by the French occult author [[Eliphas Levi]] and develops the thesis that Gauguin's primitivism proved inseparable from his ethnic prejudices and actually contributed to the anti-modernist rejection of modernism, turning it into an ideological weapon again democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|WJRAI0pLBEYC|Revelation of Modernism: Responses to Cultural Crises in Fin-de-sie`cle Painting|page=160|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mansfield|first1=Elizabeth|title=Albert Boime|url=http://www.19thc-artworldwide.org/spring09/56-spring09/spring09review/70-art-in-an-age-of-civil-struggle-1848-1871-and-revelation-of-modernism-responses-to-cultural-crises-in-fin-de-siecle-painting-both-by-albert-boime|website=19thc-artworldwide.org|publisher=[[Association of Historians of Nineteenth-Century Art]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Mathews notes two closing remarks as a distillation of his philosophy:{{Quote|text= No one is good; no one is evil; everyone is both, in the same way and in different ways. … &lt;br /&gt;It is so small a thing, the life of a man, and yet there is time to do great things, fragments of the common task.|sign= Paul Gauguin|source= ''Intimate Journals'', 1903&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|vEs3AQAAMAAJ|Intimate Journals|page=178|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He sent the manuscript to Fontainas for editing, but the rights reverted to Mette after Gauguin's death and it was not published until 1918 (in a facsimile edition), the American translation appearing in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Gauguin : Avant et après.

=== Death ===
[[File:Oviri on the Tomb of Gauguin.jpg|thumb|''Oviri'' figure on Gauguin's grave in [[Calvary Cemetery, Atuona|Atuona]].]]
At the beginning of 1903, Gauguin engaged in a campaign designed to expose the incompetence of the island's gendarmes,  in particular Jean-Paul Claverie, for taking the side of the natives directly in a case involving the alleged drunkenness of a group of them.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gauguin, {{Google books|PvLDAgAAQBAJ|Intimate Journals|page=68|plainurl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claverie, however, escaped censure. At the beginning of February, Gauguin wrote to the administrator, François Picquenot, alleging corruption by one of Claverie's subordinates. Picquenot investigated the allegations but could not substantiate them. Claverie responded by filing a charge of libeling a gendarme against Gauguin, who was subsequently fined 500 francs and sentenced to three months' imprisonment by the local magistrate on 27 March 1903. Gauguin immediately filed an appeal in Papeete and set about raising the funds to travel to Papeete to hear his appeal.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|pp=271–274}}

At this time he was very weak and in great pain. He resorted once again to using morphine. He died suddenly on the morning of 8 May 1903.

Earlier, he had sent for his pastor Paul Vernier, complaining of fainting fits. They had chatted together and Vernier had left, believing him in a stable condition. However Gauguin's neighbour Tioka found him dead at 11 o'clock, confirming the fact in the traditional Marquesan way by chewing his head in an attempt to revive him. By his bedside was an empty bottle of [[laudanum]], which has given rise to speculation that he was the victim of an overdose.{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=274}}{{sfn|Danielsson|1965|p=275}} Vernier believed he died of a heart attack.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=257}}

Gauguin was buried in the Catholic [[Calvary Cemetery, Atuona|Calvary Cemetery]] (Cimetière Calvaire), [[Atuona]], Hiva 'Oa, at 2 p.m. the next day. In 1973, a bronze cast of his ''Oviri'' figure was placed on his grave, as he had indicated was his wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n145/mode/2up|title=The Letters of Paul Gauguin to Georges Daniel de Monfreid – Monfreid XLVIII|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically his nearest neighbour in the cemetery is Bishop Martin, his grave surmounted by a large white cross.  Vernier wrote an account of Gauguin's last days and burial, reproduced in O'Brien's edition of Gauguin's letters to Monfreid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/letterspaulgaug00gauggoog#page/n193/mode/2up|title=The Letters of Paul Gauguin to Georges Daniel de Monfreid|pages=172–6|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Word of Gauguin's death did not reach France (to Monfreid) until 23 August 1903. In the absence of a will, his less valuable effects were auctioned in Atuona while his letters, manuscripts and paintings were auctioned in Papeete on 5 September 1903. Mathews notes that this speedy dispersal of his effects led to the loss of much valuable information about his later years. Thomson notes that the auction inventory of his effects (some of which were burned as pornography) revealed a life that was not as impoverished or primitive as he had liked to maintain.{{sfn|Thomson|1987|p=204}} Mette Gauguin in due course received the proceeds of the auction, some 4,000 francs.{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=255}} One of the paintings auctioned in Papeete was ''Maternité II'', a smaller version of ''Maternité I'' in the Hermitage Museum. The original was painted at the time his then ''vahine'' Pau'ura in Punaauia gave birth to their son Emile. It is not known why he painted the smaller copy. It was sold for 150 francs to a French naval officer, Commandant Cochin, who said that Governor Petit himself had bid up to 135 francs for the painting. It was sold at Sotheby's for US$39,208,000 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sotheby's Impressionist &amp; Modern Art, Part One New York 04 Nov 2004|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.pdf.N08022.html/f/15/N08022-15.pdf|website=sothebys.com|publisher=[[Sotheby's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Paul Gauguin Cultural Center]] at Atuona has a reconstruction of the ''Maison du Jouir''. The original house stood empty for a few years, the door still carrying Gauguin's carved lintel. This was eventually recovered, four of the five pieces held at the Musée D'Orsay and the fifth at the [[Paul Gauguin Museum (Tahiti)|Paul Gauguin Museum]] in Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bois de la Maison du Jouir [Sculpted wood from the Maison du Jouir]|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/search/commentaire/commentaire_id/bois-de-la-maison-du-jouir-7099.html?no_cache=1|website=musee-orsay.fr|publisher=[[Musée D'Orsay]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, forensic examination of four teeth found in a glass jar in a well near Gauguin's house threw into question the conventional belief that Gauguin had suffered from syphilis. DNA examination established that the teeth were almost certainly Gauguin's, but no traces were found of the mercury that was used to treat syphilis at the time, suggesting either that Gauguin did not suffer from syphilis or that he was not being treated for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey|first=Martin|title=Gauguin could be cleared of syphilis—by the skin of his teeth|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Gauguin-could-be-cleared-of-syphilisby-the-skin-of-his-teeth/31842|publisher=[[The Art Newspaper]]|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meier|first1=Allison|title=Posthumous Prognosis for Supposedly Syphilitic Gauguin, via His Teeth|url=http://hyperallergic.com/111730/posthumous-prognosis-for-supposedly-syphilitic-gauguin-via-his-teeth/|website=hyperallergic.com|publisher=[[Hyperallergic]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6WDJOMl2Z?url=http://hyperallergic.com/111730/posthumous-prognosis-for-supposedly-syphilitic-gauguin-via-his-teeth/|archivedate=9 February 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children ===
Gauguin outlived three of his children; his favorite daughter Aline died of pneumonia, his son Clovis died of a blood infection following a hip operation,&lt;ref name=swain1965&gt;Harrison Swain "Emile Gauguin Honor Guest at Artists' Ball" in [[The Evening Independent]] 26 January 1965, pp. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and a daughter, whose birth was portrayed in Gauguin's painting of 1896 ''[[Te tamari no atua]]'', the child of Gauguin's young Tahitian mistress Pau'ura, died only a few days after her birth on Christmas Day 1896.&lt;ref name=1896birth&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2006 |title= God's Child: Private Life of a Masterpiece |url=http://ffh.films.com/ecTitleDetail.aspx?TitleID=33301 |accessdate= |format=FLV |location= |publisher=[[BBC]] |id= |isbn=978-0-8160-9539-1 |ref= BVL57644 |series=[[The Private Life of a Masterpiece]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His son Émile Gauguin worked as a construction engineer in the U.S. and is buried in Lemon Bay Historical Cemetery, in Florida. Another son, [[Jean René Gauguin|Jean René]], became a well-known sculptor and a staunch socialist. He died on 21 April 1961 in Copenhagen. [[Pola Gauguin|Pola]] (Paul Rollon) became an artist and art critic and wrote a memoir, ''My Father, Paul Gauguin'' (1937). Gauguin had several other children by his mistresses: Germaine (born 1891) with Juliette Huais (1866–1955); Émile Marae a Tai (born 1899) with Pau'ura; and a daughter (born 1902) with Mari-Rose. There is some speculation that the Belgian artist Germaine Chardon was Gauguin's daughter. Emile Marae a Tai, illiterate and raised in Tahiti by Pau'ura, was brought to Chicago in 1963 by the French journalist Josette Giraud and was an artist in his own right, his descendants still living in Tahiti as of 2001.&lt;ref name=swain1965 /&gt;{{sfn|Mathews|2001|p=213}}

== Historical significance ==
[[Primitivism]] was an art movement of late 19th-century painting and sculpture, characterized by exaggerated body proportions, animal totems, geometric designs and stark contrasts. The first artist to systematically use these effects and achieve broad public success was Paul Gauguin.&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European cultural elite discovering the art of Africa, Micronesia, and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for the first time were fascinated, intrigued and educated by the newness, wildness and the stark power embodied in the art of those faraway places. Like [[Pablo Picasso]] in the early days of the 20th century, Gauguin was inspired and motivated by the raw power and simplicity of the so-called [[Primitive culture|Primitive]] art of those foreign cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin is also considered a [[Post-Impressionist]] painter. His bold, colorful and design oriented paintings significantly influenced [[Modern art]]. Artists and movements in the early 20th century inspired by him include [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]] and [[orphism (art)|Orphism]], among others. Later he influenced [[Arthur Frank Mathews]] and the American [[Arts and Crafts Movement]].

[[John Rewald]], recognized as a foremost authority on late 19th-century art, wrote a series of books about the Post-Impressionist period, including ''Post-Impressionism: From Van Gogh to Gauguin'' (1956) and an essay, ''Paul Gauguin: Letters to Ambroise Vollard and André Fontainas'' (included in Rewald's ''Studies in Post-Impressionism'', 1986), discusses Gauguin's years in Tahiti, and the struggles of his survival as seen through correspondence with the art dealer Vollard and others.&lt;ref&gt;John Rewald, (1986). ''Studies in Post-Impressionism,'' ''Paul Gauguin–Letters to [[Ambroise Vollard]] and Andre Fontainas'', 168–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on Picasso ==

Gauguin's posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 had a stunning and powerful influence on the French [[avant-garde]] and in particular [[Pablo Picasso]]'s paintings. In the autumn of 1906, Picasso made paintings of oversized nude women, and monumental sculptural figures that recalled the work of Paul Gauguin and showed his interest in [[primitive art]]. Picasso's paintings of massive figures from 1906 were directly influenced by Gauguin's sculpture, painting and his writing as well. The power evoked by Gauguin's work led directly to ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' in 1907.&lt;ref name=twsJun10a&gt;{{cite news

According to Gauguin biographer [[David Sweetman]], Picasso as early as 1902 became a fan of Gauguin's work when he met and befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio (1875–1940), in Paris. Durrio had several of Gauguin's works on hand because he was a friend of Gauguin's and an unpaid agent of his work. Durrio tried to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris. After they met, Durrio introduced Picasso to Gauguin's stoneware, helped Picasso make some ceramic pieces and gave Picasso a first ''La Plume'' edition of ''Noa Noa: The Tahiti Journal of Paul Gauguin.''&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 563&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to seeing Gauguin's work at Durrio's, Picasso also saw the work at [[Ambroise Vollard]]'s gallery where both he and Gauguin were represented.

Concerning Gauguin's impact on Picasso, [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]] wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt; The 1906 exhibition of Gauguin's work left Picasso more than ever in this artist's thrall. Gauguin demonstrated the most disparate types of art—not to speak of elements from metaphysics, ethnology, symbolism, the Bible, classical myths, and much else besides—could be combined into a synthesis that was of its time yet timeless. An artist could also confound conventional notions of beauty, he demonstrated, by harnessing his demons to the dark gods (not necessarily Tahitian ones) and tapping a new source of divine energy. If in later years Picasso played down his debt to Gauguin, there is no doubt that between 1905 and 1907 he felt a very close kinship with this other Paul, who prided himself on Spanish genes inherited from his Peruvian grandmother. Had not Picasso signed himself 'Paul' in Gauguin's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 461.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both David Sweetman and John Richardson point to the Gauguin sculpture called ''[[Oviri (Gauguin)|Oviri]]'' (literally meaning 'savage'), the gruesome phallic figure of the Tahitian goddess of life and death that was intended for Gauguin's grave, exhibited in the 1906 retrospective exhibition that even more directly led to ''Les Demoiselles.'' Sweetman writes, "Gauguin's statue ''Oviri,'' which was prominently displayed in 1906, was to stimulate Picasso's interest in both sculpture and ceramics, while the woodcuts would reinforce his interest in print-making, though it was the element of the primitive in all of them which most conditioned the direction that Picasso's art would take. This interest would culminate in the seminal ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon''."&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, 562–563.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richardson, &lt;blockquote&gt;Picasso's interest in [[stoneware]] was further stimulated by the examples he saw at the 1906 Gauguin retrospective at the [[Salon d'Automne]]. The most disturbing of those ceramics (one that Picasso might have already seen at Vollard's) was the gruesome ''Oviri.'' Until 1987, when the [[Musée d'Orsay]] acquired this little-known work (exhibited only once since 1906) it had never been recognized as the masterpiece it is, let alone recognized for its relevance to the works leading up to the ''Demoiselles.'' Although just under 30 inches high, ''Oviri'' has an awesome presence, as befits a monument intended for Gauguin's grave. Picasso was very struck by ''Oviri.'' 50 years later he was delighted when [Douglas] Cooper and I told him that we had come upon this sculpture in a collection that also included the original plaster of his cubist head. Has it been a revelation, like [[Iberians|Iberian]] sculpture? Picasso's shrug was grudgingly affirmative. He was always loath to admit Gauguin's role in setting him on the road to Primitivism.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson 1991, 459.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Technique and style ==
[[File:Paul Gauguin 030.jpg|upright=1.10|left|thumb|''Ta Matete'', 1892, [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]]]

Gauguin's initial artistic guidance was from Pissarro, but the relationship left more of a mark personally than stylistically. Gauguin's masters were [[Giotto]], [[Raphael]], [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Édouard Manet|Manet]], Degas and Cézanne.{{sfn|Walther|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=16}}{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=123}}{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=5}}{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=15}} His own beliefs, and in some cases the psychology behind his work, were also influenced by philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] and poet [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=10}}{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=15}}

Gauguin, like some of his contemporaries such as Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec, employed a technique for painting on canvas known as ''peinture à l'essence''. For this, the oil ([[Binder (material)|binder]]) is drained from the paint and the remaining sludge of pigment is mixed with turpentine. He may have used a similar technique in preparing his monotypes, using paper instead of metal, as it would absorb oil giving the final images a matte appearance he desired.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 67&lt;/ref&gt; He also proofed some of his existing drawings with the aid of glass, copying an underneath image onto the glass surface with watercolour or gouache for printing. Gauguin's [[woodcut]]s were no less innovative, even to the avant-garde artists responsible for the woodcut revival happening at that time. Instead of incising his blocks with the intent of making a detailed illustration, Gauguin initially chiseled his blocks in a manner similar to wood sculpture, followed by finer tools to create detail and tonality within his bold contours. Many of his tools and techniques were considered experimental. This methodology and use of space ran parallel to his painting of flat, decorative reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 23–26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paul Gauguin 049.jpg|upright=1.10|thumb|''Parahi te maras'', 1892, Meyer de Schauensee collection]]

Starting in Martinique, Gauguin began using [[Analogous colors|analogous colours]] in close proximity to achieve a muted affect.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=33}} Shortly after this he also made his breakthroughs in non-representational colour, creating canvases that had an independent existence and vitality all their own.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=52}} This gap between surface reality and himself displeased Pissarro and quickly led to the end of their relationship.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=45}} His human figures at this time are also a reminder of his love affair with Japanese prints, particularly gravitating to the naivety of their figures and compositional austerity as an influence on his primitive manifesto.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=33}} For that very reason, Gauguin was also inspired by [[folk art]]. He sought out a bare emotional purity of his subjects conveyed in a straightforward way, emphasizing major forms and upright lines to clearly define shape and contour.{{sfn|Walther|2000|pp=13, 17}} Gauguin also used elaborate formal decoration and colouring in patterns of abstraction, attempting to harmonize man and nature.{{sfn|Walther|2000|p=50}} His depictions of the natives in their natural environment are frequently evident of serenity and a self-contained sustainability.{{sfn|Walther|2000|p=75}} This complimented one of Gauguin's favourite themes, which was the intrusion of the [[supernatural]] into day-to-day life, in one instance going so far as to recall [[Art of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] tomb reliefs with ''Her Name is Vairaumati'' and ''Ta Matete''.{{sfn|Walther|2000|p=53}}

In an interview with [[L'Écho de Paris]] published on 15 March 1895, Gauguin explains that his developing tactical approach is reaching for [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Walther|2000|p=13}} He states:
:Every feature in my paintings is carefully considered and calculated in advance. Just as in a musical composition, if you like. My simple object, which I take from daily life or from nature, is merely a pretext, which helps me by the means of a definite arrangement of lines and colours to create symphonies and harmonies. They have no counterparts at all in reality, in the vulgar sense of that word; they do not give direct expression to any idea, their only purpose is to stimulate the imagination—just as music does without the aid of ideas or pictures—simply by that mysterious affinity which exists between certain arrangements of colours and lines and our minds.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|pp=170–171}}

In an 1888 letter to Schuffenecker, Gauguin explains the enormous step he had taken away from Impressionism and that he was now intent on capturing the soul of nature, the ancient truths and character of its scenery and inhabitants. Gauguin wrote:
:Don't copy nature too literally. Art is an abstraction. Derive it from nature as you dream in nature's presence, and think more about the act of creation than the outcome.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=38}}

Gauguin began making prints in 1889, highlighted by a series of zincographs commissioned by Theo van Gogh known as the ''Volpini Suite'', which also appeared in the Cafe des Arts show of 1889. Gauguin didn't waver from his printing inexperience and made a number of provocative and unorthodox choices, such as a zinc plate instead of limestone ([[lithography]]), wide margins and large sheets of yellow poster paper.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 19&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowness|1971|p=11}} The result was vivid to the point of garish, but foreshadows his more elaborate experiments with colour printing and intent to elevate monochromatic images. His first masterpieces of printing were from the ''Noa Noa Suite'' of 1893–94 where he essentially reinvented the medium of woodcutting, bringing it into the modern era. He started the series shortly after returning from Tahiti, eager to reclaim a leadership position within the avant-garde and share pictures based on his French Polynesia excursion. These woodcut prints were shown at his unsuccessful 1893 show at Paul Durand-Ruel's, and most were directly related to paintings of his in which he had revised the original composition. They were shown again at a small show in his studio in 1894, where he garnered rare critical praise for his exceptional painterly and sculptural effects. Gauguin's emerging preference for the woodcut was not only a natural extension of his wood reliefs and sculpture, but may have also been provoked by its historical significance to medieval artisans and the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 19–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Gauguin started watercolour monotyping in 1894, likely overlapping his ''Noa Noa'' woodcuts, perhaps even serving as a source of inspiration for them. His techniques remained innovative and it was an apt medium for him as it didn't require elaborate equipment, such as a printing press. Despite often being a source of practice for related paintings, sculptures or woodcuts, his monotype innovation offers a distinctly ethereal aesthetic; ghostly afterimages that may express his desire to convey the immemorial truths of nature. His next major woodcut and monotype project wasn't until 1898–99, known as the ''Vollard Suite''. He completed this enterprising series of 475 prints from some twenty different compositions and sent them to dealer Ambroise Vollard, despite not compromising to his request for salable, conformed work. Vollard was unsatisfied and made no effort to sell them. Gauguin's series is starkly unified with black and white aesthetic and may have intended the prints to be similar to a set of [[myriorama (cards)|myriorama cards]], in which they may be laid out in any order to create multiple panoramic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 26–29&lt;/ref&gt; This activity of arranging and rearranging was similar to his own process of repurposing his images and motifs, as well as a [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] tendency.{{sfn|Cachin|1992|p=119}} He printed the work on tissue-thin Japanese paper and the multiple proofs of gray and black could be arranged on top of one another, each transparency of colour showing through to produce a rich, [[chiaroscuro]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 he started his radical experiment: oil transfer drawings. Much like his watercolour monotype technique, it was a hybrid of drawing and printmaking. The transfers were the grand culmination of his quest for an aesthetic of primordial suggestion, which seems to be relayed in his results that echo ancient rubbings, worn frescos and cave paintings. Gauguin's technical progress from monotyping to the oil transfers is quite noticeable, advancing from small sketches to ambitiously large, highly finished sheets. With these transfers he created depth and texture by printing multiple layers onto the same sheet, beginning with graphite pencil and black ink for delineation, before moving to blue crayon to reinforce line and add shading. He would often complete the image with a wash of oiled-down olive or brown ink. The practice consumed Gauguin until his death, fueling his imagination and conception of new subjects and themes for his paintings. This collection was also sent to Vollard who remained unimpressed. Gauguin prized oil transfers for the way they transformed the quality of drawn line. His process, nearly alchemical in nature, had elements of chance by which unexpected marks and textures regularly arose, something that fascinated him. In metamorphosing a drawing into a print, Gauguin made a calculated decision of relinquishing legibility in order to gain mystery and abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 30–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field pp. 20–2&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked in wood throughout his career, particularly during his most prolific periods, and is known for having achieved radical carving results before doing so with painting. Even in his earliest shows, Gauguin often included wood sculpture in his display, from which he built his reputation as a connoisseur of the so-called primitive. A number of his early carvings appear to be influenced by [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Figura, Childs, Foster &amp; Mosier (2014), 37&lt;/ref&gt; In correspondence, he also asserts a passion for [[Cambodian art]] and the masterful colouring of [[Persian carpet]] and [[Oriental rug]].{{sfn|Cachin|1992|pp=180–181}}

*Gauguin is also the subject of at least two operas: [[Federico Elizalde]]'s ''Paul Gauguin'' (1943); and ''Gauguin (a synthetic life)'' by Michael Smetanin and [[Alison Croggon]]. [[Déodat de Séverac]] wrote his ''Elegy'' for piano in memory of Gauguin.
*The Danish-produced film ''[[The Wolf at the Door|Oviri]]'' (1986) is a biographical film. It follows the painter from the time he returns to Paris in 1893 after a two-year stay in Tahiti and must confront his wife, his children and his former lover. It ends when he returns to Tahiti two years later.

The Japanese styled Gauguin Museum, opposite the Botanical Gardens of Papeari in Papeari, Tahiti, contains some exhibits, documents, photographs, reproductions and original sketches and block prints of Gauguin and Tahitians. In 2003, the [[Paul Gauguin Cultural Center]] opened in Atuona in the [[Marquesas Islands]].

In 2014 the painting ''Fruits sur une table ou nature au petit chien''  (1889), with an estimated value of between €10m and €30m (£8.3m to £24.8m), which had been stolen in London in 1970, was discovered in Italy. The painting, together with a work by [[Pierre Bonnard]], had been bought by a Fiat employee in 1975, at a railway lost property sale, for 45,000 lira (about £32).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lizzy Davies in Rome |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/02/stolen-paintings-italian-works-wall-40-years-gaugain-bonnard |title=Stolen paintings hung on Italian factory worker's wall for almost 40 years &amp;#124; Art and design |publisher=theguardian.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polyworld''' is a cross-platform ([[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]]) program written by [[Larry Yaeger]] to evolve [[Artificial Intelligence]] through [[natural selection]] and [[evolutionary algorithm]]s. 

It uses the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] graphics toolkit and [[OpenGL]] to display a graphical environment in which a population of trapezoid agents search for food, mate, have offspring, and prey on each other. The population is typically only in the hundreds, as each individual is rather complex and the environment consumes considerable computer resources. The graphical environment is necessary since the individuals actually move around the 2-D [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] and must be able to "see." Since some basic abilities, like eating carcasses or randomly generated food, seeing other individuals, mating or fighting with them, etc., are possible, a number of interesting behaviours have been observed to spontaneously arise after prolonged evolution, such as cannibalism, predators and prey, and mimicry.

Each individual makes decisions based on a [[neural net]] using [[Hebbian learning]]; the neural net is derived from each individual's genome. The genome does not merely specify the wiring of the neural nets, but also determines their size, speed, color, [[mutation rate]] and a number of other factors. The [[genome]] is randomly mutated at a set probability, which are also changed in descendant organisms.

'''Ramon Artiaga Zamora''' (June 27, 1935 — August 26, 2007) was a Filipino [[actor|film actor]] best known for his leading roles in local [[martial arts]] films and action movies of the 1970s. He was popularly dubbed as the "[[Bruce Lee]] of the Philippines".&lt;ref name=GMA&gt;{{cite web| last =Meruenas| first =Mark| title =Ramon Zamora, Pinoy 'Bruce Lee,' dies at 72|publisher = [[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMANews.TV]]| date = 2007-08-27|url =http://www.gmanews.tv/story/57828/Ramon-Zamora-Pinoy-Bruce-Lee-dies-at-72| accessdate = 2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=INQ&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruz |first=Marinel |title=RP’s Bruce Lee was ‘very tired’ |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=2007-08-29 |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=85436 |accessdate=2007-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921175902/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view_article.php?article_id=85436 |archivedate=2012-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Zamora was born in [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan, Rizal]].&lt;ref name=ccp&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= Rosalinda Galang |editor=[[Nicanor Tiongson]] |encyclopedia=CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art |title=Philippine Film |edition=1st |year=1994 |publisher=[[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]|volume=VIII |location=Manila |pages= 338–339|isbn=971-8546-31-6 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his entertainment career in 1953 as a stuntman and dancer for [[LVN Pictures]].&lt;ref name=INQ/&gt; He persevered in the [[bodabil]] circuit, performing regularly at the Clover Theater and the Manila Grand Opera House.&lt;ref name=ccp/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABS&gt;{{cite web| last =Francisco| first =Butch| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =So long, Isprakenhayt!

From his stage performances, he was contracted in 1969 to star as a mainstay of the [[ABS-CBN]] gag show [[Super Laff-In]]. Zamora's most popular stock character in the show was a military-clad figure that bore an unmistakable physical resemblance to [[Adolf Hitler]], who spoke in bastardized German and spouted catchphrases such as "Isprakenheit".&lt;ref name=INQ/&gt; The role won him the "Best Actor Citizen's Award for Television".&lt;ref name=INQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccp/&gt;

==Film star==
When Super Laff-In's network ABS-CBN was closed upon the declaration of martial law in 1972, Zamora shifted gears and focused on a film career. He starred as the durable [[komiks]] character [[Pedro Penduko]] in the 1973 [[Celso Advento Castillo|Celso Ad Castillo]] fantasy film ''Ang Mahiwagang Daigdig ni Pedro Penduko''. The resulting success of the film boosted Zamora's popularity, and he soon became one of the top box-office draws in Philippine cinema in the 1970s.

Zamora was especially popular for a string of locally produced martial arts films that emerged following the international success of Bruce Lee.&lt;ref name=ccp/&gt; Patterning his film persona around a Bruce Lee-type with a comedic twist,&lt;ref name=ABS/&gt; Zamora starred in such films as ''Shadow of the Dragon'' (1973), ''Cobra at Lawin'' (1973), ''Game of Death'' (1974), ''Return of the Dragon'' (1977), and ''Bruce Liit'' (1978).

Then he played his  villain role as [[Edu Manzano]]'s right-hand man to [[Lito Lapid]] in an action packed movie ''Hindi Palulupig'' (1989)

==Later years==
By the 1980s, Zamora's career as a leading man petered out, and he returned to guest-starring in television programs, often in his "Hitler" guise. He also portrayed character roles in films, including one in the 1994 update of the Pedro Penduko saga now starring [[Janno Gibbs]], ''Ang Pagbabalik ni Pedro Penduko''. At the time of his death from a [[heart attack]] in his [[Antipolo City]] home, Zamora had completed one last film that had yet to be released, ''Ataul for Rent''.&lt;ref name=ABS/&gt;

A '''shareholder rights plan''', colloquially known as a "'''poison pill'''", is a type of defensive tactic used by a [[corporation]]'s [[board of directors]] against a [[takeover]]. Typically, such a plan gives shareholders the right to buy more shares at a discount if one shareholder buys a certain percentage or more of the company's shares. The plan could be triggered, for instance, if any one shareholder buys 20% of the company's shares, at which point every shareholder (except the one who possesses 20%) will have the right to buy a new issue of shares at a discount. If every other shareholder is able to buy more shares at a discount, such purchases would dilute the bidder's interest, and the cost of the bid would rise substantially. Knowing that such a plan could be activated, the bidder could be disinclined to take over the corporation without the board's approval, and would first negotiate with the board in order to revoke the plan.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of a standard rights plan, see [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]], ''The Share Purchase Rights Plan'' in Ronald J. Gilson &amp; Bernard S. Black, The Law and Finance of Corporate Acquisitions (2d ed. Supp. 1999) at 10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan can be issued by the board of directors as an "[[option (finance)|option]]" or a "[[warrant (finance)|warrant]]" attached to existing shares, and only be revoked at the discretion of the board.

In the field of [[mergers and acquisitions]], shareholder rights plans were devised in the early 1980s as a way to prevent takeover bidders from negotiating a price for sale of shares directly with shareholders, and instead forcing the bidder to negotiate with the board.

==History==
The poison pill was invented by [[mergers and acquisitions]] lawyer [[Martin Lipton]] of [[Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]] in 1982, as a response to tender-based [[hostile takeovers]].&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Business School, Case Study 9-496-037, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Poison pills became popular during the early 1980s in response to the wave of takeovers by [[corporate raid]]ers such as [[Carl Icahn]]. The term "poison pill" derives its original meaning from a [[suicide pill|poison pill]] physically carried by various [[Espionage|spies]] throughout history, a pill which was taken by the spies when they were discovered to eliminate the possibility of being interrogated by an enemy.

It was reported in 2001 that since 1997, for every company with a poison pill which successfully resisted a hostile takeover, there were 20 companies with poison pills that accepted takeover offers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/3001307/2/c_3046510?f=insidecfo Poison Pill Popping - CFO Magazine - October 2001 Issue - CFO.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend since the early 2000s has been for shareholders to vote against poison pill authorization, since poison pills are designed to resist takeovers, whereas from the point of view of a shareholder, takeovers can be financially rewarding.

Some have argued that poison pills are detrimental to shareholder interests because they perpetuate existing management. For instance, [[Microsoft]] originally made an unsolicited bid for [[Yahoo!]], but subsequently dropped the bid after Yahoo! CEO [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] threatened to make the takeover as difficult as possible unless Microsoft raised the price to US$37 per share. One Microsoft executive commented, "They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place." Yahoo has had a shareholders rights plan in place since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo weighs up options|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6445d618-d293-11dc-8636-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|publisher=''[[Financial Times]]''|accessdate=2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts suggested that Microsoft's raised offer of $33 per share was already too expensive, and that Yang was not bargaining in good faith, which later led to several shareholder lawsuits and an aborted proxy fight from [[Carl Icahn]].&lt;ref name="msft_withdrawl1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Withdraws Proposal to Acquire Yahoo!|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/may08/05-03letter.mspx|publisher=''[[Microsoft]]''|accessdate=2008-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft's Failed Yahoo Bid Risks Online Growth|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/technology/05soft.html?_r=4&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|accessdate=2008-05-06 | first=Steve | last=Lohr | date=2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahoo's stock price plunged after Microsoft withdrew the bid, and Jerry Yang faced a backlash from stockholders that eventually led to his resignation.

==Overview==
In publicly held companies, "poison pills" refer to various methods to deter [[takeover]] bids.  Takeover bids are attempts by a bidder to obtain control of a target company, either by [[proxy fight|soliciting proxies]] to get elected to the board or by acquiring a controlling block of shares and using the associated votes to get elected to the board.  Once in control of the board, the bidder can manage the target. As discussed below, targets have various takeover defenses available, and several types of defense have been called "poison pills" because they harm not only the bidder, but the target (or its shareholders) as well. Currently, the most common type of takeover defense is a shareholder rights plan.

Because the [[board of directors]] of the company can redeem or otherwise eliminate a standard poison pill, it does not typically preclude a [[proxy fight]] or other takeover attempts not accompanied by an acquisition of a significant block of the company's stock.  It can, however, prevent shareholders from entering into certain agreements that can assist in a proxy fight, such as an agreement to pay another shareholder's expenses.  In combination with a [[staggered board of directors]], however, a shareholder rights plan can be a defense.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite journal |last=Bebchuk |first=Lucian |authorlink=Lucian Bebchuk |author2=Coates, John C. |author3=Subramanian, Guhan  |year=2002 |title=The Powerful Antitakeover Force of Staggered Boards: Theory, Evidence, and Policy |journal=[[Stanford Law Review]] |volume=54 |issue=5 |pages=887–951  |jstor= 1229689|doi=10.2307/1229689 |publisher=Stanford Law Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a shareholder rights plan is to force a bidder to negotiate with the target's board and not directly with the shareholders. The effects are twofold:&lt;ref&gt;Fundamentals of Corporate Finance (6th ed.), Editions McGraw-Hill Ryerson, §23: Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/ref&gt;

* It gives management time to find competing offers that maximize selling price.
* Several studies indicate that companies with poison pills (shareholder rights plans) have received higher takeover premiums than companies without poison pills. This results in increased shareholder value. The theory is that an increase in the negotiating power of the target is reflected in higher acquisition premiums.

===Common types of poison pills===
==== Preferred stock plan ====
The target issues a large number of new shares, often [[preferred stock|preferred shares]], to existing shareholders. These new shares usually have severe redemption provisions, such as allowing them to be converted into a large number of common shares if a takeover occurs. This immediately dilutes the percentage of the target owned by the acquirer, and makes it more expensive to acquire 50% of the target's stock.

==== Flip-in ====
A “flip-in” permits shareholders, except for the acquirer, to purchase additional shares at a discount. This provides investors with instantaneous profits. Using this type of poison pill also dilutes shares held by the acquiring company, making the takeover attempt more expensive and more difficult.

==== Flip-over ====
A “flip-over” enables stockholders to purchase the acquirer’s shares after the merger at a discounted rate. For example, a shareholder may gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer, in subsequent mergers, at a two-for-one rate.

==== Back-end rights plan ====
Under this scenario, the target company re-phases all its employees' stock-option grants to ensure they immediately become vested if the company is taken over. Many employees can then exercise their options and then dump the stocks. With the release of the "golden handcuffs", many discontented employees may quit immediately after having cashed in their stock options. This poison pill is designed to create an exodus of talented employees, reducing a corporate value as a target. In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented human resources may result in a diluted or empty shell being left behind for the new owner.

For instance, [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival Oracle, and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses. While the acquisition ultimately prevailed, the hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;The Register, "Oracle chokes on PeopleSoft's poison pill", https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/11/oracle_chokes_on_peoplesofts_poison/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Voting plan ====
In a [[voting plan]], a company will charter preferred stock with superior voting rights over that of common shareholders. If an unfriendly bidder acquired a substantial quantity of the target firm's voting common stock, it then still would not be able to exercise control over its purchase. For example, [[ASARCO]] established a voting plan in which 99% of the company's common stock would only harness 16.5% of the total voting power.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Malatesta (University of Washington) and Ralph A. Walking (Ohio State University), "Poison Pill Securities: Stockholder Wealth, Profitability, and Ownership Structure," Journal of Financial Economics, Vol. 20, January/March 1988, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these pills, a "dead-hand" provision allows only the directors who introduce the poison pill to remove it (for a set period after they have been replaced), thus potentially delaying a new board’s decision to sell a company.

===Constraints and legal status===
The legality of poison pills had been unclear when they were first put to use in the early 1980s. However, the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] upheld poison pills as a valid instrument of takeover defense in its 1985 decision in [[Moran v. Household International, Inc.]]  However, many jurisdictions other than the U.S. have held the poison pill strategy as illegal, or place restraints on their use.

In Canada, almost all shareholders rights plans are "chewable," meaning they contain a permitted bid concept such that a bidder who is willing to conform to the requirements of a permitted bid can acquire the company by take-over bid without triggering a flip-in event.  Shareholder rights plans in Canada are also weakened by the ability of a hostile acquirer to petition the provincial securities regulators to have the company's pill overturned.  Generally, the courts will overturn the pill to allow shareholders to decide whether they want to tender to a bid for the company.  However, the company may be allowed to maintain it for long enough to run an auction to see if a [[white knight (business)|white knight]] can be found. A notable Canadian case before the securities regulators in 2006 involved the poison pill of [[Falconbridge Ltd.]] which at the time was the subject of a friendly bid from [[Vale Inco|Inco]] and a hostile bid from [[Xstrata]] plc, which was a 20% shareholder of Falconbridge.  Xstrata applied to have Falconbridge's pill invalidated, citing among other things that the Falconbridge had had its pill in place without shareholder approval for more than nine months and that the pill stood in the way of Falconbridge shareholders accepting Xstrata's all-cash offer for Falconbridge shares. Despite similar facts with previous cases in which securities regulators had promptly taken down pills, the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] ruled that Falconbridge's pill could remain in place for a further limited period as it had the effect of sustaining the auction for Falconbridge by preventing Xstrata increasing its ownership and potentially obtaining a blocking position that would prevent other bidders from obtaining 100% of the shares.

In the United Kingdom, poison pills are not allowed under the [[Takeover Panel]] rules. The rights of public shareholders are protected by the Panel on a case-by-case, principles-based regulatory regime. One disadvantage of the Panel's prohibition of poison pills is that it allows bidding wars to be won by hostile bidders who buy shares of their target in the marketplace during "raids". Raids have helped bidders win targets such as [[BAA Limited|BAA]] plc and [[AWG plc]] when other bidders were considering emerging at higher prices. If these companies had poison pills, they could have prevented the raids by threatening to dilute the positions of their hostile suitors if they exceeded the statutory levels (often 10% of the outstanding shares) in the rights plan. The [[London Stock Exchange]] itself is another example of a company that has seen significant stakebuilding by a hostile suitor, in this case the [[NASDAQ]]. The LSE's ultimate fate is currently up in the air, but NASDAQ's stake is sufficiently large that it is essentially impossible for a third party bidder to make a successful offer to acquire the LSE.

Takeover law is still evolving in continental Europe, as individual countries slowly fall in line with requirements mandated by the [[European Commission]]. Stakebuilding is commonplace in many continental takeover battles such as [[Scania AB]]. Formal poison pills are quite rare in continental Europe, but national governments hold [[golden shares]] in many "strategic" companies such as telecom monopolies and energy companies. Governments have also served as "poison pills" by threatening potential suitors with negative regulatory developments if they pursue the takeover. Examples of this include Spain's adoption of new rules for the ownership of energy companies after [[E.ON]] of Germany made a hostile bid for [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] and France's threats to punish any potential acquiror of [[Groupe Danone]].

===Other takeover defenses===
Poison pill is sometimes used more broadly to describe other types of takeover defenses that involve the target taking some action.  Although the broad category of takeover defenses (more commonly known as "shark repellents") includes the traditional shareholder rights plan poison pill.  Other anti-takeover protections include:

*Limitations on the ability to call special meetings or take action by written consent.
*Supermajority vote requirements to approve mergers.
*Supermajority vote requirements to remove directors.
*The target adds to its charter a provision which gives the current shareholders the right to sell their shares to the acquirer at an increased price (usually 100% above recent average share price), if the acquirer's share of the company reaches a critical limit (usually one third). This kind of poison pill cannot stop a determined acquirer, but ensures a high price for the company.
* The target takes on large [[debt]]s in an effort to make the debt load too high to be attractive—the acquirer would eventually have to pay the debts.
* The company buys a number of smaller companies using a [[stock swap]], diluting the value of the target's stock.
* The target grants its employees [[stock options]] that immediately vest if the company is taken over.  This is intended to give employees an incentive to continue working for the target company at least until a merger is completed instead of looking for a new job as soon as takeover discussions begin.  However, with the release of the "[[golden handcuffs]]", many discontented employees may quit immediately after they've cashed in their stock options. This poison pill may create an exodus of talented employees.  In many high-tech businesses, attrition of talented [[human resources]] often means an [[Shell (corporation)|empty shell]] is left behind for the new owner.
* [[PeopleSoft]] guaranteed its customers in June 2003 that if it were acquired within two years, presumably by its rival [[Oracle Corporation]], and product support were reduced within four years, its customers would receive a refund of between two and five times the fees they had paid for their PeopleSoft software licenses.  The hypothetical cost to Oracle was valued at as much as US$1.5 billion. PeopleSoft allowed the guarantee to expire in April 2004. If PeopleSoft had not prepared itself by adopting effective takeover defenses, it is unclear if Oracle would have significantly raised its original bid of $16 per share. The increased bid provided an additional $4.1 billion for PeopleSoft's shareholders.
* Classified boards with staggered elections for the [[board of directors]]. For example, if a company had nine directors, then three directors would be up for re-election each year, with a three-year term. This would present a potential acquirer with the position of having a hostile board for at least a year after the first election. In some companies, certain percentages of the board (33%) may be enough to block key decisions (such as a full merger agreement or major asset sale), so an acquirer may not be able to close an acquisition for years after having purchased a majority of the target's stock. As of December 31, 2008, 47.05% of the companies in the S&amp;P Super 1500 had a classified board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.SharkRepellent.net&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholder input===
An increasing number of companies are giving shareholders a say on poison pills. As of June 15, 2009, 21 companies that had adopted or extended a poison pill had publicly disclosed they plan to put the poison pill to a shareholder vote within a year. That was up from 2008's full year total of 18, and was the largest number ever reported since the early 1980s, when the pill was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laide|first=John|title=Shareholder Input on Poison Pills|url=https://www.sharkrepellent.net/request?an=dt.getPage&amp;st=1&amp;pg=/pub/rs_20090615.html&amp;Shareholder_Input_on_Poison_Pills&amp;rnd=674362|publisher=SharkRepellent.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solomon Mujuru''' (born '''Solomon Mutusva'''; 5 May 1945 – 15 August 2011), also known by his [[nom-de-guerre]], '''Rex Nhongo''', was a [[Zimbabwe]]an military officer and politician who led [[Robert Mugabe]]'s guerrilla forces during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]]. He was from the [[Zezuru]] clan. In post-independence Zimbabwe, he went on to become army chief before leaving government service in 1995. After leaving his post in the Zimbabwe National Army, he got into politics becoming Member of Parliament for Chikomba on a Zanu PF ticket. He was generally regarded as one of the most feared men in Zimbabwe. His wife, [[Joice Mujuru]], became Vice-President of Zimbabwe in 2004.

==Biography==

===Early life===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Born Solomon Mutusva in [[Chivhu|Enkeldoorn]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], Mujuru took an interest in politics at an early age. He was first arrested for his activism while a student at [[Zimuto High School (Zimbabwe)|Zimuto High School]] and later joined the youth league of the [[Zimbabwe African People's Union]] (ZANU). He was detained again by the Rhodesian authorities in 1966 and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Upon his release, Mujuru fled to [[Lusaka]], [[Zambia]], where he was recruited for guerrilla training in the [[Soviet Union]].

===Rhodesian Bush War===
During the [[Zimbabwe War of Liberation]] Mujuru, with [[Josiah Tongogara]], led the [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]] (ZANLA) while [[Robert Mugabe]] was in jail for 10 years (from 1964 to 1974). Mugabe, along with [[Edgar Tekere]], subsequently slipped into [[Mozambique]] after their release, with assistance from chief [[Rekayi Tangwena]], where Mujuru petitioned the insurgents to accept Mugabe as their leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundaytribune.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=2367172%3Cp%3E |title=It is universally accepted in Zanu-PF that without Solomon's active support, Mugabe would have been a nobody. Solomon and the late Josiah Tongogara led the Zanla forces|newspaper= Sunday Tribune|date= 9 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Mujuru was appointed military chief of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Patriotic Front]], a theoretical amalgamation of ZAPU and Mugabe's [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU). From 1976 to 1979, he supervised operational planning, infiltration, and the movement of ZANLA cadres inside Rhodesia. In 1980, the ZANLA commander was instrumental in demobilising former guerrillas in assembly points monitored by Commonwealth forces. {{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Post-Independence===

It was generally thought that Mujuru had a tremendous amount of influence on who would lead ZANU-PF and the country.&lt;ref name=BBCobit/&gt; He was the only person believed to have had the stature to challenge Mr Mugabe during party meetings.&lt;ref name=asleep/&gt; Newspaper reports claimed Mujuru had been under house arrest and 24-hour surveillance between 2007 and 2008 for his role in attempting to oust Mugabe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11182:Mujuru%20under%20house%20arrest&amp;catid=31:top%20zimbabwe%20stories&amp;Itemid=66 |title= Mujuru under house arrest|newspaper=The Zimbabwean|date= 18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thezimbabwean.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11182:Mujuru%20under%20house%20arrest&amp;catid=31:top%20zimbabwe%20stories&amp;Itemid=66 |title=Senior figures from within the party led by former army chief Solomon Mujuru are expected to challenge Mr Mugabe|newspaper=The Zimbabwean |date= 18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he remained an influential member of the ruling [[ZANU-PF]] politburo and central committees.&lt;ref name=BBCobit/&gt; Mujuru and his wife were among the [[ZANU-PF]] party members subject to personal [[International sanctions|sanctions]] imposed by the United States.

==Business and Black Economic Empowerment==
Mujuru was a successful businessman and commercial farmer, who both advocated and benefitted from indigenisation and [[black economic empowerment]] in Zimbabwe. He had diverse business ventures,&lt;ref name=BBCobit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14550942|title=Solomon Mujuru: Obituary of a Zimbabwean 'king-maker'|date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2013|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included mining, agriculture, transport, tourism and investment in the construction industry. In the mid-1990s Mujuru clashed with [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]], long considered Mugabe's favoured heir, when Solomon bid to buy into the multibillion-dollar [[Zimasco]], a chrome mining and smelting concern in Zimbabwe's Midlands Province.&lt;ref name=BBCprofile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6507993.stm|title=Profile: The Mujuru couple|date=24 February 2009|accessdate=12 October 2013|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Farming ==
Popular speculation is that Mujuru owned anywhere between six and sixteen farms,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} including Alamein Farm, seized from Guy Watson-Smith during the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe#Fast-track Land Reform and violence|fast-track land reform]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-3319957-we-were-given-minutes-to-leave.do|title= Farm owner given minutes to leave his Farm|newspaper= The London Evening Standard|date= 10 February 2003|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110805144548/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-3319957-we-were-given-minutes-to-leave.do|archivedate= 5 August 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; His seizure of Alamein Farm was at the time ruled illegal by the [[Supreme Court of Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/1366242/Evicted-farmer-sues-for-return-of-2m-assets.html |title= Evicted farmer sues for return of £2m assets|newspaper= The Telegraph|date= 24 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-541448-britain-must-act-on-zimbabwe.do|title= Britain must act on Zimbabwe|newspaper= The London Evening Standard|date= 25 January 2002|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120914142124/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-541448-britain-must-act-on-zimbabwe.do|archivedate= 14 September 2012|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Solomon Mujuru died in a fire in the early hours of the night of 15 August 2011, at the homestead of Alamein Farm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-08-16-zimbabwes-general-solomon-mujuru-dies-in-fire |title=Zimbabwe's General Solomon Mujuru dies in fire|newspaper=Mail and Guardian|location= South Africa|author=Bauer, Nickolaus |date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in circumstances that many commentators suggest were suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thoughtleader.co.za/jeremiahkure/2011/08/21/of-securocrats-candles-and-a-raging-dictatorship/|title=Securocrats, Candles and a raging dictatorship|publisher=''Mail &amp; Guardian, South Africa''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/2011/08/21/mujuru-death-no-accident|title=Mujuru death no accident|publisher=''The Times, South Africa''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had stopped at the Beatrice Hotel, 60&amp;nbsp;km south-west of Harare, where he had drunk and chatted with patrons; he was having an early night before a long journey the next day. A maid and guard at the farm testified they heard gunshots two hours before flames were seen at his farmhouse. Mujuru had left groceries and his cell phone in his car, something he had never done before. The general had taken 40 minutes to drive from the hotel to his farm, a journey of 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2012-02-06-zim-generals-death-shrouded-in-suspicion/ |title=Doubts raised about Mujuru's cause of death|newspaper=Mail and Guardian |location= South Africa |date=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lone policeman was asleep at the time, and after he awoke, he had no airtime, and the radio was broken.

An enquiry was opened.&lt;ref name="asleep"/&gt; The coroner investigating Mujuru's death concluded he had died of smoke inhalation, but Mujuru's family lacks confidence in the coroner's findings. They plan to petition for approval to exhume Mujuru's remains and have them independently examined by a doctor of their own choice. Mujuru's remains are located at [[National Heroes Acre (Zimbabwe)|Heroes Acre]], a memorial in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gonda|first=Violet|title=Zimbabwe Court Rules Smoke Inhalation Killed Mujuru, Family Demands Exhumation|url=http://www.voanews.com/zimbabwe/news/Zimbabwean-Coroner-Rules-Smoke-Inhalation-killed-Mujuru-Family-Call-for-Exhumation-142961325.html|accessdate=16 March 2012|newspaper=Voice of America|date=16 March 2012|author2=Thomas Chiripasi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodor Fischer''' (1878–1957) was a Swiss [[art dealer]] and auctioneer in [[Lucerne]] who after the First World War built a highly successful firm of auctioneers that dominated the Swiss art market. In 1939 he was the auctioneer at the infamous Grand Hotel auction of "[[degenerate art]]" removed from German museums by the [[Nazis]]. During the Second World War he played a key part in the trading of art looted by the Germans from occupied countries.

==Early life==
Fischer was born in 1878. In his early career he was associated with the firm of [[Paul Cassirer]] of Berlin, with whom a joint auction was held in 1931 after Cassirer's death. He became a director of the Bosshard Gallery in Lucerne.&lt;ref name=fisch/&gt;

==Between the World Wars==
Fischer founded [[Galerie Fischer]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=fisch&gt;[http://www.fischerauktionen.ch/ueber/geschichte.aspx?l=en Portrait.] Fischer. Retrieved 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; He later established a branch of the gallery in Berlin. He built up a large business in Lucerne between the wars and sold a number of important collections. He established his own premises there in 1939 at 17 [[Haldenstrasse]]. Before then  auctions were conducted at the [[Zunfthaus zur Meisen|Zur Meisen Guild House]] in Zurich and the [[Grand Hotel National]], Haldenstrasse, in Lucerne.&lt;ref name=fisch/&gt;

==1939 Grand Hotel auction==
In 1937 the Nazi party assembled, from art that they had removed from German museums, the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], an exhibition of mostly modern art that toured Germany until early 1939. The exhibition was intended to show the deterioration in art brought about by Jewish and [[Bolshevik]] influences. The creation of the exhibition was followed up by a far larger exercise to collect "degenerate art" from throughout Germany. On the instructions of [[Joseph Goebbels]], German Reich Minister of Propaganda, attempts were made to sell some of the more valuable "degenerate" works abroad to raise foreign currency to help the war effort. Dealers were appointed in Germany for this purpose and Theodore Fischer was instructed to hold an auction of "degenerate art" in Switzerland. This took place on 30 June 1939 at the Grand Hotel National.&lt;ref name=Lost&gt;Harclerode, Peter, &amp; Brendan Pittaway. (1999) ''The Lost Masters: The Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses''.

Retrieved 26 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the 126 pictures offered were [[Franz Marc]]'s ''Three Red Horses'', [[Paul Gauguin]]'s ''Landscape of Tahiti with Three Female Tigers'', [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''The Harlequins'' and a self-portrait by [[Paul Modersohn]]. In addition, there were four more paintings by Marc, fifteen by [[Lovis Corinth]], nine by [[Carl Hofer]], nine by [[Oskar Kokoschka]], seven by Emil Nolde, five by [[Ernst Barlach]], two by [[Paul Klee]], and three each by [[Max Beckmann]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Kirchner]], [[Max Pechstein]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]].&lt;ref name=Lost/&gt; Despite the contempt of the Nazis for the "degenerate art" on offer, the auction was described by the Fischer gallery in more flattering terms as a sale of ''Gemalde und Plastiken Moderner Meister aus Deutschen Museen'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/QH3E7U275681 "Research Resources: 'Entartete Kunst' Inventory at the V&amp;A Goes Online 31 January 2014"] lootedart.com. Retrieved 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Paintings and Sculptures of Modern Masters from German Museums'').

The sale was widely publicised and previews were held at Zurich and Lucerne but it did not have the atmosphere of a normal fine art auction. Some people were in the audience only out of curiosity and a number of bidders, who might have been expected to attend, were absent because they were worried the proceeds would be used to prop-up the Nazi regime. Others were bargain-hunters or bought because they feared what would happen to the pictures if they went unsold. [[Marianne Breslauer|Marianne Feilchenfeldt]] and her husband were shocked to discover that one of the canvases for sale was ''Cathedral of Bordeaux'' (1924/25) by [[Oskar Kokoschka]], a painting that they had donated to the [[Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin but which had been deaccessioned in 1937.&lt;ref name=Europa&gt;[[Lynn H.

Fischer's auctioneering was reported by ''Beaux Arts'' of France to be efficient but the journal couldn't help noting his disdainful attitude to the lots. Of ''Man with a Pipe''&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise known as ''The Smoker''. 1917. Lot 111, unsold. Now lost.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Max Pechstein]] they reported that, "he said with a little sneer, "This must be a portrait of the artist" ... when he withdrew other lots, which he had started at rather a high minimum, he took wicked pleasure in observing loudly, "Nobody wants that sort of thing," or "This lady doesn't please the public" ... and he smiled when he said the word "withdrawn".&lt;ref&gt;"La Vente des oeuvres d'art dégénérés à Lucerne", ''Beaux Arts'', 7 July 1939. Translated by Lynn H. Nicholas. Nicholas, 1995, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The prices realised in the sale were below expectations and 28 lots went unsold.&lt;ref name=Europa/&gt;

==Second World War==
Many of the established art markets in Europe were closed or restricted during the Second World War, making neutral Switzerland with its borders with Germany, Italy, Austria and France, an attractive alternative to Paris or London as a place to buy or sell art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commartrecovery.org/cases/switzerland Switzerland Neutral Haven And A Willing Wartime Art Market.] Commission for Art Recovery, 2010. Retrieved 13 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110901072348/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/Switzerland9.htm Switzerland and the Looted Art Trade Linked to World War II.] Georg Kreis, [[University of Basel]], Switzerland. 11 December 1999. Retrieved 26 January 2015 from Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

People were dislocated by the war and some had capital trapped abroad, leading to an urgent need to raise funds. The wife of Jewish collector [[Gisèle Freund|Julius Freund]], for instance, who had been forced to flee Germany, sold part of his collection through Galerie Fischer as she urgently needed to raise funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/NIF7RH961951 'Nazi-Era Art Claims in the United States:10 years after the Washington Conference'.] lootedart.com. Retrieved 26 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi regime in Germany sold looted art in order to raise foreign currency and collectors and dealers sought to profit from sales forced by wartime exigencies.

Fischer, who already dominated the Swiss market, was able to exploit these conditions to the full, to the extent that in 1946, the USS Office of Strategic Services Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) described him as "the focal point in all looted art transactions in Switzerland, and recipient of the greatest number of looted paintings located to date".&lt;ref name=loot&gt;"Fischer, Theodor."

[[File:Wilhelm Trübner Karl Haberstock.jpg|thumbnail|''Karl Haberstock'' by [[Wilhelm Trübner]], 1914. Haberstock was Adolf Hitler's art agent and a client of Fischer.]]

===Methods===
Fischer used an agent in [[Darmstadt]] named [[Carl Bümming]] to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]]'s art agent [[Karl Haberstock]], who like Fischer had worked for Cassirer. In Switzerland, Fischer used the services of Swiss-resident German dealer [[Hans Wendland]] to import large quantities of looted art into the country for onward sale. In November 1942, Wendland received a whole railway wagon full of art from Paris. In 1943 he received a large quantity of art from Italy. According to [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], Wendland acted on behalf of Fischer in negotiating with [[Hermann Göring]]'s art agent [[Walter Hofer]], and Wendland and Fischer were partners in most of the transactions. The two had known each other since at least 1931&lt;ref&gt;Some sources say they met in 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; when Fischer had bailed Wendland out of some financial difficulties. According to Cooper, the value of trade between Fischer and Hofer for the two years to December 1942 was Swiss Francs 1,133,930. Trade between Hofer and Wendland between 1940 and January 1944 was French Francs 7,420,000 and Swiss Francs 258,000.&lt;ref name=Harc130&gt;Harclerode, pp. 130&amp;ndash;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer also had close connections with the Zurich galleries Galerie Schmidlin and Galerie Neupert, both of which dealt in looted art.&lt;ref name=Harc130/&gt; The ALIU and [[Bergier commission]] Reports also point to the importance of German refugee art dealers such as [[Fritz Nathan]] who acted as an intermediary between Fischer, Hofer and [[Emil Georg Bührle]].&lt;ref name="loot" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Switzerland, National Socialism and the Second World War Final Report|last=Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland – Second World War Jean-François Bergier, Chairman|first=|publisher=Pendo Verlag GmbH, Zürich|year=2002|isbn=3-85842-603-2|location=https://www.uek.ch/en/schlussbericht/synthesis/ueke.pdf|pages=350–1,360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deals with Hermann Göring===
Fischer made several deals with Hermann Göring through his agent Walter Hofer. Göring particularly prized German [[Old Master|old master]] works and in February 1941, Hofer selected seven such from Galerie Fischer which were shipped to Göring's palace at [[Karinhall]]. They included four paintings by the German master [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a triptych by a Frankfurt master and a statue of a ''Female Saint Holding a Ring'' (c. 1500) of the Nuremberg school. The Cranach paintings were ''Madonna and Child in a Landscape'', ''Crucifixion with a Knight as Donor'', ''St. Anne and the Virgin'', and ''Portrait of a Bearded Kurfurst''.&lt;ref name=Harc128/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alford2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kenneth D.

Göring originally agreed to pay in Swiss francs but as foreign currency was difficult to obtain, even for him, it was later agreed that Fischer would receive 25 [[French Impressionism|French Impressionist]] paintings instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4S18272 ALIU Detailed Interrogation Report: Hans WENDLAND, 18 September 1946.] lootedart.com.

All had previously been in the [[Moïse Lévy de Benzion]] and [[Alphonse Kann]] collections,&lt;ref name=Harc128&gt;Harclerode, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; apart from ''Flowers in a Vase'' (also known as ''Glass with Wild Flowers'') (1890) by van Gogh, which had been part of the [[Alfred Lindon]] collection.&lt;ref name=Harc128&gt;Harclerode, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yeide447&gt;[[Nancy Yeide|Yeide, Nancy H.]] (2009) ''Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection.''

Another looted work handled by Fischer was Degas' ''Madame Camus at the Piano'' (1869). This had been in the Kann collection but seized by the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR) in 1941. From there it passed into the Göring collection who exchanged it with [[Gustav Rochlitz]] for older works. From Rochlitz it went to Wendland and from there to Fischer who sold it in 1942 to industrialist [[Emil Georg Bührle|Emil Bührle]]. It was recovered by Kann's heirs in 1948, only to be sold back to Bührle in 1951.&lt;ref name=Yeide458&gt;Yeide, p. 458, D31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other paintings seized by the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg|ERR]] for the Göring collection that passed into the hands of Theodor Fischer included:

===South American connections===
Among Fischer's other connections was the Catalan politician, [[Francoist]] sympathizer and art collector [[Francesc Cambó]], who dealt almost solely with Fischer. He moved to Buenos Aires shortly after the start of the Second World War. Fischer was also connected with the Austrian dealer [[Thaddeus Grauer]] who moved to Brazil in 1941 via Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C13443670 FO 837/1154/5.] The National Archives. Retrieved 29 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, more than 24 paintings looted from European Jews were discovered in a São Paulo art gallery. They were traced to Grauer and before that Fischer.&lt;ref&gt;Harclerode, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lootedart.com/MFEU4783877 News Reports: 'Brazil uncovers Nazi war loot'] lootedart.com. Retrieved 28 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings included a Picasso and a Monet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fsp/mundo/ft16099804.htm "Arte expropriada tem destino debatido."] Mario Cesar Carvalho, ''Folha De S.Paulo'', 16 September 1998. Retrieved 29 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==
After the end of the Second World War, the descendants and original owners of looted art began to try to recover their property in a process that is still continuing.

Around September 1945, [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], whose collection had been plundered by the Nazis, travelled to Switzerland in search of the paintings looted from him. Finding several in the collection of Emil Bührle, he demanded their return. Bührle refused but said he would return them to Theodor Fischer, from whom he had acquired them, as long as he received a full refund from Fischer. Fischer acknowledged that he had acquired them from Hofer and knew them to be looted but claimed that he had been unable to return them.&lt;ref name=Harc136&gt;Harclerode, pp. 136&amp;ndash;137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss government was forced to return some looted works of art to their original owners, despite the [[Swiss Syndicate of Art Dealers]] instructing its members not to provide any information on the topic. In the 1950s, Theodor Fischer sued the Swiss government for compensation of over one million Swiss Francs in respect of these restitutions but was awarded only 200,000 francs in settlement.&lt;ref name="Bischol"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bischof, Günter |author2=Anton Pelinka|author3=Ferdinand Karlhofer.

==Death==
Fischer died in 1957. His business was taken over by his sons, Arthur (1905–1981) and Paul (1911–1976).&lt;ref name=fisch/&gt;

Kennedy|assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963. Since the mid-1960s, various allegations have been made about the identities of the men and their involvement in a [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories|conspiracy to kill Kennedy]]. Records released by the [[Dallas Police Department]] in 1989 identified the men as Gus Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John Gedney. [[File:The Tree Tramps.jpg|thumb|The Three Tramps]]

==Early allegations: E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis==
The ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', the ''[[Dallas Times Herald]]'', and the ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]'' photographed three [[Homelessness |transients]]  under police escort near the Texas School Book Depository shortly after the assassination.&lt;ref name="Bugliosi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F.

Sprague]] who compiled the photographs in 1966 and 1967, and subsequently turned them over to [[Jim Garrison]] during his investigation of [[Clay Shaw]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=930}} Appearing before a nationwide audience on the January 31, 1968, episode of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'', Garrison held up a photo of the three and suggested they were involved in the assassination.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=930}} Later, in 1974, assassination researchers [[A. J. Weberman|Alan J. Weberman]] and Michael Canfield compared photographs of the men to people they believed to be suspects involved in a conspiracy and said that two of the men were [[Watergate scandal|Watergate burglars]] [[E. Howard Hunt]] and [[Frank Sturgis]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=931}} Comedian and civil rights activist [[Dick Gregory]] helped bring national media attention to the allegations against Hunt and Sturgis in 1975 after obtaining the comparison photographs from Weberman and Canfield.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=931}} Immediately after obtaining the photographs, Gregory held a press conference that received considerable coverage and his charges were reported in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]''.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=931}}&lt;ref name="Weberman"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Weberman |first1=Alan J |authorlink1=A.

The [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] reported in 1975 that they investigated the allegation that Hunt and Sturgis, on behalf of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), participated in the assassination of Kennedy.&lt;ref name="CCAUS-C19"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States |url=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?docId=930&amp;relPageId=1 |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= June 1975 |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |page=251 |chapter=Chapter 19: Allegations Concerning the Assassination of President Kennedy |chapterurl=http://www.maryferrell.org/mffweb/archive/viewer/showDoc.do?absPageId=71095 |ref={{harvid|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final report of that commission stated that witnesses who testified that the "derelicts" bore a resemblance to Hunt or Sturgis, "were not shown to have any qualification in photo identification beyond that possessed by an average layman".{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|p=256}} Their report also stated that [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Agent]] Lyndal L. Shaneyfelt, "a nationally-recognized expert in photoidentification and photoanalysis" with the FBI photographic laboratory, had concluded from photo comparison that none of the men were Hunt or Sturgis.{{sfn|Report to the President by Commission on CIA Activities in the United States, Chapter 19|1975|p=257}} In 1979, the [[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations| House Select Committee on Assassinations]] reported that [[Forensic anthropology|forensic anthropologists]] had again analyzed and compared the photographs of the "tramps" with those of Hunt and Sturgis, as well as with photographs of Thomas Vallee, Daniel Carswell, and [[Fred Crisman|Fred Lee Crisman]].&lt;ref name="HCSA-IB"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |archiveurl= |archivedate= |format= |accessdate= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year=1979 |month= |origyear= |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=91–92 |chapter=I.B.

According to [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]], Sturgis became involved with [[Marita Lorenz]] in 1985, who later identified Sturgis as a gunman in the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, Mark.

==Other allegations: Charles Harrelson, Charles Rogers, and Chauncey Holt==
In September 1982, contract killer [[Charles Harrelson]], the father of actor [[Woody Harrelson]], while wanted for the murder of federal judge [[John H.

In September 1991, private investigators John Craig and Philip Rogers, who were working on a book about an unsolved murder case, claimed that [[Charles Rogers (murder suspect)|Charles Rogers]], who disappeared in 1965 after the dismembered bodies of his parents were found in a refrigerator, was a CIA operative who was identified by his friends and relatives as one of the "tramps".&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;{{cite news |title='65 case tied to JFK death?/Book will claim suspect in CIA |first=Eric |last=Hanson |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1991_812475/65-case-tied-to-jfk-death-book-will-claim-suspect.html |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |location=Houston, Texas |date=September 28, 1991 |page=A29 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', a homicide detective who worked on the original murder case of Rogers' parents described the scenario as "far-fetched".&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Three months later in a 1991 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article about [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', [[Chauncey Holt]] received national attention for various claims he made regarding the assassination of President Kennedy, including that he was one of three CIA operatives photographed as the "tramps".&lt;ref name="Alvord"&gt;{{cite news |title=Chauncey Holt; claimed inside scoop in JFK killing |first=Valerie |last=Alvord |url=&lt;!-- Official link here: http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/1243502521.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+5%2C+1997&amp;author=Valerie+Alvord&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.7.1.6&amp;desc=Chauncey+Holt%3B+claimed+inside+scoop+in+JFK+killing --&gt;&lt;!-- Text copied here: http://groups.google.com/group/alt.conspiracy.jfk/msg/38656008e072f432 --&gt; |newspaper=The San Diego Union-Tribune |location=San Diego |date=July 5, 1997 |page=B.7.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gates |first=David  |authorlink=David Gates (author) |date=December 23, 1991 |title=Bottom Line: How Crazy Is It? |journal=Newsweek |volume=118|pages=52–54 |url=http://europe.newsweek.com/bottom-line-how-crazy-it-201178?rm=eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt also stated that he was with Harrelson in Dealey Plaza on the day of the assassination.&lt;ref name="Kroth"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kroth |first=Jerome A. |title=Conspiracy in Camelot: The Complete History of the Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy |year=2003 |publisher=Algora Publishing |location= |isbn=0-87586-247-0 |page=1012 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Holt, he was ordered to Dallas to deliver phony [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] credentials, but was not involved in killing Kennedy nor did he have knowledge of who did.&lt;ref name="Alvord"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; John Craig and Philip Rogers' 1992 book ''The Man on the Grassy Knoll'' eventually connected Charles Harrelson, Charles Rogers, and Chauncey Holt by alleging that they were the three tramps photographed in Dealey Plaza.{{sfn|Kroth|2003|pp=197}} According to that book, Harrelson and Rogers were sharpshooters on the grassy knoll, who were assisted by Holt.{{sfn|Kroth|2003|pp=197}}

==Official explanation: Gus Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John Gedney==
In 1992, journalist Mary La Fontaine discovered the November 22, 1963, arrest records that the Dallas Police Department had released in 1989, which named the three men as Gus W. Abrams, Harold Doyle, and John F. Gedney.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} According to the arrest reports, the three men were "taken off a boxcar in the railroad yards right after President Kennedy was shot", detained as "investigative prisoners", described as unemployed and passing through Dallas, then released four days later.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} An immediate search for the three men by the FBI and others was prompted by an article by Ray and Mary La Fontaine on the front page of the February 9, 1992, ''Houston Post''.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} Less than a month later, the FBI reported that Abrams was dead and that interviews with Gedney and Doyle revealed no new information about the assassination.&lt;ref name="Bolt"&gt;{{cite news |title=FBI queries hobos seized day JFK shot |first=John A. |last=Bolt |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1992_1040447/fbi-queries-hobos-seized-day-jfk-shot.html |agency=AP |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |location=Houston, Texas |date=March 3, 1992 |page=A9 |accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Doyle, the three men had spent the night before the assassination in a local [[homeless shelter]] where they showered and ate before heading back to the railyard.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} Interviewed by ''[[A Current Affair (U.S. TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' in 1992, Doyle said that he was aware of the allegations and did not come forward for fear of being implicated in the assassination.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} He added: "I am a plain guy, a simple country boy, and that's the way I want to stay. I wouldn't be a celebrity for $10 million."{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} Gedney independently affirmed Doyle's account,{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=933}} and a researcher who tracked down Abrams' sister confirmed that Abrams lived the life of an itinerant [[freighthopping|train hopper]] and had died in 1987.{{sfn|Bugliosi|2007|p=934}}

Despite the Dallas Police Department's 1989 identifications of the three tramps as being Doyle, Gedney and Abrams and the lack of evidence connecting them to the assassination, some researchers have continued to maintain other identifications for the tramps and to theorize that they may have been connected to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;Fetzer, James H. ''Assassination Science : Experts Speak Out on the Death of JFK'' (Open Court, 1998). {{ISBN|0-8126-9366-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Presentation by Mary Holt at the ''November In Dallas Research Conference 2000.''[http://www.jfklancer.com/Dallas00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the three at the time of their arrest have fueled speculation as to the identities of the three "tramps", as they appeared to be well-dressed and clean-shaven, seemingly unlikely for [[hobo]]s riding the rails. Some researchers also thought it suspicious that the Dallas police had quickly released the tramps from custody, apparently without investigating whether they might have witnessed anything significant related to the assassination,{{efn|Author Henry Hurt notes, "They had been in a potentially good location to see activities that could have helped in an investigation."&lt;ref name="Hurt"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hurt |first=Henry  |title=Reasonable Doubt: An Investigation into the Assassination of John F.

'''Timothy Treadwell''' (born '''Timothy William Dexter'''; April 29, 1957 {{ndash}} October 5, 2003) was an American [[Bear#Relationship with humans|bear enthusiast]], [[environmentalist]], [[documentary|documentary filmmaker]], founder of the bear-protection organization Grizzly People. He lived among [[grizzly bear]]s of [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]] in [[Alaska]] for 13 summers. At the end of his 13th summer in the park, in 2003, he and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were killed and almost fully eaten by a 28-year-old [[brown bear]], whose stomach was later found to contain human remains and clothing.&lt;ref name="Medred article"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Medred|first1=Craig|title=Biologist Believes Errors Led to Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard Attack|url=http://www.wolfsongnews.org/news/Alaska_current_events_1381.htm|accessdate=August 2, 2017|agency=Anchorage Daily News|date=August 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treadwell's life, work, and death were the subject of [[Werner Herzog]]'s critically acclaimed documentary film ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name="Grizzly Man 2005"&gt;''Grizzly Man'' (DVD). Directed by [[Werner Herzog]]. Lions Gate, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Treadwell was born on [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], one of five children of Val and Carol Dexter. He attended [[Connetquot High School]], where he achieved B average grades and was the swimming team's star diver. He was very fond of animals and kept a squirrel named Willie as a pet. In an interview in the film ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005), his parents say he was an ordinary young man until he went away to college. There, he claimed that he was a British orphan who was born in [[Australia]]. According to this account, his father said Timothy "spiraled down" and became an alcoholic after he lost the role of [[Woody Boyd]] to [[Woody Harrelson]] in the sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''.&lt;ref name=triblive&gt;{{cite news|author=Blank, Ed|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_369501.html|title=Film Questions Man's Life Amid Wildlife|work=[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]|location=[Pittsburgh, PA]|date=September 1, 2005|accessdate=April 2012}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treadwell studied [[grizzly bear]]s during summer seasons for 13 years, before being killed by one of them. According to his book, ''Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska'', his mission to protect bears began in the late 1980s after surviving a near fatal [[heroin overdose]]. He claims in his book that his [[drug addiction]] grew from his [[alcoholism]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

A lover of animals since he was a child, Treadwell traveled to [[Alaska]] to watch bears after a close friend convinced him to do so. He wrote that after his first encounter with a wild bear, he knew he had found his calling in life, and that now his destiny was entwined with that of the bears. He attributed his recovery from drug and alcohol addictions entirely to his relationship with bears.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Alaskan expeditions==
[[File:Timothy Treadwell's last camp - cascading maps.gif|thumb|From Grizzly Sanctuary to Grizzly Maze]]
Treadwell spent the early part of each season camping on the "Big Green", an open area of bear grass in [[Hallo Bay]] on the Katmai Coast. He called the area "The Grizzly Sanctuary". Treadwell was known for getting extremely close to the bears he observed, sometimes even touching them and playing with bear cubs. However, in his book, he claimed that he was always careful with the bears and actually developed a sense of mutual trust and respect with the animals. He habitually named the bears he encountered and consistently saw many of the same bears each summer, and thus claimed to build a standing relationship with them.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} 
In contrast, Tom Smith, a research ecologist with the Alaska Science Center of the U.S. Geological Service declared that Treadwell "...was breaking every park rule that there was, in terms of distance to the bears, harassing wildlife and interfering with natural processes. Right off the bat, his personal mission was at odds with the park service. He had been warned repeatedly." Referring to Treadwell's death, Smith concluded "It's a tragic thing, but it's not unpredictable."&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/08/local/me-bear8]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the later part of each summer he would move to Kaflia Bay and camp in an area of especially thick brush he called the "Grizzly Maze". Here the chances of crossing paths with grizzlies were much higher, since the location intersected bear trails. Treadwell recorded almost 100 hours of video footage (some of which was later used to create the documentary ''Grizzly Man'') and produced a large collection of still photographs.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Treadwell claimed to be alone with the wildlife on several occasions in his videos. However, his girlfriend Amie was with him during parts of the last three summers (the documentary says two summers) and at the time of his death. Other people possibly accompanied Treadwell during the other summer trips.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

By 2001, Treadwell became sufficiently notable to receive extensive media attention both on television and in environmental circles, and he made frequent public appearances as an environmental activist. He traveled throughout the United States to educate school children about bears and appeared on the [[Discovery Channel]], the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]],'' and ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' to discuss his experiences.

He also co-authored ''Among Grizzlies: Living with Wild Bears in Alaska'' with Jewel Palovak (his co-worker with whom he lived for 20 years),&lt;ref name=robertdavis&gt;{{cite web | last=Davis | first = Robert | title= Werner Herzog: The Tests and Trials of Men| work= [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=April 11, 2007 | url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2007/04/werner-herzog.html| accessdate= November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describes Treadwell's adventures on the [[Alaska Peninsula]]. Treadwell and Palovak founded Grizzly People, an organization devoted to protecting bears and preserving their wilderness habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grizzlypeople.com/ Grizzly People]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlie Russell (Bear researcher)|Charlie Russell]], who studied bears, raised them, and lived with them in [[Kamchatka]], Russia, for a decade, worked with Treadwell. Russell wrote a lengthy critique of Treadwell's lack of basic safety precautions, such as [[pepper spray]] and [[electric fence]]s. He also commented on what he considered the standard reaction of Alaskans to hearing of Treadwell's death, writing, "If Timothy had spent those thirteen years killing bears and guiding others to do the same, eventually being killed by one, he would have been remembered in Alaska with great admiration." Russell was also critical of the film ''Grizzly Man'', saying it was inaccurate, and if Palovak "really was a protector of bears, she should have looked for a filmmaker who would have been sympathetic towards them."&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Russell, Charlie]] |date=February 21, 2006|url=http://cloudline.org/treadwell.html |title=Letters from Charlie|website=cloudline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the organization Treadwell founded, Grizzly People, five bears were poached in the year following his death, while none had been poached while he was present in Katmai. However, according to court records as reported by the ''Anchorage Daily News'', the guilty parties were charged with poaching wildlife along Funnel Creek in the Preserve, an area open to hunting that borders the National Park. According to several sources, including Nick Jans' book, ''The Grizzly Maze'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jans, Nick|title=The Grizzly Maze: Timothy Treadwell's Fatal Obsession with Alaskan Bears|location= New York, N.Y.|publisher= Penguin Group|date= 2005|isbn= 0-525-94886-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treadwell camped only near the Katmai Coast, mainly in areas around Hallo Bay and Kaflia Bay, and never in or near the Preserve. The only effective way to patrol all {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2|-3}} of Katmai National Park is by airplane, the method used by authorities.

== Conflicts with the National Park Service ==
Treadwell's years with the grizzlies were not without disruption. Almost from the start, the [[National Park Service]] expressed their worries about his behavior. The Park's restrictions made him increasingly irate. According to the file kept on Treadwell by the Park Service, rangers reported he had at least six violations from 1994 to 2003. Included among these violations were guiding tourists without a license, camping in the same area longer than the Park Service's seven-day limit, improper food storage, wildlife harassment, and conflicts with visitors and their guides. Treadwell also frustrated authorities by refusing to install an electric fence around his camp and refusing to carry [[bear spray]] to use as a deterrent. In fact, Treadwell had carried pepper spray with him and had resorted to using it at least one time, but wrote that he had felt terrible grief over the pain he perceived it had caused the bear and refused to use it on subsequent occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Treadwell, Timothy|title= Among Grizzlies: Living With Wild Bears In Alaska|publisher= Harper Collins Publishing|location= New York, New York|date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, park rangers issued Treadwell a citation for storing an ice chest filled with food in his tent. A separate incident involved rangers ordering him to remove a prohibited portable [[Electrical generator|generator]]. When the [[National Park Service|Park Service]] imposed a new rule&amp;mdash;often referred to as the "Treadwell Rule"&amp;mdash;requiring all campers to move their camps at least one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) every seven days, Treadwell initially obeyed the order by using a small motorboat to move his camp up and down the coast. Finding this method impractical, he later hid his camp from the Park Service in stands of trees with heavy brush. He was cited at least once for this violation.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

== Death ==

In October 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend, [[physician assistant]] Amie Huguenard (born October 23, 1965, in [[Buffalo, New York]]), visited [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]], which is on the [[Alaska Peninsula]] across [[Shelikof Strait]] from [[Kodiak Island]]. In ''Grizzly Man'', [[Werner Herzog]] states that according to Treadwell's diaries, Huguenard feared bears and felt deeply uncomfortable in their presence. Her final journal entries indicated that she wanted to be away from Katmai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Medred | first = Craig | title= Woman who died with 'bear guru' was duped| work= Anchorage Daily News|date=February 18, 2005 | url=http://www.wolfsongnews.org/news/Alaska_current_events_1068.htm| accessdate= November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treadwell chose to set his campsite near a salmon stream where grizzlies commonly feed in autumn. Treadwell was in the park later in the year than usual,&lt;ref name="Grizzly Man 2005"/&gt; at a time when bears attempt to gain as much fat as possible before winter. Food was scarce that fall, causing the grizzly bears to be even more aggressive than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jans | first = Nick | title = The Grizzly Obsession | publisher = Dutton Adult | location = City | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-525-94886-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treadwell was to leave the park at his usual time of year but extended his stay a week in an effort to locate a favorite female brown bear. He said he hated modern civilization and felt better in nature with the bears than he did in big cities around humans. The bears he had been used to during the summer had already gone into [[hibernation]], and bears that Treadwell did not know from other parts of the park were moving into the area. Some of the last footage taken by Treadwell, hours before his death, includes video of a bear diving into the river repeatedly for a piece of dead salmon. Treadwell mentioned in the footage that he did not feel entirely comfortable around that particular bear. In ''Grizzly Man'', Herzog posits that Treadwell may have filmed the very bear that killed him.&lt;ref name="Grizzly Man 2005"/&gt;

[[File:Treadwell Incident Map.jpg|right|thumb|Diagram of attack site showing positions of bodies. Longitude incorrectly marked as East rather than West. {{coord|58|14|50.63|N|154|15|24.68|W|region:US-AK_type:event}}]]Around noon on Sunday, October 5, 2003, Treadwell spoke with an associate in [[Malibu, California]], by [[satellite phone]]; Treadwell mentioned no problems with any bears. The next day, October 6, Willy Fulton, a Kodiak [[air taxi]] pilot, arrived at Treadwell and Huguenard's campsite to pick them up but found the area abandoned, except for a bear, and contacted the local park rangers. The couple's mangled remains were discovered quickly upon investigation. Treadwell's disfigured head, partial spine, and right forearm and hand, with his wristwatch still on, were recovered a short distance from the camp. Huguenard's partial remains were found next to the torn and collapsed tents, partially buried in a mound of twigs and dirt. A large male grizzly (tagged Bear 141) protecting the campsite was killed by park rangers during their attempt to retrieve the bodies. A second adolescent bear was also killed a short time later, when it charged the park rangers. An on-site [[necropsy]] of Bear 141 revealed human body parts such as fingers and limbs. The younger bear was consumed by other animals before it could be necropsied.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In the 85-year history of Katmai National Park, this was the first known incident of a person being killed by a bear.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite web | last=Sanders | first = Kevin | title= Night of the Grizzly, A True Story Of Love And Death In The Wilderness | work=Yellowstone Outdoor Adventures |year=2006 | url=http://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/Tim_Treadwell.html | accessdate= February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[video camera]] was recovered at the site that proved to have been operating during the attack, but police said that the six-minute tape contained only voices and cries as a brown bear mauled Treadwell to death. The tape begins with Treadwell yelling that he is being attacked. "Come out here; I'm being killed out here," he screams. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 10, 2003|title=Final cries of couple killed by bear|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1443788/Final-cries-of-couple-killed-by-bear.html|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That the tape contained only sound led troopers to believe the attack might have happened while the camera was stuffed in a duffel bag or during the dark of night. In ''Grizzly Man'',&lt;ref name="Grizzly Man 2005"/&gt; filmmaker Herzog claims that the lens cap of the camera was left on, suggesting that Treadwell and Huguenard were in the process of setting up for another video sequence when the attack happened. The camera had been turned on just before the attack, presumably by sound activation, but the camera recorded only six minutes of audio before running out of tape. This, however, was enough time to record the bear's initial attack on Treadwell and his agonized screams, its retreat after Huguenard tells Treadwell to play dead and when she attacked it and its return to carry Treadwell off into the forest.&lt;ref name=robertdavis/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanders" /&gt;

== Media attention ==

* ''[[Grizzly Man]]'' (2005), directed by [[Werner Herzog]], is a documentary about Treadwell's work with wildlife in Alaska. Released theatrically by Lions Gate Films, it later was telecast on the [[Discovery Channel]]. Treadwell's own footage is featured, along with interviews with people who knew him. Although Herzog praises Treadwell's video footage and photographs, he states his belief that Treadwell was a disturbed individual with a [[death drive|death wish]]. Treadwell's [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] treatment of wild animals is apparent in the documentary.
* ''The Grizzly Man Diaries'' is an eight-episode [[mini-series]] that premiered on August 22, 2008, on [[Animal Planet]] and is a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Grizzly Man''. Produced by Creative Differences, the series chronicles the last 10 years of Treadwell's life with diary entries, and footage and photographs taken by Treadwell during his expeditions.

An [[all-rounder]], Bailey was known for his skilful but unspectacular batting. As the BBC reflected in his obituary: "His stubborn refusal to be out normally brought more pleasure to the team than to the spectators."&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; This defensive style of play brought him the first of his nicknames, "Barnacle Bailey",&lt;ref name="teleg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8316020/Trevor-Bailey.html# |title=Trevor Bailey |publisher=Telegraph |date= 10 February 2011|accessdate=2011-02-10 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was a good enough cricketer that he has retrospectively been calculated to have been the leading all-rounder in the world for most of his international career.

In later life, Bailey wrote a number of books and commentated on the game. He was particularly known for the 26 years he spent working for the [[BBC]] on the [[Test Match Special]] radio programme.

==Early life==
Bailey was born in [[Westcliff-on-Sea]], [[Essex]]. His father was a civil servant in the [[Admiralty]]. Bailey grew up in modest affluence: "The family lived in [a]&lt;!-- Telegraph omits this word --&gt; semi-detached house at Leigh-on-Sea, complete with a live-in maid on 12 shillings (60p) a week; they did not, however, own a car."&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt; He first learned to play cricket on the beach.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;

He won sporting scholarships to attend [[Alleyn Court Prep School]], where he learned cricket from former [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] captain [[Denys Wilcox]],&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt; and then [[Dulwich College]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/feb/10/trevor-bailey-england-barnacle | location=London |work=The Guardian | first=Andy | last=Bull | title=Trevor Bailey: England legend and all-rounder in more than one sense | date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his first year, aged just 14, he was selected for Dulwich's [[First XI]] cricket team.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; He came top of the school's [[batting average|batting]] and [[bowling average]]s in 1939 and 1940, became captain in 1941, and was top of the averages again in his last year at Dulwich, 1942.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;

He was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Marines]] after leaving school;&lt;ref name="modelling"&gt;http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/493308.html&lt;/ref&gt; he was "not enamoured of war, and won some reputation as defending counsel in court martials". Though [[World War II]] was still in progress, he received an early discharge in January 1945 to return to Alleyn Court Prep School as a schoolmaster. He subsequently attended [[St John's College, Cambridge]] for two years, reading English and History and graduating in 1948.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;  He won [[Blue (university sport)#University of Cambridge|Blues]] for both cricket and football both years, 1947 and 1948.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;  The Cambridge football team included [[Doug Insole]], whom Bailey would later succeed as captain of Essex County Cricket Club.

==Career==

===Cricket===
Bailey made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] cricket debut in September 1945, aged 22, for the "Under 33s" [[scratch team]], in a match at [[Lord's]], against an "Over 33s" team, and made his debut playing [[county cricket]] for Essex in May 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/853/First-Class_Matches.html |title=The Home of CricketArchive |publisher=Cricketarchive.com |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He quickly became a lynchpin of the Essex team, and made his Test debut for England against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] in [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 1949|June 1949]], taking 6 wickets for 118 runs in his first match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62700.html |title=1st Test: England v New Zealand at Leeds, Jun 11–14, 1949 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A right-arm [[fast bowler|fast-medium bowler]], dependable right-handed [[batsman]] and strong [[Fielding (cricket)|fielder]], often in the [[slip (cricket)|slips]] or at leg gully, Bailey played 61 Tests for England between 1949 and 1959. His [[swing bowling]] provided an effective foil for the fast bowling of [[Alec Bedser]], and later [[Fred Trueman]], [[Brian Statham]] and [[Frank Tyson]]. He is described as having had "a model high, sideways-on action which encouraged outswing. At his best he could touch greatness..."&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;  He took 132 wickets at the [[bowling average]] of 29, scored a century (134 not out) in attaining a useful [[batting average]] of nearly 30, and took 32 catches.

He is best remembered for his obdurate defensive batting, especially in matches against Australia. England were facing defeat by the Australians at Lord's in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|Second Test in 1953]]. Bailey shared a defensive fifth wicket stand with [[Willie Watson (England cricketer)|Willie Watson]], defying the bowlers for over four hours to earn a draw, taking 257 minutes to score 71 runs.&lt;ref name="gobit"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/10/trevor-bailey-obituary | location=London |work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Foot | title=Trevor Bailey obituary | date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth Test of that series, at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]], Bailey again played an important part in ensuring that England avoided going 1–0 down, which would have ended their hopes of regaining [[the Ashes]]. When the last day began England were 177–5 in their second innings, only 78 runs ahead. Bailey scored 38 in 262 minutes, and Australia eventually had to score 177 in only 115 minutes. They reached a point where they needed only another 66 in 45 minutes with seven wickets left. But Bailey went back to his long run and slowed the over rate, as well as bowling negatively wide of the leg stump, and Australia fell 30 runs short and the game was drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Barker]] &amp; [[Irving Rosenwater]], ''England v Australia: A compendium of Test cricket between the countries 1877–1968'', Batsford, 1969, {{ISBN|0-7134-0317-9}}, p 220.&lt;/ref&gt;  England went on to win the fifth and final Test and so regained [[the Ashes]].

His best Test bowling figures of 7/34, bowling [[outswing]] on a flat pitch, enabled England to bowl out the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] for 139 in the first innings of the fifth Test at [[Kingston, Jamaica]], in [[English cricket team in West Indies in 1953–54|1953–54]], on a pitch on which the groundsman expected the home side to score 700.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt; This enabled England to win the match and to share the series 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/139867.html The second-most controversial tour in history]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was vice-captain on that tour, and may be considered unlucky never to have been appointed captain of England. According to [[Alan Gibson]]: "It is astonishing that so good a cricketer, so thoughtful a judge, and so friendly a man, should have been passed over."  However, he adds: "He is, or was in his earlier days, a man of contradictions, who sometimes enjoyed being irritating, to his captain, to his colleagues, to the public, but most of all to his opponents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Gibson|first = Alan|title = The Cricket Captains of England|publisher = Cassell|year = 1979|location= London|isbn = 0-304-29779-8|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He played his final Tests in [[the Ashes]] [[English cricket team in Australia in 1958–59|tour to Australia in 1958–59]]. He had a bad tour, during which he scored the slowest half-century in first-class cricket, reaching 50 just 3 minutes short of 6 hours at the crease,&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/284093.html |title=Records/Test matches/Batting records: Slowest Fifties |publisher=Stats.espncricinfo.com |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England's second innings during the 1st Test at Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62850.html |title=1st Test: Australia v England at Brisbane, Dec 5–10, 1958 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first Test match to be broadcast on television in Australia.&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; He bagged a pair in his final test, the last of the tour at Melbourne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/62854.html |title=5th Test: Australia v England at Melbourne, Feb 13–18, 1959 &amp;#124; Cricket Scorecard |publisher=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was never selected for England's Test side again, but continued to play first-class cricket for Essex for another 8 years, and in the 1959 season became the only player since the Second World War to score more than 2,000 runs and take 100 wickets in a single domestic season.

His [[first-class cricket]] career began just after World War II in 1946 and lasted 21 years as he played 682 matches, taking 2,082 wickets at a bowling average of 23.13, which puts him 25th on the all-time list of wicket-takers. Bailey achieved the rare feat of taking all 10 wickets in an innings, for 90 runs, against [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] at [[Clacton]] in 1949. His 28,641 runs in [[first-class cricket]] put him 67th on the all-time list of run-scorers. He captained the county from 1961 to 1966. He was also the county's secretary (i.e. the chief administrative officer) from 1964 to 1969, having previously had a spell as assistant secretary. He arranged for [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] to make an interest-free loan to Essex in 1965 which allowed Essex to buy its [[County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford|Chelmsford ground]].&lt;ref name="modelling"/&gt;  This enabled him to receive a salary whilst at the same time technically remaining an [[History of English amateur cricket|amateur]] cricketer, although he was better paid than the club's professionals. However, [[Keith Fletcher]], a playing colleague at Essex, did not begrudge him his salary, saying: "...he was a better cricketer than the pros and someone instrumental in taking Essex County Cricket Club into the modern era. He was cricket and Essex, through and through.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/england/8317128/Trevor-Bailey-is-remembered-for-his-obdurate-batting-and-as-one-of-Englands-finest-all-rounders.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Derek | last=Pringle | title=Trevor Bailey is remembered for his obdurate batting and as one of England's finest all-rounders | date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He supplemented his income by undertaking advertising work while playing for Essex, modelling for [[Brylcreem]], [[Shredded Wheat]] and [[Lucozade]].&lt;ref name="modelling"/&gt;

===Football===
He played [[association football|football]] for [[Cambridge University A.F.C.|Cambridge University]] (appearing in the University Match against [[Oxford University|Oxford]]), [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] reserves, [[Clapton F.C.|Clapton]], [[Leytonstone F.C.|Leytonstone]] and [[Walthamstow Avenue F.C.|Walthamstow Avenue]]. At various times he played at [[centre-half]], [[inside-right]] and on the [[Wide midfielder|wing]]. He was a member of the Walthamstow Avenue side which won the [[FA Amateur Cup]] in 1951-2, winning the final before a Wembley crowd of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/ESSEX-Cricket-legend-Trevor-Bailey-dies/article-3209162-detail/article.html |title=CRICKETING legend Trevor Bailey, 87, died in the early hours this morning (Thursday Feb 10) at a flat fire at a retirement complex |publisher=Thisistotalessex.co.uk |date=14 December 2010 |accessdate=2011-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505064957/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/news/ESSEX-Cricket-legend-Trevor-Bailey-dies/article-3209162-detail/article.html |archivedate=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, he played in the side which reached the fourth round of the [[FA Cup]]. Drawn against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Old Trafford]], they drew 1–1, a fine achievement for an amateur side. The replay took place at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and Manchester United won 5–2.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Bailey, ''Wickets, Catches and the Odd Run'', Willow Books, 1986, {{ISBN|0-00-218127-4}}, pp197-207.&lt;/ref&gt;  He later became a director of [[Southend United F.C.]].&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/trevor-bailey-combative-and-uncompromising-cricketer-hailed-as-the-worlds-best-allrounder-in-the-1950s-2211183.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=Trevor Bailey: Combative and uncompromising cricketer hailed as the world's best all-rounder in the 1950s | date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writer and broadcaster==
After retiring from cricket in 1967, Bailey continued to play for Westcliff-on-Sea Cricket Club for many years and also became a cricket journalist and broadcaster. He was the cricket and football correspondent of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' for 23 years.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/965de652-35ca-11e0-b67c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1E3O6fqJZ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dulwich.org.uk/OA_Document_1.aspx?id=1:29463&amp;id=1:29454&amp;id=1:29431 Biography on Dulwich College website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215043/http://www.dulwich.org.uk/OA_Document_1.aspx?id=1%3A29463&amp;id=1%3A29454&amp;id=1%3A29431 |date=19 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a regular on the [[BBC]]'s [[Test Match Special]] from 1974 to 1999,&lt;ref name="reflect"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/9393503.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|title=Cricket – Cricket mourns England Test great Trevor Bailey  |date= 10 February 2011|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; where fellow commentator [[Brian Johnston]] nicknamed him '''The Boil''', based on the supposed Australian barrackers' pronunciation of his name as "Boiley". (The ''Daily Telegraph'' gives an alternative source for this nickname from the pronunciation of his surname by the [[East End]] supporters of the Walthamstow Avenue football team.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;) During his retirement he would watch Westcliff-on-Sea Cricket Club play at their [[Chalkwell Park]] Ground where he had played many times for school, club and county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/tms.html#y TMS personalities]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1994 Birthday Honours]] for services to cricket.&lt;ref&gt; {{London Gazette |date=10 June 1994 |supp=y |issue=53696 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He remains the only player since the [[Second World War]] to score more than 2,000 runs in a season and take 100 wickets, a feat he achieved in 1959, and he achieved the all-rounders' double of 1,000 [[run (cricket)|runs]] and 100 wickets in a season eight times, a post-World War II record he shares with [[Fred Titmus]]. He was selected as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1950. He is also one of three players (the others are [[Fred Titmus]] and [[Ray Illingworth]]) to have scored 20,000 first-class runs and taken 2,000 wickets since the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt; According to the retrospectively calculated [[ICC cricket ratings]], for most of his career, Bailey was the best all-rounder in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/playerdisplay/test/all-rounder/?id=117&amp;graph=ranking |title=Reliance ICC Test Championship All-Rounder Rankings – Trevor Bailey |work=[[Reliance ICC Player Rankings]] |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the individual disciplines, his bowling saw him achieve the higher ranking, as high as eighth in the [[1957 English cricket season|summer of 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relianceiccrankings.com/playerdisplay/test/bowling/?id=117&amp;graph=ranking |title=Reliance ICC Test Championship Bowling Rankings – Trevor Bailey |publisher=Relianceiccrankings.com |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doug Insole]], his one-time captain at Essex, described him thus: "Trevor was quite a stroppy lad in his early cricketing years, and a bit of a rebel. He was a very intense character – we used to tease him about that in the dressing room, and he did mellow over the years."&lt;ref name="briggs"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/8319693/Warrior-Trevor-Bailey-cared-little-for-entertainment.html "Warrior Trevor Bailey cared little for entertainment" from ''Daily Telegraph''] Retrieved 13 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Briggs wrote: "There was little comfy or cosy about his cricket career. Rather, he fitted into a long tradition of hard-nosed English pragmatists – a lineage that runs from [[WG Grace]], through [[Douglas Jardine|Jardine]] and up to [[Nasser Hussain]]...  To Bailey and company, the best way to honour the gods of cricket was to commit your heart and soul to the fight. For them, a Test match was a contest between two groups of warriors. Its entertainment value was almost irrelevant."&lt;ref name="briggs"/&gt;

He was renowned for his slow scoring in Tests against Australia, [[Neville Cardus]] writing of one innings in his book ''Full Score'' (1970, chapter "Cricket of Vintage"): "Before he gathered together 20 runs, a  newly-married couple could have left [[Heathrow]] and arrived in [[Lisbon]], there to enjoy a honeymoon. By the time Bailey had congealed 50, this happily wedded pair could easily have settled down in a semi-detached house in [[Surbiton]]; and by the time his innings had gone to its close they conceivably might have been divorced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cardus|first=Neville|authorlink=Neville Cardus|title=Full Score|url=http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/MISC/HUMOUR/CARDUS_ON_BAILEY_1959|accessdate=September 2013|year=1970|publisher=[[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]]|location=London |chapter=Cricket of Vintage| isbn= 030493643X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Various|first=|title=The Authors XI: A Season of English Cricket from Hackney to Hambledon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gALUQJaS6fMC&amp;pg=PT35&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;dq=%22Before+he+gathered+together+20+runs,+a+newly-married+couple+could+have+left+Heathrow+and+arrived+in+Lisbon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uEO0V2qfoZ&amp;sig=aA0wUKIXFVZTyP3maUCHD9Hl2lI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GsgyUszlD4bJiAebsIHACQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Before%20he%20gathered%20together%2020%20runs%2C%20a%20newly-married%20couple%20could%20have%20left%20Heathrow%20and%20arrived%20in%20Lisbon&amp;f=false  |chapter=Cricket and Broadcasting (Jon Hotten)|accessdate=September 2013|date=Jun 6, 2013|publisher=[[Google eBook]] / [[A&amp;C Black]]|isbn=1408840464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was nicknamed "Barnacle" for his implacable defensive batting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cricinfo|ref=ci/content/player/8944.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cardus's piece on him in ''Close of Play'', first published in 1956, he was more complimentary: "Some cricketers are born to greatness. Bailey achieved it... He conquers by tremendous effort... Yet Bailey... loves to attack any bowler... He has made catches bordering on the marvellous... It is no small thing to be a Trevor Bailey in a world of anonymous mediocrity."&lt;ref&gt;Neville Cardus, ''Close of Play'', Sportsmans Book Club, 1957, pp64-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey died in a fire in his retirement flat in [[Westcliff-on-Sea]] on 10 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southendstandard.co.uk/news/echo/8844541.Updated__Cricketing_legend_dies_in_flat_fire/ |title=Updated: Cricketing legend dies in flat fire |work=[[Southend Standard]] |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-12414599 |publisher=BBC News |title=Former England cricketer Trevor Bailey dies in fire  |date= 10 February 2011|accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Greta, survived.&lt;ref name="teleg"/&gt;  They had two sons and one daughter.&lt;ref name="gobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

The chairman of the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]], [[Giles Clarke]], described him as "one of the finest all-rounders this country has ever produced", while [[Jonathan Agnew]], who worked with Bailey on Test Match Special, wrote of him: "dogged batsman, aggressive bowler. Intelligent cricketer. Wonderfully concise pundit. Great sense of humour."&lt;ref name="reflect"/&gt;

[[Lieutenant-Colonel]] '''Sir Walter Dorling Smiles''' [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (8 November 1883 &amp;ndash; 31 January 1953) was a Northern Irish politician.

Sir Walter was the son of William Holmes Smiles, director of [[Belfast Ropeworks]], and grandson of [[Samuel Smiles]].  Sir Walter served during the [[First World War]] and, in the 1920s, managed a tea estate in [[Assam]], there he became involved in local government and was a member of the [[Assam Legislative Council]].

During the First World War; he obtained a pilots certificate but due to the lack of aircraft he transferred to [[Royal Naval Air Service#RNAS Armoured Car Section|Royal Naval Armoured Car Division]]. In 1915 he was seconded to the [[Imperial Russian Army]] to fight against [[Ottoman Army (1861–1922)|Turkish forces]] in the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. In 1918 he had reached the rank of [[Lieutenant commander#United Kingdom|Lieutenant commander]] and was highly decorated; he received the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] in 1916, with bar in 1917 and a [[Mentioned in dispatches|MID]], along with Russian and Romanian decorations; such as the [[Order of St. George|St George of the 4th class]].&lt;ref&gt;Grylls, Bear, '' Mud, Sweat and Tears'',  Channel 4, 2012 {{ISBN|1905026498}} {{ISBN|978-1905026494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He was [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn]] from 1931 to 1945. Smiles was [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|re-elected in 1935]] but stood for [[Down (UK Parliament constituency)|Down]] in Northern Ireland at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 Westminster election]], as a Unionist. The two-seat constituency was split in 1950 into [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]] and [[South Down (UK Parliament constituency)|South Down]]. Smiles won North Down that year and remained its MP until his death in 1953; he lost his life in the sinking of the {{MV|Princess Victoria}} off [[Larne Lough]], in the [[North Sea flood of 1953|Great Storm]]. He was succeeded by his daughter, [[Patricia Ford (politician)|Patricia Ford]].   He was the great-grandfather of explorer [[Bear Grylls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p24749.htm#i247489 thepeerage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''watershed stroke''' or '''watershed infarct''' is defined as a [[brain ischemia]] that is localized to the vulnerable border zones between the tissues supplied by the [[anterior cerebral artery|anterior]], [[posterior cerebral artery|posterior]] and [[middle cerebral artery|middle]] [[cerebral arteries]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathophysiology: Concepts of Altered Health States (Eighth Edition)|last=Porth|first=C.M.|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health {{!}} Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2009|isbn=978-16054-7390-1|location=Philadelphia|pages=1301|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual blood stream blockage/restriction site can be located far away from the infarcts. [[Watershed area (medical)|Watershed]] locations are those border-zone regions in the brain supplied by the major [[cerebral arteries]] where [[Circulatory system|blood supply]] is decreased. Watershed strokes are a concern because they comprise approximately 10% of all [[ischemic stroke]] cases.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt; The watershed zones themselves are particularly susceptible to infarction from [[Brain ischemia|global ischemia]] as the distal nature of the vasculature predisposes these areas to be most sensitive to profound hypoperfusion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Watershed strokes are localized to two primary regions of the brain, and are termed cortical watersheds (CWS) and internal watersheds (IWS).&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Momjian-Mayor |first1=I |last2=Baron |first2=J.C. |title=The Pathophysiology of Watershed Infarction in Internal Carotid Artery Disease: Review of Cerebral Perfusion Studies |journal=Stroke |volume=36 |pages=567–77 |year=2005 |pmid=15692123 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000155727.82242.e1 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with many different [[cardiovascular disease]]s have a higher likelihood of experiencing a [[Thrombus|blood clot]] or loss of [[blood flow]] in border-zone regions of the brain. The resulting symptoms differ based on the affected area of the brain. A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] and [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] are used for diagnosis, and afterward several treatment options are available, including the removal of [[Atherosclerosis|atherosclerotic plaque]] and a physical widening of the clogged [[blood vessel]]. Long-term care is focused around three areas: rehabilitative therapy, surgical interventions, and prevention of future watershed strokes. Going forward, research to combat watershed strokes is focusing on various topics, such as [[stem cell]] research.

==Terminology and location==
[[File:Gray's Anatomy plate 517 brain.png|thumb|Outer surface of cerebral hemisphere, showing areas supplied by cerebral arteries. Pink is the region supplied by the [[middle cerebral artery]], blue is supplied by the [[anterior cerebral artery]] and yellow is supplied by the [[posterior cerebral artery]]. Cortical watershed strokes occur at the borders between those areas.]]

Watershed strokes are named because they affect the distal watershed areas of the brain. The original terminology came from the German literature, which used the analogy of an [[irrigation]] system. The German scholars compared the blood flow in [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] [[Artery|arterial]] territories of the brain to the last field on a farm, which was the area with the least supply of water and therefore most vulnerable to any reduction in flow.&lt;ref name=Bladin&gt;{{cite journal |pages=477–8 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.24.3.477 |title=Confusing stroke terminology: Watershed or borderzone infarction? |year=1993 |last1=Bladin |first1=C. F. |last2=Chambers |first2=B. R. |last3=Donnan |first3=G. A. |journal=Stroke |volume=24 |issue=3 |pmid=8446987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a medical context, the term "watershed" refers to those areas of the brain that receive dual blood supply from the branching ends of two large arteries.&lt;ref name=Bladin/&gt;

These events are localized to two primary regions of the brain:

# [[Cerebral cortex|Cortical]] watershed strokes (CWS), or outer brain [[Infarction|infarcts]], are located between the cortical territories of the [[anterior cerebral artery]] (ACA), [[middle cerebral artery]] (MCA), and [[posterior cerebral artery]] (PCA).&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;
# Internal watershed strokes (IWS), or subcortical brain infarcts, are located in the [[white matter]] along and slightly above the [[Lateral ventricles|lateral ventricle]], between the deep and the superficial arterial systems of the MCA, or between the superficial systems of the MCA and ACA.&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;

Nonetheless, within the literature itself, there exists confusion over the terminology used to describe cortical (outer brain) infarcts and subcortical (inner brain) infarcts.  Besides watershed, border-zone is another common term used to refer to areas of the brain between the ends of two adjacent arteries. Other less used terms include: borderland, end zone, boundary zone, and terminal zone. These varying terms have arisen from the considerable [[Anatomy|anatomic]] variability  both in the cerebral vascular structure and the territories of the brain that they supply.&lt;ref name=Bladin/&gt;

==Causes and risk factors==

Watershed strokes are caused by ischemia or a lack of blood flow to the brain.&lt;ref name=Torvik&gt;{{cite journal |pages=221–3 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.15.2.221 |title=The pathogenesis of watershed infarcts in the brain |year=1984 |last1=Torvik |first1=A. |journal=Stroke |volume=15 |issue=2 |pmid=6701929}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several causes of ischemia, including [[embolism]] and [[atherosclerosis]].  There are several conditions that can predispose someone to watershed stroke by increasing the likelihood that insufficient blood supply will be able to reach the brain.  People with many different [[cardiovascular disease]]s have a higher likelihood of experiencing a clot or a plaque that impedes flow through a [[blood vessel]].&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;  Cardiovascular diseases that increase the risk of ischemia include:
*[[Heart failure|Congestive heart failure]], which can lead to an inability to pump sufficient amounts of blood to the brain
*Atherosclerosis, which can cause a buildup of cholesterol plaques in the blood vessels, thereby decreasing the volume of blood that can flow through the vessel and reach the brain&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;
*[[Angiopathy]], a disease of the blood vessels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=605–10 |doi=10.1179/016164103101202048 |title=Cerebral hypoperfusion induces cortical watershed microinfarcts which may further aggravate cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease |year=2003 |last1=Miklossy |first1=J. |journal=Neurological Research |volume=25 |issue=6 |pmid=14503014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Stroke signs and symptoms in general===

Watershed stroke symptoms are due to the reduced blood flow to all parts of the body, specifically the brain, thus leading to brain damage. Initial symptoms, as promoted by the American Stroke Association, are [[FAST (stroke)]], representing F = Facial weakness (droop), A = Arm weakness (drift), S = Speech difficulty (slur), and T = Time to act (priority of intervention).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)00966-6 |title=Rapid ambulance protocol for acute stroke |year=1999 |last1=Harbison |first1=J. |last2=Massey |first2=A. |last3=Barnett |first3=L. |last4=Hodge |first4=D. |last5=Ford |first5=G. A. |journal=The Lancet |volume=353 |issue=9168 |pmid=10371574 |pages=1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All strokes are considered a medical emergency. Any one of these symptoms, whether seen alone or in combination, should be assumed to be stroke until proven otherwise. Emergency medical help should be sought IMMEDIATELY if any or all of these symptoms are seen or experienced. Early diagnosis and timely medical intervention can drastically reduce the severity of a stroke, limit damage to the brain, improve the chances of a full recovery and reduce recovery times massively.

After the initial stroke, other symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. If one of the three [[Neural pathway|central nervous system pathways]] is affected, symptoms can include numbness, reduced sensation, and [[hyperreflexia]].

Most often, the side of the brain damaged results in body defects on the opposite side. Since the cranial nerves originate from the [[brainstem]], damage to this area can lead to defects in the function of these nerves. Symptoms can include altered breathing, problems with balance, drooping of eyelids, and decreased sensation in the face.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Martini, F, Nath, J, Bartholomew, E 2012. "Fundamentals of Anatomy &amp; Physiology.", p. 742-43. Pearson Education Inc, San Francisco. {{ISBN|9780321709332}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage to the cerebral cortex may lead to [[aphasia]] or confusion and damage to the [[cerebellum]] may lead to lack of motor movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Watershed stroke signs and symptoms===
Stroke presentations which are particularly suggestive of a watershed stroke include bilateral visual loss, stupor, and weakness of the proximal limbs, sparing the face, hands and feet.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of a cerebral vascular accident begins with a general neurological examination, used to identify specific areas of resulting injury. A [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] of the brain is then used to identify any cerebral hemorrhaging. An MRI with special sequences called diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI), is very sensitive for locating areas of an ischemic based stroke, such as a watershed stroke.

Further diagnosis and evaluation of a stroke includes evaluation of the blood vessels in the neck using either Doppler ultrasound, MR-angiography or CT-angiography, or formal angiography. An echocardiogram may be performed looking for a cardiac source of emboli. Blood tests for risk factors also may be ordered, including cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, homocysteine levels, and blood coagulation tests.

===Classification systems===
*The Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the patient's initial symptoms. Based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as [[total anterior circulation infarct]] (TACI), [[partial anterior circulation infarct]] (PACI), [[lacunar infarct]] (LACI) or [[posterior circulation infarct]] (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=1521–6 |doi=10.1016/0140-6736(91)93206-O |title=Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction |year=1991 |last1=Bamford |first1=J. |last2=Sandercock |first2=P. |last3=Dennis |first3=M. |last4=Warlow |first4=C. |last5=Burn |first5=J. |journal=The Lancet |volume=337 |issue=8756 |pmid=1675378}} Later publications distinguish between "syndrome" and "infarct", based on evidence from imaging. "Syndrome" may be replaced by "hemorrhage" if imaging demonstrates a bleed. See {{cite web |url=http://www.strokecenter.org/trials/scales/oxford.html |title=Oxford Stroke Scale |author=Internet Stroke Center |accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2–4 |doi=10.1159/000047582 |title=The Role of the Clinical Examination in the Subclassification of Stroke |year=2000 |last1=Bamford |first1=J.M. |journal=Cerebrovascular Diseases |volume=10 |pmid=11070389}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The TOAST (Trial of [[Danaparoid|Org 10172]] in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations. In this diagnostic system, a stroke is classified as being due to
# [[Thrombosis]] or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery
# Embolism of cardiac origin
# Occlusion of a small blood vessel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=35–41 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.24.1.35 |title=Classification of subtype of acute ischemic stroke.

==Pathogenesis==

Although many imaging techniques are used to document watershed strokes, their [[pathogenesis]] remains controversial. It may involve various mechanisms such as systemic hypotension, [[Embolism|microemboli]], severe arterial stenosis, ICA occlusion or a combination of these.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;

===Hypotension===

A sharp drop in [[blood pressure]] is the most frequent cause of watershed infarcts. The most frequent location for a watershed stroke is the region between the anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery. These events caused by hypotension do not usually cause the blood vessel to rupture.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt;

===Microemboli===

Microemboli have not been experimentally proven to cause watershed strokes. It is unclear whether they are a cause or an effect of a watershed stroke.&lt;ref name=Grotta&gt;{{cite journal |pages=2321–2 |doi=10.1161/01.CIR.103.19.2321|pmid=11352876 |year=2001 |last1=Grotta |first1=JC |last2=Alexandrov |first2=AV |title=Preventing stroke: Is preventing microemboli enough? |volume=103 |issue=19 |journal=Circulation}}&lt;/ref&gt; With watershed strokes, [[platelet]] aggregates block the small [[Middle meningeal artery|meningeal arteries]] in watershed regions creating a microembolism. Microemboli usually form as thrombi, and can block arteries outright. On the other hand, they often detach, move into blood circulation, and eventually block smaller downstream branches of arteries causing a thromboembolism. Generally, emboli travel as far outward as their size permits along the vascular branches of the brain. Using this hypothesis, microemboli are viewed as the cause of the infarct rather than secondary events. Nevertheless, secondary thrombi do form after infarcts, and therefore it has been difficult to distinguish between emboli and thrombi in watershed locations.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt; The best supporting evidence is correlative; patients display subcortical abnormalities on CT scans and present more microembolic signals during a [[carotid endarterectomy]].&lt;ref name=Grotta/&gt;

Microemboli can be common in some high-risk patients, such as those with carotid stenosis. However, in healthier patients strokes do not usually result from microemboli.&lt;ref name=Grotta/&gt;

===ICA occlusions===

}}

Thrombi at the split of the internal carotid artery in the neck may cause watershed infarcts between the territories of the anterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery. The resulting watershed infarcts in carotid artery blockages have mostly been considered to be due to a reduced blood flow, similar to that of hypotension.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt; Imaging studies in severe [[internal carotid artery]] (ICA) disease report an incidence of watershed stroke ranging from 19% to 64%.&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;  Almost 40% of these watershed infarcts are attributed to narrowing of the carotid artery, which produces the reduced blood flow.&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;

However, a different possible explanation has emerged. Alternatively, the vascular occlusion could be the result of microemboli from the carotid thrombi before the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] becomes completely blocked.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt; In this scenario, the clotting becomes too severe and the clot breaks free. The resulting traveling clot is known as an embolus (plural emboli). The wall of internal carotid artery just distal to the bifurcation (split) is a common site of atherosclerosis because of the unique [[Hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] effects caused by the blood flow divider. As a result, thrombi formation is more prevalent there.&lt;ref name=Grotta/&gt; In general, researches have observed that this microembolization is a frequent phenomenon during the build-up of cerebral thrombi.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt; The resulting emboli are pieces of calcified plaque. If these microemboli are 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, they might pass into the small branches of the vascular system. There they may be destroyed by protective cellular defenses, or they may cause a stroke.&lt;ref name=Grotta/&gt; Altogether, these considerations suggest that the watershed infarcts in carotid thrombosis are caused by microembolization from mural thrombi, thrombi adherent to the vessel wall, rather than by blood flow disturbances.&lt;ref name=Torvik/&gt;

==Treatment==

===Carotid endarterectomy===
Often considered one of the safest ways to treat symptomatic carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is a procedure by which a surgeon gently removes atherosclerotic plaque. Blood flow hopefully then returns to normal, increasing oxygen concentration to normal amounts in watershed areas of the brain.

There is the potential for complications, including disturbing portions of the plaque leading to a stroke or heart attack during or after surgery. Small risks of bleeding and infection exist as well.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sharma|first2=J.|last3=Snyder|first3=K. V.|last4=Natarajan|first4=S. K.|last5=Siddiqui|first5=A. H.|last6=Hopkins|first6=L. N.|last7=Levy|first7=E. I.|year=2009|title=Safety, Effectiveness, and Practicality of Endovascular Therapy Within the First 3 Hours of Acute Ischemic Stroke Onset|url=|journal=Neurosurgery|volume=65|issue=5|pages=860–5; discussion 865|doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000358953.19069.E5|via=|last1=Mathews|first1=Marlon S.|pmid=19834397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percutaneous treatments of carotid stenosis===
In this type of procedure, a narrowed blood vessel is expanded via angioplasty or stenting. A thin angiography catheter is inserted in a large groin blood vessel and advanced to the stenosis. Percutaneous treatment is less invasive than endarterectomy, usually requiring only local anesthesia. Endarterectomy is still considered safer though, as percutaneous treatments can lead to accidental dislodging of plaque or even arterial rupturing.&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt;

====Carotid angioplasty====
During carotid [[angioplasty]], an angiography cather with a small deflated balloon attached on the tip is advanced to a carotid stenosis. The ballon is then inflated slowly, forcing the narrowed portion of the vessel to expand.

====Carotid stenting====
Carotid stenting follows a similar procedure. Rather than using a balloon, a stent (metal mesh-like tube) is placed over the atherosclerotic plaque in the hopes of stabilizing it and allowing for increased blood flow to watershed portions of the brain.

==Long-term care and rehabilitation==

Watershed strokes are seldom fatal, but they can lead to neuromuscular degeneration, as well as [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt;  This degeneration at the watershed regions of the brain can lead to difficulties with movement and motor coordination, as well as speech.  Long-term care is focused around three areas: rehabilitative therapy, surgical interventions, and prevention of future watershed strokes.

===Rehabilitative therapies===
Long-term rehabilitative therapy for watershed stroke patients involves physical, occupational, and speech and language therapies.  Physical therapy can be used to enhance motor function in the legs and arms that has been impacted by stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hunter|first2=S.|last3=Sim|first3=J.|last4=Crome|first4=P.|year=2011|title=Hands-on therapy interventions for upper limb motor dysfunction following stroke|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=6|pages=CD006609|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006609.pub2|pmid=21678359|via=|last1=Winter|first1=Jackie|editor1-last=Winter|editor1-first=Jackie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapies]] can be provided to help to alleviate cognitive impairments that result from watershed stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bennett|first2=S.|last3=Koh|first3=C. L.|last4=McKenna|first4=K. T.|year=2010|title=Occupational therapy for cognitive impairment in stroke patients|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=9|pages=CD006430|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006430.pub2|pmid=20824849|via=|last1=Hoffmann|first1=Tammy|editor1-last=Hoffmann|editor1-first=Tammy}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to improve fine motor function that was damaged as a result of the stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.39343.466863.55 |title=Occupational therapy for patients with problems in personal activities of daily living after stroke: Systematic review of randomised trials |year=2007 |last1=Legg |first1=L. |last2=Drummond |first2=A. |last3=Leonardi-Bee |first3=J. |last4=Gladman |first4=J R F |last5=Corr |first5=S. |last6=Donkervoort |first6=M. |last7=Edmans |first7=J. |last8=Gilbertson |first8=L. |last9=Jongbloed |first9=L. |last10=Logan |first10=P. |last11=Sackley |first11=C. |last12=Walker |first12=M. |last13=Langhorne |first13=P. |journal=BMJ |volume=335 |issue=7626 |pmid=17901469 |pmc=2048861 |pages=922|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stroke can also cause impairments in speech production secondary to neurocognitive and neuromuscular impairments, and therefore speech and language therapies are often a component of long-term care for stroke patients.  Intensive speech and language therapy has been shown to improve speech deficits associated with [[aphasia]] resulting from stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Kelly|first2=H.|last3=Godwin|first3=J.|last4=Enderby|first4=P.|last5=Campbell|first5=P.|year=2016|title=Speech and language therapy for language problems after a stroke|url=|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=|issue=6|pages=1–4|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000425.pub4|pmid=27245310|via=|last1=Brady|first1=Marian C|editor1-last=Brady|editor1-first=Marian C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical interventions===

Endovascular interventions, including surgical [[revascularization]], can increase blood flow in the area of the stroke, thereby decreasing the likelihood that insufficient blood flow to the watershed regions of the brain will result in subsequent strokes.&lt;ref name="Pmid" /&gt;  Neuroscientists are currently researching stem cell transplantation therapies to improve recovery of cebreral tissue in affected areas of the brain post-stroke.  Should this intervention be proven effective, it will greatly increase the number of neurons in the brain that can recover from a stroke.&lt;ref name="pmid21499328"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lukomska|first2=B.|year=2011|title=Stroke induced brain changes: Implications for stem cell transplantation|url=http://www.ane.pl/linkout.php?pii=7107|journal=Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis|volume=71|issue=1|pages=74–85|pmid=21499328|via=|last1=Jablonska|first1=A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevention of future strokes===

There are several interventions that are often used to help prevent the recurrence of a watershed stroke; namely, nutritional interventions, as well as antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and statin drug use.  Nutritional interventions, including increased consumption of certain [[amino acid]]s, [[antioxidant]]s, [[B vitamins|B-group vitamins]], and zinc, have been shown to increase the recovery of neurocognitive function after a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=339–45 |doi=10.1177/0884533611405793 |title=Nutrition for Brain Recovery After Ischemic Stroke: An Added Value to Rehabilitation |year=2011 |last1=Aquilani |first1=R. |last2=Sessarego |first2=P. |last3=Iadarola |first3=P. |last4=Barbieri |first4=A. |last5=Boschi |first5=F. |journal=Nutrition in Clinical Practice |volume=26 |issue=3 |pmid=21586419}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antiplatelet drug]]s, such as aspirin, as well as [[anticoagulant]]s, are used to help prevent blood clots and therefore embolisms, which can cause watershed strokes.  [[Statin]] drugs are also used to control hyperlipidemia, another risk factor for watershed stroke.

==Current and future research==

===Stem cell transplantation===
Ischemic stroke is still a major health concern and studies are being conducted to determine the pathway in which brain damage occurs to identify targets for intervention.  Stem cell transplantation may help in intervention to improve cell recovery and regeneration.&lt;ref name=pmid21499328/&gt;

===Strokes after cardiac surgery===
Although the mechanism is not entirely understood, the likelihood of a watershed stroke increases after cardiac surgery. An experiment conducted in a five-year span studied the diagnosis, etiology, and outcome of these postoperative strokes. It was observed that intraoperative decrease in blood pressure may lead to these strokes and patients who have undergone aortic procedures are more likely to have bilateral watershed infarcts. Furthermore, bilateral watershed strokes are associated with poor short-term outcomes and are most reliably observed by diffusion-weighted imaging MRI. Thus future clinical research and practice should focus on the identification of bilateral stroke characteristics. This identification can help discover affected areas and increase correct diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sherman|first2=P. M.|last3=Grega|first3=M. A.|last4=Yousem|first4=D.

F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deep watershed infarcts===
Hemodynamic impairment is thought to be the cause of deep watershed infarcts, characterized by a rosary-like pattern. However new studies have shown that microembolism might also contribute to the development of deep watershed infarcts. The dual contribution of hemodynamic impairment and microembolism would result in different treatment for patients with these specific infarcts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Momjian-Mayor|first2=I.|last3=Jones|first3=P.

R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basilar artery (BA) stenting===
While intracranial artery stenting is used for same side stoke prevention, [[basilar artery]] stenting may help to improve parallel, accessory blood flow. The stent may also lead to termination of recurrent middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnis.2009.001958 |title=Use of far field basilar artery stenting for recurrent middle cerebral artery ischemia |year=2010 |last1=Titsworth |first1=W |last2=Civelek |first2=A |last3=Abou-Chebl |first3=A |journal=Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery |volume=3 |pages=57–61 |pmid=21990791 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Penumbra imaging===
The area around the damaged ischemia is known as the penumbra. This viable area has the ability to regenerate with the help of pharmacological treatment however most patients with penumbra are left untreated. New research is being conducted in metabolic suppression, direct energy delivery, and selective drug delivery to help salvage this area of the brain after a stroke.&lt;ref name=pmid20607107&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20607107 |year=2010 |last1=Liu |first1=S |last2=Levine |first2=S |last3=Winn |first3=H |title=Targeting ischemic penumbra: Part I - from pathophysiology to therapeutic strategy |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=47–55 |pmc=2896002 |journal=Journal of experimental stroke &amp; translational medicine |doi=10.6030/1939-067x-3.1.47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CLEVSRKNC peptide====
This new drug has been shown to home to ischemic stroke tissue as well as [[Apoptosis|apoptotic]] neuronal cells of the penumbra region. This discovery may help in creating selective drug delivery for stroke patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=167–72 |doi=10.1016/j.jconrel.2008.07.020 |title=Detection of apoptosis in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia using a homing peptide selected from in vivo phage display |year=2008 |last1=Hong |first1=H |last2=Choi |first2=J |last3=Kim |first3=Y |last4=Lee |first4=H |last5=Kwak |first5=W |last6=Yoo |first6=J |last7=Lee |first7=J |last8=Kwon |first8=T |last9=Kim |first9=In-S |last10=Han |first10=H |last11=Lee |first11=B |journal=Journal of Controlled Release |volume=131 |issue=3 |pmid=18692101|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liposomal drug delivery====
Nanoliposomes are currently being researched for specific drug delivery due to their ph-sensitive and high [[blood–brain barrier]] diffusion characteristics. Many advantages of these drugs include:
#Drugs can be maintained in the active state while encapsulated.
#Being encapsulated provides direct access to target tissue
#Prevention of non-specific binding
#Allows for a high concentration of drug
Due to the fact that acidic environment and low blood flow are prominent characteristic of the penumbra area, [[Liposome|liposomal]] drugs seem to be well suited.&lt;ref name=pmid20607107/&gt;

'''William McMaster Murdoch''' (28 February 1873 – 15 April 1912) was a Scottish sailor who served as [[Chief mate|First Officer]] aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}}. He was notable as the officer in charge when the Titanic collided with an iceberg. Mystery also surrounds his death.

Born from a family of sailors, William Murdoch was an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve; he was employed by the [[White Star Line]] in 1900 and quickly rose to the rank of [[Officer#Shipping industry|officer]]. In 1903, his leadership became recognized when he avoided a collision with the ''[[SS Arabic (1902)|Arabic]]''. In April 1912, Murdoch served as [[Chief mate|First Officer]] aboard the {{RMS|Titanic}}. He is notable as the officer in charge on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] the night the ''Titanic'' struck an iceberg in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. He was one of 1,500 people who died in the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Walter Lord | title=A Night To Remember | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murdoch became an iconic British hero, a status that is maintained and reflected by the memorial in his hometown of [[Dalbeattie]]. However, debate revolves around the adequacy of instructions given to avoid the iceberg.

In the aftermath of the sinking, a number of eyewitness testimonies arose of a shooting/suicide by an officer during the launching of the last lifeboat. Though these facts are unconfirmed, it is possible that Murdoch was that officer.

Murdoch has become a figure of controversy, with mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death and his actions during the collision with the iceberg.

==Life and career==
Murdoch was born in [[Dalbeattie]] in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]] (now [[Dumfries and Galloway]]), [[Scotland]], the fourth son of Captain Samuel Murdoch, a master mariner, and Jane Muirhead, six of whose children survived infancy. They were a long and notable line of Scottish seafarers who sailed the world's oceans as early as the 19th century. His father and grandfather were both sea captains as were four of his grandfather's brothers.

Murdoch was educated first at the old Primary School in High Street, and then at the [[Dalbeattie High School]] in Alpine Street until he gained his diploma in 1887. Finishing schooling, he followed in the family seafaring tradition and was apprenticed for five years to ''William Joyce &amp; Coy'', [[Liverpool]], but after four years (and four voyages) he was so competent that he passed his [[second mate]]'s Certificate on his first attempt.

He served his apprenticeship aboard the ''Charles Cosworth'' of Liverpool, trading to the west coast of [[South America]]. From May 1895, he was First Mate on the ''St. Cuthbert'', which sank in a hurricane off [[Uruguay]] in 1897. Murdoch gained his Extra Master's Certificate at Liverpool in 1896, at age 23. From 1897 to 1899, he was First Officer aboard the ''J. Joyce &amp; Co.'' steel four-masted 2,534-ton barque Lydgate, that traded from New York to Shanghai.
[[File:William Murdoch in his 30s.jpg|thumb|right|Murdoch in his 30s]]
[[File:William McMaster Murdoch in RMS Olympic.jpg|thumb|From left to right: Murdoch, Chief Officer Joseph Evans, Fourth Officer David Alexander and Captain Edward J. Smith, all as seen on the '' Olympic'']]
From 1900 to 1912, Murdoch gradually progressed from Second Officer to First Officer, serving on a successive number of White Star Line vessels, [[SS Medic|''Medic'']] (1900, along with [[Charles Lightoller]], ''Titanic''{{'}}s second officer), [[SS Runic (1900)|''Runic'']] (1901–1903), [[SS Arabic (1902)|''Arabic'']] (1903), [[RMS Celtic (1901)|''Celtic'']] (1904), [[SS Germanic (1874)|''Germanic'']] (1904), [[RMS Oceanic (1899)|''Oceanic'']] (1905), [[RMS Cedric|''Cedric'']] (1906), [[RMS Adriatic (1906)|''Adriatic'']] (1907–1911) and [[RMS Olympic|''Olympic'']] (1911–1912).

In 1903, Murdoch met a 29-year-old [[New Zealand]] school teacher named Ada Florence Banks en route to [[England]] on either the ''Runic'' or the ''Medic''. They began to correspond regularly and on 2 September 1907 they were wed in [[Southampton]] at St Deny's Church.

During 1903, Murdoch finally reached the stormy and glamorous ''North Atlantic'' run as Second Officer of the new liner ''[[SS Arabic (1902)|Arabic]]''. His cool head, quick thinking and professional judgement averted a disaster when a ship was spotted bearing down on the ''Arabic'' out of the darkness. He overrode a command from his superior, Officer Fox, to steer hard-a-port, rushing into the wheelhouse, brushing aside the quartermaster and holding the ship on course. The two ships passed within inches of one another. Any alteration in course would have actually caused a collision.

The final stage of Murdoch's career began in May 1911, when he joined the new {{RMS|Olympic}}, at {{convert|45000|LT|t|lk=on|abbr=on}}. Intended to outclass the ''[[Cunard Line|Cunard]]'' ships in luxury and size, it needed the most experienced large-liner crew that the ''White Star Line'' could find. Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]] assembled a crew that included [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]] as Chief Officer, Murdoch as First Officer, and Chief Purser Herbert McElroy. On 14 June 1911 Olympic departed on her maiden voyage to New York, arriving there on the 21st.

The first indications of what was to come occurred on 20 September when the ''Olympic'' had her hull badly damaged in a collision with the Royal Navy cruiser ''HMS Hawke''. Since Murdoch was at his docking-station at the stern during this collision – a highly responsible position – he found himself giving evidence in the inquiry into an incident that turned into a financial disaster for the White Star Line, as the voyage to New York had to be abandoned and the ship taken to [[Belfast]] for repairs, which took a good six weeks. It was thus not until 11 December 1911 that Murdoch rejoined the ship. During the time that he served aboard as First Officer (until some time in March, 1912) there were two further – though lesser – incidents, striking a sunken wreck and having to have a broken propeller replaced, and nearly running aground while leaving [[Belfast]]. However, upon reaching [[Southampton]], he learned that he had been appointed as Chief Officer of the new ''Titanic'', the ''Olympic'''s sister ship and reputedly the largest and most luxurious one afloat. Lightoller later remarked that "three very contented chaps" headed north to Belfast, for he had been appointed First Officer, and their friend Davy Blair was to be the new second officer. Awaiting them would be an old '' Adriatic'' hand, [[Joseph Boxhall|Joseph Groves Boxhall]], as Fourth Officer, and others who would be familiar colleagues, including the now aging Edward J. Smith as Captain and on the verge of retirement.

==''Titanic''==
{{main|Sinking of the RMS Titanic}}
Murdoch, with an "ordinary master's certificate" and a reputation as a "canny and dependable man", had climbed through the ranks of the White Star Line to become one of its foremost senior officers. He was selected to be the ''Titanic''{{'}}s Chief Officer, with 16 years of maritime experience now behind him.

Murdoch had originally been assigned as the ship's Chief Officer, though when the ''Titanic''{{'}}s skipper, Edward J. Smith, brought [[Henry Tingle Wilde|Henry Wilde]], his Chief from his previous command, Murdoch was temporarily reduced to First while First Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] was in turn reduced to Second. The original Second, [[David Blair (mariner)|David Blair]], would sit out the voyage altogether while the rest of the ship's complement of officers remained unchanged.

[[Image:Titanic Bridge and Crow's Nest.png|thumb|right|150px|Murdoch was on the navigation bridge of the Titanic at the time of the collision with the iceberg.]]
Murdoch was the officer in charge on the bridge when at approximately 11:40 pm on 14 April 1912 a large iceberg directly in the ''Titanic'''s path was sighted. Quartermaster [[Robert Hichens (RMS Titanic)|Robert Hichens]], who was at the helm, and Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, who may or may not have been on the bridge during the collision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marconigraph.com/titanic/grounding/grounding2.html |website=marconigraph.com |title=Appendix II: STOP Command / "Porting Around" Maneuver
|quote=Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall reported during the Enquiry that upon arriving on the bridge after the fact, he saw both telegraph handles pointing to FULL ASTERN, and heard Murdoch report that the engines had been reversed to Captain Smith. This, in effect, has led historians to believe that Murdoch rang down a 'crash stop.' |accessdate=23 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; both stated that Murdoch gave the order "Hard-a-starboard",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/item/1485/ |work=Encyclopedia Titanica |title=Hard a-starboard |author=Nathan Robison |date=12 February 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic Inquiry Project – United States Senate Inquiry |website=titanicinquiry.org |url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq10Boxhall03.php }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Robert Hichens (Quartermaster, SS Titanic)|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/USInq/AmInq05Hichens01.php|work=Titanic Inquiry Project - United States Senate Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tiller command which would turn the ship to [[port (nautical)|port]] (left) by moving the tiller to [[starboard]] (right).

At the time steering instructions on British ships generally followed the way tillers on sailing vessels are operated, with turns in the opposite direction from the commands.  As [[Walter Lord]] noted in ''The Night Lives On'', this did not fully change to the "steering wheel" system of commands in the same directions as turns until 1924.  It has been alleged that Murdoch's orders were misinterpreted by the helmsman, resulting in a turn the wrong way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8016752/Titanic-sunk-by-steering-blunder-new-book-claims.html |title=Titanic sunk by steering blunder, new book claims |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boxhall]] also reported that Murdoch set the [[Engine order telegraph|ship's telegraph]] to "Full Astern", though his testimony was contradicted by [[Oiler (occupation)|Greaser]] Frederick Scott and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett who stated that the stoking indicators went from "Full" to "Stop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marconigraph.com/titanic/grounding/grounding2.html |website=marconigraph.com |title=STOP Command / "Porting Around" Maneuver }}&lt;/ref&gt; During or right before the collision he may have also given an order (as heard by Quartermaster Alfred Oliver when he walked onto the bridge in the middle of the collision) of "Hard a'port"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marconigraph.com/titanic/grounding/grounding2.html |website=marconigraph.com |title=STOP Command / "Porting Around" Maneuver}}&lt;/ref&gt; (moving the tiller all the way to the port (left) side turning the ship to starboard (right)) in what may have been an attempt to swing the remainder ([[Stern|aft]] section) away from the berg in a common manoeuvre called a "port around"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/murdochmystery/Last_Log_of_the_Titanic.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031028123941/http://www.geocities.com/murdochmystery/Last_Log_of_the_Titanic.html |archivedate=28 October 2003 |title="Last Log of the Titanic" -Four Revisionist Theories – a ''"port around"'' or S-curve manoeuvre in which ''"the bow is first turned away from the object, then the helm is shifted (turned the other way) to clear the stern"'' |accessdate=12 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (this could explain his comment to the captain ''"I intended to port around it"''). The fact that such a manoeuvre was executed was supported by other crew members who testified that the stern of the ship never hit the iceberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://marconigraph.com/titanic/grounding/grounding2.html |website=marconigraph.com |title=STOP Command / "Porting Around" Maneuver |quote=SENATOR BURTON: Do you not think that if the helm had been hard astarboard the bow would have been up against the berg? QUARTERMASTER GEORGE ROWE: It stands to reason it would, sir, if the helm were hard astarboard. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The orders that Murdoch gave to avoid the iceberg are debated. According to nearby Quartermaster Alfred Oliver, he immediately ordered the helm "hard to port" to ward off the stern of the iceberg. Hichens and the Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall made no mention of the order. However, since the stern avoided the iceberg, it is likely that the order was given and carried out.&lt;ref name=MC155&gt;{{harvsp|Mark Chirnside|2004|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvsp|Gérard Piouffre|2009|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these efforts the ship made its fatal collision in an estimated 37 seconds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.titanic-model.com/db/db-02/rm-db-2.html |title=titanic-model.com, '&amp;#39;'Titanic and the Iceberg'&amp;#39;' – By Roy Mengot |publisher=Titanic-model.com |date=1912-04-14 |accessdate=2013-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920234448/http://titanic-model.com/db/db-02/rm-db-2.html |archivedate=20 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; after the iceberg had been sighted. The starboard side scraped the iceberg, buckling the hull in several places and causing [[rivet]]s to pop out below the waterline, opening the first five compartments (the forward peak tank, the three forward holds and Boiler Room 6) to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lostliners/titanic.html |title=The whole impact had lasted only 10 seconds |publisher=Pbs.org |date=1912-04-10 |accessdate=2013-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collision, Murdoch was put in charge of the starboard evacuation during which he launched ten lifeboats, containing almost 75% of the total number who survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William McMaster Murdoch, Titanic hero unstuck in time |author=Charles Pellegrino |url=http://members.lycos.co.uk/murdochmystery/Starboard_Evacuation.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was last seen attempting to launch Collapsible Lifeboat A.{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=316}} Murdoch perished in the sinking and his body was never recovered.

===Death===
In the days and weeks immediately following the sinking of the Titanic, it was widely rumored that Murdoch had committed suicide in the ship's final moments, by shooting himself with a revolver shortly before the vessel foundered. Several passengers, including Third Class Passenger Eugene Daly and First class passenger George Rheims, claimed to have seen an officer committing suicide in the ship's final moments. Murdoch was right where many of the suicide accounts place the shooting – at the forward lifeboat station on the starboard side.
 
Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] denied the rumors, saying that he saw Murdoch working to free Collapsible A, when Murdoch was swept into the sea by the wave washing over the boat deck, and that "other reports as to the ending are absolutely false".&lt;ref name="williammurdoch1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williammurdoch.net/mystery03_alternative_01_lightoller.html|title=Charles Herbert Lightoller- William Murdoch|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jT-8P9ykSkcC&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96&amp;dq=titanic+101+things+bride+smith&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Cvz5Tmt-Vz&amp;sig=zZMkJX01bUinkXMNwCNGa8wFZMY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MR_oUfjnB6Hm4QSG8ICoCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA 101 Things You Thought You Knew about the Titanic - But Didn't!] at Google Books.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lightoller's testimony at the US inquiry suggests that he was not in a position to witness Murdoch being swept into the sea. It is also possible that Lightoller may have wanted to conceal the suicide, if it occurred, from Murdoch's widow. Later in life, Lightoller is said to have admitted that he "knew someone who committed suicide that night" but never said who.&lt;ref name="williammurdoch1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="google1"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Shortly after the sinking of the Titanic, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' published a story about [[Rigel (dog)|Rigel]], a dog reportedly owned by Murdoch who saved some of the survivors from the sinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williammurdoch.net/articles_09_Murdochs_herioc_dog_Rigel.html |title=Did Murdoch Have a Heroic Dog Named 'Rigel'?|website=williammurdoch.net |accessdate=28 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the story was widely reproduced, contemporary analyses cast doubt on whether the dog actually existed.{{sfn|Maltin|Aston|2011|p=176}}

[[File:Dalbeattie William McMaster Murdoch memorial.jpg|thumb|right|The memorial to William Murdoch in Dalbeattie.]]
In Murdoch's home town of [[Dalbeattie]], [[Dumfries and Galloway]], Scotland, there is a memorial to his heroism and a charitable prize has been established in his name. The charitable prize was given a donation by the James Cameron film for its portrayal of him after the residents of Dalbeattie complained.

In April 2012, [[Premier Exhibitions]] announced that it had identified Murdoch's belongings from a prior expedition to the wreck of the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|Titanic]] in 2000. There was a toiletry kit, a spare White Star Line officer's button, a  straight razor, a shoe brush, a smoking pipe, and a pair of long johns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-ap-exclusive-titanic-artifacts-linked-to-officer-2012apr03-story.html|title=AP Exclusive: Titanic artifacts linked to officer|publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=April 3, 2012|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The items were recovered by David Concannon, Ralph White and Anatoly Sagalevitch diving in the Russian submersible Mir 1 in July 2000.

The reported incident of Murdoch's suicide has been portrayed in the 1996 miniseries and the 1997 film. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the latter, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as destroying Murdoch's heroic reputation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/50203.stm |title=Nephew angered by tarnishing of Titanic hero |publisher=BBC News |date=24 January 1998 |accessdate=19 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and studio executives later flew to Murdoch's hometown to issue an apology for this depiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/78839.stm |work=BBC News |title=Titanic makers say sorry |date=15 April 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cameron, then, his depiction of Murdoch was not of a man "gone bad", a "cowardly murderer", but of an "honorable man" who accepts full collective responsibility for the predicament they are in and for the death of 1,500 that were shortly to occur. He was overwhelmed by feelings of desperation and makes the ultimate payment by sacrificing his own life. He added, "I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism."&lt;ref&gt;James Cameron's Titanic, p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt; This is perhaps why Murdoch has the privilege of being among those seen in Rose's "dream sequence" at the end of the film, implying his heroic reputation. He is shown standing next to [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], smiling as Rose drifts by and clapping along with the rest of the crowd of happy onlookers as she and Jack kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williammurdoch.net/articles_02_celluloid_portrayal%20_07_1997.html |title=Murdoch |website=williammurdoch.net |accessdate=23 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joel Woolf Barnato'''&lt;ref name=WBName group=note&gt;Pronounced Barnatoo — from [[Barney Barnato#Background|Barnett too]]&lt;/ref&gt; (27 September 1895 – 27 July 1948) was a British [[financier]] and [[auto racing|racing driver]], one of the "[[Bentley Boys]]" of the 1920s. He achieved three consecutive wins out of three entries in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race.

==Early life==
The youngest son of Fanny Bees and [[Barney Barnato]], who had made a fortune as a "[[Randlord]]" in South African diamond and gold mining, he was a relative of the [[Joel family]] of entrepreneurs.

Born at [[Spencer House (St. James's, London, England)|Spencer House]], 27 St James's Place, London, he had a sister Leah Primrose (died 1933) and brother Isaac "Jack" Henry (died 1918 of bronchial pneumonia). The family divided their time between London, [[Brighton]], [[Colwyn Bay]] and South Africa.

In 1897, when Woolf two years old, his father died near [[Madeira]] during a sea crossing from South Africa to London. The official verdict was suicide ('death by drowning while temporarily insane'). Woolf hence inherited his father's fortune at the time, but with the monies placed in [[trust law|trust]], he only inherited his first instalment of £250,000, in 1914 aged 19. In addition, Woolf benefited from a further inheritance after the murder of [[Joel family|Woolf Barnato Joel]] in Johannesburg in 1898.

Barnato was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].

==Sports==
Barnato's attitude to a new sport that took his interests, was to immerse himself in the learning process, practising endlessly and taking lessons only from the very best instructors he could find.  His desire to excel at whatever he attempted was considerable.

He collected prizes (including the 1925 Duke of York Trophy) for motor boat racing, using his Bentley-powered boat 'Ardenrun V', a good amateur boxer and a keen shot.  He bred horses whilst at his house Ardenrun, and hunted with the Old Surrey and Burstow Foxhounds. He was a strong swimmer, and also played tennis to 'country house level'. He took golf lessons at Coombe Hill Golf Club, Kingston, Surrey, with the club professional Archie Compston, a friend of [[King Edward VIII]].

==Career==
Barnato served as an officer in the [[Royal Field Artillery]], [[British Army]] in [[World War I]]. Serving in France, Egypt and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he attained the rank of captain in the latter stages of the war.

Having claimed a share of the business's profits from 1897 to 1916, in 1917 he broke off his business arrangements with the Joels. After a long legal dispute in South Africa, Woolf settled for £900,000 plus £50,000 in costs. He then sued his family for the £50,000, as well as £23,883 for disbursements.

Following settlement of the case, Barnato played [[first-class cricket]], appearing as [[wicket-keeper]] with [[Surrey County Cricket Club]] from 1928 to 1930.

==W. O. Bentley==
{{main|Bentley}}
[[File:1929 Bentley front 34 right.jpg|thumb|1929 [[Bentley Blower|"Blower" Bentley]]]]
Barnato acquired his first Bentley (a 3-litre) in 1925, just 12 months before he also acquired the business itself. With this car he won numerous [[Brooklands]] races. He was a member of a social set of wealthy British motorists known as the "[[Bentley Boys]]" who favoured the cars of [[W. O. Bentley]]. Many were independently wealthy, often with a background in military service. Barnato was [[List of motorsports people by nickname#B|nickname]]d '''"Babe"''', in ironic deference to his [[heavyweight boxer]]'s build.

Inspired by the 1924 Le Mans win by [[John Duff]] and [[Frank Clement (racing driver)|Frank Clement]], Barnato agreed to finance Bentley's business. Barnato had incorporated ''Baromans Ltd'' in 1922, which effectively existed as his finance and investment vehicle. Via Baromans, Barnato initially invested in excess of £100,000, saving the company and its workforce. A subsequent agreed wind-up of the original Bentley company was agreed, with all existing creditors paid off for £75,000, but with existing shares devalued from £1.00 each to just 1 shilling, or 5% or their original value. Barnato held 149,500 of the new shares, meaning that he controlled the company, and became chairman. Barnato injected further cash into the business: £35,000 as a debenture in July 1927; £40,000 in 1928; £25,000 in 1929.

With renewed financial input, W. O. Bentley was able to design another generation of cars, the six-cylinder [[Bentley 6.5 Litre|6½&amp;nbsp;Litre]]. However, the [[supercharger|supercharged]] 4½&amp;nbsp;Litre (the famous [[Blower Bentley|"Blower" Bentley]]), which Barnato pushed through against Bentley's wishes, had poor durability and failed on the track.

The [[Wall Street Crash]] of 1929 affected the Bentley business greatly, with the [[Great Depression]] reducing demand for the company's expensive products. In July 1931 two mortgage payments on the firm that were guaranteed by Barnato fell due, and accepting the inevitable, he advised the lenders that he was "unable to meet these debts." On 10 July, on the application of the mortgagee, the court appointed a Receiver to Bentley Motors Limited.&lt;ref&gt;Receiver Appointed Of Bentley Motors Limited Re Bentley Motors Limited; London Life Association Limited v. Bentley Motors Limited, And Woolf Barnato. ''The Times'', Saturday, 11 Jul 1931; pg. 4; Issue 45872&lt;/ref&gt; After a period where it appeared that [[Napier &amp; Son|Napier]] was going to acquire the business, the firm passed into the hands of [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] in November 1931 for the sum of £125,000 after a sealed bid auction.

Barnato received around £42,000 in return for his shares in the business, having bought a sizeable stake in Rolls-Royce not long before Bentley Motors was liquidated. By 1934 he was again on the board of Bentley Motors (1931) Ltd.

==Motor racing==
Barnato first went motor racing in 1921, when after importing an eight-litre [[Locomobile Company of America|Locomobile]] from the [[United States]], he signed-up to race at the [[Brooklands]] [[Easter]] meeting.&lt;ref name=ClassicDriver/&gt; Having come third in the 100-mile Long Handicap, he then swapped to a [[Calthorpe cars|Calthorpe]] to compete in the following [[Whitsun]] meeting.&lt;ref name=ClassicDriver/&gt; For the 1922 season he bought a 1921 chassis [[Talbot]] directly from its owner/driver [[Malcolm Campbell]],&lt;ref name=ClassicDriver/&gt; and for 1923 a [[Alastair Miller|Sir Alastair Miller]] customised-racing [[Wolseley Racing]] [[Wolseley Moth|Moth]].&lt;ref name=ClassicDriver/&gt; At the start of the 1924 season Barnato obtained an eight-litre [[Hispano-Suiza]] [[Hispano-Suiza H6|H6C]] chassis, which he commissioned [[Jarvis of Wimbledon]] to build a suitable racing body for. Barnato then established an eight-litre class racing record for the car.&lt;ref name=ClassicDriver&gt;https://www.classicdriver.com/en/article/classic-life/woolf-babe-barnato-gentleman-driver&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1924 he obtained a prototype [[Bentley 3 Litre]] chassis, which was subsequently fitted with a boat-tail body by Jarvis for a cost of £400.&lt;ref name=ClassicDriver/&gt; Barnato used the car to win several major Brooklands races, and then partnered by [[John Duff]] set a new 3 Litre 24-hour record averaging {{convert|95.03|mph}} at [[Autodrome de Montlhéry]].&lt;ref name="ClassicDriver"/&gt; Barnato later won the Brooklands Six Hour Race and Double Twelve Race in 1930. He was regarded by W. O. Bentley as, "The best driver we ever had and, I consider, the best British driver of his day. One who never made a mistake and always obeyed orders."

===Le Mans===
As a driver, Barnato won the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] race three times:
*1928 — with [[Bernard Rubin]] in a Bentley 4½&amp;nbsp;Litre
*1929 — with [[Tim Birkin|Sir Henry "Tim" Birkin]] in a [[Bentley Speed Six]] ("Old Number One")
*1930 — with [[Glen Kidston]] in a Bentley Speed Six  ("Old Number One")

As these were the only years in which he entered the race, Barnato is the only Le Mans driver with a perfect wins-to-starts ratio. Bentley, under his chairmanship, also won the race in 1927, with [[Dudley Benjafield|Dr. J. Dudley "Benjy" Benjafield]] and [[S. C. H. "Sammy" Davis]] in a Bentley 3&amp;nbsp;Litre.

===The Blue Train Races===
{{main|Blue Train Races}}
In March 1930 at the [[Carlton Cannes|Carlton Hotel]], [[Cannes]], during the [[Blue Train Races]], Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on [[Rover Company|Rover]] and its [[Rover Light Six]]. Having raced and beaten ''[[Le Train Bleu]]'' for the first time, Barnato claimed that he could not only beat the Blue Train from Cannes to Calais, but could reach London in his 6½ Litre [[Bentley Speed Six]] before the train even reached [[Calais]], on a bet of 100 [[pounds sterling]].

He set off from the bar of the Carlton Hotel at just before 6pm on 13 March, accompanied by his friend Dale Bourne as unofficial co-driver. They stopped for fuel at [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Lyon]], [[Auxerre]] and [[Paris]]. He arrived at the docks in [[Boulogne]] at 10:30 am on 14 March, in time for the 11:30 sailing to [[Folkestone]]. Barnato reached Dale Bourne's club (the Conservative) in [[St James's]], London, at around 3:30 pm, having covered the {{convert|830|mi}} in 22½ hrs, at an average speed of {{convert|43.43|mph}}.

Barnato drove an [[H. J. Mulliner &amp; Co.|H. J. Mulliner]]-bodied [[Saloon (car)|formal saloon]] in the race; the streamlined fastback "Sportsman Coupé" by [[J Gurney Nutting &amp; Co Limited|Gurney Nutting]] which he took delivery of on 21 May 1930 also became known as the ''[[Blue Train Bentley]]'' and is regularly mistaken for or erroneously referred to as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecarpage.com/car/1698/Bentley-Speed-Six--Blue-Train-Special-.html|title=Bentley Speed Six 'Blue Train Special'|last=Melissen|first=Wouter|date=12 January 2004|work=UltimateCarPage|accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html |title=The Slippery Shape of Power |last=Burgess-Wise |first=David |date=1 January 2006 |work=Auto Aficionado |accessdate=4 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916204901/http://www.autoaficionado.net/issue/0101-38.html |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further confusion is caused by the well-known painting by [[Terence Cuneo]] which depicts the Gurney Nutting car.  Both vehicles are still in existence.

==Later life==
From 1940 to 1945, Barnato was a [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] with the [[Royal Air Force]], responsible for the protection of aircraft factories against [[Nazi]] [[Luftwaffe]] bombing raids. He continued various low-key business opportunities out of his office on Park Lane.

==Personal life==
Barnato was married three times:
*Dorothy Maitland Falk: 1915–1933, two daughters Virginia and [[Diana Barnato Walker|Diana]]
*Jacqueline Claridge {{Not a typo|Quealy}}: 1933–1947. The daughter of a wealthy American colliery owner; the couple had two sons Michael Jay, and Peter Woolf (1934–1959; died of cancer, San Francisco){{citation needed|date=August 2012}}
*Joan Jenkinson:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/inchiquin1543.htm&lt;/ref&gt; December 1947 – his death.

Barnato's daughter [[Diana Barnato Walker]] MBE learned to fly at the Brooklands Flying Club in 1938 at age 20. She went on to ferry [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]s, [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]]s and [[Vickers Wellington|Wellingtons]] with the [[Air Transport Auxiliary]] during [[World War II]].

===Residences===
Barnato lived for most of the time in London, at his house at 39 Elsworthy Road, [[Hampstead]] whilst married to Dorothy Maitland and, after his divorce, at his flat at 50 [[Grosvenor Square]] in [[Mayfair]], on the south east corner of the square.  Other Bentley Boys also had flats in the same block and, such was the number of Bentley cars parked outside, the location was known to taxi drivers as 'Bentley's Corner'.

He also owned [[Ardenrun Place]], a country house situated near [[Lingfield, Surrey|Lingfield]], Surrey.  Originally built in 1906–1909 by Ernest Newton for the Konig family, the house was the scene of many lavish motor racing-themed parties for Barnato and his friends, but was destroyed by fire on 14 March 1933.  He also owned the nearby Nuthill Farm in [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], which was used by his ex-wife Dorothy and his daughters Diana and Virginia at weekends.

After the loss of Ardenrun, in 1938 he built a large castellated home named Ridgemead in [[Englefield Green]], Surrey, at a cost of more than £100,000.  Designed by Robert Lutyens, son of Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], Ridgemead featured innovations such as central heating, a 'talkie' cinema and a drive lit by secret light rays.  It boasted 25 bedrooms, a heated swimming pool and was set in 25 acres of land overlooking the [[River Thames]] at Runnymede.  Upon Barnato's death in 1948, his wife Joan sold the house for £25,000 and it became a nursing home, which it remains.

During his final marriage, he purchased an eight-acre plot named Perot's Island, in [[Bermuda]], "as an investment after my death".

==Death==
Barnato died at the London Clinic, Devonshire Place, on 27 July 1948, aged just 53, as a result of a [[thrombosis]] after an operation for [[cancer]].

His funeral cortege was led by his Bentley 'Old Number One', which was covered with flowers and wreaths. He is buried at St Jude's Church in [[Englefield Green]], Surrey (grave 286, plot 25), next to his son-in-law Derek Walker (who had married his daughter Diana in 1944 and was killed in an aircraft crash in 1945). Estimates of his wealth at the time of his death were between £1.5 and 5m.

===Posthumous honours===
The [[Sports Car Club of America]] (SCCA) named its highest award in Barnato's honour; the first Woolf Barnato Award was presented in 1948, and has been presented every year from 1948 to the present (including the period it was renamed the [[Carl Haas]] Award, 1994–2001).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scca.com/pages/scca-awards SCCA Awards&lt;/ref&gt; Recipients are nominated by the past three winners and approved by SCCA's board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scca.com/about/?cid=44418 The Sports Car Club of America – About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515161356/http://www.scca.com/about/?cid=44418 |date=15 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
