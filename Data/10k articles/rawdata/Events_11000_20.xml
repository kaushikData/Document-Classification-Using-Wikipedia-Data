"'''(Don't Go Back To) Rockville'''" is the second and final single released by [[R.E.M.]] from their second studio album ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]''. The song failed to chart on either the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] or the [[UK Singles Charts]].

The song was written by [[Mike Mills]] (credited to Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe), in 1980, as a plea to his then girlfriend, [[Ingrid Schorr]], not to return to [[Rockville, Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;Black, Johnny (2004). ''Reveal: The Story of R.E.M.'' Backbeat Books. {{ISBN|0-87930-776-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where her parents lived.&lt;ref name=schorr&gt;{{cite web|title=HERMENAUT: I'm Reading as Fast as I Can: Minnie Minnola's Story |author=Schorr, Ingrid |url=http://www.hermenaut.com/a135.shtml |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5k5EkfKI6?url=http://www.hermenaut.com/a135.shtml |archivedate=2009-09-26 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schorr, who later became a journalist, has written about her amusement with the factual inaccuracies about her relationship with Mills and the background of the song that often appear in books about the band.&lt;ref name=schorr/&gt; Peter Buck has stated that the song was originally performed in a punk/thrash style, and that it was recorded for this single in its now more-familiar country-inspired arrangement as a joke aimed at R.E.M. manager [[Bertis Downs]].&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to R.E.M.'s ''Eponymous''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, Mike Mills has taken lead vocals instead of Michael Stipe. On R.E.M.'s appearance on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]'' in 1998, Mills performed the song solo on piano. A live version of the song was released as the [[B-side]] to "[[Leaving New York]]" in 2004 and on ''[[R.E.M. Live]]'' in 2007.

__NOTOC__
Year '''494 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. At the time, it was known as the '''Year of the Consulship of Tricostus and Geminus''' (or, less frequently, '''year 260 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'''''). The denomination 494 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian empire ====
* Having successfully captured several of the revolting [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s, the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] under [[Artaphernes]] lay siege to [[Miletus]]. The decisive [[Battle of Lade]] is fought at the island of Lade, near Miletus' port. Although out-numbered, the Greek fleet appears to be winning the battle until the ships from [[Samos]] and [[Lesbos]] retreat. The sudden defection turns the tide of battle, and the remaining Greek fleet is completely destroyed. Miletus surrenders shortly thereafter, and the [[Ionian Revolt]] comes to an end.
* The Persian leaders Artaphernes and [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] grant a degree of autonomy to the Ionian cities. They abstain from financial reprisals and merely exact former levels of tribute. The Persians abolish the Greek tyrannies in [[Ionia]] and permit democracies.
* The Persians burn down the [[Temple of Apollo (Didyma)|Temple of Apollo]] at [[Didyma]].

==== Greece ====
* The [[Phoenicia]]n allies of the Persians take savage reprisals against the Greeks, whom the Phoenicians regard as pirates.
* The [[Thracians]] and [[Scythians]] drive [[Miltiades the Younger]] from the [[Chersonesos Taurica|Chersonesos]]. Miltiades loads five boats with his treasures and makes for Athens. One of the boats, captained by Miltiades' eldest son, [[Metiochos]] is captured. Metiochos is taken as a lifelong prisoner to Persia.
* The [[Sparta]]n king, [[Cleomenes I]] inflicts a severe defeat on [[Argos]] at [[Battle of Sepeia|Sepeia]] near [[Tiryns]].
* The former tyrant of Miletus, [[Histiaeus]] is captured by the Persians and executed at [[Sardis]] by Artaphernes.

==== Roman republic ====
* The Senate appoints [[Manius Valerius Maximus]] to the office of dictator to deal with a series of military threats, and a popular uprising.
* The dictator Valerius [[Roman-Sabine_wars#Engagement_in_494_BC|defeats]] the [[Sabines]], and is awarded a triumph plus the honour of a [[curule chair]] in the [[circus maximus]].
* The Roman consul [[Aulus Verginius Tricostus Caeliomontanus]] [[Roman-Volscian_wars#Engagement_in_494_BC|defeats]] the [[Volsci]], and a [[Roman colony]] is planted at [[Velitrae]].
* The Roman consul [[Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus (consul 494 BC)|Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus]] [[Roman-Aequian_wars#Aequi_incursions_in_494_BC|defeats]] the [[Aequi]] at the request of Rome's [[Latin League|Latin]] allies.
* At the end of the military campaigns, the plebs retire to the [[Monte Sacro|Sacred Mountain]] outside [[Rome]] in the [[First secessio plebis in 494 BC|Secession of the Plebs]].  To end the succession, the plebeians gain acceptance from the patricians that they may choose two leaders to whom they give the title of [[Tribune]]s. The office of the tribunate is thereby established.
* The [[aediles]], magistrates of ancient Rome who are in charge of the temple and cult of [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], are first established. They are two officials of the plebeians, created at the same time as the tribunes, whose sanctity they share.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

'''''Anastasia''''' is a ballet created by [[Kenneth MacMillan]]. The first version in one act was premiered in 1967 by the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Deutsche Oper Ballet]]. In 1971 MacMillan expanded the work to three acts for the [[Royal Ballet]]; the original one-act version became the final act of the 1971 work.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;[http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/work.aspx?work=578 "Anastasia (three acts)"], Royal Opera House Collections Online, retrieved 10 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1967 version uses [[Bohuslav Martinů]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Martinů)|Symphony No. 6]] (1953) and untitled electronic music by Fritz Winckel and Rüdiger Rüfer. The three-act version also used [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Symphony No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 1]] and [[Symphony No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Symphony No. 3]].&lt;ref name=archive/&gt;

The ballet is based on the story of [[Anna Anderson]], who purported to be the [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]]. After MacMillan's death, DNA tests showed that Anderson was unrelated to the Russian imperial family, but at the time the ballet was created many, including MacMillan, were inclined to accept that she might be the lost Grand Duchess.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson was confined for a time to a mental institution in Berlin in 1920. The 1967 ballet depicts her there, painfully attempting to recover her memory. The first two acts of the 1971 version show Anastasia's life (or Anderson's mental image of it) in her privileged surroundings before the [[Russian Revolution]]. MacMillan chose Tchaikovsky's music for these acts, to provide a dramatic contrast with the ''[[musique concrète]]'' and the edgy Martinů score in the third act.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, pp. 327 and 389&lt;/ref&gt;

The first performance of the single-act version was given at the [[Deutsche Oper Berlin|Deutsche Oper, Berlin]] on 25 June 1967. The title role of Anastasia/Anderson was danced by [[Lynn Seymour]]. The three-act version was premiered by the [[Royal Ballet]] at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]] on 22 July 1971. [[Barry Kay]] designed costumes and scenery for both productions. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barry-kay-archive.org/DESIGN/Indices/BT_Alpha_Index.html "Anastasia 1967 and 1971 productions"] Barry Kay Archive - ballet design index&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rohcollections.org.uk/production.aspx?production=4321&amp;row=0 " Anastasia (three acts) (1971)"] Royal Opera House Collections Online, retrieved 10 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; After MacMillan's death the ballet was revived, with minor changes, under the supervision of his widow Deborah MacMillan in May 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Craine, Debra.

The '''Annual Customs of Dahomey''' (''xwetanu'' or ''huetanu'' in [[Fon language|Fon]]) were the main yearly celebration in the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], held at the capital, [[Abomey]].&lt;ref name=Yoder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoder|first=John C.|coauthors=|title=Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1974|volume=15|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1017/s0021853700013566}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ceremonies were largely started under [[Agaja|King Agaja]] around 1730 and involved significant collection and distribution of gifts and tribute, [[human sacrifice]], military parades, and discussions by dignitaries about the future for the kingdom.

==Origins==
Tradition amongst the [[Fon people|Fon]] in Western Africa, and among other ethnic groups, often had ceremonies in family lineages where all members of the family would gather for a feast, provide gifts to the eldest member of the family, and discuss issues pertaining to the family.&lt;ref name=Bay-1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the religious [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] practiced in the area, gifts and sacrifices to the spirits and ancestors would also be given.  King [[Houegbadja]] (''c.'' 1645-1685) changed this widespread practice during his reign by making it so that sacrifices or gifts to spirits would have to be done by the king.&lt;ref name=Halcrow&gt;{{cite book|last=Halcrow|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Canes and Chains: A Study of Sugar and Slavery|year=1982|publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishing|location=Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMVF71JsLpEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780435982232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Agaja]] (1718-1740) further centralized the ceremonies under the king and the royal dynasty.  Under Agaja, the Annual customs became the central religious ceremony in the kingdom, wide participation by most of the population was required, all family lineages were expected to provide gifts and tribute (sometimes considered taxes) to the ruler, and aspects of animal and [[human sacrifice]] were added to the practice.&lt;ref name=Monroe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monroe|first=J. Cameron|title=In the Belly of Dan: Space, History, and Power in Precolonial Dahomey|journal=Current Anthropology|year=2011|volume=52|issue=6|pages=769–798|doi=10.1086/662678}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The traditional family lineage ceremonies were not allowed in the kingdom until after the royal ceremony was completed.&lt;ref name=Bay-1998 /&gt; After Agaja the ceremony grew larger, longer and more lavish by future kings.

==Practice==
{{History of Benin}}
The Annual Customs involved multiple elaborate components and some aspects may have been added in the 19th century.  In general, the celebration involved distribution of gifts, human sacrifice, military parades, and political councils.  Its main religious aspect was to offer thanks and gain the approval for ancestors of the royal lineage.&lt;ref name=Monroe /&gt;

Another function of the Annual Customs was to raise money for the royal family and the kingdom as a whole. Based on the traditional customs of gift-giving to eldest members of lineage lines, the population of the kingdom provided gifts or paid tribute to the king.&lt;ref name=Bay-1998 /&gt;  The king would then display the riches as a sign of the accomplishments of his administration.&lt;ref name="Yoder"/&gt; The wealth was provided and displayed not simply to enrich the kingdom but also to gain the approval of the ancestors.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt; After the display, significant amounts of the gifts were redistributed to the population.

Since Dahomey was a significant military power involved in the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]], slaves and human sacrifice became crucial aspects of the ceremony. Captives from war and criminals were killed for the deceased kings of Dahomey. During the ceremony, around 500 prisoners would be sacrificed. As many as 4,000 were reported killed In one of these ceremonies in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;R. Rummel (1997)"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1j1QdPMockC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Death by government]''". Transaction Publishers. p.63. {{ISBN|1-56000-927-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Law-1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=The Politics of Commercial Transition: Factional Conflict in Dahomey in the Context of the Ending of the Atlantic Slave Trade|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1997|volume=38|issue=2|pages=213–233|doi=10.1017/s0021853796006846|url=http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/280/1/politics-of-commercial-transition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmarys.ca/~wmills/course316/7Dahomey.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715083114/http://stmarys.ca/~wmills/course316/7Dahomey.html |archivedate=2010-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the victims were sacrificed through decapitation, a tradition widely used by Dahomean kings, and the literal translation for the Fon name for the ceremony ''Xwetanu'' is "yearly head business".&lt;ref name=Law-1989&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title='My Head Belongs to the King': On the Political and Ritual Significance of Decapitation in Pre- Colonial Dahomey|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1989|volume=30|issue=3|pages=399–415|doi=10.1017/s0021853700024452}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years this ceremony also included the spilling of human blood from the sacrificed.&lt;ref name=Monroe /&gt;  Related with this, there was also a significant military parade in the ceremonies that further displayed the military might of the kingdom of Dahomey.&lt;ref name=Bay-1998 /&gt;

One additional aspect was that the Annual Customs also included a prominent structure for discussion and debate about public policy in the kingdom.  In this respect, scholar John C. Yoder has argued that the customs "served a political function similar to that of parliaments in Western countries", although still far from the open contests in democracies.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;  The Great Council would convene at the annual customs and bring together important leaders from throughout Dahomey to discuss national policy.  The Great Council included a large segment of the population and included women. Debate and discussion would be extensive; low ranking-officials could publicly rebuke high-ranking ones. In the end the king would end the debate by declaring consensus.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

In addition, when a king died, his successor would have to include a significant ceremony in his honor to finish the funeral rites. Until such sacrifices and ceremonies were performed, it was considered that the new king was not approved by the spirits of the ancestors.&lt;ref name=Bay-1998 /&gt;

Items associated with the Customs are preserved at the [[Abomey Historical Museum]], in the [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa-prema.net/abomeyGB/collects.htm|title=Collections|website=www.epa-prema.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schedule==
By day, according to Yoder.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

#Procession from Cana
#Private receptions or levées
#Parade through Great Square, more petitions
#Historical songs sung by court singers
#Parade of the king's wealth
#Distribution of wealth, including slain captives

The '''Ashton Court Festival''' was an outdoor music festival held annually in mid-July on the grounds of [[Ashton Court]], just outside [[Bristol]], England. The festival was a weekend event which featured a variety of local bands and national headliners. Mainly aimed at local residents, the festival did not have overnight camping facilities and was financed by donations and benefit gigs.

Starting as a small one-day festival in 1974, the festival grew during succeeding years and was said to be Britain's largest free festival until changes brought on by [[Licensing Act 2003|government legislation]] resulted in compulsory fees and security fencing  being introduced. After problems were caused  by a temporary move to [[Hengrove#Hengrove Park|Hengrove Park]] in 2001, due to the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth crisis|foot and mouth crisis]], and a washout in 2007, the organisers declared bankruptcy in 2007.

==History==
[[Image:Ashton Court Festival fire twirlers.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Firetwirling]] was a popular amateur event at Ashton Court Festival. Image from 2005 festival.]]

===Origins===
The first festival was held in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Going Out in Bristol – Ashton Court Festival
 |work=BBC Bristol |publisher=BBC |date= 15 March 2003 |last=Staff
 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; organised by Royce Creasey and friends, as a small event, for the local musicians to entertain the local community. The first festival took place over four successive weekends with bands playing from a stage improvised from a flat bed truck. [[Bristol City Council]] donated £50.&lt;ref name="EP2003"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T9251181987&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T9250730602&amp;cisb=22_T9251181990&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=264&amp;csi=169745&amp;docNo=2

 |work=Bristol Evening Post, archived at [[LexisNexis]]|subscription=yes |date=15 July 2003 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year the festival took place over one weekend and was located near to [[Ashton Court|Ashton Court mansion]]. After this, new organisers came on board and fund-raising gigs were held enabling the event to grow steadily through the 1970s.&lt;ref name="EP2003" /&gt;

===1980===
In 1980, large numbers of people from far afield attended, trees were damaged and burnt and there was illegal camping and lurid press reports of drugs and nudity. It was not until 1983 that the festival recommenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/lifestyle/Festival-given-ahead/article-228801-detail/article.html
 |title=Festival given the go-ahead|date=21 July 2008 |last=Staff |work=This Bristol |publisher= Bristol News and Media |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was a one-day event; in 1984 a ''de facto'' two-day event was created by staging it back-to-back with a one-day [[WOMAD]] event.&lt;ref name="EP2003" /&gt; The festival took place in a large sloped clearing surrounded on three sides by New Barn Wood and Clarken Coombe.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bristol Community Festival programme|editor=Staff|publisher=Bristol Community Festival|location=Bristol|date=July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ashton Court Festival programme|editor=Staff|publisher=Bristol Community Festival|location=Bristol|date=July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stage was placed at the bottom of the slope and the second stage in a natural [[amphitheatre]] near the entrance to the clearing. There were many other performance spaces, varying from year to year, including a dance tent, marquees for [[world music]], [[acoustic instrument|acoustic]] acts and [[performing arts]], and the "Blackout" tent for experimental music and video, as well as a children's area and funfair rides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.ashtoncourtfestival.com/HOME/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819133357/http://www.ashtoncourtfestival.com/HOME/ |archivedate=19 August 2006 |title=Welcome to the Orange Ashton Court Festival |work=Ashton Court Festival |accessdate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Court in the Act|editor=BCF|publisher=Bristol Community Festival|location=Bristol|year=1992|page=endpaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Camping on the festival site was not allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtoncourtfestival.com/

===21st century===

In 2001 the Bristol Community Festival temporarily relocated to [[Hengrove Park]] in the south of the city. [[Ashton Court]] Estate, which includes a [[deer]] park, was closed as a [[quarantine]] measure due to the [[2001 UK foot and mouth crisis|outbreak]] of [[foot and mouth disease]] that affected the United Kingdom that year. The move caused a massive drop in attendance and a heavy financial loss, leading to debts which hung over the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/news/2002/07/21/news1/bcf.shtml
 |title=Bright future for Ashton Court Festival  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |last=Staff |date=26 July 2002 |accessdate=3 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with changes to licensing laws and tightening health and safety requirements, led to a more commercial style of organisation, with a compulsory entrance fee and a strict security presence around the [[perimeter fence]]. This attracted criticism from some locals who felt that the "community" nature of the festival had been lost. Even so, the festival continued to be run by volunteers on a not-for-profit basis.&lt;ref name="EP2007a"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/nexis/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T9251351704&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=BOOLEAN&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T9251351707&amp;cisb=22_T9251351706&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=169745&amp;docNo=2

In 2003 the weight and vibrations of crowds returning from the Ashton Court Festival and the [[Bristol International Balloon Fiesta]] put such a great strain on the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] that the Bridge Trustees decided to close the bridge to all traffic, including pedestrians, for the entirety of the festival and most of the Balloon Fiesta in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/3894167.stm |title=Hundreds queue for festival buses |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=18 July 2004 |last=Staff |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crisis===
In December 2006 it was announced that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place.&lt;ref name="BBC-cash"&gt;{{cite news
 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6195675.stm
 |title=City festival needs public cash|date=20 December 2006|last=Staff
 |work=BBC News|publisher=Bristol |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival planning went ahead with support and donations from a number of Bristol businesses. In June 2007 it was announced that alcohol would not be allowed to be taken on site, but would be available to purchase from official bars within the arena. Also, that everyone attending the festival would be searched on the way in. This announcement caused much controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Ashton Court BYO ban: Licence to blame
 |work=BBC Bristol |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although locals have long referred to the festival as the "Ashton Court Festival", before 2004 it was officially called the '''Bristol Community Festival'''.&lt;ref name="EP2003" /&gt; Since then it became increasingly popular, and for several years it was claimed to be Britain's biggest free festival;&lt;ref name="EP2003" /&gt; however, the "suggested minimum donation" for entry become a gradually increasing compulsory entry fee.&lt;ref name="EP2007a"/&gt; From 2007, children (aged 10–16) also had to pay an entry fee, while under 10s remained free (previously all children got in free), and a new discounted weekend ticket became available. The festival was typically attended by over 60,000 people annually.&lt;ref name="EP2003" /&gt;

In the festival's last year, 2007, the site was moved to Smythe's field in front of Ashton Court Mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Ashton Court Festival 2007
 |work=efestivals.co.uk
 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day, the event was cancelled due to torrential rain, which made the site inaccessible to emergency vehicles. "The health and safety of our audience is what is important," said organiser Steve Hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6899427.stm |title= Rain forces festival cancellation |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2007|last=Staff |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 80 bands were due to perform that day, including [[Damon Albarn]]'s The Good, the Bad and the Queen. The cancellation increased the pressure on the already strained finances of the festival.  On Friday 20 July 2007 Bristol Community Festival Ltd, the not-for-profit company which organised the event, announced that it had started the process of winding up the company due to unsustainable financial losses.&lt;ref name="BBC-Festivalend"&gt;{{cite news

==Notable performers==
The festival's music policy always focused on local acts, but since the late 1990s there was a move towards attracting national acts to headline the festival. Major acts at Ashton Court in recent years include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.p4ft.co.uk/bcf.htm |title=Bristol Community Festival – Ashton Court Festival – Line ups 1994 – 2007 |work=p4ft.co.uk |accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Following the end of Bristol Community Festival, other groups emerged hoping to continue with some sort of summer festival in Bristol.&lt;ref name="BBC-Festivalend" /&gt; Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival (now BrisFest) and has so far successfully put on four summer festivals, albeit in the city centre. 2011 saw the most successful even yet, with over 25,000 people attending over three days.

BrisFest returned to Ashton Court in 2012 and 2013, however announced in December 2013 that they would not be continuing the festival into 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thebristolfestival.org/about-us

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16565">{{Ancient Roman religion}}
The '''Bacchanalia''' were [[Roman festivals]] of Bacchus, based on various [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] elements of the Greek [[Dionysia]]. They seem to have been popular, and well-organised, throughout the central and southern Italian peninsula. They were almost certainly associated with Rome's native cult of [[Liber]], and probably arrived in Rome itself around 200 BC but like all [[mystery religions]] of the ancient world, very little is known of their rites.

[[Livy]], writing some 200 years after the event, offers a scandalised, extremely colourful account of the Bacchanalia. Modern scholarship takes a skeptical approach to his allegations of frenzied rites, sexually violent initiations of both sexes, all ages and all social classes, and the cult as a murderous instrument of conspiracy against the state. Livy claims that seven thousand cult leaders and followers were arrested, and that most were executed.

Senatorial [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|legislation to reform the Bacchanalia]] in 186 BC attempted to control their size, organisation, and priesthoods, under threat of the death penalty. This may have been motivated less by the kind of lurid and dramatic rumours that Livy describes than by the senate's determination to assert its civil and religious authority over Rome and her allies, after the prolonged social, political and military crisis of the [[Second Punic War]]. The reformed Bacchanalia rites may have been merged with the [[Liberalia]] festival. Bacchus, Liber and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable from the late Republican era onward, and their mystery [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]]s persisted well into the [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial era]].

==Background and development==
{{See also|Bacchus|Liber|Dionysia|Dionysian Mysteries}}
The Bacchanalia were Roman festivals of Bacchus, the Greco-Roman god of wine, freedom, intoxication and ecstasy. They were based on the Greek [[Dionysia]] and the [[Dionysian mysteries]], and probably arrived in Rome c. 200 BC via the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and from [[Etruria]], Rome's northern neighbour. Like all [[mystery cult]]s, the Bacchanalia were held in strict privacy, and initiates were bound to secrecy; what little is known of the cult and its rites derives from Greek and Roman literature, plays, statuary and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;One of the earliest sources is Greek playwright [[Euripides]]'s ''[[The Bacchae]]'', which won the Athenian Dionysia competition in 405 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Livy]], the principal Roman literary source on the early Bacchanalia, as he reports a major political incident involving one form of the cult, names [[Paculla Annia]], a [[Campania#Roman period|Campania]]n priestess of Bacchus, as the founder of a [[Religion in ancient Rome#Religio and the state|private, unofficial]] Bacchanalia cult in Rome, based at the grove of [[Semele#Semele in Roman culture|Stimula]], where the western slope of the [[Aventine Hill]] descends to the [[Tiber]]. The Aventine was an ethnically mixed district, strongly identified with Rome's [[plebeian]] class and the ingress of new and foreign cults.&lt;ref&gt;"No other location approaches [its] concentration of foreign cults": see Eric M. Orlin, "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), pp. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The wine and fertility god [[Liber Pater]] ("The Free Father"), divine patron of plebeian rights, freedoms and [[augur]]y, had a long-established official cult in the nearby [[Aventine Triad|temple he shared with Ceres and Libera]].&lt;ref&gt;Only official introductions, controlled by Rome's ruling elite, conferred legitimacy on foreign cults in Rome; see Sarolta A. Takács, "Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E" in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Roman sources describe him as Rome's equivalent to Dionysus and Bacchus, both of whom were sometimes titled  ''eleutherios'' (liberator).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy claims the earliest version as open to women only, and held on three days of the year, in daylight; while in nearby Etruria, north of Rome, a "Greek of humble origin, versed in sacrifices and soothsaying" had established a nocturnal version, added wine and feasting to the mix, and thus acquired an enthusiastic following of women and men;&lt;ref&gt;Sarolta A. Takács, Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E., ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p.305: the "Greek of humble origin" (''Graecus ignobilis'', in Livy, 39.8.3) may be understood as an ethnically Greek, itinerant priest of Dionysus.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy says that Paculla Annia corrupted Rome's unofficial but morally acceptable Bacchic cult by introducing the Etruscan version, with five, always nocturnal cult meetings a month, open to all social classes, ages and sexes—starting with her own sons; the new celebrations and initiations featured wine-fueled violence and violent sexual promiscuity, in which the screams of the abused were drowned out by the din of drums and cymbals. Those who resisted or betrayed the cult were disposed of. Under cover of religion, priests and acolytes broke civil, moral and religious laws with impunity. Livy also claims that while the cult held particular appeal to those of uneducated and fickle mind (''levitas animi''), such as the young, plebeians, women and "men most like women", most of the city's population was involved, and even Rome's highest class was not immune. An ex-initiate and prostitute named Hispala Faecenia, fearing the cult's vengeance for her betrayal but more fearful for her young, upper class client and protegé, told all to the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 186 BC)|Postumius]], who presented it to a shocked [[Roman senate]] as a dire national emergency. Once investigations were complete, the senate rewarded and protected informants, and suppressed the cult "throughout Italy"—or rather, forced its reformation, in the course of which seven thousand persons were arrested, most of whom were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Overview in Erich S. Gruen, "The Bacchanalia affair", in ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, p. 34 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNm4WKaQd6gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false52.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Livy5&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/livy39.asp For Livy's account, see Livy, ''The History of Rome'', Vol 5, Book 39, IX.] Modern scholarly sources offer various estimates on the number executed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reform==
[[File:Sarcophagus with Scenes of Bacchus - Getty Villa - Collection.jpg|thumb|left|Bacchanal on a [[Roman sarcophagus]] of 210-220 AD]]
Legislation of 186 survives in the form of an inscription. Known as the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'', it brought the Bacchanalia under control of the senate, and thus of the Roman [[pontifex|pontifices]]. The existing cult chapters and colleges were dismantled. Congregations of mixed gender were permitted, but were limited to no more than two men and three women, and any Bacchanalia gathering must seek prior permission from the Senate. Men were forbidden Bacchus' priesthood.

Despite their official suppression, illicit Bacchanals persisted covertly for many years, particularly in Southern Italy, their likely place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;See Sarolta A. Takács, Politics and Religion in the Bacchanalian Affair of 186 B.C.E., ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,'' Vol. 100, (2000), p.301. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3185221]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., Price, S., North, J., ''Religions of Rome: Volume 1, a History'', illustrated, Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp. 93–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The reformed, officially approved Bacchic cults would have borne little resemblance to the earlier crowded, ecstatic and uninhibited Bacchanalia. Similar attrition may have been imposed on Liber's cults; his perceived or actual association with the Bacchanalia may be the reason that his Liberalia ''ludi'' of 17 March were temporarily moved to Ceres' [[Cerealia]] of 12–19 April. They were restored when the ferocity of reaction eased, but in approved, much modified form.&lt;ref&gt;[[T.P. Wiseman]], ''Remus: a Roman myth'', Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
Livy's account of the Bacchanalia has been described as "tendentious to say the least".&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Orlin, "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As a political and social conservative, he had a deep mistrust of mystery religions, and probably understood any form of Bacchanalia as a sign of Roman degeneracy.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, P. G., "Making a Drama out of a Crisis: Livy on the Bacchanalia", Greece &amp; Rome, Second Series, Vol. 43, No. 2, Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Classical Association, 1996, p. 190. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/gr/43.2.188&lt;/ref&gt; Though most of his ''[[dramatis personae]]'' are known historical figures, their speeches are implausibly circumstantial, and his characters, [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s and plot developments draw more from Roman [[satyr play]]s than from the Bacchanalia themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The plots and stock characters of Greek-based Satyr plays would have been familiar to Roman audiences from around the 3rd century BC, as they certainly were in Livy's day, 200 years on. See Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 191.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3297899]&lt;/ref&gt; Paculla Annia is unlikely to have introduced all the changes he attributes to her.&lt;ref&gt;Eric M. Orlin, "Foreign Cults in Republican Rome: Rethinking the Pomerial Rule", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome'', Vol. 47 (2002), University of Michigan Press, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the changes attributed to Paculla Annia as unlikely, see Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek Culture and Roman Policy'', University of California Press, 1996, pp 48–54: Hispala Faecina is the standard "golden-hearted prostitute" whose courage and loyalty outweigh her low origin and profession, and her fear of reprisal, see Victoria Emma Pagán, ''Conspiracy Narratives in Roman History'', University of Texas Press, 2004, pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;..."the Bacchic passages in the Roman drama, taken over from their Greek models, presented a pejorative image of the Bacchic cult which predisposed the Romans towards persecution before the consul denounced the cult in 186." Robert Rouselle, Liber-Dionysus in Early Roman Drama, ''The Classical Journal'', 82, 3 (1987), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Livy, the cult's greatest offences arose from indiscriminate mixing of freeborn Romans of both sexes and all ages at night, a time when passions are easily aroused, especially given wine and unrestricted opportunity. Women at these gatherings, he says, outnumbered men; and his account has the consul Postumius stress the overwhelmingly female nature and organisation of the cult. Yet the ''[[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus]]'' itself allows women to outnumber men, by three to two, at any permitted gathering; and it expressly forbids Bacchic priesthoods to men.&lt;ref&gt;cf later descriptions of  [[Liber]]'s "aged priestesses" who offer sacrifice at the [[Liberalia]] festival.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy's own narrative names all but one of the offending cult leaders as male, which seems to eliminate any perceived "conspiracy of women".&lt;ref&gt;Gruen, E. ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', University of California Press, 1996, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender seems to have motivated the Senate's response no more than any other cause.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, C., ''Women's religious activity in the Roman Republic'', UNC Press Books, 2006, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Livy's insistently negative account of the cult's Greek origins and low moral character—not even Bacchus is exempt from this judgment—may have sought to justify its suppression as a sudden "infiltration of too many Greek elements into Roman worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orlin|first=Eric|editor=In Rüpke, J|title=A Companion to Roman Religion|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell publishing|isbn=978-1-4051-2943-5|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cult had, however, been active in Rome for many years before its supposedly abrupt discovery, and Bacchic and Dionysiac cults had been part of life in Roman and allied, Greek-speaking Italy for many decades. Greek cults and Greek influences had been part of Rome's religious life since the 5th century BC, and Rome's acquisition of foreign cults—Greek or otherwise—through alliance, treaty, [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#evocatio|capture]] or conquest was a cornerstone of its foreign policy, and an essential feature of its eventual hegemony. While the pace of such introductions had gathered rapidly during the 3rd century, contemporary evidence of the Bacchanalia reform betrays no anti-Greek or anti-foreign policy or sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Orlin, "Urban Religion in the Middle and Late Republic", in Jorge Rüpke (editor), ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', Blackwell, 2007, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gruen interprets the ''Senatus consultum'' as a piece of ''[[realpolitik]]'', a display of the Roman senate's authority to its Italian allies after the Second Punic War, and a reminder to any Roman politician, populist and would-be generalissimo that the Senate's collective authority trumped all personal ambition.&lt;ref&gt;Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', University of California Press, 1996, Ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the extent and ferocity of the official response to the Bacchanalia was probably unprecedented, and betrays some form of [[moral panic]] on the part of Roman authorities; [[Walter Burkert|Burkert]] finds "nothing comparable in religious history before the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecutions of Christians]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''Ancient Mystery Religions'', Harvard University Press, 1987, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;During the Punic crisis, some foreign cults and oracles had been repressed by Rome, but on much smaller scale and not outside Rome itself. See Erich S. Gruen, ''Studies in Greek culture and Roman policy'', BRILL, 1990, pp.34-78: on precedents see p.41 ff.[https://books.google.com/books?id=dnOPjX6GOrgC&amp;lpg=PA75]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern usage==
In modern usage, ''bacchanalia'' can mean any uninhibited or drunken revelry. The bacchanal in art describes any small group of revellers, often including satyrs and perhaps Bacchus or Silenus, usually in a landscape setting. The subject was popular from the Renaissance onwards, and usually included a large degree of nudity among the figures.

== History ==

Historically, they were separate events. They were Meenakshi festival and Alagar festival celebrated on different months as two separate celebrations.

As per the legend, Meenakshi was the daughter of [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]] king Malayadhwaja Pandian and queen Kanchana Malai. The royal couple didn't have a child for a long time. So, Malayadhwaja Pandian performed special [[Pooja (Hinduism)|pooja]]s and offered his prayers to God. During the pooja, a small girl came out of the fire and sat on the lap of the king. At that time a divine voice from the sky told them that this child was an incarnation of [[Shakti]] (Wife of Lord Shiva) and Lord Shiva himself would come to marry her at the right age. Meenakshi was trained in warfare and she was crowned as the Queen of Pandya kingdom after her father. She conquered the whole world with her extraordinary war skill and at last she went to Kailasham (the abode of Lord [[Shiva]]) to conquer it. When Meenakshi confronted Lord Shiva in the battlefield, she fell in love with him and realized that she is an [[avatar]] of [[Shakti]].

Lord Shiva assured Meenakshi that he will come to Madurai to marry her. As promised Lord Shiva along with all the Devas and rishi's came to Madurai. Lord Shiva married Meenakshi and ruled the Pandya kingdom under the name Sundara Pandyan.

This is a Separate celebration that was celebrated by Saivaites (Followers of Lord Shiva). The below is the story of Alagar festival that is celebrated by [[Vaishnavites]] (Followers of Lord [[Vishnu]]).

Once, Mandooka rishi (a saint) was taking bath in the holy waters of Aagaayagangai in [[Alagar Koyil|Alagar hills]]. At that time, the most powerful and short tempered [[Durvasa|Durvasar Maharishi]] came by the way. Mandooka rishi hadn't noticed his arrival, But Durvasa took this as an insult. So he cursed Mandooka to become a frog and live in the river Vaigai. Mandooka was worried by the curse and pleaded for mercy. Durvasa told him to go to [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] and pray to Lord Alagar to get out of his curse and get back his human body. As advised by Durvasa he went to river [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] and lived in the river as a frog and pray lord Alagar.

Alagar was pleased by the prayers of Mandooka rishi and he himself went to river Vaigai to lift the curse off Mandooka rishi. And, as per Mandooka's wish he showed him [[Dashavatara|all his ten avatars]] and blessed him.

During the rule of King Thirumalai Nayakar, both the festivals were merged as one single event to unite the people of the two groups ([[Saivism]] and [[Vaishnavite]]). Since then they are celebrated as one grand event during the Tamil month of Chithirai and this gives the celebration its famous name Chithirai Festival.

== Legend ==
People in and around Madurai tell this story as the history of Chithirai Thiruvizha.

The wedding of Meenakshi with Sundaraswarar (Lord Shiva) was to happen in Madurai. Alagar, the brother of Meenakshi, was invited. He started on a 20&amp;nbsp;km journey from his abode at Alagar Hills towards Madurai. Alagar decided to travel disguised as a robber, to protect himself and his belongings. At times, he had to hide, to avoid getting arrested by soldiers. This and the dense forest of Alagar Hills delayed his journey further. When he was crossing Vaigai river, he learned that his sister's wedding was over. This made him furious. To pacify, Meenakshi and Lord Shiva came to Vaigai river. He chose to give all the gifts that he carried, to Meenakshi and Sundaraswarar in a Mandapam in the middle of Vaigai river, and returned to Alagar Hill without entering Madurai.

== List of events ==

In early May, clashes started between rebel groups Ghuraba al-Sham and groups operating under Judicial Committee alliance. The latter accused Ghuraba al-Sham, which was in alliance with Jabhat al-Nusra, of going rogue and looting factories. According to various rebel reports Jabhat al-Nusra started weakening after Nusra leader al-Jolani pledged loyalty to Al-Queda leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]]. Before the announcements rebel fighters of various brigades were leaving for Jabhat al-Nusra, in one day about 120 left.

A former government scientist claimed that the Syrian government was using chemical weapons in small quantities to slow rebel advances.

On 2 June, a senior commander in the Lebanese movement [[Hezbollah]], said that Assad's forces had called thousands of Hezbollah fighters deeper into Northern Syria, in and around Aleppo, to shore up Assad's overstretched forces and potentially break the stalemate there. It was estimated that around 4,000 Hezbollah fighters responded. Rebels said Hezbollah forces had entered the city on Sunday and were preparing an attack. An unnamed Hezbollah commander stated: “We are going to go after strongholds where they (the FSA) think they are safe. They are going to fall like dominos.”

The diversion of rebel forces to the [[Battle of al-Qusayr (2013)|Battle of al-Qusayr]] potentially weakened the rebel grip on Aleppo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/hezbollah-boosting-assads-forces-in-northern-syria/2013/06/02/3bb59c7e-cb9e-11e2-8f6b-67f40e176f03_story.html|title=In Syria, Hezbollah forces mass around Aleppo to aid Assad|work=Washington Post|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June, in a statement on recent clashes in the province of Afrin, in western Kurdistan, People's Defense Units (YPG) Command said that Turkish soldiers attacked the village of Mele Xelîl in Afrin late Wednesday. YPG said, "The armed groups which first attacked our forces in the villages of Aqîn, Basil and Zarat increased in number as of June 10 when they attacked Meresk and Kefer Mezê villages. The armed groups were strongly responded and defeated by our forces". The Command remarked that YPG had strengthened its control as armed groups had to withdraw from the region after the clashes one day later. Referring to the Turkish attacks, YPG said "Troops of the Turkish military launched an attack against the village of Mele Xelîl in Afrin's Cindêris district late Wednesday in support of the armed groups targeting the region of Afrin." YPG said Turkish soldiers were repulsed from the region as a result of the response by YPG units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.firatnews.com/news/news/ypg-turkish-troops-repulsed-from-afrin.htm |title=YPG: Turkish troops repulsed from Afrin |publisher=En.firatnews.com |date=13 June 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202110316/http://en.firatnews.com/news/news/ypg-turkish-troops-repulsed-from-afrin.htm# |archive-date=2014-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 7 and 14 June, Army troops, government militiamen, and reportedly Hezbollah fighters, launched the operation. Over a one-week period, government forces advanced both in Aleppo city and the countryside, pushing back the rebels. However, on 14 June, according to an opposition activist, the tide started reversing, after rebels halted an armoured reinforcement column from Aleppo headed for the two Shiite villages northwest of the city.

An activist said that an apparent rebel blockade of the southwestern highway was causing fast-emerging food shortages in government-held areas.

On 8 November 2013, before sunrise, the Syrian Army launched an attack against "Base 80", controlled by the rebels since February 2013, near the Aleppo airport. The Army, backed up by tanks and heavy artillery, unleashed "the heaviest barrage in more than a year" according to residents in Aleppo. A rebel fighter said, "We did not see it coming. The attack came as a real shock to us." According to Al-Jazeera, if the Army captured the base, it would cut the rebel supply routes between Aleppo city and the opposition-controlled town of al-Bab, about 30 kilometers from the Turkish border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.aljazeera.com/Event/Syria_Live_Blog/95575090|title=Syria Live Blog|work=AJE Live Events|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By morning, the Army took over several areas of "Base 80", leaving them in control of large parts of it.

On January 11, 2013, '''Kendrick Johnson''''s body was discovered inside a rolled up mat in the gymnasium of [[Lowndes High School]] in [[Valdosta, Georgia|Valdosta]], in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he was a student.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/10/justice/georgia-gym-mat-death/ |title=Gym mat death: Attorneys call for surveillance video |publisher=CNN.com |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wptv.com/dpp/news/national/kendrick-johnson-lowndes-county-high-school-gym-mat-death-lawyers-ask-for-surveillance-video |title=Kendrick Johnson Lowndes County High School gym mat death: Lawyers ask for surveillance video |publisher=Wptv.com |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ktla.com/2013/10/10/gym-mat-death-shocker-body-stuffed-with-newspaper/#axzz2hNHPv06p |title=Gym Mat Death Shocker: Body Stuffed With Newspaper &amp;#124; KTLA 5 |publisher=Ktla.com |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary investigation and autopsy concluded that the death was accidental.

On June 20, 2016, the US DOJ announced that it would not be filing any criminal charges related to Johnson's death. &lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal prosecutor will look into Kendrick Johnson case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/justice/georgia-gym-mat-death/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kendrick Johnson's family filed a $100 million civil lawsuit against 38 individuals. The lawsuit alleged that Johnson's death was a murder and accused the respondents of a conspiracy to cover up the homicide. That lawsuit was subsequently withdrawn.

== Death ==

=== Initial investigation ===
Johnson was found headfirst in the center of a rolled up wrestling mat, in his high school gym, on January 10, 2013. His body was discovered by students who had climbed up to the top of a cluster of mats, each of which stood nearly six feet tall and three feet wide.&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt; An autopsy by the [[Georgia Bureau of Investigation]] (GBI) stated that Johnson had died from [[positional asphyxia]],&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt; and the case was ruled an accidental death by the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; 

They hypothesized that Johnson had fallen into the mat while looking for a shoe and died after being unable to get out.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt; Three students told investigators that it was common for some students to store their shoes behind or under the rolled up mats. Johnson was not wearing shoes when he was found.&lt;ref name="Six"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/05/kendrick-johnson-parents_n_4545031.html|title=Kendrick Johnson's parents still searching for answers to their son's death|publisher=Huffington Post|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=January 19, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110092827/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/05/kendrick-johnson-parents_n_4545031.html|archivedate=January 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student at the school said that he shared a pair of [[Adidas]] shoes with Johnson, and that after gym class Johnson would always "go to the mats, jump up and toss the shoes inside the middle of the hole."&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt;

Lt. Stryde Jones, who headed up the investigation for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office stated: "We never had credible information that indicated this was anything other than an accident."&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt;  Johnson's family questioned this hypothesis. Unsatisfied with the result of the investigation, Johnson's family hired an independent autopsy conducted by Dr. William R. Anderson with Forensic Dimensions in Heathrow, Florida on June 15th. Dr Anderson's claimed that his findings indicate traces of blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues, and suggested the death was not accidental.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2nd Autopsy |url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/20/us/kendrick-johnson-justice-department-no-charges/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent events and legal actions==
After the opinion of the private pathologist was released, Johnson's family stated that they believed Johnson had been murdered.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt; The family retained the services of attorney [[Benjamin Crump]].&lt;ref name="Killed" /&gt;  On October 31, 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia announced that the office would open a formal review into the death of Johnson.&lt;ref name="FBI" /&gt;  Benjamin Crump's application to the Georgia court to practice in Georgia representing Kendrick's parents was not ruled on, and he withdrew from representing the Johnson family and is no longer participating in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://valdostatoday.com/2016/01/national-civil-rights-attorney-no-longer-involved-in-kendrick-johnson-case/|title=National Civil Rights Attorney No Longer Involved In Kendrick Johnson Case {{!}} Valdosta Today|website=Valdosta Today|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's family filed a legal action to open a coroner's inquiry into his death. When the judge in that case delayed a decision, pending the outcome of the U.S. District Attorney review, the family demanded that the [[governor of Georgia]] immediately authorize the inquiry instead. The Johnson family, together with the [[NAACP]] and other civil rights activists, then held a rally at the state capitol in [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name="Killed"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2013/12/11/rally-held-for-kendrick-johnson-at-capitol-building/| title=Who Killed K.J.?!

=== Body ===
The independent autopsy found, among other things, that Johnson's body was stuffed with newspapers.&lt;ref name="Mat"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/11/21867811-parents-of-georgia-teen-found-dead-in-gym-mat-rally-for-inquiry?lite| title=Parents of Georgia teen found dead in gym mat rally for inquiry| publisher=NBCnews.com| date=| accessdate=December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/11/us/kendrick-johnson-rally-complaint|title=Kendrick Johnson family holds rally after filing complaint about missing organs| publisher=CNN.com|date=|accessdate= December 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral home that processed the body following the GBI's autopsy stated that they never received Johnson's organs from the coroner. Johnson's internal organs were said to have been "destroyed through natural process" and "discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to Valdosta," according to the funeral home owner.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; That left a void, which the funeral home filled.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt; The funeral home owner stated that it is standard practice to fill a void in this fashion, and that cotton or sawdust may also be employed for this purpose.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ten" /&gt;  Johnson's family filed a complaint, with a regulatory body, against the funeral home operator.&lt;ref name="Mat" /&gt;

A subsequent investigation by the [[Georgia Secretary of State]]'s office found that the funeral home did not follow "best practice" and that other material was "more acceptable than newspaper". Nonetheless, the investigation cleared the funeral home of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="Civil"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/02/06/parents-georgia-teen-found-in-gym-mat-sue-funeral-home/?intcmp=latestnews| title=Parents of Georgia teen found dead in gym mat sue funeral home| publisher=Fox News| date=February 6, 2014| accessdate=February 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesperson for the Secretary of State said that the investigation found that the funeral home "didn't violate any rules".&lt;ref name="Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/no-wrongdoing-detected-in-kendrick-johnson-funeral-home-probe/| title=No Wrongdoing Detected in Kendrick Johnson Funeral Home Probe| date=January 17, 2014| accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Johnson family subsequently filed a civil suit against the funeral home, seeking money damages.&lt;ref name="Civil" /&gt;

Johnson's family requested that his body be exhumed for a second time and was granted permission by Valdosta city officials. On June 22, 2018, Kendrick Johnson's body was exhumed. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wctv.tv/content/news/Body-of-Kendrick-Johnson-to-be-exhumed-486064111.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surveillance tape ===
[[File:Kendrick Johnson surveillance shot 1.png|thumb|right|Surveillance footage of Johnson entering the gymnasium shortly before he died]]
In November 2013, 290 hours of surveillance tape from 35 cameras that covered the gym area was released to [[CNN]] following a court request.&lt;ref name="Tape"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/21/justice/kendrick-johnson-surveillance-videos/|title=Kendrick Johnson footage released; expert finds it 'highly suspicious'|date=|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A forensic analyst enlisted by CNN found that tapes from two cameras are missing an hour and five minutes of footage, while another set was missing two hours and ten minutes of footage.&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt;  However, some apparent lapses in coverage were found to result from camera systems that were not synchronized with one another. Time stamps between some separate camera systems differed by as much as 20 minutes for the same time period, giving the impression of a "gap" where no gap existed.&lt;ref name="Pixel"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kendrick's Final Walk|publisher=Valdosta Daily Times|author1=Adam Floyd, Brandon Powers|url=http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/archives/kendrick-s-final-walk/article_14b87e1a-bf73-5d56-9885-e9fae70f076a.html|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other "missing" footage was the result of inactivity within the camera's view. Camera systems were motion activated, using a change in light pixels to turn recordings on and off.&lt;ref name="Pixel" /&gt; The area where Johnson's body was discovered, where the gym mats were stored, was outside the range of all of the surveillance cameras.

Attorneys for the Johnson family expressed fears that the camera footage was edited as part of a "cover-up".&lt;ref name="Six" /&gt; However, a detailed analysis of the camera systems by the ''[[Valdosta Daily Times]]'' explained the anomalies, casting significant doubt on the idea of a cover-up.&lt;ref name="Pixel" /&gt; Both the president of the Valdosta-[[Lowndes County, Georgia|Lowndes County]] chapter of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] and the former lead investigator for that chapter have stated that they believe the attorneys for the Johnsons have "not been entirely truthful in their statements" and that there is no cover-up in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/kendrick-johnson/x2112910298/Rose-Touchton-believe-no-cover-up-in-Johnson-case| title = Rose, Touchton believe no coverup in Johnson case| publisher = Valdosta Daily Times|date = October 31, 2013| author = Adam Floyd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal actions===
The family of Kendrick Johnson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lowndes County Board of Education, its superintendent and the high school principal. The suit alleged that Johnson "was violently assaulted, severely injured, suffered great physical pain and mental anguish, and subjected to insult and loss of life" on January 10, 2013. While the lawsuit did not name the person or persons allegedly involved in the January 10 event, nor identify the race of alleged perpetrators, it implied a race-based dimension to the hypothetical assault. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants were negligent and violated Johnson's constitutional right to equal protection based on race. It alleged that the defendants ignored reports that, previously, Johnson had been repeatedly attacked and harassed by a white student.&lt;ref name=lawsuit /&gt; It alleged that Johnson was attacked on a bus trip, 14 months prior to his death. The lawsuit further alleged that another student "had a history of provoking and attacking" Johnson at school, stating that the provocations took place "in the presence of the coaching staff and employees" of the school, after his mother complained about previous attacks. The suit also alleged that school officials failed to "properly monitor the activities of students throughout all areas" of the campus and to "maintain a properly functioning video surveillance system."&lt;ref name=lawsuit&gt;{{cite news |last1=Duke |first1=Alan |title=Georgia school officials sued in Kendrick Johnson's gym death |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/07/28/us/georgia-kendrick-johnson-lawsuit/ |publisher=CNN |date=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, the parents of Brian and Brandon Bell filed a $5 million lawsuit against ''[[Ebony Magazine]]'' after the magazine published a series of articles naming two students as possible suspects in the death.&lt;ref name="Investigation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.cnn.com/2014/12/26/justice/georgia-kendrick-johnson-teen-gym-mat-death/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=Local, federal investigations into gym mat death continue|publisher=CNN.com|author=Victor Blackwell|date=28 December 2014|accessdate=28 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine used [[pseudonym]]s but was otherwise accurate in descriptions of the boys, including the fact that their father was an FBI agent. The article used as a source an anonymous email to the sheriff's office alleging that the younger of the two brothers killed Johnson after learning that Johnson had sex with the brother's girlfriend. Rick and Karen Bell assert that their sons were not involved in the death, are not considered suspects, and have been harassed as a result of the publication.&lt;ref name=Floyd&gt;{{cite news |last1=Floyd |first1=Adam |title=FBI agent, wife file $5 million defamation suit against Ebony.com and crime writer for KJ stories |url=http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/article_33a71cd0-2e47-11e4-b206-001a4bcf887a.html |publisher=Valdosta Daily Times |date=August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Kendrick Johnson's family filed a $100 million civil lawsuit in the Superior Court of [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] against 38 individuals. Respondents include three of Johnson's classmates (two or three respondents are unnamed) and local, state, and federal officials: the school superintendent of Lowndes County, the Valdosta-Lowndes crime lab, the police chief of Valdosta, many sheriff's deputies, the city of Valdosta, the state medical examiner, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and its five agents, and an FBI agent. The lawsuit alleged that the FBI agent ordered his two sons and a classmate to attack Johnson. Kendrick Johnson's family alleged that his death was a murder and accused the respondents of a conspiracy to cover up the homicide.&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=M.

The judges' reason was because of their close proximity to the accused. For that reason, Chief Judge Harry J. Altman stated that it was inappropriate for these judges to preside over the case.&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt; Shortly before the lawsuit was filed, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael J. Moore, said in a statement that a federal investigation was still open and that "the investigation has proven more complicated and taken longer than originally anticipated."&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt; U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael J. Moore has since resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/u-s-attorney-in-kj-case-resigns/article_fff0d130-896a-11e5-b478-bb5d1f29fa92.html|title=U.S. Attorney in KJ case resigns|last=Floyd|first=Adam|website=Valdosta Daily Times|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Michael Moore resigned, the case was transferred to the Northern District of Ohio under the leadership of Steven Dettlebach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://valdostatoday.com/2016/01/second-u-s-attorney-in-charge-of-kj-case-resigns/|title=Second U.S. Attorney in charge of KJ case resigns|work=Valdosta Today|last=Floyd|first=Adam|date=January 21, 2016|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after receiving the Kendrick Johnson case, U.S. attorney Steven Dettlebach resigned.  Despite these resignations, the Department of Justice investigation continued, according to Department of Justice spokesman Michael Tobin.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/21/us/georgia-kendrick-johnson-attorney-exits/index.html|title=Kendrick Johnson probe: Attorney exits mark shift|last=CNN|first=Victor Blackwell|website=CNN|access-date=2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In November 2015, the DOJ filed a motion in the civil case to intervene and stay the case. The U.S. Attorney said allowing evidence discovery in the civil suit to continue would have a “chilling effect” on the federal investigation, which had expanded into investigating possible obstruction and grand jury witness tampering.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/judge-denies-doj-motions-in-kj-lawsuit/article_98fc532b-057e-55ad-a67f-7b582ebd52c3.html|title=Judge denies DOJ motions in KJ lawsuit|last=Floyd|first=Adam|website=Valdosta Daily Times|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the DOJ's motion was denied, Jackie and Kenneth Johnson dismissed their own wrongful death lawsuit, saying that they hoped to refile it after the conclusion of the DOJ's investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://valdostatoday.com/2016/03/kj-family-drops-100-million-wrongful-death-suit/|title=KJ Family Drops $100 Million Wrongful Death Suit {{!}} Valdosta Today|website=Valdosta Today|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackie and Kenneth Johnson were subsequently sued for more than  $850,000 in attorney fees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/more-defendants-seek-kj-attorney-fees/article_b2cc9c32-725f-5416-be0f-2fc5c8b4f83c.html|title=More defendants seek KJ attorney fees|author=Dean Poling|website=Valdosta Daily Times|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $1,000,000 in defamation damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.valdostadailytimes.com/news/local_news/bells-countersue-kj-family/article_99033718-c478-11e4-89a1-bf49440d8764.html|title=Bells countersue KJ family|last=Floyd|first=Adam|website=Valdosta Daily Times|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2016, the US DOJ announced that they would not be filing any criminal charges related to Johnson's death, stating "After extensive investigation into this tragic event, federal investigators determined that there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone or some group of people willfully violated Kendrick Johnson's civil rights or committed any other prosecutable federal crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d6fa9fa6da444646b81a0daa7d44431c/us-justice-department-no-criminal-charges-gym-mat-death|title=US Justice Department: No criminal charges in gym mat death|last=Dandron|first=Jennifer|website=Associated Press|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 2017, a judge ruled that Johnson's family and their attorney must pay more than $292,000 in legal fees to the dozens of people they accused of foul play in a lawsuit that they previously dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/judge-parents-owe-292-000-153245007.html|title=Judge: Parents owe $292,000 for suit in son's gym mat death|website=Yahoo News|date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">'''Mohammed Jaweed Azmath''' and '''Ayub Ali Khan''' (also known as '''Syed Gul Mohamed Shah''') are two [[India]]n men who were wrongly accused of involvement in the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-01-16/justice/inv.terror.investigation_1_credit-card-citibank-indictment?_s=PM:LAW |title=New Jersey men to be arraigned for credit card fraud - CNN |publisher=Articles.cnn.com |date=2002-01-16 |accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drew&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/nyregion/nation-challenged-detainees-2-suspects-found-train-probably-are-not-linked.html?ref=mohammedjaweedazmath# |title=A NATION CHALLENGED - THE DETAINEES - A NATION CHALLENGED - THE DETAINEES - 2 Suspects Found on Train Probably Are Not Linked to Attack, Officials Say |location=New York City; Texas; Jersey City (Nj); Washington (Dc) |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2001-12-13 |accessdate=2012-05-17|author=Christopher Drew and William K. Rashbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detention ==
One day after the September 11th attacks, the men were detained in Texas for possible immigration violations.  Their apartment in [[Jersey City]] was searched the following weekend.  According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', writing one week after the attacks, "Mohammed Jaweed Azmath, 47, and Ayub Ali Khan, 51, both from India, were taken into custody Wednesday on an Amtrak train in Texas, carrying $5,000 in cash, hair dye and box cutter knives -- weapons said to have been used by the hijackers."&lt;ref name=Kovaleski&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2001/09/18/northern-new-jersey-draws-probers-eyes/40f82ea4-e015-4d6e-a87e-93aa433fafdc/|title=Northern New Jersey Draws Probers' Eyes|publisher=Washington Post|date=2001-11-18|author= Serge F. Kovaleski and Fredrick Kunkle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subjects were profiled as potential drug smugglers because they purchased train tickets with cash immediately before departure, and appeared nervous when questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v01/n1816/a02.html?3191|title=US TX: Pair On Train Were Initially Drug Suspects|publisher=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|author=Jack Douglas Jr|date=2001-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 25, 2001, the men were being held in New York as [[material witness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20011025/aponline195409_000.htm|title=Ashcroft Discusses New Powers|publisher=Associated Press/Washington Post|date=2001-10-25|author=Karen Gullo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Investigators said they had offered Azmath, Khan, [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] and [[Nabil al-Marabh]] "the prospect of reduced sentences, money, jobs and new identities within the US" if they assisted investigation into the attacks, while threatening to inject them with a "[[truth serum]]", identified as [[sodium pentothal]], or to transfer them to countries with more brutal interrogation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=224097|title=US investigators consider resorting to 'truth serum'|date=October 23, 2001|publisher=[[New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(see also [[torture by proxy]], [[extraordinary rendition]])''  The four men were cited by a number of media pundits raising discussion of whether [[torture]] should be practiced within the United States, and whether it would be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2001/11/tort-n10.html|title=US liberal pundits debate the value of torture|author=David Walsh|date=10 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/time-think-about-torture-149445?piano_d=1|title=
Time To Think About Torture|author=Jonathan Alter|date=November 4, 2001|publisher=Newsweek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that 'three months of intensive investigation' had failed to link the men with the attack.  The men's circumstance appeared to be coincidence - they had lost their employment managing news stands in Newark, and were relocating to Texas to open or work at a fruit stand.  They had used box cutters to open bundles of newspapers.  After their flight to [[San Antonio]] was stopped in [[St. Louis]] after the attacks, they boarded a train to complete the trip, which was stopped for a "routine drug search".&lt;ref name=Drew /&gt;

Though cleared of involvement in the attacks, prosecutors charged them with an unrelated case of "fraud involving several hundred thousand dollars of unpaid credit card charges."&lt;ref name=Drew /&gt;  The men made a [[plea bargain]], as arguing for their innocence would have left them in jail much longer than confessing their guilt.&lt;ref name=Farooq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/2744963.stm|title=Indian terror suspects 'to sue US'|date=10 February 2003|publisher=BBC|author=Omer Farooq}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had agreed afterward to be [[deported]] for immigration violations.&lt;ref name=Drew /&gt;

Both men alleged ill-treatment in custody, the first 12 months of which they spent in [[solitary confinement]].  According to Azmath, "I was made to stand in freezing temperatures in the open for four to five hours a day to force me to confess to a crime I had not committed."  According to Khan's lawyer, each time he was brought to court he was thrown, while shackled, against a wall.  After reaching India they filed suit against the United States.&lt;ref name=Farooq /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
Following their deportation, both men were charged in India with passport violations.&lt;ref name=Farooq /&gt;  According to the ''[[Times of India]]'', the men were accused of obtaining fake passports from a corrupt passport agent, and Khan's true name was Gul Mohammed Shah, and Azmath had listed his age as 50 rather than 30.  The ''Times'' reported that Azmath's wife, Tasleem Murad, had told them that he was not the first person to misstate his age to obtain a visa and "He did not have any evil intentions and he has paid for it already."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/9/11-suspects-Azmath-Ayub-to-face-trial-at-home/articleshow/23107764.cms|title=9/11 suspects Azmath, Ayub to face trial at home|date=September 24, 2002|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional issue was that Azmath's wife, being Pakistani, did not have Indian citizenship.&lt;ref name=Farooq /&gt;

'''''Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits''''' (also known as '''''Eurovision's Greatest Hits''''') was a [[live television]] [[concert]] programme organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) to commemorate the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]'s 60th anniversary. The concert took place on 31 March 2015 at the Eventim Apollo, in [[Hammersmith]], London. Guy Freeman was the executive producer and Geoff Posner the director, both of whom held the same positions as the last time the BBC hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]]. Simon Proctor was the senior producer and David Arch was the musical director for the concert. Tickets for the event went on sale at 10{{nbsp}}am on 6 February 2015.

Graham Norton and Petra Mede hosted the event, which saw fifteen acts from thirteen countries performing their Eurovision entries from yesteryear. During the televised show, video montages for some of the Eurovision Song Contest archives were shown in-between each live performance. The United Kingdom entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]] was performed at the concert, but never broadcast on the televised show. Riverdance performed a reprise of their 1994 Eurovision Song Contest interval act as part of the anniversary celebrations.

Several countries confirmed that they would air the [[Broadcast delay|delayed broadcast]] of the concert on various dates that suited the broadcasters scheduling, including {{Esccnty|Australia}}, who first competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 as a wildcard entry. The host broadcaster, BBC, and [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ), simulcast the show on Good Friday, 3 April 2015 across BBC One and RTÉ 2. The Dutch broadcaster, [[AVROTROS]], were the first to announce their decision to not broadcast the event. Other countries also announced their decision to decline broadcasting the event, including {{Esccnty|Luxembourg}}, who had an act taking part in the event.

It was announced on 22 October 2014, that the EBU had appointed the United Kingdom's broadcaster, BBC, to co-produce a special anniversary show to celebrate sixty-years of the Eurovision Song Contest, similar to the show ''[[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]]'' which took place in 2005.

==International broadcasting==
As the anniversary concert show was not [[live television|broadcast live]], the participating national broadcasters were able to broadcast the show on a date and channel that was convenient for their [[Broadcast programming|broadcasting schedules]].  Some broadcasters – such as Austria and Sweden – recorded additional links and interviews in London for their viewers and these were used as previews for the main show.&lt;ref name="Broadcasting Schedule"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eurovision's Greatest Hits – Ticket FAQ|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3Lk6TzSmghJSbSgsR27P29q/eurovisions-greatest-hits-ticket-faq|website=BBC|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=5 February 2015|quote=When will the show be broadcast in the UK / my country?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Fnord'''" ({{IPAc-en|f|n|ɔr|d}}) is a word coined in 1965 by [[Kerry Thornley]] and [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Greg Hill]] in the ''[[Principia Discordia]]''. It entered the popular culture after appearing in ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' (1975) of [[Satire|satirical]] and parody [[conspiracy fiction]] novels by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]]. In these novels, the interjection "fnord" is given [[hypnotism|hypnotic power]] over the unenlightened, and children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word "fnord". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the text in which it appears. 

The word has been used in [[newsgroup]] and [[hacker culture]] to indicate irony, humor, or [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;Raymond, Eric S. (1996) [https://books.google.com/books?id=g80P_4v4QbIC&amp;pg=PA196 ''The New Hacker's Dictionary.''] MIT Press, p. 196. {{ISBN|9780262680929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placement at the end of a statement in brackets (''fnord'') explicitly tags the intent, and may be so applied to any random or surreal sentence, coercive subtext, or anything jarringly out of context, intentional or not. It is sometimes used as a [[metasyntactic variable]] in programming.&lt;ref name=Bautts&gt;Bautts, T., Dawson, T. &amp; Purdy G. (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=T8V02u2jDP0C&amp;pg=PT86 ''Linux Network Administrator's Guide''.] [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]], p. 64. {{ISBN|9780596005481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fnord appears in the [[Church of the SubGenius]] recruitment film ''Arise!'' and has been used in the SubGenius newsgroup [[alt.slack]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Origins==
The word was coined as a nonsensical term with religious undertones in the [[Discordian]] parody of [[religious text]]s, ''Principia Discordia'' (1965) by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill, but was popularized by ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' (1975) of [[Satire|satirical]] [[conspiracy fiction]] novels by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]].&lt;ref name="illuminatus_website"&gt;[http://www.rawilson.com/illuminatus.html#fnord FNORD], excerpt from [[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]] by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea. 'Suddenly I saw Hagbard's eyes burning into me and heard his voice: "Your heart will remain calm. Your adrenalin gland will remain calm. Calm, all-over calm. You will not panic. You will look at the fnord and see it. You will not evade it or black it out. You will stay calm and face it." And further back, way back: my first-grade teacher writing FNORD on the blackboard, while a wheel with a spiral design turned and turned on his desk, turned and turned, and his voice droned on, IF YOU DON'T SEE THE FNORD IT CAN'T EAT YOU, DON'T SEE THE FNORD, DON'T SEE THE FNORD . . .'&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Illuminatus!'' was produced, in the United Kingdom, as a cycle of plays by anarchic theatre director [[Ken Campbell#Theatre director and playwright|Ken Campbell]] and his [[Jungian]] Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool.  The plays further popularized the term.

In the novel trilogy (and the plays), the interjection "fnord" is given [[hypnotism|hypnotic power]] over the unenlightened. Under the [[Illuminati]] program, children in grade school are taught to be unable to consciously see the word "fnord". For the rest of their lives, every appearance of the word subconsciously generates a feeling of unease and confusion, and prevents rational consideration of the text it appears in. The uneasiness and confusion create a perpetual low-grade state of fear in the populace. The government acts on the premise that a fearful populace keeps them in power. 

In the Shea/Wilson construct, fnords— occurrences of the word "fnord"— are scattered liberally in the text of newspapers and magazines, causing fear and anxiety in those following current events. However, there are no fnords in the advertisements, encouraging a [[consumerism|consumerist]] society. The exclusion of the text from rational consciousness also enables the Illuminati to publish messages to each other in newspapers, etc., without fear that other people will be aware of them. It is implied in the books that ''fnord'' is not the actual word used for this task, but merely a substitute, since most readers would be unable to see the actual word. 

To "see the fnords" means to be unaffected by the supposed hypnotic power of the word or, more loosely, of other [[fighting words]]. The term may also be used to refer to the experience of becoming aware of a phenomenon's ubiquity after first observing it.  The phrase "I have seen the fnords" was graffitied on a British railway bridge throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until the bridge was upgraded. The bridge, located between Earlsdon and Coventry city centre, is known locally as "Anarchy Bridge". The bridge and the phrase were mentioned in the novel ''A Touch of Love'' by [[Jonathan Coe]].

The lack of a clear definition of the word, and its popularity among certain groups on the internet, allowed it to be appropriated as a [[Placeholder name|placeholder word]] (a [[metasyntactic variable]]) in computer programming,&lt;ref name=Bautts/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deckard2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jason Deckard |title=Buffer Overflow Attacks: Detect, Exploit, Prevent |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYyKhOqOCF8C&amp;pg=PA283 |date=29 January 2005 |publisher=Syngress |isbn=978-0-08-048842-4 |page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly by those with ties to [[Discordianism]] or the [[Church of the SubGenius]].&lt;ref name=Ray/&gt; It has also been found useful as the name for a "techno cultural" conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowafest.com/2014/02/fnord-2014-northern-india-engineering-college-techno-cultural-festival-delhi.html |title=FNORD 2014, Northern India Engineering College, Delhi, Techno Cultural Festival, Delhi, March 5-7 2014 |publisher=Knowafest.com |date=2014-02-13 |accessdate=2014-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer programs,&lt;ref name="Raucci1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Raucci |title=A Windows NTTM Guide to the Web: Covering Browsers, Servers, and Related Software |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5f3mlM-JKUAC&amp;pg=PA50 |date=1 January 1997 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-387-94792-1 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a general placeholder word in computing literature.&lt;ref name="Linnhoff-PopienHegering2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Claudia Linnhoff-Popien]] |author2=Heinz-Gerd Hegering |title=Trends in Distributed Systems: Towards a Universal Service Market: Third International IFIP/GI Working Conference, USM 2000 Munich, Germany, September 12-14, 2000 Proceedings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrZEP2exU00C&amp;pg=PA62 |date=1 September 2000 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-41024-9 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farewell Sermons.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Title page]] of a collection of Farewell Sermons preached by ministers ejected from their parishes in 1662.]]
The '''Great Ejection''' followed the [[Act of Uniformity 1662]] in [[England]]. Several thousand [[Puritan]] ministers were forced out of their positions by [[Church of England]] clergy, following the changes after the restoration to power of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. It was a consequence (not necessarily intended) of the [[Savoy Conference]] of 1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=William L. Sachs|title=The Transformation of Anglicanism: From State Church to Global Communion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ARx1B_pbhcC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=4 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52661-6|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Act of Uniformity prescribed that any minister who refused to conform to the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' by [[St. Bartholomew's Day]] (24 August) 1662 should be ejected from the Church of England.  This date became known as '''Black Bartholomew's Day''' among dissenters, a reference to the fact that it occurred on the same day as the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572. [[Oliver Heywood (minister)|Oliver Heywood]] estimated the number of ministers ejected at 2,500.&lt;ref name = Calamy&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle= Calamy, Edmund (1671-1732)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This group included [[Richard Baxter]], [[Edmund Calamy the Elder]], [[Simeon Ashe]], [[Thomas Case]], [[John Flavel]], [[William Jenkyn]], [[Joseph Caryl]], [[Thomas Brooks (Puritan)|Thomas Brooks]], [[Thomas Manton]], [[William Sclater]], [[Thomas Doolittle]] and [[Thomas Watson (Puritan)|Thomas Watson]]. Biographical details of ejected ministers and their fates were later collected by the historian [[Edmund Calamy (historian)|Edmund Calamy]], grandson of the elder Calamy.

Although there had already been ministers outside the established church, the Great Ejection created an abiding concept of [[non-conformity]]. Strict religious tests of the [[Clarendon code]] and other [[English Penal Laws|Penal Laws]] left a substantial section of English society excluded from public affairs, and also university degrees, for a century and a half. Culturally, in England and Wales, [[nonconformism]] endured longer than that.

==Historiography==
[[File:Memorial Hall, Albert Square 2.JPG|thumb|The Memorial Hall on Albert Square, Manchester, built to commemorate the bicentennial of the Great Ejection, at the suggestion of [[John Relly Beard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Beard, John Relly|volume=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The bicentennial in 1862 led to a sharp debate, with the nonconformist agenda being questioned, and the account in Calamy being reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Timothy Larsen|title=Contested Christianity: The Political and Social Contexts of Victorian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjzepnomLz8C&amp;pg=PA159|year=2004|publisher=Baylor University Press|isbn=978-0-918954-93-0|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iain Murray (author)|Iain Murray]] argues that the issue was deeper than "phrases in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and forms of church order," but regarded the "nature of true Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Murray |first=Iain |authorlink=Iain Murray (author) |title=Sermons of the Great Ejection: Introduction |location=London |journal=[[Banner of Truth Trust]] |year=1962 |volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Bishop of Liverpool, [[J. C. Ryle]], referred to the Ejection as an "injury to the cause of true religion in England which will probably never be repaired".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ryle |first=J. C. |authorlink=J. C. Ryle |title=History of the Later Puritans |page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Service of Reconciliation was held at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 7 February 2012 to mark the 350th anniversary of the Great Ejection. [[Rowan Williams]], then [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], preached at the service which was attended by clergy and laity of the Church of England and the [[United Reformed Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= A Service of Reconciliation, Healing of Memories and Mutual Commitment for the Church of England and the United Reformed Church| publisher= Westminster Abbey | url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/worship/special-services/upcoming-special-services/2012/february/a-service-of-reconciliation,-healing-of-memories-and-mutual-commitment-for-the-church-of-england-and-the-united-reformed-church | accessdate=2012-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4924">The '''Great Fire of Warwick''' was a major conflagration that swept through the small town of [[Warwick]], [[England]], beginning at 2:00 p.m. on 5 September 1694 and lasting for six hours. The fire started from a spark from a torch that was being carried up High Street. The town’s small population, the close-packed nature of the environment, and the amount of combustible building material all lead to the fire’s start and spread, and the limited fire-fighting methods of the time helped transform the small torch fire into a catastrophic event.{{sfn|Borsay|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}

== Damage ==
The [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]] was severely damaged by the fire. The fire progressed through [[Castle Street, Warwick|Castle Street]], Market Street, and High Street until it was halted by the 0.5 metre thick stone walls of the former [[Lord Leycester Hotel]] on Jury Street. If the fire had not been stopped by the church and struck the suburbs, it would have burnt all the way to the edge of town. The original estimates had the financial damage totaling around ₤90,000–₤120,000 and the physical damage at around 250–460 houses, but later the [[Book of Estimates]] had the damage at 157 houses totaling between ₤40,000–₤60,000.{{sfn|Borsay|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}

== Effects on architecture ==
The Great Fire of Warwick made builders review the way they constructed buildings. The Fire Act of 1694 established new rules and regulations on architecture. The Act stated that public streets and roads should all be made a certain regulated width.{{sfn|Evans|2007}} It also provided regulations for a standard house design: two storeys of 10 feet in height each with cellars and garrets. This gave the town of Warwick symmetry, uniformity, and a new flair. The fire caused an urban design revolution of sorts. The post-fire homes in Warwick also got rid of the [[jetted façade]]s and the concept of timber-framed construction in which floors of buildings overhung each other.{{sfn|Borsay|2002|p=}}{{Page needed|date=January 2011}} The town gave compensation to those whose property was destroyed by the street widening process just so that the Fire Act rules would be followed.

The beautiful post-fire buildings are credited to Francis and William Smith.{{sfn|Evans|2007}} In 1695, William was appointed as the surveyor for the fire council. Although he was officially appointed just to follow the council's orders, William took some direction to oversee the rebuilding himself. William throughout his life had a lasting legacy on Warwick, twice serving as the city's mayor from 1713–1714 and 1728–1729.{{sfn|Evans|2007}} Francis joined his brother in the reconstruction of St. Mary's Church, but later became a successful architect, overseeing the project of the new courthouse. Francis also had a lasting impact on the town. Francis served on the Town Corporation in the 1720s and was the head of maintenance during the 1730s until he died in 1738. The Smith brothers had a lasting impact on the new and beautiful architecture of Warwick and passed on the tradition of architecture to their sons.{{sfn|Evans|2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27070">An '''ignition interlock device''' or '''breath alcohol ignition interlock device''' ('''IID''' or '''BAIID''') is a [[breathalyzer]] for an individual's vehicle. It requires the driver to blow into a mouthpiece on the device before starting the vehicle. If the resultant breath-alcohol concentration analyzed result is greater than the programmed [[blood alcohol concentration]] (which [[Drunk driving laws by country|varies between countries]]), the device prevents the engine from being started. The interlock device is located inside the vehicle, near the driver’s seat, and is directly connected to the engine’s ignition system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sober to Start|url=http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/ignition-interlocks/|website=MADD|accessdate=29 June 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629015612/http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/ignition-interlocks/|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ignition interlock interrupts the signal from the ignition to the starter until a valid breath sample is provided that meets minimal alcohol guidelines in that state. At that point, the vehicle can be started as normal. At random times after the [[engine]] has been started, the IID will require another breath sample, referred to as a rolling retest. The purpose of the rolling retest is to prevent someone other than the driver from providing a breath sample.  If the breath sample isn't provided, or the sample exceeds the ignition interlock's preset blood alcohol level, the device will log the event, warn the driver, and then start up an alarm in accordance to state regulations (e.g., lights flashing, horn honking) until the [[Ignition system|ignition]] is turned off, or a clean breath sample has been provided. A common misconception is that interlock devices will simply turn off the engine if alcohol is detected; this would, however, create an unsafe driving situation and expose interlock manufacturers to considerable liability. Ignition interlock devices do not have an automatic engine shut off feature.

==History==
The first performance based interlocks were developed by [[BorgWarner|Borg-Warner]] Corp. (now BorgWarner, Inc.), in 1969. In 1981, Jeffrey Feit, a student in [[New Jersey]], placed in a statewide innovation contest with a primitive schematic of a breathalyzer based interlock device. In 1983, Hans Doran, a student in [[Limerick]], presented a working prototype at the Young Scientist competition in [[Dublin]]. Alcohol-sensing devices became the standard through the 1980s. They employed semiconductor (nonspecific) alcohol sensors. Semiconductor-type (Taguchi) interlocks were sturdy and got the field moving, but did not hold calibration very well, were sensitive to altitude variation, and reacted positively to non-alcohol sources. Commercialization and more widespread adoption of the device was delayed pending improvement of systems for preventing circumvention. By the early 1990s, the industry began to produce “second generation” interlocks with reliable and accurate fuel cell sensors. All current ignition interlocks are required to meet [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) standards.

==Design==
Modern ignition interlock devices use an [[ethanol]]-specific [[fuel cell]] for a sensor. A fuel cell sensor is an electrochemical device in which alcohol undergoes a chemical [[oxidation reaction]] at a catalytic electrode surface ([[platinum]]) to generate an [[electric current]]. This current is then measured and converted to an alcohol equivalent reading. Although fuel cell technology is not as accurate or reliable as [[infrared spectroscopy]] technology used in evidentiary [[breathalyzer]]s, they are cheaper and tend to be more specific for [[alcohol]].

The devices keep a record of the activity on the device and the interlocked vehicle's electrical system. This record, or log, is printed out or downloaded each time the device's sensors are calibrated, commonly at 30-, 60-, or 90-day intervals. Authorities may require periodic review of the log. If violations are detected, then additional sanctions can be implemented.

Periodic [[calibration]] is performed using either a pressurized alcohol–gas mixture at a known alcohol concentration, or with an alcohol wet bath arrangement that contains a known alcohol solution.  The [https://www.intoxalock.com/ignition-interlock-cost/ costs of installation], maintenance, and calibration are generally paid by the offender. On average, ignition interlock devices are about $70–150 to install and about $60–90 per month for monitoring and calibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ignition Interlock FAQ's|url=http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/ignition-interlocks/interlockfaq.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402060249/http://www.madd.org/drunk-driving/ignition-interlocks/interlockfaq.html|archivedate=2016-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries are requiring the ignition interlock as a condition for drivers convicted of driving under the influence, especially repeat offenders. Most US states now permit judges to order the installation of an IID as a condition of probation; for repeat offenders, and for first offenders in some states, installation may be mandated by law.

Some IIDs are equipped with cameras, which may be required by the jurisdiction or voluntarily used.  The purpose of the camera is to identify "fail" results with the driver, which conveniently makes it easier to "clear" test failure reports when the "fail" result was triggered by a third party.

Other states are looking into their use.

=== Austria ===

Interlock systems were introduced in 2017.

===Belgium===

Laws permitting judges to impose the use of interlock devices on convicted drunk drivers permitted their use from 2010, however by 2016 it had only been used in 55 cases. The cost, €3,500 to be paid by the driver, is a deterrent to its use. From 2017 the device may be paid from the fines imposed on the driver and in addition it may become compulsory for repeat offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expatica.com/be/news/Flanders-Ignition-interlock-device-soon-to-become-a-popular-punishment_1037342.html |title=Ignition interlock device soon to become a popular punishment |publisher=expatica.com |date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Some provinces, such as Ontario&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/safety/impaired/interlock.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/publications/permis/condition_x_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223070302/http://www.saaq.gouv.qc.ca/publications/permis/condition_x_en.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; require any person convicted of drunk driving or refusing to provide a breath example, to install an ignition interlock device into any vehicle he or she owns or operates, for a specified period of time (or for life), depending on the number of prior drunk driving offenses.

After so many drunk driving convictions, some provinces, such as Nova Scotia,&lt;ref&gt;https://novascotia.ca/snsmr/rmv/safe/alcohol.asp&lt;/ref&gt; will impose a lifetime driving ban, with no possibility of license reinstatement. Ontario&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/dandv/driver/handbook/section4.8.10.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; courts, however, have the power to enact lifetime driving bans, with no possibility of reinstatement, after so many Criminal Code driving convictions.  Under such circumstances, ignition interlock conditions are not put in place on the person's license.

=== Netherlands ===

From December 2011 the Netherlands started to use an interlock device for offenders who were caught with a blood alcohol level over a certain limit. The process which had over 5,000 participants was cancelled in 2015 due to legal and technical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stap.nl/en/home/dutch-alcohol-policy.html |title=Dutch alcohol policy |publisher=STAP |accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Alcohol interlock devices became a sentencing option in New Zealand in August 2012. In December 2012, it was reported that the first device had been installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maas|first=Amy|title=Six beer habit earns first interlock|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8129601/Six-beer-habit-earns-first-interlock|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===USA===
As of 2012, all 50 states have laws permitting the imposition of ignition-interlock devices as [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] alternatives for drunken drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Washington, DC: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard device in the USA consists of a mouthpiece mounted on a handheld unit and a cord that attaches to the vehicle’s ignition system and runs on the battery. The driver is required to blow into the mouthpiece to test his or her alcohol level before starting the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intoxalock.com/ignition-interlock-devices/what-is-an-ignition-interlock-device/|title=What is an Intoxalock ignition interlock device?|publisher=Intoxalock|accessdate=2017-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devices are required to be installed at a certified service center. Devices are shipped directly to the qualifying service center and are never handled by the customer. The largest ignition interlock device providers are SkyFineUSA, Draeger, Smart Start, Guardian, Intoxalock, and LifeSafer.

====General implementation of IID requirements in the US====

Most states impose the installation of [[ignition interlock]] devices (IID), with varying thresholds for installation requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MADD Report: 2.3 Million Drunk Drivers Stopped by Interlocks |url=https://guardianinterlock.com/blog/new-madd-report-on-ignition-interlock-use/ |website=guardianinterlock.com |publisher=Guardian Interlock (20-Mar-2017)|ref=guardian_madd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Task Force Backs Ignition Interlocks as Drunk Driving Deterrent |url=https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2018/03/08/task-force-backs-ignition-interlocks-as-drunk-driving-deterrent/ |website=www.northcarolinahealthnews.org |publisher=North Carolina Health News |accessdate=24 June 2018 |ref=NC_interlocks_deterrent}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Criminal process thresholds for installation requirements vary between minimum BAC levels (e.g., 0.20%, or 0.15%) or repeat offense, with about half of the states requiring installation on first offense.

These [[ignition interlock]] sanctions are meant as punishment, but also as a deterrence.   When required under a high BAC level or multiple offense threshold, [[ignition interlock|ignition interlock requirements]] address a strong tendency of repeat offense by drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]] (AUD or alcoholism).

[[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after positive [[#chemical_test|chemical blood alcohol tests]], as a physical deterrent for drivers with [[Alcoholism|alcoholic use disorder]], or as a [[Civil penalty|pseudo-civil punishment]].  [[Ignition interlock]] requirements are also imposed in some instances after an [[implied consent|implied consent refusal]] under similar forensic procedures.

=====Zero tolerance threshold=====
In most US implementations, [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] are set to a "[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]" level (set to either levels consistent with culinary alcohol or measurement errors).

=====Operation=====
In operation, the driver blows into the [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] to enable the car's starter.  After a variable time period of approximately 20-40 minutes, the driver is required to re-certify (blow again) within a time period consistent with safely pulling off the roadway.  If the driver fails to re-certify within the time period, the car will alarm in a manner similar to setting off the car's [[imobilizer]] (but mechanically independent of the [[immobilizer]].

=====Restrictions on operation and repair by others=====
Various US states have different penalties for disabling IIDs.  In some cases, the driver may be penalized if a family member or mechanic disables the IID when not in use by the sanctioned individual, or temporarily for servicing the vehicle.  In some implementations, disabling by mechanics and others is either permitted or authorisation easily obtained, but some jurisdictions restrict or deny authorisation.  (Such restrictions on mechanics can be problematic, for example, if limited to designated "licensed mechanics" or as applied to routine repair procedures requiring operation of the ignition and starter systems.)   Some jurisdictions criminalize such temporary bypass of IIDs.

=====Violations=====
Violations can occur from a driver not having reached the "[[Zero tolerance#Driving|zero tolerance]]" level, but can also occur from use by other drivers within legal limits, or from test anomalies.  In some states, anomalies are routinely discounted, for example as not consistent with patterns of BAC levels or at levels incompatible with life (e.g., significant mouth alcohol - if read as BAC would mean the patient is dead).  In some states, "fail" readings inconsistent with actual alcohol use can be cleared by a routine process, but other states automatically deem these "fail" readings as violations.

=====Universal IID installation=====
Proposals (none official) have been made to install [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What If Every Car Had An Ignition Interlock? |url=https://guardianinterlock.com/blog/every-car-ignition-interlock/ |website=guardianinterlock.com |publisher=Guardian Interlock (31-Mar-2015)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve [[Six Sigma|Six&amp;nbsp;Sigma (6σ)]] reliability,&lt;ref&gt;6σ refers to long-term defect levels below 3.4 [[defects per million opportunities]] (DPMO)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to not interfere with vehicle usability.

There are no present plans to introduce universal IID installation in the US.


====Individual state provisions====
=====Alaska=====

"DUI Offenders may be required to obtain an Ignition Interlock Device (IID)."&lt;ref name=AKDOT&gt;{{cite web|last=State of|first=Alaska|title=Ignition Interlock Information|url=http://doa.alaska.gov/dmv/reinst/iidinfo.htm|work=Ignition Interlock|publisher=Arizona MVD|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Arizona=====

Arizona mandates a minimum of six months for all DUI offenses, including those not involving alcohol.&lt;ref name=AZDOT&gt;{{cite web|last=State of|first=Arizona|title=Arizona Interlock Laws|url=https://www.azdot.gov/motor-vehicles/driver-services/ignition-interlock|work=Ignition Interlock|publisher=Arizona MVD|accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====California=====

As of July 1, 2010, California implemented a pilot project for DUI sentencing, as a pilot program involving four counties under AB 91: [[Alameda County, California|Alameda]], [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]], and [[Tulare County, California|Tulare]].  Under the pilot project, if driving on a suspended license due to a DUI conviction, legally the court must impose an ignition interlock device requirement for up to a maximum of three years from the date of conviction. As of July 1, 2010, interlocks are required upon a DUI conviction in the four counties.

In the four counties under the AB 91 pilot program, all drivers convicted of a DUI offense are required to install IIDs in their vehicles as a condition to receive restricted driving privileges.  First offenders convicted of drunk driving are required to install an ignition interlock device in their car for a period of five months and second offenders for a period of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Don|title=Calif. DUI law among those taking effect today|url=http://www.sbsun.com/article/ZZ/20100701/NEWS/100709882|accessdate=30 June 2017|agency=Associated Press|publisher=San Bernardino County Sun|date=1 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, this requirement was only required for third offenders and permitted for second offenders, and then for a three-year period. The California DMV has written guidelines to clear up some ambiguities in the law. Costs associated with ignition interlock devices include $70 – $150 for installation and fees in the range of $60 - $80 per month thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pamer|first1=Melissa|title=Ignition Interlock Requirement for DUI Offenders Signed Into Law by Gov.

SB 598 shortens the amount of time certain repeat DUI offenders will have to wait before becoming eligible to apply for restricted California driving privileges. To receive the restricted license, though, these drivers will be required to meet certain criteria, such as the installation of an IID in their vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State of California 2013 Vehicle Code|year=2013|publisher=Department of Motor Vehicles|location=Sacramento|url=http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/veh_code.pdf|chapter=Section 14601.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Georgia=====

Upon conviction of a second DUI within a 5-year period, the violator's license is suspended for no less than 18 months.  See O.C.G.A. 40-5-63(a)(2).  During the first 120 days of the 18-month suspension, the violator has no limited driving privileges.  See 40-5-64(a)(2).  Following the 120-day hard suspension, the violator may apply for a 12-month interlock permit, upon the approval by an accountability court or proof of enrollment in a state-licensed substance abuse treatment program.  O.C.G.A. 40-5-64(a)(2).  During the final two months of the 18-month suspension, the driver in question can have the interlock restriction removed from their limited permit.  O.C.G.A. 40-5-64(e)(2).  The sentencing court can waive the interlock requirement in cases of financial hardship, but the violator still must serve the 12-month period designated for interlock under a hard suspension.  See O.C.G.A. 42-8-111.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2013 Driver's Manual|year=2013|publisher=Georgia Department of Driver Services|url=http://www.dds.ga.gov/docs/forms/driversmanual.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031153337/http://www.dds.ga.gov/docs/forms/driversmanual.pdf|archivedate=2013-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Massachusetts=====

Starting January 1, 2006, drivers that had a second or subsequent operating under the influence offense and are eligible for a hardship license or for license reinstatement, are required to have an ignition interlock device attached to their motor vehicle, at their own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Driver's Manual, pp. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

=====New Mexico=====

Ignition interlocks are required for at least one year for all first-time DWI offenders; subsequent offenses require longer periods of installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The High Cost of DWI in New Mexico|url=http://transportation.unm.edu/pubs/HighCost11x17.pdf|publisher=University of New Mexico|accessdate=30 October 2013|year=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031204603/http://transportation.unm.edu/pubs/HighCost11x17.pdf|archivedate=31 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if your license has been revoked for failure to submit to an alcohol test, you can regain your driving privileges if you install an ignition interlock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifesafer.com/new-mexico/|title=Steps to Regaining Your License in New Mexico|last=|first=|date=15 February 2018|website=LifeSafer|access-date=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====New York=====

Don Prudente from DriveSafe Ignition Interlock of New York, Inc. states that as of August 15, 2010, New York state requires a person sentenced for Driving While Intoxicated have an ignition interlock device installed for at least 6 months on any vehicle they own or operate, and the driver have an "ignition interlock" restriction added to their driver license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dmv.ny.gov/alcohol-drug.htm#lelaw | title=Alcohol and Drug Driving Violations | publisher=New York State Department of Motor Vehicles | accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was mandated in honor of [[Leandra's Law|Leandra Rosado]] who died riding in a vehicle driven by a drunk driver.

=====North Carolina=====

A conviction of Driving While Impaired with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more or another conviction within the past seven years will require an ignition interlock device to be installed on the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Driver's Manual, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Utah=====

Effective July 2, 2009, anyone convicted of a DUI, whether it be a first offense or a subsequent offense, will be required to have an ignition interlock device placed on their car — for 18 months for first time offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le.state.ut.us/UtahCode/getCodeSection?code=41-6a-518.2 |title=Utah Code |publisher=Le.state.ut.us |date= |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Virginia=====

Effective July 1, 2012, anyone who is convicted of DUI may drive only with an ignition interlock after the first offense, as a condition of a restricted license and is required to have an ignition interlock installed in each vehicle owned by or registered to him after a second offense for a period of six months. The bill also provides that the court may authorize a restricted license for travel to and from the interlock installer and a person can pre-qualify for an ignition interlock prior to conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?121+sum+HB279 | title=HB 279 DUI ignition interlock; required on first offense as a condition of a restricted license. | publisher=Virginia's Legislative Information System | accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Washington=====

First-time DUI convictions result in one year of a mandatory ignition interlock device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.wa.gov/driverslicense/ignitioninterlock.html|title=WA State Licensing (DOL) Official Site: Ignition interlock device|publisher=Washington State Department of Licensing|accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second conviction requires the IID be installed for at least five years, and on a third offense or greater, the requirement becomes at least ten years. Some convictions of negligent driving or reckless driving can require the convicted person to use an IID for a period of six months or longer.

==Universal IID installation==
Proposals  have been made to install [[ignition interlock|IIDs]] on all new vehicles, set to the legal limit for the driver.  Among others, [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]] (MADD) have campaigned for mandatory IID installation for all drivers.  Some politicians in [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riksdagen.se/webbnav/index.aspx?nid=410&amp;dok_id=GU02T284 Motion om alkolås] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]], [[Canada]], the US, and other countries have called for such devices to be installed as standard equipment in all motor vehicles sold.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Issues to be solved, besides consumer and voter acceptance, include difficulty in obtaining accurate measurements without inconvenience, and a need to achieve [[Six Sigma|Six&amp;nbsp;Sigma (6σ)]] reliability,&lt;ref&gt;6σ refers to long-term defect levels below 3.4 [[defects per million opportunities]] (DPMO)&lt;/ref&gt; in order to not interfere with vehicle usability.

'''''Kepler''''' is an opera by [[Philip Glass]] set to a [[libretto]] in German and Latin by Martina Winkel. It premiered on 20 September 2009 at the [[Landestheater Linz|Landestheater]] in the Austrian city of [[Linz]] with [[Dennis Russell Davies]] conducting the [[Bruckner Orchestra Linz|Bruckner Orchestra]]. Its libretto is based on the life and work of [[Johannes Kepler]], the 16th and 17th century [[mathematician]] and [[astronomer]]. The work was commissioned by the Linz Landestheater and Linz09 (a programme celebrating the city's designation as a [[European Capital of Culture]]). The opera was performed in the USA for the first time in May 2012 at the Spoleto Festival; it was conducted by John Kennedy and directed by Sam Helfrich, featuring an English translation by Saskia M. Wesnigk-Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spoletousa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Kepler.pdf |title=Program notes |date=2008 |website=www.spoletousa.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the third opera by Glass to be inspired by a physicist, after ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' (1976) and [[Galileo Galilei (opera)|''Galileo Galilei'']] (2002).

The '''Korean conflict''' is based on the division between the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] in the north and the [[Republic of Korea]] in the south, both of which claim to be the government of [[Korea|the entire peninsula]]. During the [[Cold War]], North Korea was backed by the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and other [[communist states]], and South Korea was backed by the [[United States]] and [[Western Bloc|its capitalist allies]]. The [[division of Korea]] by external powers occurred at the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, and tensions erupted into the [[Korean War]], which lasted from 1950 to 1953. When the war ended, the country was devastated, but the division remained. North and South Korea continued a military standoff, with periodic clashes. The conflict survived the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] of 1989 to 1991.

The U.S. maintains a [[United States Forces Korea|military presence in the South]] to assist South Korea in accordance with the [[Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea|ROK–US Mutual Defense Treaty]]. In 1997, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] described the division of Korea as the "Cold War's last divide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hyung Gu Lynn |date= 2007 |title= Bipolar Orders: The Two Koreas since 1989 |publisher= Zed Books |p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] described North Korea as a member of an "[[axis of evil]]".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

In 2018, North and South Korea, and the United States, held a series of summits which promised peace and nuclear disarmament. This led to the Panmunjom Declaration on April 27 2018, where the two nations agreed to work together to end the conflict.

==Background==
{{see also|Korean Empire|Korea under Japanese rule}}

Korea was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] in 1910. In the following decades during the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]], nationalist and radical groups emerged, mostly in exile, to struggle for [[Korean independence movement|independence]]. Divergent in their outlooks and approaches, these groups failed to unite in one national movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]| location = New York| isbn = 0-393-32702-7 |pp=156–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based in China, the [[Korean Provisional Government]] failed to obtain widespread recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]| location = New York| isbn = 0-393-32702-7 |pp=159–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The many leaders agitating for Korean independence included the conservative and U.S.-educated [[Syngman Rhee]], who lobbied the U.S. government, and the Communist [[Kim Il-sung]], who fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese from neighboring [[Manchuria]] to the north of Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=35–36, 46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Surrender of Japan|end of the occupation]], many high-ranking Koreans were accused of collaborating with [[Japanese imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intense and bloody struggle between various figures and political groups aspiring to lead Korea ensued.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Division of Korea==

{{see also|United States Army Military Government in Korea}}
[[Image:KMAG Headquarters, Seoul, South Korea circa 1950.jpg|thumb|213px|left| US Military Advisory Group Headquarters, South Korea, c. 1950]]
On August 9, 1945, in the closing days of [[World War II]], the [[Soviet Union]] [[Soviet–Japanese War|declared war on Japan]] and advanced into [[Korea]], at the request of the United States. Though the Soviet declaration of war had been agreed by the Allies at the [[Yalta Conference]], the US government had agreed with the Russian government earlier that the Soviet advance would stop at the 38th parallel, which it did. The US government forces arrived a few weeks later and occupied the area south of the 38th parallel, including the capital, [[Seoul]]. This was incorporated into [[General Order No. 1]] to Japanese forces after the [[surrender of Japan]] on August 15. On August 24, the Red Army entered [[Pyongyang]] and established a military government over Korea north of the parallel. American forces landed in the south on September 8 and established the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American government had not consulted or asked permission of the Korean people or their representatives to conduct this division of the country. The division of the Korean peninsula by the US and Russia would set the stage for the civil war in 1950.

The Allies had originally envisaged a joint trusteeship which would steer Korea towards independence, but most Korean nationalists wanted independence immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the wartime co-operation between the Soviet Union and the US deteriorated as the [[Cold War]] took hold. Both occupying powers began promoting into positions of authority Koreans aligned with their side of politics and marginalizing their opponents. Many of these emerging political leaders were returning exiles with little popular support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=50–51, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]| location = New York| isbn = 0-393-32702-7 |pp=194–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North Korea, the Soviet Union supported Korean Communists. Kim Il-sung, who from 1941 had served in the Soviet Army, became the major political figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Society was centralized and collectivized, following the Soviet model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politics in the South were more tumultuous, but the strongly anti-Communist Syngman Rhee, who had been educated in the United States, was positioned as the most prominent politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=66, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rival leaders, [[Kim Koo]] and [[Lyuh Woon-hyung]], were assassinated.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Other popular leaders were deemed "leftists" by the US occupying forces and fled to the north to escape imprisonment.

As a result, two antagonistic states emerged, with diametrically opposed political, economic, and social systems.  In [[South Korea]], a [[South Korean Constitutional Assembly election, 1948|general election]] was held on May 10, 1948. The Republic of Korea (or ROK) was established with [[Syngman Rhee]] as President, and formally replaced the US military occupation on August 15. In North Korea, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (or DPRK) was declared on September 9, with [[Kim Il-sung]], as prime minister. Soviet occupation forces left the DPRK on December 10, 1948. US forces left the ROK the following year, though the US [[Korean Military Advisory Group]] remained to train the [[Republic of Korea Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]| location = New York| isbn = 0-393-32702-7 |pp=255–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new regimes even adopted different [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]]: the North choosing ''Choson'', and the South ''Hanguk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea| last = Bluth | first = Christoph | year = 2008| publisher = Polity Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-07456-3357-2 |p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both opposing governments considered themselves to be the government of the whole of Korea (as they do to this day), and both saw the division as temporary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

[[Syngman Rhee]] repeatedly expressed his desire to conquer the North.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

Throughout this period there were uprisings in the South, such as the [[Jeju Uprising]] and the [[Yeosu–Suncheon Rebellion]], that were brutally suppressed. In all, over one hundred thousand lives were lost in fighting across Korea before the Korean War began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi | authorlink= Sheila Miyoshi Jager| title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Korean War==

By 1950, North Korea had clear military superiority over the South. The Soviet occupiers had armed it with surplus weaponry and provided training. Many troops returning to North Korea were battle-hardened from their participation in the [[Chinese Civil War]], which had just ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |pp=114–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Il-sung expected a quick victory, predicting that there would be pro-Communist uprisings in the South and that the US would not intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=72, 77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than perceiving the conflict as a civil war, however, the West saw it in Cold War terms as Communist aggression, related to recent events in China and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

North Korea invaded the South on June 25, 1950, and swiftly overran most of the country. In September 1950 [[United Nations Command|United Nations force]], led by the United States, intervened to defend the South, and following the [[Battle of Incheon|Incheon Landing]] and [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|breakout from the Busan Perimeter]], [[UN Offensive, 1950|rapidly advanced into North Korea]].  As they neared the border with China, Chinese forces intervened on behalf of North Korea, shifting the balance of the war again. Fighting ended on July 27, 1953, with an [[Korean Armistice Agreement|armistice]] that approximately restored the original boundaries between North and South Korea.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Korea was devastated. Around three million civilians and soldiers had been killed. Seoul was in ruins, having changed hands four times.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite book| title = Korea's Twentieth-Century Odyssey | last = Robinson | first = Michael E | year = 2007 | publisher = University of Hawaii Press |  location = Honolulu | isbn = 978-0-8248-3174-5 |p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every substantial building in North Korea had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

==Armistice==
{{main|Korean Armistice Agreement}}

Negotiations for an armistice began on July 10, 1951, as the war continued. The main issues were the establishment of a new demarcation line and the exchange of prisoners. After Stalin died, the Soviet Union brokered concessions which led to an agreement on July 27, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syngman Rhee opposed the armistice because it left Korea divided.

After the war, the Chinese forces left, but [[United States Forces Korea|US forces remained in the South]]. Sporadic conflict continued between North and South Korea. On October 1, 1953, the United States and South Korea signed a [[Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and the Republic of Korea|defense treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the United States stationed nuclear weapons in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

North Korea presented itself as a champion of orthodox Communism, distinct from the Soviet Union and China. The regime developed the doctrine of [[Juche]] or self-reliance, which included extreme military mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=93, 95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the threat of nuclear war, it constructed extensive facilities underground and in the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Korea's Place in the Sun: A Modern History| last = Cumings| first = Bruce| authorlink = Bruce Cumings| year = 2005| publisher = [[W.

South Korea became a strongly anti-Communist military dictatorship and [[South Korea in the Vietnam War|was heavily involved in the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge|  location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |pp=107, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea's occupation left behind a guerrilla movement that persisted in the Cholla provinces.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

Tensions between North and South escalated in the late 1960s with a series of low-level armed clashes known as the [[Korean DMZ Conflict (1966-1969)|Korean DMZ Conflict]]. In 1966, Kim declared "liberation of the south" to be a "national duty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jager | first = Sheila Miyoshi | title = Brothers at War – The Unending Conflict in Korea | year = 2013 | publisher = Profile Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84668-067-0|p=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, North Korean commandos launched the [[Blue House Raid]], an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate the South Korean President [[Park Chung-hee]].

In 1977, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed the withdrawal of troops from South Korea.

Unrest in the South came to a head with the [[Gwangju Uprising]] in 1980. The dictatorship equated dissent with North Korean subversion.

Conflict intensified near the disputed maritime boundary known as the [[Northern Limit Line]] in the [[Yellow Sea]].

'''LISA''' is the Large Installation System Administration Conference, co-sponsored by the computing professional organizations [[USENIX]] and its [[LISA (organization)|LISA]] special interest group (formerly known as SAGE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= LISA Special Interest Group for Sysadmins (formerly SAGE) |url= http://www.usenix.org/lisa |accessdate= 13 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "large" was dropped from the title of the 6th conference in 1992 (though retaining the "LISA" name).  The full acronym was restored in the title of the 2003 conference and remains in use today.&lt;ref name="USENIXEventsByName"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.usenix.org/events/byname/lisa.html | title=USENIX Events by Name: Large Installation System Administration Conference (LISA) | accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "large" was originally understood to mean sites with over 100 users or over 100 [[terabyte]]s of storage. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

== History ==
The LISA conference were first held in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= USENIX Timeline|url= http://www.usenix.org/about/history/firsts.html|date= |work= |publisher= [[USENIX]]|accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USENIX web site lists proceedings as far back as 1987, though only those proceedings from 1993 onward are available online.&lt;ref name="USENIXEventsByName"/&gt; Attendance has recently been in the 1000-2000 range.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

== Content ==
The conference is typically held in the fall in a conference center [[hotel]] somewhere in the [[United States]].  Between 1987 and 2008, roughly half of them were somewhere in [[California]].&lt;ref name="USENIXEventsByName"/&gt; It generally runs six days: six days of full-day and half-day tutorial training sessions, three days of technical sessions, and a two-day vendor exhibition.   The technical sessions usually include multiple tracks, including a [[peer review]]ed refereed paper track, invited talks, and a "Guru-Is-In" Q&amp;A track.

For many years, the conference often ended with a LISA [[quiz show]] trivia contest, but that has been replaced with a plenary session to close out the week.

== Proceedings ==
The refereed papers are published in a proceedings volume.  Many important topics in system administration were first disseminated publicly via LISA papers. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

{{italictitle}}'''''Lessons in Love and Violence''''' is an [[opera]] with music by [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]] and [[libretto]] by [[Martin Crimp]]. The opera, which is based on the story of [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] and [[Piers Gaveston]], was premiered at the [[Royal Opera House]] London on 10 May 2018, conducted by the composer and directed by [[Katie Mitchell]]. The opera was a [[co-production (media)|co-production]] with [[Dutch National Opera]], [[Hamburg State Opera]], [[Opéra de Lyon]], [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]], [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]], Barcelona, and [[Teatro Real]], Madrid.&lt;ref name=roh&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/lessons-in-love-and-violence-by-katie-mitchell "Lessons in Love and Violence"], ROH website, accessed 15 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera covers the events set out in [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s play ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'', which combines the story of Edward and Gaveston (who was murdered in 1312), with the deposition of Edward II by [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Mortimer]] (1327) and the overthrow of Mortimer and Edward's queen [[Isabella of France]] by Edward III (1330).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rowland, "Re-imagining Edward II", Royal Opera House Programme, "Lessons in Love and Violence" (2018), p. 40. &lt;/ref&gt;

The opera is in two parts, of four and three scenes respectively, and is performed without a break.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Opera House Programme, "Lessons in Love and Violence" (2018), p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; King Edward is not referred to by name, only as 'the King'. Similarly his wife Queen Isabella is referred to simply as Isabel, and his son, later [[Edward II of England|Edward III]], is listed as 'Boy, later Young King'. Both Gaveston and Edward's nemesis Mortimer are named.

==Synopsis==
===Part One===
Scene 1. Mortimer criticizes the King's obsession with his lover, Gaveston, at a time when his people are suffering from war and starvation. The King strips Mortimer of his wealth and lands.

Scene 2. Mortimer impresses on Isabel the King's dereliction of his duties by confronting her with representatives of the suffering people. She agrees to support Mortimer's campaign against Gaveston.

Scene 3. Gaveston is arrested during an entertainment at the King's residence.

Scene 4. The King rejects Isabel when he hears of Gaveston's death.

===Part Two===
Scene 1. Isabel is now living with Mortimer. They instruct the King's son to assert his royalty by presenting him with a madman who believes that he himself is the true King.

Scene 2. The King is in prison. Mortimer persuades him to abdicate. Death, in the guise of Gaveston, claims the King.

Scene 3. The King's son, having succeeded to the throne, rejects Isabel and arranges the death of Mortimer.

==Critical reception==
The opera received a positive reception in the British press, with some reservations. The review in ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented: "[D]espite the care that has so clearly gone into every aspect of the production, it often seems to be the orchestral music that is really in charge of the drama, as if the usual priorities of opera have been reversed. In the end the terrible story becomes the excuse for some striking music rather than being driven along by it."&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Clements, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/11/lessons-in-love-and-violence-review-royal-opera-house-george-benjamin "Lessons in Love and Violence review – soaring tale of a brutal royal downfall"], 11 May 2018, ''Guardian'' website, accessed 16 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' commented that he " left Covent Garden impressed rather than excited or moved. For all the refinements, Benjamin and Crimp haven’t moved on from ''[[Written on Skin]]'' [their previous opera] so much as shuffled the cards to play the same game."&lt;ref&gt; Rupert Christiansen,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opera/what-to-see/lessons-love-violence-review-royal-opera-potent-beautiful-account/ "Lessons in Love and Violence review, Royal Opera: a potent and beautiful account of Edward II's downfall"], 11 May 2018, ''Daily Telegraph'' website, accessed 16 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Stage]]'' however praised the opera: "George Benjamin’s new work on the subject of Edward II once again shows his operatic mastery."&lt;ref&gt;George Hall,[https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2018/lessons-love-violence-review-royal-opera-house-london/ "Lessons in Love and Violence review at Royal Opera House, London – ‘operatic mastery’"], 11 May 2018, ''The Stage'' website, accessed 16 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room''' ([[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''LROR'''; {{lang-ar|غرفة عمليات ثوار ليبيا}}) is an armed group loyal to [[Nouri Abusahmain]]. It has been declared a terrorist organization by the [[Council of Deputies|Libyan parliament]]. It is heavily involved in the [[Second Libyan Civil War (2014–present)|Second Libyan Civil War]].

The LROR was established in 2013 by [[Nouri Abusahmain]], who had recently been elected GNC President. He formed the LROR by uniting existing militias under his command. Its official task was to keep order in Tripoli. He allegedly misappropriated 900&amp;nbsp;million Libyan Dinars (US $720&amp;nbsp;million) to the benefit of the LROR, but this was not investigated as Abusahmain himself suppressed the inquiry.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Libya|author=John, R.B.S.|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|isbn=9780810878761|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xIrOAwAAQBAJ|page=201|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after being formed, the LROR attempted an Islamist coup when the group [[2013 Libyan coup d'état attempt|kidnapped Prime Minister Ali Zeidan]] in October 2013. The LROR later set up a branch in Benghazi, purportedly to deal with the deteriorating security situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=20 May 2014 |title=Guide to key Libyan militias |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-19744533 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Formation and kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan===
The LROR was created in the fall of 2013 by GNC President [[Nouri Abusahmain]], who tasked it with providing security to Tripoli.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"&gt;{{cite book |last=St John |first=Ronald Bruce |date=4 June 2014 |title=Historical Dictionary of Libya |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=201 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LROR was later involved in the 10 October  kidnapping of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, who it charged with corruption.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"/&gt; Zeidan was later rescued the same day after the building where LROR was keeping him was surrounded by a mixture of local protesters and pro-Zeidan militias.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"/&gt;

===Attempts to disestablish===
On 27 October 2013, Zeidan supporters walked out of a GNC session in protest to last minute changes to the agenda made by Abusahmain.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"/&gt; In the changes Abusahmain cancelled a request by GNC members to disestablish the LROR, and also cancelled a request to establish a committee to investigate the allocation by Abusahmain of 900&amp;nbsp;million Libyan Dinars ($720&amp;nbsp;million) to the LROR and various other militias.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"/&gt; The GNC members had claimed that the allocations made by Abusahmain had been against GNC rules.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"/&gt;

On 3 November 2013, the GNC voted to withdraw the LROR's mandate to provide security for Tripoli. In response to the vote LROR forces surrounded the building where the GNC was meeting in an attempt to intimidate members of the GNC.&lt;ref name="Dic 201"/&gt; In a compromise vote the GNC agreed to maintain the LROR's mandate for Tripoli, on the terms that the LROR was brought under the control of the General Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref name="Dic 202"&gt;{{cite book |last=St John |first=Ronald Bruce |date=4 June 2014 |title=Historical Dictionary of Libya |url= |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=202 |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12208">A '''school prank''' is a [[Practical joke|prank]] primarily occurring in a school setting. The effect and intent of school pranks may range from everyday play and consensual [[Human bonding|bonding]] behavior to [[Crime|crimes]] including [[hazing]], [[School bullying|bullying]] and [[assault]], including [[sexual assault]].

== Common pranks ==

&lt;!-- Do not add uncited pranks. Do not add simple bullying. --&gt;
=== Circle game ===

[[File:Circle_game.jpg|thumb|Example of person playing the circle game]]
The objective of the "circle game" or "basic killer"&lt;ref name="circlevice"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rohnke&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rohnke |first1=Karl |title=Silver Bullets: A Guide to Initiative Problems, Adventure Games, Stunts and Trust Activities. |date=1984 |publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company |isbn=9780840356826 |pages=54-55 |url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED356918.pdf |language=en}} [https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED356918 Indexed] at [[ERIC]]&lt;/ref&gt; to form a circle with one's thumb and forefinger (the [[OK (gesture)|"OK" gesture]]) on the leg below the waist and get someone else to look at it.&lt;ref name=Rohnke/&gt; If the person looks, the gesture-maker gets to hit them,&lt;ref name="circlevice" /&gt; or is simply considered "out" or "killed".&lt;ref name=Rohnke/&gt; In some variations the target can put their index finger through the hole without looking at it and thereby win the right to punch the maker of the gesture.&lt;ref name="circlevice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bish|first1=Joe|title=Searching for the Man Behind 'The Circle Game'|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/wj8e74/searching-for-the-man-behind-the-circle-game|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|date=29 June 2017|language=en-uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pantsing===
{{Main article|Pantsing}}
Pantsing (also known as "flagging", "depantsing", "pantsing" and various other names) is the act of pulling down a person's trousers and sometimes also the person's underwear, which reveals the person's [[Sex organ|genitalia]]. The most common method is to sneak up behind the intended victim, grab the waistband of the garment, and apply a quick downward tug before the victim is aware of the debagger's presence.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

=== Flat tire or flat foot ===
The heel of the victim is trodden upon, which may cause the victim to fall. Stepping on the rear portion of the shoe as the foot lifts and thereby removing it is also a "heels" variant known as a "flat tire" or "score". A variant is to kick their heel forwards as it lifts, known as an "airwalk".&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

=== Indian burn ===
This is a prank done by grasping the victim's forearm firmly in both hands, and then twisting the hands in opposite directions about the victim's arm to stretch their skin, making it red and sore.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

Known primarily as a "Chinese burn" or a "snake bite" in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]], "buffalo skin" in [[India]], "snake bite", "Chinese Sunburn" or "Indian rub" in [[Canada]], and "Indian burn", "Indian sunburn" or "Indian rug burn" in the [[United States]] (except in some midwest states such as [[Wisconsin]] and [[Illinois]] where it is known as a snakebite), "Indian burn" in [[France]], "policeman's glove" or "hundred needles" in [[Hungary]], "barbed wire" in the [[Netherlands]], "needles" in [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] and "Brennessel" ("stinging nettle") in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]] and the southern parts of [[Germany]], "thousand needle stings" in the northern parts of Germany, "manita de puerco" (pork's little hand) in [[Mexico]], "little fire" in the [[Czech Republic]], "thousand needles" in [[Sweden]], "Nettle" in [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]] and [[Russia]], "French cuff" in [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], "kuuma makkara" (hot sausage) or "nokkonen" (nettle) in [[Finland]] and again "snakebite" in [[Flanders]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Kancho / Dongjim ===
{{Main article|Kancho}}
Kancho is a prank played in [[Japan]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kancho.org|url=http://www.kancho.org/|access-date=2009-04-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201065747/http://www.kancho.org/|archive-date=2009-02-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is performed by clasping the hands together so the index fingers are pointing out and attempting to insert them sharply into someone's anal region when the victim is not looking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=佐藤 信正（さとう　のぶまさ）|url=http://trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp/article/col/20060428/116519/|title=(Japanese) KANCHO across the world in Japan, Korea KANCHO What? '&amp;#39;Trendy Net'&amp;#39;|publisher=Trendy.nikkeibp.co.jp|date=|accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the wedgie or a goosing. Kancho means "[[enema]]". In [[South Korea]] it is known as "ddong-chim" This prank is also played in Scotland, in this case known as a 'fishy' or 'jobbie jab'. In [[Brazil]] is known as Pula Pirata (literally, Jump Pirate), named after the name which the game [[Pop-up Pirate]] is known there.

=== "Kick me" or other signs ===
A note (commonly reading "Kick me") is attached to the back of an unsuspecting victim. This prank may be performed with [[Post-it note|Post-it notes]] or other items, such as paper and tape. There are also other signs such as Slap Me or Push Me signs too.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

=== Mooning ===
{{Main article|Mooning}}
"Mooning" is displaying one's bared buttocks to someone, so-called because the buttocks are generally not suntanned, so resemble a full moon. It is commonly performed out of windows of moving buses and cars.

=== Noogie ===
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes called a ''Monkey Scrub'',  ''Hippo Handing'' or ''Russian Haircut'', a noogie is performed when the middle knuckles of the fore and middle fingers are rubbed vigorously against the surface of the scalp, stretching the skin and pulling the hair. A [[Professional wrestling holds#Side headlock|headlock]] may be applied for more exact or prolonged execution. This will trap the victim. The headlock noogie is called "La Savonette du Chef" ("The chief's bath soap") in the area around [[Toulon]], [[France]].&lt;/p&gt;
Also described as a 'Skully' in Australian Playgrounds circa 1980's.
An open-hand variant known as the &lt;i&gt;Dutch Rub&lt;/i&gt; is performed with the heel of the hand. In Czech Republic noogie is called "peanut"&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;.

=== Shoe-lacing ===
This prank involves the tying of a victim's shoe laces together, typically while the victim is seated and distracted. The laces may also be tied to a nearby object such as a chair leg. This may cause the victim to unexpectedly trip or stumble when attempting to get up and move. This prank may be combined with a taunt or additional prank designed to provoke the victim into getting up and running after the prankster, resulting in a more pronounced effect. A related but more destructive prank involves secretly cutting the shoelaces with scissors.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

Another variant of this prank involves tying another student's backpack to a table. This is often done at lunch time to cause panic when the bell rings for students to go back to class and the victim only then realizes their predicament.

=== Short-sheeting/apple-pie bed ===
[[wikt:apple-pie bed|Apple-pie]] (UK) or [[wikt:shortsheet|short-sheet]] (US) bed is a prank done at boarding schools, college dorms, camps or on excursions where children sleep in full beds (also common in the military services). A [[bed sheet]] is untucked at the head end of the bed and folded, making it look as if it is two sheets (an undersheet and top sheet). The victim will find that he or she cannot get into bed (as doing this "shortens" the bed length). Also known as a 'wallet bed' (''lit en portefeuille'') in France and as an 'apple-pie bed' in the UK.&lt;ref name="wedgies"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Greg Tananbaum and Dan Martin|title=Atomic Wedgies, Wet Willies, and Other Acts of Roguery|publisher=Santa Monica Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59580-000-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apple-pie bed sometimes involves sewing up the sheets with a needle and thread so that it is impossible for the prankee to get in, and requires a degree of effort to make the bed usable again.

=== Spitball ===
A "spitball" is a clump of paper that the prankster has chewed and made wet with saliva, to be thrown, spat, or blown at a person or object. If not removed from some types of surface, they dry and harden into a sort of paper cement. Small spitballs are often propelled by placing them in a straw or the shaft of a disassembled hollow pen and blowing through the other end. Larger spitballs are sometimes flicked with the fingers, a flexible ruler or through the use of a rubber band. Sometimes, whole sheets of paper are crumpled and inserted into the mouth for a period of up to five minutes to form a large spitball that is usually thrown manually.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

=== Swirlie ===
The act of holding the victim upside down and dunking his or her head in a toilet bowl while flushing [[water]]. Instances of swirling have been prosecuted in courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hazing Investigation|work=[[WTLX]]|format=WMV video|date=2006-04-03|url=http://www.wltx.com/includes/buildasx_oas.aspx?fn=http://wm.wltx.gannett.edgestreams.net//news/apr06/04032006_hazing_wltx.wmv&amp;sp=http://wm.wltx.gannett.edgestreams.net/ads/sales/toyotacenter012307.wmv}} {{Dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Towel snap ===
Also known as a "towel whip", "towel whipping", a "rat-tail", or "rat-tailing", or "kangaroo tail" in Australia, the prankster twists a towel along the diagonal (typically dampened to hold its shape) by spinning it at the corner, making it into a [[whip]] with a towel corner at the tip. The prankster then "snaps" the towel as if cracking a whip, striking the victim with the end tip of the towel and causing pain. This prank is usually performed in communal showers, where wet towels are plentiful and bare skin provides opportunity to maximize the pain inflicted.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;

=== Wedgie ===
{{Main article|Wedgie}}
A '''wedgie''' (sometimes also known as a "gotchie" or "grundy" or "melvin" and in instances where the undergarments are torn off, a "Chinese Laundry") is any one of a variety of pranks involving pulling the victim's [[underwear]] up so that it wedges between the [[buttocks]] and may even be performed to the extent that the victim's underpants are torn off. The victim's underwear may also be hung on something in a more extreme form of this prank. A wedgie may be performed by one attacker, or by a group. On April 6, 2006, [[Fox News]] reported on an [[Albany, New York]] teacher who was arrested for endangering the welfare of a child by giving the 10-year-old student a wedgie.&lt;ref name="wedgies" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Charges for Giving a Wedgie|first=Brit|last=Hume|work=Fox News|date=2006-04-06|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,190761,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wet Willy ===
A prank whereby an assailant moistens one of their fingers with saliva, quietly sneaks up behind a victim and inserts the finger into the victim's ear hole. While the wet willy is primarily an elementary school prank, it is occasionally seen in higher institutions of learning, including the [[Postdoctoral researcher|post doc]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Via Akifokur1|url=http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6877938/wet-willy-during-proud-moment-for-the-society-of-jesus|title=Wet Willie On the News - CollegeHumor Video|publisher=Collegehumor.com|date=March 15, 2013|accessdate=2014-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129112829/http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6877938/wet-willy-during-proud-moment-for-the-society-of-jesus|archivedate=November 29, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Warof1812-Origins}}
The '''''Little Belt'' affair''' was a naval battle on the night of 16 May 1811. It involved the United States [[frigate]] {{USS|President|1800|6}} and the British [[sixth-rate]] {{HMS|Little Belt|1807|6}}, a [[sloop-of-war]], which had originally been the Danish ship ''Lillebælt'', before being captured by the British in the 1807 [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]]. The encounter took place off the [[North Carolina]] coast.
The ''Little Belt'' Affair was one of many incidents and events that led to the [[War of 1812]].

== Background ==
The ''Little Belt'' affair occurred four years after the [[Chesapeake–Leopard affair|''Chesapeake''–''Leopard'' affair]] of 1807, in which {{HMS|Leopard|1790|6}} had attacked {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}}, killing three, wounding eighteen, and putting four of her sailors on trial for desertion. It was fifteen days after an incident involving {{HMS|Guerriere|1806|6}}, a frigate. On 1 May ''Guerriere'' had stopped the  [[brig]] {{USS|Spitfire|1803|6}} off [[Sandy Hook]] in [[New Jersey]] and had [[impressment|impressed]] [[Maine]] citizen John Diggio, the apprentice [[sailing master]] of ''Spitfire''. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Paul Hamilton (politician)|Paul Hamilton]] had ordered ''President'', along with {{USS|Argus|1803|6}}, to patrol the coastal areas from [[the Carolinas]] to New York.

==The Affair==

===Chase===
[[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John Rodgers (1772–1838)|John Rodgers]], commanding the frigate ''President'', had left [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]] several days earlier and was aware of the ''Guerriere'' incident. He was off the Virginia Capes and sailing up the coast towards New York. ''Little Belt'' was sighted to the east at about noon on 16 May. Believing her to be ''Guerriere'', Rodgers pursued. ''Little Belt''{{'}}s captain, [[Arthur Bingham]], had spotted ''President'' one hour earlier. Bingham signaled ''President'' asking for identification but received none. However, he noticed a blue [[Pennant (commissioning)|pennant]] showing the ship's nationality was American. Bingham continued south, but Rodgers continued his pursuit because he wanted to know the stranger's identity. By 15:30, ''President'' was close enough for Rodgers to make out part of the British ship's [[stern]]. However, the angle at which he saw her made her appear larger than she was. ''Little Belt'' was much smaller than ''President'', displacing only 460 tons in contrast to  ''President''{{'}}s 1,576. The sloop mounted 20 guns, while ''President'' carried 56.

===Battle===
The British and American accounts disagree on what followed. As ''President'' closed with ''Little Belt'', Bingham thought the frigate was manuevering to rake his ship with gunfire. Bingham [[Jibe|wore ship]] three times to avoid the threat. The ships were not within hailing range until long after sunset. At about 10:15, each captain demanded the other identify his ship. Each refused to answer before the other. Each captain later claimed he had been the first to ask. Shortly after this a shot was fired, but it is disputed who shot it.&lt;ref&gt;Toll, Ian W., pp. 321–323.&lt;/ref&gt; The ships were soon engaged in a battle which the sloop had no chance of winning. After fifteen minutes, most of Bingham's guns had been put out of action, and Rodgers ordered a cease fire. ''President'' returned and Rodgers asked Bingham if he had struck. Bingham replied he had not, and ''President'' withdrew.

==Aftermath==
''President'' had only one man injured. ''Little Belt'' suffered nine dead and 23 injured (two of them fatally). The sloop was also badly damaged in the encounter. The next morning, [[Lieutenant]] John Creighton went from ''President'' to ''Little Belt'' to lament the affair and offer Bingham space at any American port, which he declined. Bingham asked why ''President'' had attacked his much smaller ship. Creighton said it was because ''Little Belt'' had "provoked" the action. Bingham rejected the charge.

[[File:President and HMS Little Belt 1811 BRM1682.jpg|thumb|President and HMS Little Belt]]

''President'' sailed on to New York City, and ''Little Belt'' went to the [[North America and West Indies Station|North America Station]] in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], escorted by {{HMS|Goree}} The British and American governments argued about the encounter for months. Rodgers insisted that he had mistaken the sloop for a frigate and was adamant that Bingham had fired first. The [[Admiralty]] expressed their confidence in Bingham and promoted him to [[post-captain]] on 7 February 1812.

On 19 August 1812, after war had finally broken out, HMS ''Guerriere'' sailed into her [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|ill-fated action]] against {{USS|Constitution}}. Painted across her foretopsail were the words "NOT THE LITTLE BELT".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Tyrone G., p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toll, Ian W., pp. 347–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lyrid meteor shower radiant point.jpeg|thumb|Radiant point of the April Lyrid meteor shower, active each year around April 22]]
The '''April Lyrids''' (LYR, IAU shower number 6 &lt;ref name="IAU Meteor Shower Working List"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.amu.edu.pl/~jopek/MDC2007/index.php |title=IAU Meteor Data Center|page=1|accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a [[meteor shower]] lasting from April 16 to April 26&lt;ref name="meteonline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/lyrids.html |title=Lyrids|publisher=Meteor Showers Online|page=1|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; each year. The [[Radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] of the meteor shower is located in the constellation [[Lyra]], near this constellation's brightest star, Alpha Lyrae (proper name [[Vega]]).  Their peak is typically around April 22 each year.

The source of the meteor shower is particles of dust shed by the long-period Comet [[C/1861 G1]] Thatcher.&lt;ref name=Jenniskens2006&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jenniskens | first = P. | title=Meteor Showers and their Parent Comets | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | date=2006 | pages=790}}&lt;/ref&gt; The April Lyrids are the strongest annual shower of meteors from debris of a long-period comet, mainly because as far as other intermediate long-period comets go (200–10,000 years), this one has a relatively short orbital period of about 415 years. The Lyrids have been observed and reported since 687 BC; no other modern shower has been recorded as far back in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=King|first1=Bob|title=The Lyrid Shower Kicks Off Year of Great Meteor Watching|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/lyrid-shower-kicks-off-year-of-great-meteor-watching/|website=www.skyandtelescope.com|publisher=F+W Media, Inc.|accessdate=19 April 2018|date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shower usually peaks on around April 22 and the morning of April 23. Counts typically range from 5 to 20 meteors per hour, averaging around 10.&lt;ref name="meteonline"/&gt; As a result of [[light pollution]], observers in rural areas will see more than observers in a city. Nights without a moon in the sky will reveal the most meteors. April Lyrid meteors are usually around [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] +2. However, some meteors can be brighter, known as "Lyrid [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireballs]]", cast shadows for a split second and leave behind smokey debris trails that last minutes.&lt;ref name="spaceweather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/meteors/lyrids/lyrids.html|title=the Lyrid meteor shower|date=2008|publisher=spaceweather.com|page=1|accessdate=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, the shower intensifies when the planets steer the one-revolution dust trail of the comet into Earth's path, an event that happens about once every 60 years.&lt;ref name=Jenniskens2006/&gt;  This results in an April Lyrid meteor outburst. The one-revolution dust trail is dust that has completed one orbit: the stream of dust released in the return of the comet prior to the current 1862 return.This mechanism replaces earlier ideas that the outbursts were due to a cloud of dust moving in a 60-year orbit.&lt;ref name=Arter1997&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">The '''Michigan Festival of Sacred Music''' (MFSM) is a biennial music festival in southwest [[Michigan]] that shares the music of diverse religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/kzgazette/answerbook/index.ssf/2009/05/music_concerts_organizations.html Music concerts, organizations add culture to Southwest Michigan - Kalamazoo Gazette, Friday May 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The festival occurs during the second weekend in November in odd-numbered years. Events include public concerts and presentations, lectures, and related workshops.

== Mission ==
The mission of the Michigan Festival of Sacred Music is to present high quality events which represent different religious traditions, promoting mutual respect and understanding through sharing the music treasured by these traditions, and promoting community interaction.

== History ==
In 1998 the Congregation of the First [[Baptist Church]] of [[Kalamazoo]], Michigan voted to explore the desirability and feasibility of introducing a biennial festival of sacred music into the Kalamazoo Area. With support from the Irving S. Gilmore and [[Kalamazoo Community Foundations]] and input from Kalamazoo-area religious and community leaders, the project got underway in January 1999. An opinion survey to determine its desirability concluded that such a festival is both desirable and feasible. In January 2000 and area-wide representative group met to prepare for its introduction and decided to call it the Michigan Festival of Sacred Music. A Board of Directors was formed with the goal of making the festival a reality in November 2001. 

The first full MFSM festival in 2001 was an overwhelming success, and the Michigan Festival of Sacred Music, now an independent organization, has continued planning and presenting the biennial festivals. It is supported by numerous grants and individual contributions, showing the strong support the festival's goals continue to have. It continues to be led by a Board and Advisory Council made up of community leaders and representatives of many different faiths. In 2004, the MFSM presented its first off-season event, which proved to be a great success. The MFSM plans to continue the presentation of single off-season events.

In 2007, the MFSM took over co-sponsorship of the [[Sing-Along Messiah]], shared with [[Congregational church|First Congregational Church]].  This event, which drew over 500 attendees (including about 40 homeless people) in 2007, generally occurs annually on the Sunday following Thanksgiving.  In 2007, the MFSM assumed the co-sponsorship role which had previously been taken by the [[Kalamazoo Bach Festival Society]].

As attendance increases with each MFSM, the response from the public and the artists themselves shows that the MFSM provides a much-needed channel for mutual understanding of diverse religious traditions and cultures.  The first festival, occurring as it did soon after the 2001 terrorist attacks, had a powerful healing quality.  As our community continues to try to make sense of events unfolding on the world stage, we find the subsequent festivals to be as meaningful as the first.  The high quality of the performing artists and programming makes the festivals valuable aesthetic experiences, as well.

The word "Ngom" is written in ''[[Gheg Albanian]]'' dialect and it means "Listen to me" whereas the word "Fest" represents the abbreviation of the word "Festival". This Festival originates from a group of young and creative people who are active in the social life of ''[[Prizren]]'' and ''[[Kosovo]]''. The first edition of the festival was held in June 2011 and due to its major success, the activists were more committed in organizing this event. The main objectives of this festival are to promote new bands and artists, build a new perspective for music festivals in Kosovo, and to connect different ethnic groups in ''[[Kosovo]]'' and in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southeast-europe.eu/index.php?id=1884 |title=Southeast Europe: People and Culture: NGOM Festival |publisher=Southeast-europe.eu |date= |accessdate=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ngomfest1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngomfest.com/2013/?id=festivali&amp;gjuha=1 |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710072640/http://ngomfest.com/2013/?id=festivali&amp;gjuha=1 |archivedate=July 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first edition of the festival took place on June 24, 2011. The success that this festival had in its first year had set a solid base for the future editions. This achievement helped promote cultural inheritance including the sightseeing's of Prizren, qualitative music and aided to raise awareness of environmental issues. At the same time, numerous events concerning different social and cultural issues were held during the course of three days of this festival. The main focus was to address problems that preoccupy the youth and the society in general. During the first edition, this festival was awarded by the Municipality of Prizren with the prize “The Most Massive Event of the Year 2011".&lt;ref name="ngomfest1"/&gt;

The second edition of the festival took place on June 22, 2012. It lasted three days and had six stages.

== The Festival ==
{{local|date=September 2014}}
The opening ceremony of the festival starts at 19:00. During this show, secondary school pupils from Kosovo and students of the “Academy of Music in Prishtina” performed classical music. After 20:00 the music starts at the stage in “Marash” and also in the stage of “Shadërvan.” The music continues until the last day at noon. Another scene that is part of NGOM Fest is the‘Promo Scene’ which is designed to promote new musical bands. Thirty bands from Kosova and Albania applied to perform, however only 10 bands were accepted, amongst them, three bands will be selected to record a song in a studio. This activity aims to promote and support the early careers of these new bands.
Eighty volunteers participate in the organization of this festival, by turning Prizren into a city of music and art for three days in a row. The camp in Prizren is located in the center of the city, near the Bistrica. This camp accommodates visitors from all over the countries and houses them at the lowest price.

Besides the music performances, this festival is known for recreational spots, including the Ngom Shop. Another interesting event which takes place during these three days is the exhibition that presents the most beautiful parts of the city and its architecture. This exhibition is placed in Hamam.

'''Opéra de Baugé''' is an [[opera festival]] held each summer near the [[Loire Valley|Loire]] town of [[Baugé-en-Anjou]], 40 kilometres east of [[Angers]], [[France]].

From 2003 to 2011 the festival was held in the gardens of Les Capucins (pictured), a private house and former convent.  In 2016 the festival returned to Les Capucins after 4 years in a theatre in the centre of the town.

The festival is modelled on England's [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]], and performances feature 90-minute intervals during which members of the audience picnic or dine in the attached restaurant.  Many of the cast and orchestra are English, and the performances are [[Surtitles|surtitled]] in both English and French.  In recent years the festival has drawn an audience of 2,500-3,000 to the town, including large numbers who travel from England.

The 2016 season featured performancesof  [[L'incoronazione di Poppea]] ([[Claudio Monteverdi|Monteverdi]]), [[Albert Herring]] ([[Benjamin Britten|Britten]]) and [[La Périchole]] ([[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]). The works presented in 2017 are [[Lucia di Lammermoor]] ([[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]), [[La Cenerentola]] ([[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]) and [[La clemenza di Tito]] ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]).

The opera is noted for its authentic performances, with a full orchestra and chorus in support of fully staged productions.  The festival has increasingly attracted soloists from across Europe and beyond.  Singers have gone on to win prizes including the [[Kathleen Ferrier Award]] and positions in the Young Artists Programme at [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].

Bernadette Grimmett has been artistic director of the festival since its inception.

'''''Orson's Shadow''''' is a play by [[Austin Pendleton]]. The play received a [[Lucille Lortel]] Award nomination for Outstanding Play and won the [[Drama League Award]] for Distinguished Performance.

==Plot==
The play, based on true events, is set in 1960 [[London]]. In his declining years, [[Orson Welles]] is directing a production of [[Eugène Ionesco]]'s ''[[Rhinoceros (play)|Rhinoceros]]'', starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Joan Plowright]]. Olivier is fresh from his triumphant theatrical portrayal of [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]] Archie Rice and is about to reprise the role in the film adaptation of [[John Osborne]]'s ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]''. He and Plowright are in the early stages of a romantic liaison; Olivier's tumultuous marriage to [[Vivien Leigh]] is all but ended. Critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] also figures in the plot, which debates the merits of stage versus screen, the internal struggle that theatrical performers endure when contemplating a leap to films, and the ways that the studio system frustrated the careers of individual artists.

It is a study of theatrical egos, each of the protagonists living more on the stage than in real life, each one feeling insecure while jockeying for power.

== Production history ==
===United States===
The play debuted at the [[Steppenwolf Theatre]] in [[Chicago]] in January 2000 and was performed at the [[Old Globe Theatre]] in [[San Diego]] in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Citron, Cynthia. [http://www.curtainup.com/orsonsshadow.html Orson's Shadow Review], Curtain Up. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[off-Broadway]] production, directed by [[David Cromer]], opened on March 13, 2005 at the [[Barrow Street Theatre]], where it ran for 349 performances. The cast included Jeff Still as Orson Welles, John Judd as Laurence Olivier, Susan Bennett as Joan Plowright, Lee Roy Rogers as Vivien Leigh, [[Tracy Letts]] as Ken Tynan, and Ian Westerfer as the stagehand Sean.

Since its [[New York City]] staging, ''Orson's Shadow'' has been mounted by a number of [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]]s, including [[Marin Theatre Company]] in [[Mill Valley, California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sanfran/s828.html Talking Broadway]&lt;/ref&gt; Round House Theatre in [[Bethesda, Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/07/AR2007020702520.html Washington Post] 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Unicorn Theatre in [[Kansas City, Missouri]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infozine.com/news/stories/op/storiesView/sid/18574/|title=Orson's Shadow at the Unicorn Theatre, a Review - Kansas City infoZine|work=Kansas City infoZine|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Gorilla Theatre in [[Tampa, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, John.

===United Kingdom===
In 2006 it received a rehearsed reading at London's [[Old Vic|Old Vic Theatre]], and in July 2015 received its European premiere directed by Alice Hamilton at London's [[Southwark Playhouse]], as part of the Orson Welles centenary. The cast included John Hodgkinson as Orson Welles, [[Adrian Lukis]] as Laurence Olivier, Louise Ford as Joan Plowright, [[Gina Bellman]] as Vivien Leigh, [[Edward Bennett (actor)|Edward Bennett]] as Kenneth Tynan, and Ciaran O'Brien as the stagehand Sean.&lt;ref&gt;Stratford, Brice.

The '''Red Bull Big Wave Africa''' is a [[surfing]] competition held annually in [[Cape Town]], [[Western Cape]], [[South Africa]].

The event is held at "Dungeons", just east of [[The Sentinel, Hout Bay|The Sentinel]], a peak in [[Hout Bay]], [[Cape Town]]. The reef has been known since the 80's as a site for large Atlantic swells breaking over a reef. The competition is held between 24 July and 31 August each year, depending on when appropriately large waves are available. Between the first competition, in 1999, and 2007, only three victors had been decided. 

In the 2008 competition, 24 competitors participated. The six finalists were drawn from the [[United States]], [[Hawaii]], [[Brazil]], and South Africa for a first prize of R100 000. The competition was won by South African Grant "Twiggy" Baker.

"'''Red Museum'''" is the tenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 2)|second season]] of the [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on December 9, 1994. It was written by [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], directed by Win Phelps, and featured guest appearances by [[Mark Rolston]], [[Paul Sand]], [[Bob Frazer]], and [[Robert Clothier]]. The episode helps to explore the series' overarching [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Red Museum" earned a Nielsen household rating of 10.4, being watched by 9.9 million households in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with many noting the episode's complexity as a detractor.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In the episode, Mulder and Scully travel to Wisconsin after several teens are found wandering in the woods in their underwear with “He Is One” or “She Is One” scrawled on their backs. However, the duo soon stumble upon a strange cult of vegetarian “walk-ins.”

Originally, the episode was slated to be a crossover episode with the [[CBS]] show ''[[Picket Fences]]''. However, the networks nixed the idea before any filming could begin. A facet of the episode, that the adherents of the Red Museum believe that the year 2012 will bring about the dawning of The New Age, is later referenced in the series' finale "[[The Truth (The X-Files)|The Truth]]", seven seasons later.

== Plot ==

[[Fox Mulder]] and [[Dana Scully]] are called in to investigate a number of kidnappings in [[Wisconsin|Delta Glen, Wisconsin]] where local teenagers are recovered half-naked and drugged with either the phrase "He is one" or "She is one" written on their backs. Meeting with Sheriff Mazeroski, the agents initially suspect a nearby [[cult]], the Church of the Red Museum, which was founded by [[vegetarian]] Richard Odin. Mulder, Scully and Mazeroski attend a ceremony of the Red Museum, causing Mulder to believe that they are [[walk-in]]s, people whose souls have been taken over by someone else. One of the kidnap victims claims to have felt an animal spirit enter him.

Katie, the girlfriend of Mazeroski's son Rick, is the latest to be found, and her blood is found to contain an unknown alkaloid substance and high levels of [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]], a controlled substance. This appears to link her to Odin, a former doctor. Meanwhile, the agents meet an old man who points to a pair of men injecting growth serum into cattle, which he believes is the cause of the trouble. That night, local doctor Jerrold Larson is killed in a plane crash. An investigation of the site turns up shipping orders that trace back to the kidnapped teens. One of the men injecting the cows is murdered by the [[Men in Black (The X-Files)#The Cleaner/Crew Cut Man|Crew Cut Man]]. The other, a [[Voyeurism|peeping tom]] named Gerd Thomas, is revealed to be the kidnapper after the agents find a hidden supply of videotapes in the home of one of the victims. Thomas claims that Larson had been turning the children into "monsters" with the drugs he had been injecting in them, which he claims to be unknown.

Meanwhile, Rick is murdered by the Crew Cut Man. Having passed by him on the road, Scully recognizes him as the assassin who killed [[Deep Throat (The X-Files)|Deep Throat]]. Her toxicology results on the victims show what she thinks is the mysterious substance known as "Purity Control". Mulder theorizes that Larson had been injecting the children with alien [[DNA]], and convinces Mazeroski to round up all of the children who had been receiving treatment from Larson and hide them in the Church of the Red Museum. Mulder tracks the Crew Cut Man down at a beef processing plant that he is about to destroy. While Mulder wants him alive, Mazeroski kills him as revenge for Rick's murder and Deep Throat’s murder as well.

Scully reports that the Crew Cut Man had no records on file with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] or other agencies. The material injected into the cows and children is found to be an unknown substance. All the children who were inoculated came down with a flu-like illness while those in the Church of the Red Museum did not, causing her to think they were a [[control group]]. Scully declares the case open and unsolved.&lt;ref name="plot1"&gt;Lowry, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plot2"&gt;Lovece, pp. 133–135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

[[File:Michelle Pfeiffer and David E. Kelley.jpg|right|150px|David E. Kelley (''left''), series creator of ''Picket Fences'' initially wanted to make "Red Museum" a crossover|thumb]]

The original draft of "Red Museum" function as a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] episode with the [[CBS]] show ''[[Picket Fences]]''{{em dash}}an idiosyncratic [[CBS]] drama that ran from 1992 until 1996 and was set in the fictional Wisconsin town of Rome.&lt;ref name="picketfences" /&gt;&lt;ref name=poobala&gt;{{cite web|last=Natale|first=Richard|title='Fences' X'd Out|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,304822,00.html|date=9 December 1994|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea came about when [[David E. Kelley]] (the series creator of ''Picket Fences'') and [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (the series creator of ''The X-Files'') were talking in a parking lot about how interesting it would be to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome.&lt;ref name="poobala"/&gt;

Kelley and Carter started to plan out ideas, agreeing that unlike traditional crossovers, the two shows would each air their own episode, featuring characters from the other series.&lt;ref name="poobala"/&gt; However, CBS vetoed the crossover idea.&lt;ref name="picketfences"&gt;Lowry, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; Executive producer [[R.W. Goodwin|Robert Goodwin]] said of the experience: "I spent days on the phone with a producer of ''Picket Fences''. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing ''[[The X-Files]]''.' It's too bad."&lt;ref name="prod1"&gt;Edwards, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Picket Fences'' episode originally intended to crossover with ''The X-Files'' was called "Away in the Manger" and aired the week following "Red Museum." While every reference to ''Picket Fences'' was purged from ''The X-Files'' episode, the ''Picket Fences'' episode contains a few subtle references to the happenings in "Red Museum", including a mention of Dr. Larson.&lt;ref name="poobala"/&gt;

Producer and writer [[Glen Morgan]] was disappointed with how the Crew Cut Man was killed off in the episode, saying, "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, this is the guy who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [Carter]. He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him."&lt;ref name="rec1" /&gt; Morgan's writer partner [[James Wong (producer)|James Wong]] disliked the episode, saying, "I think that was one of the most confusing episodes I've ever seen. It had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally."&lt;ref name="rec1"&gt;Edwards, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ladner, British Columbia]] served as a location for Delta Glen, while the beef processing plant was shot in a facility in [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]]; local employees at the latter were even used as extras in the butchering and cleaning up scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gradnitzer and Pittson, pp. 66-9&lt;/ref&gt; The episode is the first in the series to mention the concept of walk-ins, a plot device that would later be used [[The X-Files (season 7)|five seasons later]], when [[Closure (The X-Files)|the truth about Samantha's abduction]] was finally revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast and reception==

"Red Museum" premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] on December 9, 1994.&lt;ref name="dvdliner"&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=The X-Files: The Complete Second Season |titlelink=The X-Files (season 2) |origyear=1994–1995 |others=[[David Nutter]], [[Daniel Sackheim]], et al |type=booklet |publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Corporation|Fox]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 10.4, with an 18 share, meaning that roughly 10.4 percent of all television-equipped households, and 18 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 9.9 million households.&lt;ref name="rating"&gt;Lowry, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode received mostly mixed to negative reviews from critics. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave "Red Museum" a B, noting that the episode was "creative if convoluted."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,295179_2,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219004834/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C295179_2%2C00.html |archive-date=19 December 2011 |dead-url=yes |title=X Cyclopedia: The Ultimate Episode Guide, Season 2 {{!}} EW.com |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' |date=29 November 1996 |accessdate=19 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewer Zack Handlen of ''[[The A.V.

This episode stands as one of the shining examples of that trend, and it’s only appropriate that the episode was written by Chris Carter."&lt;ref name=myth&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.entil2001.com/series/x-files/reviews/season2/2-10.html | title=Red Museum|last=Keegan|first=John | publisher=Critical Myth | accessdate=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the emergence of the [[Big Bang theory]] as the dominant [[physical cosmology|physical cosmological paradigm]], there have been a variety of reactions by religious groups regarding its implications for [[religious cosmology|religious cosmologies]]. Some accept the scientific evidence at face value, some seek to harmonize the Big Bang with their religious tenets, and some reject or ignore the evidence for the Big Bang theory.&lt;ref&gt;

  |quote=Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin's notorious chief ideologue, said in a speech of 1947 that Lemaître and his kindred spirits were 'Falsifiers of science [who] wanted to revive the fairy tale of the origin of the world from nothing ... Another failure of the 'theory' in question consists in the fact that it brings us to the idealistic attitude of assuming the world to be finite.'

==Hinduism==
The view from the [[Hindu]] ''[[Puranas]]'' is that of an eternal universe cosmology, in which time has no absolute beginning, but rather is infinite and cyclic, rather than a universe which originated from a Big Bang.&lt;ref name="SanatanDharma1"&gt;

 |quote=In the Vedic cosmogonies, the question of what caused the primordial desire does not arise; like the Big Bang of modern cosmology, the primal impulse is beyond all time and causation, so it makes no sense to ask what preceded it or what caused it. However, in the Hindu cosmology which we find in the Puranas and other non-Vedic Sanskrit texts, time has no absolute beginning; it is infinite and cyclic and so is ''kama''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SanatanDharma2"&gt;

'''Steady State'''  

Some say there must be more than we 
can fathom, rather favouring the thought
that chance alone cannot explain 
a world that's so complex and fraught.
They say the Big Bang is a fact,
that laws and constants have been so 
since one exclusive point and moment
only fourteen billion years ago.

The smallest chance becomes a certainty 
in endless time. A boundless trace
endures and shifts, unseen beyond 
the red horizon of our little space
where supernovae — little bangs 
of energy and sub-atomics — flow 
into primordial entropy, and then 
re-form the latest matter that we know.

The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two are the same, yet they are different.” The terminology used here refers to [[ancient Greek]] and [[Islamic philosophy]] ([[al-Kindi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] and [[Shaykh Ahmad]]).&lt;ref name = "rafati"&gt;Rafati, Vahid.

{{Campaignbox First Persian invasion of Greece}}

The '''Siege of Eretria''' took place in 490 BC, during the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]]. The city of [[Eretria]], on [[Euboea]], was besieged by a strong [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] force under the command of [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]].

The first Persian invasion was a response to Greek involvement in the [[Ionian Revolt]], when the Eretrians and [[History of Athens|Athenians]] had sent a force to support the cities of [[Ionia]] in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Eretrian and Athenian force had succeeded in capturing and burning [[Sardis]] (the regional capital of Persia), but was then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, the Persian king [[Darius I]] swore to have revenge on Athens and Eretria.

Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the [[Battle of Lade]], Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean to subjugate the [[Cyclades]], and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching [[Euboea]] in mid-summer after a successful campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to put Eretria under siege. The siege lasted six days before a [[fifth column]] of Eretrian nobles betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was plundered, and the population was [[deportation|deported]] to the village [[Ardericca in Susiana]] near the Persian capital.

After Eretria, the Persian force sailed for Athens, landing at the bay of [[Marathon]]. An Athenian army marched to meet them, and won a famous victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]], thereby ending the first Persian invasion.

== Sources ==
{{Main|Herodotus}}

The main source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History',&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Laws I, 5&lt;/ref&gt; was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—''Historia''; English—''[[Histories (Herodotus)|(The) Histories]]'') around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC).&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it.&lt;ref name = hxvi/&gt; As Holland has it: "For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally."&lt;ref name = hxvi&gt;Holland, pp. ''xvi''–''xvii''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with [[Thucydides]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, e.g. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0200&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.22 I, 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Fin15&gt;Finley, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the [[Siege of Sestos]]), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting.&lt;ref name = Fin15/&gt; [[Plutarch]] criticised Herodotus in his essay "On The Malignity of Herodotus", describing Herodotus as "''Philobarbaros''" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. ''xxiv''.&lt;/ref&gt; A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm|title=Herodotus: Father of History, Father of Lies|accessdate=2008-01-18|author=David Pipes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080127105636/http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1998-9/Pipes.htm |archivedate = January 27, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events.&lt;ref name = h377&gt;Holland, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his ''Historia'', but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism.&lt;ref name = h377/&gt; Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Fehling, pp. 1–277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica|Bibliotheca Historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus's.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus Siculus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&amp;layout=&amp;loc=11.28 Bibliotheca Historica], XI, 28–34&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are alluded by other authors, such as the playwright [[Aeschylus]]. Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]], also supports some of Herodotus's specific claims.&lt;ref&gt;Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=9.81.1 IX, 81]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Ionian Revolt|First Persian invasion of Greece}}

The first Persian invasion of Greece had its immediate roots in the [[Ionian Revolt]], the earliest phase of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, it was also the result of the longer-term interaction between the Greeks and Persians. In 500 BC the Persian Empire was still relatively young and highly expansionistic, but prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, p47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = h58&gt;Holland, p58–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h203"/&gt; Moreover, the Persian king Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt; Even before the Ionian Revolt, Darius had begun to expand the Empire into Europe, subjugating [[Thrace]], and forcing Macedon to become a vassal of Persia.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2011|p=343}} Attempts at further expansion into the politically fractious world of Ancient Greece may have been inevitable.&lt;ref name = h58/&gt; However, the Ionian Revolt had directly threatened the integrity of the Persian empire, and the states of mainland Greece remained a potential menace to its future stability.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, 171–178&lt;/ref&gt; Darius thus resolved to subjugate and pacify Greece and the Aegean, and to punish those involved in the Ionian Revolt.
&lt;ref name = h171/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darius-Vase.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Darius I of Persia, as imagined by a Greek painter, 4th century BC]]

The Ionian revolt had begun with an unsuccessful [[Siege of Naxos (499 BC)|expedition]] against [[Naxos (island)|Naxos]], a joint venture between the Persian satrap [[Artaphernes]] and the [[Milesians (Greek)|Miletus]] tyrant [[Aristagoras]].&lt;ref name = h154&gt;Holland, p154–157&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, Artaphernes decided to remove Aristagoras from power, but before he could do so, Aristagoras abdicated, and declared Miletus a democracy.&lt;ref name = h154/&gt; The other [[Ionia]]n cities followed suit, ejecting their Persian-appointed tyrants, and  declaring themselves democracies.&lt;ref name = h154/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.98 V, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; Artistagoras then appealed to the states of Mainland Greece for support, but only [[History of Athens|Athens]] and [[Eretria]] offered to send troops.&lt;ref name = h157&gt;Holland, p157–161&lt;/ref&gt;

The reasons that Eretria sent assistance to the Ionians are not completely clear. Possibly commercial reasons were a factor; Eretria was a mercantile city, whose trade was threatened by Persian dominance of the Aegean.&lt;ref name = "h157"/&gt; Herodotus suggests that the Eretrians supported the revolt in order to repay the support the [[Miletus|Milesians]] had given Eretria in a past war against [[Chalcis]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;layout=;query=chapter%3D%23875;loc=5.98.1 V, 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians and Eretrians sent a task force of 25 triremes to Asia Minor to aid the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23875;layout=;loc=5.98.1 V, 99]&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst there, the Greek army surprised and outmaneuvered Artaphernes, marching to Sardis and there burning the lower city.&lt;ref name = "h160"&gt;Holland, p160&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was as much as the Greeks achieved, and they were then pursued back to the coast by Persian horsemen, losing many men in the process. Despite the fact their actions were ultimately fruitless, the Eretrians and in particular the Athenians had earned Darius's lasting enmity, and he vowed to punish both cities.&lt;ref name = "h168"&gt;Holland, p168&lt;/ref&gt;  The Persian naval victory at the [[Battle of Lade]] (494 BC) all but ended the Ionian Revolt, and by 493 BC, the last hold-outs were vanquished by the Persian fleet.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p176&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was used as an opportunity by Darius to extend the empire's border to the islands of the East Aegean&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23933;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 31]&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Propontis]], which had not been part of the Persian dominions before.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23935;layout=;loc=6.32.1 VI, 33]&lt;/ref&gt; The completion of the pacification of Ionia allowed the Persians to begin planning their next moves; to extinguish the threat to the empire from Greece, and to punish Athens and Eretria.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p177–178&lt;/ref&gt;

In 492 BC, once the Ionian Revolt had finally been crushed, Darius dispatched an [[First Persian invasion of Greece#492 BC: Mardonius's Campaign|expedition]] to Greece under the command of his son-in-law, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]]. Mardonius re-conquered [[Thrace]] and compelled [[Alexander I of Macedon]] to make [[Macedon]] a client kingdom to Persia, before the wrecking of his fleet brought a premature end to the campaign.&lt;ref name = VI44&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%23946;layout=;loc=6.43.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt;
However, in 490 BC, following up the successes of the previous campaign, Darius decided to send a maritime expedition led by [[Artaphernes]], (son of the satrap to whom Hippias had fled) and [[Datis]], a [[Medes|Median]] admiral. Mardonius had been injured in the prior campaign and had fallen out of favor. The [[First Persian invasion of Greece#490 BC: Datis and Artaphernes' Campaign|expedition]] was intended to bring the [[Cyclades]] into the Persian empire, to punish [[Naxos, Greece|Naxos]] (which had resisted a Persian assault in 499 BC) and then to head to Greece to force Eretria and Athens to submit to Darius or be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.94.1 VI, 94 ]&lt;/ref&gt; After island hopping across the Aegean, including successfully attacking Naxos, the Persian task force arrived off Euboea in mid summer, ready to fulfil their second major objective - to punish Eretria.

== Prelude ==
When the Eretrians had discovered that the Persian task force was heading to attack them, they had appealed to the Athenians to send reinforcements.&lt;ref name = VI100&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231006;layout=;loc=6.99.1 VI, 100]&lt;/ref&gt; The Athenians agreed to this, and instructed the 4,000 Athenian colonists from the nearby Euboean city of Chalcis to aid the Eretrians.&lt;ref name = VI100/&gt; These colonists had been planted on Chalcidian land after Athens had defeated Chalcis some 20 years previously.&lt;ref name = V77&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.77 V, 77]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when these Athenians arrived at Eretria, they were told by a leading citizen, Aeschines, of the divisions amongst the Eretrians, and he advised them to leave and save themselves.&lt;ref name = VI100/&gt; The Athenians followed Aeschines' advice and sailed to [[Oropus]], thus avoiding the fate of the Eretrians.&lt;ref name = VI101&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231007;layout=;loc=6.100.1 VI, 101]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eretrians failed to come to a clear plan of action; in Herodotus's words "it seems that all the plans of the Eretrians were unsound; they sent to the Athenians for aid, but their counsels were divided". There were three competing plans - one group wanted to surrender to the Persians, seeking to profit thereby, others wanted to flee to the hills above Eretria, whilst others wanted to fight.&lt;ref name = VI100/&gt; However, when the Persians landed in their territory, a consensus was reached not to leave the city but to try to withstand a siege, if possible.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt;

== Opposing forces ==
=== Eretrians ===
Herodotus does not estimate numbers for the Eretrians. Presumably, the majority of the citizen body would have been involved in the defence of the city, but the population of Eretria at the time cannot be clearly established.

=== Persians ===

[[File:Trireme.jpg|thumb|right|The trireme, the main type of ship used by the Greeks and Persians|250px]]

According to Herodotus, the fleet sent by Darius consisted of 600 [[trireme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231001;layout=;loc=6.96.1 VI, 95]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus does not estimate the size of the Persian army, only saying that they were a "large infantry that was well packed".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus  [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.94 VI, 94]&lt;/ref&gt; Among ancient sources, the poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], another near-contemporary, says the campaign force numbered 200,000; while a later writer, the Roman [[Cornelius Nepos]] estimates 200,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry, of which only 100,000 fought in the battle, while the rest were loaded into the fleet that was rounding Cape Sounion;&lt;ref name = Nepos&gt;Cornelius Nepos, ''Miltiades'' IV&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]]&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Moralia'', 305 B&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias IV, 22&lt;/ref&gt; both independently give 300,000, as does the [[Suda]] dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;Suda, entry ''Hippias''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] and [[Lysias]] assert 500,000;&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Menexenus'', 240 A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lysias, ''Funeral Oration'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] 600,000.&lt;ref name = Justin&gt;Justin II, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians have proposed wide-ranging numbers for the infantry, from 20,000–100,000 with a consensus of perhaps 25,000;&lt;ref name = L46/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, p164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, p90&lt;/ref&gt; estimates for the cavalry are in the range of 1,000 &lt;ref name = L46&gt;Lazenby, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Siege ==
The Eretrian strategy was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; Possibly this was the only plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, this was probably a sensible strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp23–29&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the [[First Persian invasion of Greece#Lindos|siege of Lindos]] earlier in the expedition.&lt;ref&gt;Lind. Chron. D 1–59 in Higbie (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Persians landed their army at three separate locations, disembarked, and advanced towards Eretria.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; The Persians then began besieging the city.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; Rather than passively besieging the city, the Persians seemed to have vigorously attacked the walls.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; Herodotus reports that the fighting was fierce and both sides suffered heavy losses.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; However, after six days of clashes, two eminent Eretrians, Euphorbus and Philagrus, opened the gates for the Persians.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; Once inside the city, the Persians plundered it, burning temples and sanctuaries in revenge for the burning of Sardis.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt; Those citizens who were captured were enslaved, as Darius had ordered.&lt;ref name = VI101/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{Main|Battle of Marathon}}

After staying at Eretria for a few days, the Persians made their way down the coast towards [[Attica]].&lt;ref name = VI102&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.102 VI,102]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians dropped the captured Eretrians off on the island of [[Aegilia (island)|Aegilia]], before landing at the bay of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] in [[Attica]].&lt;ref name = VI102/&gt;&lt;ref name = VI107&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126;query=chapter%3D%231013;layout=;loc=6.106.1 VI,107]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians' next target was Athens. However, the Athenians had marched out from Athens to meet the Persians, and blocked the exits from the plains of Marathon.&lt;ref name = VI103&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.103 VI,103]&lt;/ref&gt; After several days of stalemate, the Athenians finally resolved to attack the Persians, winning a famous victory at the ensuing [[Battle of Marathon]].&lt;ref name = VI115&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.115 VI,115]&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle, the remaining Persians fled to their ships, picked up the Eretrians from [[Aegilia (island)|Aegilia]],&lt;ref name = VI115/&gt; and then sailed back to [[Asia Minor]], thereby ending the campaign, and the first Persian invasion of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.116 VI,116]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Persian fleet arrived in Asia Minor, Datis and Artaphernes took the Eretrians before Darius in [[Susa]].&lt;ref name = VI119&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126&amp;layout=&amp;loc=6.119 VI,119]&lt;/ref&gt; The Eretrians were not harmed by Darius who decided to settle them in the town of [[Ardericca in Susiana|Ardericca]] in [[Cissia (area)|Cissia]].&lt;ref name = VI119/&gt; They were still there, using their own language and customs, when Herodotus wrote his history,&lt;ref name = VI119/&gt; and were encountered by [[Alexander the Great]] during his conquest of Persia a further century later.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p543&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meanwhile, Darius began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = h203&gt;Holland, p203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son [[Xerxes I]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp206–207&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp208–211&lt;/ref&gt; The epic [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] finally began in 480 BC, and the Persians met with initial success at the battles of [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p151&lt;/ref&gt; However, defeat at the [[Battle of Salamis]] would be the turning point in the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p197&lt;/ref&gt; and the next year the expedition was ended by the decisive Greek victory at the [[Battle of Plataea]].&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp350–355&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Six-Day War of 1899''' was fought  between the [[British Empire]] and the major [[punti]] clans of the [[New Territories]] in [[Hong Kong]] on 14–19 April 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Hase, Patrick H. The Six-Day War of 1899: Hong Kong in the Age of Imperialism. Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press. 2008. {{ISBN|9789622098992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British quickly and decisively ended armed resistance, but to prevent future resistance made concessions to placate the [[indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]]. Despite losing to the superiorly equipped British military, they had achieved their ultimate goals which is to preserve their land rights, land use, and traditional customs. The special status and rights of the minority indigenous people of Hong Kong are still seen to this day. The casualties were two wounded on the British side and about 500 dead on the Chinese side.

==Background==
[[File:New Territories Proclamation (English).png|thumb|left|upright|The proclamation of the [[New Territories]] of Hong Kong by [[Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong|Colonial Secretary]] [[James Stewart Lockhart]].]]

On 9 June 1898, the British and the [[Qing government]] signed the [[Second Convention of Peking]], granting the British a 99-year lease of the [[New Territories]] as part of [[Hong Kong]].

Feeling abandoned by the Qing government and fearing for their traditional land rights and land use, the punti [[Chinese kin|Chinese clans]] mobilised the clan militias&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chung |first=David Wong Wing |date=March 1998 |title=The reason behind the resistance by the New Territories inhabitants against British takeover in 1899 |url=http://hk.geocities.com/yingconghk/NT.htm |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027114956/http://hk.geocities.com/yingconghk/NT.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 |access-date=10 June 2017 |via=[[Wayback Machine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been trained and equipped to defend against longshore raids by pirates and attempted to resist the British takeover of the territory.

==Events==
The war began on 14 April when the insurgents burnt down the masthead the British had prepared for a flag-raising ceremony at the [[Flagstaff Hill, Tai Po|Flagstaff Hill]] in [[Tai Po]].

125 Indian soldiers of the Royal Hong Kong Regiment&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Disbanded in 1902, this regiment is not to be confused with the later [[Royal Hong Kong Regiment]] formed from the body of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps consisting primarily of Europeans and Chinese.&lt;/ref&gt; was sent to Tai Po on 15 April and were soon besieged by the villagers. They were rescued after the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[HMS Fame (1896)|HMS ''Fame'']] shelled the insurgents' position.{{sfn|Hase|2008|p=15}} On 17 April, the British forces launched an attack on the insurgents in [[Lam Tsuen Valley]] and chased them up the hill. On 18 April, about 1,600 insurgents assaulted the British troops at [[Sheung Tsuen]] but were soon defeated. Further resistance was ended when British artillery was brought up against the punti [[Walled villages of Hong Kong|walled villages]], and the insurgents and villagers surrendered on 19 April. Most prominent of the villages in the resistance [[Kat Hing Wai]], of the [[Tang clan]], was symbolically disarmed, by having its main gates dismounted and removed.

==Aftermath==
After the war, Governor [[Henry Arthur Blake]] adopted an amiable co-operation policy with the villagers and it remained the official policy of the colonial government on the New Territories throughout almost the entire British rule.{{sfn|Hase|2008|p=16}} The British made the concession of allowing the [[indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories (Hong Kong)|indigenous inhabitants]] to retain traditional laws and customs to land inheritance, land usage and marriage, these differed from the laws made for Kowloon and Hong Kong proper and the legacy of which continues to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4467">'''The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show''' was a historical fashion show held on November 28, 1973, in the [[Palace of Versailles]] to raise money for its restoration. 

Created by [[Eleanor Lambert]] and Versailles curator Gerald Van der Kemp,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/battle-of-versailles-the-night-american-fashion-stumbled-into-the-spotlight-and-made-history/oclc/908176012&amp;referer=brief_results|title=The Battle of Versailles: the night American fashion stumbled into the spotlight and made history|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=2016-01-01|isbn=9781250062321|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; the show pitted French designers ([[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Pierre Cardin]], [[Emanuel Ungaro]], [[Christian Dior]], and [[Hubert de Givenchy]]) against American designers ([[Oscar de la Renta]], [[Stephen Burrows (designer)|Stephen Burrows]], [[Halston]], [[Bill Blass]], and [[Anne Klein]], who brought along her assistant, [[Donna Karan]]).&lt;ref name="Times-later-feature"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morris |first1=Bernadine |title=Review/Design; When America Stole the Runway From Paris Couture|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/10/arts/review-design-when-america-stole-the-runway-from-paris-couture.html|website=The New York Times|date= 10 September 1993 |accessdate=28 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With a guest list of 700 and notables such as [[Princess Grace]], [[Marie-Hélène de Rothschild]], [[Jacqueline de Ribes]], [[Gloria Guinness]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Liza Minnelli]], the event became legendary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/03/relive-the-magical-fashion-battle-of-versailles.html|title=Relive the Magical Fashion Battle of Versailles|work=The Cut|access-date=2017-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each designer was to submit eight designs for consideration. The Parisian designers viewed their competition as mere sportswear designers. The American designers used eleven black models, an unprecedented number at the time. The American designers and their models stole the show, providing a youthful approach and stunning the primarily French audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/908176012|title=The Battle of Versailles: the night American fashion stumbled into the spotlight and made history|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=2016-01-01|isbn=9781250062321|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Huffington Post Game Changer Awards honored the African American models of Versailles with the Style Award. The models included [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, [[Alva Chinn]], [[Norma Jean Darden]], [[Charlene Dash]], [[Barbara Jackson (Model)|Barbara Jackson]], [[China Machado]], Ramona Saunders, and [[Amina Warsuma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msfabulous.com/2011/10/huffington-post-style-gamechangers.html "Huffington Post Game Changers of Style".]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, filmmaker Deborah Riley Draper chronicled the event in the feature documentary, ''Versailles '73: American Runway Revolution''.  The film included designer [[Stephen Burrows (designer)|Stephen Burrows]], French Chambre Syndicale President Didier Grumbach, and many of the models, journalists and guest who attended the event in 1973.

In 2016 another documentary "Battle at Versailles" was made by the fashion network M2M, chronicling the event. The film was narrated by [[Stanley Tucci]] and featured many of the event's participants. &lt;ref&gt; [https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/battle-at-versailles/id1159755029?ls=1"Battle at Versailles".]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Great Beyond'''" is a song by [[R.E.M.]] written specifically for the 1999 film ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]''. It was released as a single the following year for support of [[Man on the Moon (soundtrack)|the film's soundtrack album]]. The single reached #3 in the [[UK singles chart]] in January 2000, the band's highest-ever chart position in that country. The unedited version is included in two R.E.M. compilations: ''[[In Time - The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003]]'' and ''[[Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011]]''. On the ''Man on the Moon'' soundtrack, there is some dialogue from the movie at the end of the track; meanwhile, the single version is a radio edit, with the bridge omitted.

In the unedited version, at 4:09 and at 4:26, the listener can hear [[Michael Stipe]] singing the following lines in the background: "Here's a little [[Agit prop|agit]] for the never-believer, here's a little ghost for the offering". Both lines were taken from the 1992 R.E.M. song "[[Man on the Moon (song)|Man on the Moon]]", also about [[Andy Kaufman]], from which the movie took its title.

The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].

The song's video was directed by [[Liz Friedlander]]. It originally featured footage of [[Jim Carrey]] as Andy Kaufman from the 1999 film. Yet, for the ''[[In View: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003]]'' [[DVD]] (which accompanied ''In Time'' and collected R.E.M.'s major videos from 1988 to 2003), the video was remixed to feature archived footage of Kaufman himself (similar to the video for "Man on the Moon"). The original version can be seen on the ''Man on the Moon'' DVD.

In June 2003, Michael Stipe sang an ''a capella'' excerpt from the song for a [[BBC Radio 2]] advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campaignlive.com/news/search/174074/ "Radio 2 TV ads reflect its unique positioning"] – www.campaignlive.com&lt;/ref&gt; He performed it on a stage in an empty theater. Welsh [[progressive breakbeat]] producers [[Hybrid (Welsh band)|Hybrid]] later would use this a cappella to create a bootleg remix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.breakbeatpolice.com/353/rem-the-great-beyond-hybrid-mix/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106205551/http://www.breakbeatpolice.com/353/rem-the-great-beyond-hybrid-mix |archivedate=2011-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was covered by [[The Fray]] in 2007 for the compilation album ''[[Radio 1: Established 1967]]''.

A live version of this song is included on ''[[R.E.M. Live]]''.

'''''The King's Speech''''' is a 2012 [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by David Seidler and based on the [[83rd Academy Awards|2010]] [[Academy Award]]-winning [[The King's Speech|film of the same name]]. The play was staged at the [[Wyndham's Theatre]] on London's West End and opened on March 27th, 2012 and closed on May 12th, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-17783302 King's Speech to close] accessed 11/5/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
The story of how King [[George VI]] overcame his fear of public speaking through the help of Australian speech therapist [[Lionel Logue]] was first researched by David Seidler in the 1970s. He had originally conceived the piece as a stage play, and contacted Valentine Logue, Lionel's son, and was able to gather information about the story. Valentine Logue asked Seidler to contact the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] and ask her for approval of the story being publicized. The Queen responded she did not want the story told until after she died. The Queen Mother died in 2002, and it wasn't until 2005 that Seidler began working on the story again. It was instead conceived as film. The film version of ''The King's Speech'', that starred [[Colin Firth]] as King George and [[Geoffrey Rush]] as Lionel Logue, was a critical success and won several Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor. The success of the film encouraged producers to bring the story to the stage as originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/article/the-kings-speech-to-transfer-to-west-ends-wyndhams-theatre-in-march-com-187594 King's Speech to transfer to West End] accessed 11/5/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The play made its World Premiere in February 2012 at the [[Yvonne Arnaud Theatre]]. It then went on a short tour in the UK and then premiered at the Wyndham's Theatre on the West End.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/9088425/The-Kings-Speech-to-transfer-to-West-End.html King's Speech to transfer] accessed 11/6/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the play was staged at the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/11444450/The-Kings-Speech-Birmingham-Repertory-Theatre-review-dogged-persistence-pays-off.html King's Speech at Birmingham Rep] accessed 11/6/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Triple Entente''' (from French ''entente'' {{IPA-fr|ɑ̃tɑ̃t|}} "friendship, understanding, agreement") refers to the understanding linking the [[Russian Empire]], the [[French Third Republic]], and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] after the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] on 31 August 1907. The understanding between the three powers, supplemented by agreements with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].

However, Italy did not side with Germany and Austria during [[World War I]] and joined the Entente instead in the [[Treaty of London (1915)]].

Historians continue to debate the importance of the alliance system as one of the [[causes of World War I]]. At the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, all three Triple Entente members entered it as [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] against the [[Central Powers]]: Germany and Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Gildea]], ''Barricades and Borders: Europe 1800-1914'' (3rd ed. 2003) ch 15&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Triple Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance or the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defense. Thus, Britain felt free to make its own foreign policy decisions in the 1914 [[July Crisis]].

==  Background ==
Russia had previously been a member of the [[League of the Three Emperors]], an alliance in 1873 with Austria-Hungary and Germany. The alliance was part of German [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]]′s plan to isolate France diplomatically; he feared that France's [[revanchism|revanchist]] aspirations might make it to regain its losses in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Feuchtwanger, ''Imperial Germany 1850-1918'' (2002). p 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  The alliance also served to fight against progressive sentiments, which the conservative rulers found unsettling, such as the [[First International]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGildea2003|Gildea 2003]], p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the League faced great difficulty with the growing tensions between Russia and [[Austria-Hungary]], mainly over the [[Balkans]], where the rise of [[nationalism]] and the continued [[decline of the Ottoman Empire]] made many former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] provinces struggle for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Henig, ''The Origins of the First World War'' (2002), p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation in the Balkans, especially in the wake of the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] and the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], which made Russia feel cheated of its gains made in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], prevented the League from being renewed in 1887. In an attempt to stop Russia from allying with France, Bismarck signed the secret [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia in 1887. The treaty assured that both parties would remain neutral if war broke out. The alliance between Russia and France and Bismarck's exclusion of Russia from the German financial market in 1887 prevented the treaty from being renewed in 1890. That ended the alliance between Germany and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Rich, ''Great power diplomacy, 1814-1914'' (1992) pp 244-62&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Franco-Russian Alliance ===
After the Reinsurance Treaty was not renewed in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/event/Reinsurance-Treaty Reinsurance Treaty]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian leaders grew alarmed at the country's diplomatic isolation and joined the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;George Frost Kennan, ''The fateful alliance: France, Russia, and the coming of the First World War'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entente cordiale ===
In 1904, Britain and France signed a series of agreements, the [[Entente cordiale]], mostly in solving colonial disputes. That heralded the end of British [[splendid isolation]] and was partly a response to growing German antagonism, as expressed in the expansion of the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial Navy) to become a battle fleet that could threaten the supremacy of the British [[Royal Navy]].

The Entente, unlike the Triple Alliance and the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not an alliance of mutual defence and so Britain was free to make its own foreign policy decisions in 1914. As British Foreign Office Official [[Eyre Crowe]] minuted, "The fundamental fact of course is that the Entente is not an alliance. For purposes of ultimate emergencies it may be found to have no substance at all. For the Entente is nothing more than a frame of mind, a view of general policy which is shared by the governments of two countries, but which may be, or become, so vague as to lose all content".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=K.A.|editor-last=Hinsley |editor-first=F.H. |title=British Foreign Policy Under Sir Edward Grey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJ08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 |year=1977 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-21347-9 |page=324 |chapter=Great Britain and France, 1911–1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 ===
In 1907, Britain and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]] to end their rivalry in [[Central Asia]], nicknamed [[The Great Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Ingram,   "Great Britain's Great Game: An Introduction" ''International History Review'' 2#2 pp. 160-171 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40105749 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Britain continued its policy of "[[splendid isolation]]", with its primary focus on defending its massive [[British Empire|overseas empire]]. However, by the early 1900s, the German threat had increased dramatically, and in Britain thought it was in need of allies. For most of the 19th century, Britain had regarded France and Russia as its two most dangerous rivals, but with the growing threat of Germany, policy began to change for several reasons:

# France and Britain had signed five separate agreements regarding spheres of influence in [[North Africa]] in 1904, the ''Entente cordiale''. The [[Tangier Crisis]] later encouraged co-operation between the two countries from their mutual fear of apparent German [[expansionism]].
# Russia was defeated in the [[Russo-Japanese War]], which resulted in less concern over Russian imperialism and encouraged Russia to secure its position elsewhere. France was already allied to Russia in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance]].
# Britain was frightened about the rising threat of German imperialism. Kaiser Wilhelm II had announced to the world his intentions to create a global German empire and to develop a strong navy.  Britain, traditionally having control of the seas, saw that a serious threat to its own empire and navy.
# In 1907, the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] was agreed, which attempted to resolve a series of long-running disputes over [[Persia]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Tibet]] and helped to address British fears about the [[Baghdad Railway]], which would help German expansion in the [[Near East]].

==France==
{{main|French Third Republic}}
During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] defeated the [[Second French Empire]], resulting in the establishment of the Third Republic. In the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]], Prussia forced France to cede [[Alsace-Lorraine]] to the new [[German Empire]]. Ever since, relations had been poor.

France, worried about the escalating military development of Germany, began building up its own war industries and army to deter to German aggression. Also, France developed a strong bond with Russia by ratifying the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]], which was designed to create a strong counter to the Triple Alliance. France's main concerns were to protect against an attack from Germany and to regain Alsace-Lorraine.
[[File:Triple Entente.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A 1914 Russian poster in which the upper inscription reads "agreement". The uncertain [[Britannia]] (''right'') and [[Marianne]] (''left'') look to the determined [[Mother Russia]] (''centre'') to lead them in the coming war.]]

==Russia==
{{main|Russian Empire}}
Russia had by far the largest manpower reserves of all the six European powers, but it was also the most backward economically. Russia shared France's worries about Germany. After the Germans started to reorganise the Ottoman army, Russia feared that they would come to control the [[Dardanelles]], a vital trade artery that carried two fifths of Russia's exports.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona K. Tomaszewski, ''A Great Russia: Russia and the Triple Entente, 1905 to 1914'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also Russia's long history of rivalry with Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary had recently annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], greatly angering Russia, which had considered itself the leader of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] world ([[Pan-Slavism]]). Russia viewed the invasion as another step towards annexing [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]].

Russia had also recently lost the humiliating [[Russo-Japanese War]], a cause of the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] and the apparent transformation into a constitutional monarchy. To counter its enemies militarily and politically, Russia sought to revive the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]].

Although it was perceived as useless during the war with [[Japan]], the alliance was valuable in the European theatre. Russia also signed the [[Anglo-Russian Entente|Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]] with Britain to counteract the threat of the Triple Alliance.

The alignment of the autocratic Russian Empire with Europe's two largest democracies was controversial on both sides. Many Russian conservatives mistrusted the secular France and recalled British past diplomatic maneuvers to block Russian influence in the [[Near East]]. In turn, prominent French and British journalists, academics and parliamentarians found the reactionary tsarist regime distasteful. Mistrust persisted even during wartime, with British and French politicians expressing relief when Tsar [[Nicholas II]] abdicated and was replaced by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] after the [[February Revolution]] in 1917. An offer of [[political asylum]] for the Romanovs was even withdrawn by the British king for fear popular reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gareth Russell|title=The Emperors: How Europe's Rulers Were Destroyed by the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4QFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP164|year=2014|publisher=Amberley|pages=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, France never brought up the subject of asylum with the deposed tsar.

'''Venera-D''' ({{lang-ru|Венера-Д}}, {{IPA-ru|vʲɪˈnʲɛrə ˈdɛ|pron}}) is a proposed [[Russia]]n space mission to [[Venus]] that would include an orbiter and a lander to be launched in 2026 or 2031.&lt;!--Note: this is not a range; From the standpoint of total mass delivered to Venus, the best launch opportunities occur in 2026 and 2031.--&gt;&lt;ref name='LPI 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name="fedspacenews"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gazeta.ru/science/news/2012/04/09/n_2284249.shtml | title=РАН: запуск "Венеры-Д" состоится не ранее 2024 года | publisher=Gazieta.ru | date=9 April 2012 | accessdate=September 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orbiter's prime objective is to perform radar remote-sensing observations with the use of a powerful radar. A lander, based on the [[Venera]] design, is also planned, capable of operating for a long duration (24 h) on the planet's surface.

The "D" in Venera-D stands for "dolgozhivushaya," which means "long lasting" in Russian.&lt;ref name="Joint proposal 2017"/&gt; Venera-D will be the first Venus probe launched by the [[Russian Federation]] (the earlier Venera probes were launched by the former [[Soviet Union]]). Venera-D will serve as the flagship for a new generation of Russian-built Venus probes, culminating with a lander capable of withstanding the harsh Venerian environment for more than the 1½ hours logged by the Soviet probes. The surface of Venus experiences average temperatures of 462° Celsius (864 Fahrenheit), crushing 90-bar pressures, and corroding clouds of carbon dioxide laced with [[sulfuric acid]]. Venera-D would be launched with either a [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] or [[Angara A5]] rocket.&lt;ref name='LPI 2017'/&gt;

==History==

In 2003, Venera-D was proposed to the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] for its "wish list" of scientific projects to be included into the Federal Space Program in 2006–2015. During the formulation of the mission concept in 2004, the launch of Venera-D was expected in 2013 and its landing on the surface of Venus in 2014.&lt;ref name= "spaceweb"&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/venera_d.html Venera-D mission at Russia Space Web] (accessed 25 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  In its original conception, it had a large orbiter, sub-satellite, two balloons, two small landers, and a large, long-lived lander (24 h).  By 2011, the mission had been pushed back to 2018, and scaled back to an orbiter with a subsatellite orbiter, and a single lander with an expected 3-hour operation time.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Stryk, [http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/3210.html Russia's Venera-D mission (DPS-EPSC 2011)], Planetary Society, 10/05/2011 (accessed 25 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the beginning of 2011, the Venera-D project entered Phase A (Preliminary Design) stage of development.  Following the loss of the [[Phobos-Grunt]] spacecraft in November 2011 and resulting delays in all Russian planetary projects (with the exception of [[ExoMars]], a joint effort with the [[European Space Agency]]), the implementation of the project was again delayed to no earlier than 2026.&lt;ref name="Joint proposal 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Report 2017"/&gt;

=== Status ===

[[Lavochkin Association]] are leading the effort in the development of the mission concept architecture. As of 2018, the second phase of the science activities between NASA and the [[Russian Space Research Institute]] (IKI) is currently underway with a focus on refining the science concepts, and the orbiter and lander mission architecture, as well as a detailed examination of the types of aerial platforms that could address key Venus science ''in situ''.&lt;ref name='2018 status'&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/pdf/1243.pdf Development of the Venera-D Mission Concept, from Science Objectives to Mission architecture.] 49th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2018 (LPI Contrib. No. 2083).&lt;/ref&gt; It is anticipated that additional workshops will be held as the mission concept develops.&lt;ref name='2018 status'/&gt; From the standpoint of total mass delivered to Venus, the best launch opportunities occur in 2026 and 2031.&lt;ref name='2018 status'/&gt;

==Goals==

The mission has an emphasis on the atmospheric superrotation, the geological processes that have formed and modified the surface, the mineralogical and elemental composition of surface materials, and the chemical processes related to the interaction of the surface and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Report 2017"/&gt; 

;The orbiter's goals are:&lt;ref name="Joint proposal 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name='2018 status'/&gt;
*Study of the dynamics and nature of superrotation, radiative balance, and the nature of the [[greenhouse effect]]
*Characterize the thermal structure of the atmosphere, winds, thermal tides, and solar locked structures
*Measure the composition of the atmosphere, study the clouds, their structure, composition, microphysics, and chemistry
*Investigate the upper atmosphere, [[ionosphere]], electrical activity, [[magnetosphere]], and the gas escape rate

;The lander's goals are:&lt;ref name="Joint proposal 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name='2018 status'/&gt;
*Perform chemical analysis of surface materials and study the elemental composition of the surface, including radiogenic elements
*Study of interaction between the surface and the atmosphere
*Investigate the structure and chemical composition of the atmosphere down to the surface, including the abundances and [[Isotope|isotopic]] ratios of the trace and [[noble gas]]es
*Perform direct chemical analysis of the cloud aerosols
*Characterize the geology of local landforms at different scales

==Potential NASA collaboration==

In 2014, Russian scientists asked NASA if the U.S. space agency would be interested in collaborating some instruments to the mission.&lt;ref name="Joint proposal 2017"&gt; {{cite news |last=Wall |first=Mike |url=https://www.space.com/35333-russia-nasa-venus-mission-venera-d.html |title=Russia, US Mulling Joint Mission to Venus |work=Space |date=17 January 2017 |accessdate=2017-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NASA Science'&gt;[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/news/2017/03/10/nasa-studying-shared-venus-science-objectives-with-russian-space-research-institute NASA Studying Shared Venus Science Objectives with Russian Space Research Institute].

==Pre-World Youth Day incidents==
In July 2013 it was reported that 320,000 young people had registered for this World Youth Day, although one million had been predicted by the organizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title = WYD organizers face financial squeeze | url =http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=18468 | work = CatholicCulture.org | date = July 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Brazilian newspaper reported that Rio organizers had unsuccessfully sought additional funding from government leaders.

A bus-truck crash in western [[French Guiana]] ([[Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni]]) on 17 July killed 21-year-old Sophie Moriniere, a member of a [[Paris]] WYD group, and wounded six others of the 23 young WYD pilgrims from France on the bus. Moriniere had been serving as a special correspondent for Notre Dame Radio. The bus was reportedly on its way to [[Kourou, French Guiana]]. [[Bishop]] [[Emmanuel Lafont]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cayenne]] in [[Cayenne]] celebrated a Mass for the crash victims, while Cardinal [[Andre Vingt-Trois]], Cardinal Archbishop of Paris, asked members of his Archdiocese to pray for the victims. [[Pope Francis]]'s [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], [[Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone]], [[S.D.B.]], sent a formal message of condolence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1303090.htm |title=Pope sends condolences after French WYD pilgrim dies in crash |publisher=Catholicnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A travel firm's bankruptcy affected pilgrims in 20 US dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sean |first=Michael |url=http://ncronline.org/news/faith-parish/travel-firms-bankruptcy-upends-world-youth-day-pilgrimage-plans |title=Travel firm's bankruptcy upends World Youth Day pilgrimage plans |publisher=Ncronline.org |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philippe Barbarin|Cardinal Barbarin]] canceled his participation after suffering a heart incident in Guyane, where 700 French WYD pilgrims were stranded due to airliner failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/cardinal-philippe-barbarin-suffers-heart-attack |title=Cardinal Philippe Barbarin Suffers Heart Attack |publisher=Zenit.org |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
