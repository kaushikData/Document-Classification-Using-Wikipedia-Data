Protests began the night of 12 June 2009, following the announcement that incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won nearly 63% of the vote, despite several reported irregularities.  However, all three opposition candidates claimed the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged, with Rezaee and Mousavi lodging official complaints. Mousavi announced he "won't surrender to this manipulation", before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on [[Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests#June|14 June]].&lt;ref name=join/&gt; Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] ordered an investigation into the claims of electoral fraud and irregularities, as requested by Green Movement leaders.&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{Cite news|title=Election Battles Turn Into Street Fights in Iran |publisher=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7830630 |date=13 June 2009 |accessdate=13 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibzFCQPv?url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7830630 |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonMurphy"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Anna Johnson |author2=Brian Murphy |title=Iranian protester killed after opposition rally |date=15 June 2009 |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090615/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |accessdate=20 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618115353/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090615/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_election |archivedate=18 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinaview"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran's supreme leader orders investigation into claims of vote fraud |date=15 June 2009 |work=China View |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/15/content_11546228.htm |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibzHnLho?url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-06/15/content_11546228.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmadinejad called the election "completely free" and the outcome a "great victory" for Iran, dismissing the protests as akin to little more than "passions after a soccer match".&lt;ref name=join1&gt;{{Cite news|date=14 June 2009|accessdate=23 June 2009|title=Iranian leader: Fiery clashes over election 'not important'|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2009-06-13-iran-vote-saturday_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===Prior to 2005===
{{main|History of the Islamic Republic of Iran}}
{{See also|Politics of Iran|Islamic Government: Governance of the Jurist|Iranian reform movement}}
Since 1980 following the [[Iranian Revolution|collapse of the Shah's regime in 1979]]. The government is based on the concept of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|Velayat-e Faqih]], which is a system of governance in which a ''faqih'' was to serve as the [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]. However, following calls that this idea was undemocratic, the system was moderately altered into the current "Islamic Republic", in which a [[Assembly of Experts|council of clerics]], who are elected by the people, choose the Supreme Leader who, per the constitution, has to be a cleric (though this was altered in 1988). The Supreme Leader, in turn appoints the members of the twelve member [[Guardian Council]], who approve laws and candidates for elections, even at the presidential level. The President of Iran is not the commander-in-chief, and the control of the military, police, and the parallel [[Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] is under the control of the Supreme Leader. The Revolutionary Guards is a constitutionally protected paramilitary force that operates alongside the regular Armed forces, whose primary function is to protect the Islamic Republic. The Revolutionary Guards also have an auxiliary wing called the [[Basij]], who provide support in enforcing religious laws and suppressing dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', W.W. Norton, (2005), p.88, 316–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/19/world/middleeast/19basij.html?_r=1&amp;ref=global-home |title=Shadowy Iranian Vigilantes Vow Bolder Action |work=New York Times |author=Neil MacFarquhar |accessdate=19 June 2009 |date=19 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are not considered full members of the Revolutionary Guards, and lack the training given to full-time members, although they can be called up at any time to assist the regular forces in times of trouble. Though Ayatollah Khomeini and his successor Ayatollah Khamenei, claimed that this system was democratic and the Revolutionary guards are necessitated to protect the government from military coups and foreign interference, critics contend that this system only serves to keep like-minded conservatives in power and marginalize any opposition, while using the Revolutionary guards to silence any dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308224 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=8 October 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146308301 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=13 November 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=2146307117 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=7 September 2005 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/media.asp?id=10588595 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Media - Articles |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webneveshteha.com/en/weblog/?id=1779650752 |title=Mohammad Ali Abtahi - Weblog |publisher=Webneveshteha.com |date=11 January 2004 |accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic Republic has not escaped popular opposition in the past. During the 1980s, the Marxist-Islamist, [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin Khalq]] was instrumental in opposing Ayatollah Khomeini through large protests and bombings against politicians such as [[Mohammad-Ali Rajai]], [[Shahid Beheshti]], and Khamenei himself, who escaped an assassination attempt that left his right arm paralyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/islam/countries/bl_IranRevolutionTerror.htm |title=Religion in Iran - Terror and Repression |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Daily News - June 1981"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eightiesclub.tripod.com/id112.htm |title=The Daily News - June 1981 |publisher=Eightiesclub.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=72375 |title=Iran ABC News broadcast from the Vanderbilt Television News Archive |publisher=Tvnews.vanderbilt.edu |date=1981-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the 1981 [[Hafte Tir bombing]], Ayatollah Khomeini declared the Mojahedin and anyone opposed to the Islamic republic, "enemies of god" and pursued a mass campaign of torture, rape, and execution against members of the Mojahedin, [[Organization of Iranian People's Fedaian (Majority)|Fadaiyan]], and [[Tudeh Party of Iran|Tudeh]] parties as well as their families, close friends, and even anyone who was accused of insufficient Islamic behavior, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Iranians who were usually tried in secret kangaroo courts run by hard line clerics.&lt;ref&gt;Moin, Baqer, ''Khomeini'', Thomas Dunne Books, (2001), p.243&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failed [[Operation Mersad]] in 1988, Khomeini [[1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners|ordered all prisons to execute those still in captivity]], resulting in an estimated 30,000 dead. Since then, no organized opposition has surfaced in Iran and following this experience, the Iranian Government usually employs heavy handed tactics to marginalize any attempt at regime removal and usually justifies this with the "enemy of god" classification.

In 1997, following the unexpected victory of a little-known reformist cleric [[Mohammad Khatami]], there was a revival of a moderate faction within the government whom the public believed had the ability to reform and curb the power of the conservatives and make the system somewhat democratic, and that Khamenei was willing to trust this faction in the hopes that it could recover the country after the eight-year war with Iraq, which Rafsanjani and the conservatives had failed to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1373476.stm |title=BBC News, 6 June 2001 Profile: Mohammad Khatami |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than promoting a reform of the system, the reformists began questioning the concept of the Islamic republic itself and following the exposure of the [[Chain Murders of Iran|murders of dissidents by the intelligence services]] in reformist newspapers (which were run by former Revolutionary Guards and intelligence agents now turned reformists), the government began to distrust Khatami and his faction, a conflict which reached the breaking point after the 1999 [[Iran student protests, July 1999|student protests]], after which hardliners such as [[Mohammad Ali Jafari]], [[Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf]], and [[Qasem Soleimani]] were promoted to take control of the Revolutionary Guards and the Security Services to crack down on most reformist movements. Despite reformists gaining a majority in the Majlis in 2000 and Khatami winning the 2001 election as well, Khamenei would oppose any attempts at liberalization of the government or society.&lt;ref&gt;"Men of principle", ''The Economist''. London: 21 July 2007. Vol. 384, Iss. 8538; pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Most Iranians and observers in general have regarded the reform movement to have been a failure with [[Saeed Hajjarian]], the main theorist behind the movement, declaring in 2003 that "the reform movement is dead. Long live the reform movement".&lt;ref&gt;اصلاحات مرد زنده باد اصلاحات&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahmadinejad's first term===
{{main|Government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (2005–13)}}
In 2005, Tehran Mayor [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was elected to the presidency, defeating now reformist [[Ali-Akbar Rafsanjani]], placing the conservatives in charge of the government once more. Ahmadinejad would focus his presidency on confronting Israel. His speeches gained international infamy, which usually called for the destruction of Israel and claimed that the [[Holocaust]] was fabricated. The funding of anti-Israeli groups went up exponentially, particularly towards [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]], which have been labeled as Terrorist groups by the United States. Despite Iran's huge oil and gas reserves, those sectors have been relatively neglected in favor of a nuclear energy program that has cost billions of dollars and has been condemned by Israel and the United States, who claim that the program is a cover up for a much larger nuclear weapons program. As a result, the United Nations has placed sanctions on the Iranian government, which has had a heavy impact on the economy, reducing the value of the rial from a low of 8,000 to the dollar in 2005 to 10,000 to the dollar in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=7 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203093100/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=3 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has been experiencing high birth rates since 1988, both due to an increase in standard of living and government encouragement of large families, with an estimated 60 percent of the country being under the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uesco.org/education/wef/countryreports/iran/rapport_2.html Country Reports - Iran]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===The election===
The [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|election of the president of Iran in 2009]] was preceded by [[Iran 2009 election#Opinion polls|many Iranian surveys]] and a survey by the US-based Terror Free Tomorrow organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/ |title=Terror Free Tomorrow |accessdate=18 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jc8EoPnz?url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/ |archivedate=7 September 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Terror Free Tomorrow opinion poll, conducted from 11 to 20 May 2009, predicted the high participation and showed similar ratios for the candidates to the later official result, with over a quarter yet undecided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ahmadinejad Front Runner in Upcoming Presidential Elections; Iranians Continue to Back Compromise and Better Relations with US and West.

The election for presidency took place on 12 June 2009. Unlike the [[Iranian presidential election, 2005|election in 2005]], the 2009 election featured high participation. The results of the elections were announced only 2 hours after the end of the votes, which may seem impossible. The [[Iran 2009 election#Result|official results]] were rejected by all three opposition candidates, who claimed that the votes were manipulated and the election was rigged. The last presidential election had already been [[Iranian presidential election, 2005#Election controversies|controversial]], but this time it escalated. Candidates [[Mohsen Rezaee]] and Mousavi have lodged official complaints. Mousavi announced that he "won't surrender to this manipulation" before lodging an official appeal against the result to the [[Guardian Council]] on 14 June.&lt;ref name=join/&gt;

According to an analysis by Professor Walter R. Mebane, Jr. from the Department of Statistics of the [[University of Michigan]], considering data from the first stage of the 2005 presidential election produces results that "give moderately strong support for a diagnosis that the 2009 election was affected by significant fraud".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mebane|first=Walter R.|title=Note on the presidential election in Iran, June 2009|date=18 June 2009|format=PDF|url=http://www.umich.edu/~wmebane/note18jun2009.pdf| accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK-based think-tank Chatham House also suspected fraud in the voting process for a number of reasons:&lt;ref name="chatham"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Voting Figures in Iran's 2009 Presidential Election|url=http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|date=26 June 2011|author1=Ali Ansari|author2=Daniel Berman|author3=Thomas Rintoul|publisher=Chatham House and the Institute of Iranian Studies, University of St Andrews|accessdate=21 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005142556/http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Middle%20East/iranelection0609.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| More than 100%
|In two Conservative provinces, Mazandaran and Yazd, a turnout of ''more than 100%'' was recorded.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;
|-
| No swing
|At a provincial level, there is no correlation between the increased turnout, and the swing to Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt; This challenges the notion that his victory was due to the massive participation of a previously silent Conservative majority.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;
|-
| Reformist votes
|In a third of all provinces, the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters, and all former centrist voters, and all new voters, but ''also took up to 44% of former Reformist voters'', despite a decade of conflict between these two groups.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;

|In 2005, as in 2001 and 1997, conservative candidates, and Ahmadinejad in particular, were markedly unpopular in rural areas. The claim that this year Ahmadinejad swept the board in more rural provinces in 2009 flies in the face of these trends.&lt;ref name="chatham"/&gt;

{{Main|Timeline of the 2009 Iranian election protests|Results of the Iranian presidential election, 2009}}

On Saturday 13 June after election results announced that Ahmadinejad had won, supporters of Mousavi took to the streets to protest. The next day, protests grew, as did violence. On the night of 14 June the pro-Ahmadinejad [[Basij]] paramilitary group raided Tehran University, injuring many. On 15 June millions of protesters marched on Azadi street and Mousavi made his first post-election appearance.

On 16 June, protests continued, and the [[Guardian Council]] announced a partial recount would be conducted; however, the vote was not annulled. On Wednesday 17 June another large protest occurred; some members of the [[Iranian national football team]] wore green wristbands in support of Mousavi during their game against South Korea. On Thursday, 18 June more than 100,000 protesters held a candlelight vigil in Tehran following Mousavi's call for a day of mourning for those killed in protests. The Guardian Council invited the three major challengers to meet to discuss their grievances.

On Friday, 19 June, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini spoke during religious services, saying the election was legitimate and called the large voter turnout and resulting victory (for Ahmadinejad) a "divine assessment" and that protests would no longer be tolerated. However, the opposition did not accept this and the protests occurred, albeit on a smaller scale. The next day, 20 June, fewer protesters took to streets. At the protests that did occur, said to number in the tens of thousands of people, much violence occurred, causing many would-be protesters to stay in their homes the next day, Sunday, 21 June. On 20 June, a young Iranian woman, identified as [[Neda Agha-Soltan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|language=French |publisher=egoblog.net |title=Her name was Neda |url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ |accessdate=21 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibz2nxSW?url=http://egoblog.net/2009/06/21/her-name-was-neda/ |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; was shot and died in front of cameras on Kargar Avenue in Tehran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=BreakForNews.com |title=Unidentified Woman Shot Dead in Karegar Ave – 20 June 2009 |url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm |accessdate=20 June 2009 |date=20 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ibz44O18?url=http://breakfornews.com/KarekarAveShooting090620.htm |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Highly graphic amateur videos of the killing rapidly spread [[Viral video|viral]] across the Internet after being posted to Facebook and YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Youtube|title=Basij shots to a young woman in Tehran's Saturday 20 June protests |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=185vPe_gROA |accessdate =20 June 2009|date=20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June, riot police broke up the main rally in Tehran with tear gas and live fire into the air.

During Friday, 26 June, prayers were broadcast live on television, and [[Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami]] is reported to have said that "Anybody who fights against the Islamic system or the leader of Islamic society, fight him until complete destruction" and called for the execution of leading demonstrators as they are "people who wage war against God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6583797.ece |accessdate=27 June 2009 |location=London |work=The Times |first=Martin |last=Fletcher |title=Leading demonstrators must be executed Ayatollah Khatami demands |date=27 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday, 29 June, the Guardian Council certified the results of the controversial election.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Council Certifies Disputed Election Results|author=Michael Slackman|date=29 June 2009|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set off a wave of protests, disregarding the Iranian government's ban on street marches.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; The Iranian intelligence chief alleged that western and "Zionist" forces were responsible for inciting the protests. Four of the nine British officials arrested on 28 June 2009 remain in custody under those charges.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;

Late July, protest had reportedly entered a "Phase II", using tactics such as the boycott of goods advertised on state-controlled television; attempting to deny power to state-run TV evening news broadcasts by turning on all electric appliances just before the news; "blitz" street demonstrations "lasting just long enough to chant `Death to the dictator!` several times", but not long enough for security forces to arrive; identifying paramilitary [[Basij]] vigilantes linked to the crackdown and putting marks in the opposition color green, or pictures of protest victims in front of their homes; scribbled anti-regime slogans on money. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The new protest is reportedly based on the idea of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] that "even the most powerful cannot rule without the cooperation of the ruled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1912941,00.html?xid=rss-world |work=Time |first=Robin |last=Wright |title=Iran's Protesters: Phase 2 of Their Feisty Campaign |date=27 July 2009|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 August, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term as President of Iran in an official inauguration in Tehran. Protests were held outside the Parliament during the inauguration, with protesters chanting "death to the dictator".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/world/52524657.html|title=Ahmadinejad sworn in as Iran president amid crisis|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=5 August 2009}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major protests would continue after the inauguration as well.

While the [[Death of Neda Agha-Soltan|death of Neda]] attracted widespread media attention, ''The Guardian'' is also maintaining a list of numerous other people who have ostensibly been either killed or arrested since the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Iran election: faces of the dead and detained |accessdate=5 July 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/jun/29/iran-election-dead-detained |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=29 June 2009 |first=Simon |last=Jeffery |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724091446/http://www.guardian.co.uk//world//interactive//2009//jun//29//iran-election-dead-detained|archivedate=24 July 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has issued very little official information on who has been killed or arrested (except Neda Agha-Soltan, whose video circulated quickly on the Internet). Hospitals were prohibited from registering the dead bodies or injured people, as a medical student at Rasoul-Akram hospital witnessed on the night of 15 June: "Nine people died at our hospital and another 28 had gunshot wounds...

The families of those who died were allegedly subjected to penalties and bureaucratic [[red tape]], such as being asked to sign paperwork that they do not have complaints against the government prior to being allowed to claim bodies. When the death was due to gunshot wounds, some were reportedly asked to pay a $3,000 fee, ostensibly for the bullet used by security forces.&lt;ref name="wsjalipour"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124571865270639351 |title=Son's Death Has Iranian Family Asking Why|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=23 June 2009 |first=Farnaz |last=Fassihi|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110126194701/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124571865270639351.html|archivedate=26 January 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions on burial locations have also been reported,&lt;ref name="wsjalipour" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makanbbc"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8113552.stm|title=Death video woman 'targeted by militia'|publisher=BBC News|date=22 June 2009|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iranian government did not permit a memorial service for Neda Agha-Soltan.&lt;ref name="makanbbc"/&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] speculates that the [[Arba'een|Shi'ite cycle of mourning]] on the third (23 June), seventh (27 June), and 40th (30 July) day after a person's death may give the protests sustained momentum, similar in fashion to what occurred during the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Wright |first=Robin |title=In Iran, one woman's death may have many consequences |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=23 June 2009 |date=21 June 2009 |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906049,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622174825/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1906049%2C00.html |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Torture of prisoners====
Opposition leaders have claimed that the prisoners have been tortured and raped in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090812/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_23|title=Pro-reform party blames Iran's president for abuse|accessdate=13 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition leaders and world leaders condemned the abuse.

Former chairman of Iranian parliament [[Mehdi Karroubi]] stated that male and female prisoners have been raped in the prison and their genitals were torn, but it is not yet proven. He asked the head of the assembly to investigate the issue in a letter to the head of [[Assembly of Experts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons |title=Opposition party leader claims sexual abuse in Iranian prisons |accessdate=9 August 2009 |author1=James Wray |author2=Ulf Stabe |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j5ISFK5N?url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1494473.php/Opposition-party-leader-claims-sexual-abuse-in-Iranian-prisons |archivedate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's police chief, Gen.

Additionally, several of the detained died while in prison. Authorities claimed that the deaths were caused by "pre-existing conditions". However, examinations of the bodies showed signs of torture, including broken bones, finger nails torn off, and rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090812/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_23|title=Pro-reform party blames Iran's president for abuse|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=13 August 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theaustralian&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,26093533-2703,00.html|title=Ahmadinejad's Basiji run a regime of rape, murder to suppress critics|work=The Australian|accessdate=4 October 2009 |first1=Martin |last1=Fletcher |date=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iranian film maker [[Reza Allamehzadeh]] made a documentary about Azar Al-Kanan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azar Ale-Kanan &amp;#124; Iranian.com |url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5j6930NAT?url=http://iranian.com/main/2009/aug/azar-ale-kanan |archivedate=17 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a prominent Iranian human rights activist and former political prisoner in Iran who became one of the victims of torture, sexual abuse, and finally, rape. The documentary was released after ex-chairman of Iranian parliament Mehdi Karroubi called for investigation of sexual abuse of protesters in prisons by Iranian police and the judicial system, both under the responsibility of the Supreme Leader. Karroubi's letter angered conservatives and the head of Iranian parliament, [[Ali Larijani]], and senior cleric and representative of the Supreme Leader, [[Ahmad Khatami]], denied the reports of sexual abuse. Following the denials, on 16 August 2009, [[Fereshteh Ghazi]], in an article in [[Rooz]], wrote her story and described the torture and sexual violence in Iranian prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=تکان دهنده تر از دروغ – roozonline.com |url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jD3gG533?url=http://www.roozonline.com/persian/news/newsitem/article////107/-1738c4bd99.html |archivedate=22 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=16 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June, Belgian national television reporter Jef Lambrecht from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] public television broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] and his sound technician, Vandervorst, were arrested in Tehran. They had been doing a story on the riots and had gotten caught in the middle of the violence. While Lambrecht had taken a punch, Vandervorst was arrested by riot police. When Lambrecht went to check where Vandervorst was being taken, he was promptly arrested as well. Both were taken to the Ministry of Information and detained in the basement. They were both released after two hours with strict instructions not to make any photos or film recordings of the protests. At the same time, two Dutch reporters from Nova were also arrested and deported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VRT-reporter opgepakt in woelig Teheran |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV |language=Dutch |date=15 June 2009 |work=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ic2uaN8l?url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=LO2BDPIV |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This directly appeals to the notion of injustice and redemption at the heart of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{Cite news|title=Demanding to be counted |url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13856232 |work=The Economist |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ic2vgQmU?url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13856232 |archivedate=28 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=23 July 2009 |date=18 June 2009 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, were [[Irreligion in Iran|irreligious]] in their protests.

For Iran, one of the links of communication exist solely because of the ideology the revolutionary movement was based upon Islamism (Poursaied, p.&amp;nbsp;136). The religious institutions were used to communicate from one revolutionary group to another. These institutions consist of "mosques, ritual centres, and even charity funds,&lt;ref&gt;Poursaeid Farzad, “Democracy Promotion, Authoritarian Resiliency, and Political Unrest in Iran", ''Discourse: An Iranian Quarterly'', Volume 10 (Winter/Spring 2012):119–143.&lt;/ref&gt; and these venues allowed people to gather right under the nose of the government in order to become organised.

Protesters have deliberately dressed modestly. The marches in Tehran saw women in [[chador]]s and turbaned clerics,&lt;ref name=econ/&gt; some of whom were seen thronging Mousavi's car during the 15 June rally at Revolution Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gunfire, euphoria: week that shook Iran|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iIZfBKxzXFlFYz1AGvhnIVr27tXwD98UIHVO1|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anna Johnson of Associated Press, conservative women in black chadors have joined the liberal youth for the common goal of trying to get their voices heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Anna Johnson|title=Families, women in chadors join Iran's opposition|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hWoxNISdzCH6A5mt0n0coCRzxg-QD98SQ4Q03|accessdate=14 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] reported that some protesters believed they had a religious duty to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Forbidden Iran: How to Report When You're Banned|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906069,00.html|author=Nahid Siamdoust|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bystander, [[Neda Agha-Soltan]], who was killed by authorities, has been mythologised by the opposition as a [[Shahid|martyr]]. The status of a martyr is revered in Shia Islam. To prevent this from happening, the authorities have tried to call off [[janaza|funeral services]] for her, which according to Shia Islam, must be held on the third, seventh, and 40th day after the martyr's passing. Robert Tait and Matthew Weaver of ''The Guardian'' noted that it was [[funeral procession]]s on the 40th day of [[mourning]] of fallen protesters in 1979 that created momentum in toppling the [[Pahlavi dynasty|shah's regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=How Neda Soltani became the face of Iran's struggle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/22/neda-soltani-death-iran|author1=Robert Tait |author2=Matthew Weaver |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of martyrdom resonates deeply amongst the Shiite Muslim population of Iran.

An '''abstention doctrine''' is any of several doctrines that a United States court may (or in some cases must) apply to refuse to hear a case if hearing the case would potentially intrude upon the powers of another court. Such doctrines are usually invoked where [[lawsuit]]s involving the same issues are brought in two different court systems at the same time (such as federal and state courts).

The United States has a federal court system with limitations on the cases that it can hear, while each state has its own individual court system. In some instances, the jurisdiction of these courts overlap, so a lawsuit between two parties may be brought in either or both courts. The latter circumstance can lead to confusion, waste resources, as well as cause the appearance that one court is disrespecting the other. Both federal and state courts have developed rules determining when one court will defer to another's jurisdiction over a particular case.

==Federal abstention doctrines==
The various abstention doctrines applied by federal courts are named for the [[United States Supreme Court]] cases in which they were enunciated.

===''Pullman'' abstention===
''Pullman'' abstention was the first "doctrine of abstention" to be announced by the Court, and is named for ''[[Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co.]]'', 312 U.S. 496 (1941). Concisely, the doctrine holds that "the federal courts should not adjudicate the constitutionality of state enactments fairly open to interpretation until the state courts have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to pass on them."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1986/1986_85_1513/argument/&lt;/ref&gt; This doctrine permits a federal court to stay a plaintiff's claim that a state law violates the [[United States Constitution]] until the state's judiciary has had an opportunity to apply the law to the plaintiff's particular case. The hope is to avoid a federal constitutional ruling by allowing the state courts to construe the law in a way that eliminates the constitutional problem or to rule it void under the state's own constitution.

For ''Pullman'' abstention to be invoked, three conditions must be apparent:
#  The case presents both state grounds and federal constitutional grounds for relief;
#  The proper resolution of the state ground for the decision is unclear; and
#  The disposition of the state ground could obviate adjudication of the federal constitutional ground.

Under ''Pullman'' abstention, the federal court retains [[jurisdiction]] to hear the constitutional issues in the case if the state court's resolution is still constitutionally suspect. In ''[[Government and Civil Employees Organizing Committee, CIO v. Windsor]]'', 353 U.S. 364 (1957), the Supreme Court held that litigants must ''inform'' the state court that they are contending that the state law violates a federal constitutional provision, so that the state court may take that into consideration when interpreting the state statute. However, in ''[[England v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners]]'', 375 U.S. 411 (1964), the Supreme Court noted that the litigants must not ask the state court to ''resolve'' the constitutional issue itself, or the federal court would be bound by ''[[res judicata]]'' to follow the decision of the state court. In such a case, the litigant seeking a judgment that the law is unconstitutional must usually appeal to the higher courts of the state, rather than seeking review in a federal court.

===''Younger'' abstention===
''Younger'' abstention, named for ''[[Younger v. Harris]]'', 401 U.S. 37 (1971), is less permissive to the federal courts, barring them from hearing [[civil rights]] [[tort]] claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim in state court. For example, if an individual who was charged with drug possession under a state law believes that the search was illegal, and in violation of their [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights, that person may have a [[cause of action]] to sue the state for illegally searching him. However, a federal court will not hear the case until the person is convicted of the crime. The doctrine has been extended to state civil proceedings in aid of and closely related to state criminal statutes,&lt;ref&gt;''Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd.'', 420 U.S. 592, 43 L.Ed.2d 482, 95 S.Ct. 1200 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; administrative proceedings initiated by a state agency,&lt;ref&gt;''Ohio Civil Rights Comm'n v. Dayton Christian Sch., Inc.'', 477 U.S. 619, 627 n.2, 91 L. Ed. 2d 512, 106 S. Ct. 2718 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or situations where the State has jailed a person for [[contempt of court]].&lt;ref&gt;Judice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine applies even where the state does not bring an action until after the person has filed a lawsuit in federal court, provided that the federal court has not yet undergone proceedings of substance on the merits of the federal suit.&lt;ref&gt;''Hicks v. Miranda'', 422 U.S. 332, 45 L.Ed.2d 223, 95 S.Ct. 2281 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three exceptions to ''Younger'' abstention:
# Where the prosecution is in bad faith (i.e. the state knows the person to be innocent); or
# Where the prosecution is part of some pattern of harassment against an individual; or
# Where the law being enforced is utterly and irredeemably unconstitutional (e.g., if the state were to pass a law making it a crime to say anything negative about its governor under any circumstances).

===''Burford'' abstention and ''Thibodaux'' abstention===
''Burford'' abstention, derived from ''[[Burford v. Sun Oil Co.]]'', 319 U.S. 315 (1943), allows a federal court sitting in [[diversity jurisdiction]] to abstain where the state courts likely have greater expertise in a particularly complex area of state law (the case itself dealt with the regulation of oil drilling operations in Texas). ''Burford'' allows a federal court to dismiss a case only if:

# The case presents "difficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public import whose importance transcends the result in the case then at bar," or 
# The adjudication of the case in a federal forum "would be disruptive of state efforts to establish a coherent policy with respect to a matter of substantial public concern."&lt;ref&gt;''Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co'', 517 U.S. 706, 727 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Burford'' abstention is closely related to ''Thibodaux'' abstention, derived from ''[[Louisiana Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Thibodaux]]'', 360 U.S. 25 (1959), which occurs when a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction chooses to allow a state to decide issues of state law that are of great public importance to that state, to the extent that a federal determination would infringe on state sovereignty. 

Unlike the abstention doctrines raised in federal question cases, there is a strong presumption that federal courts should ''not'' apply ''Burford'' or ''Thibodaux'' Abstention.

===''Colorado River'' abstention===
Finally, ''Colorado River'' abstention, from ''[[Colorado River Water Conservation District v. United States]]'', 424 U.S. 800 (1976) comes into play where [[parallel litigation]] is being carried out, particularly where federal and state court proceedings are simultaneously being carried out to determine the rights of parties with respect to the same questions of law. Under such circumstances, it makes little sense for two courts to expend the time and effort to achieve a resolution of the question.

Unlike other abstention doctrines, application of the ''Colorado River'' doctrine is prudential and discretionary, and is based less on [[comity]] or respect between different court systems than on the desire to avoid wasteful duplication of litigation. The classification of the doctrine as a form of abstention has been disputed, with some courts simply calling it a "doctrine of exceptional circumstances". Each of the various federal circuits has come up with its own list of factors to weigh in determining whether a federal court should abstain from hearing a case under this doctrine. Typically, such factors include:
* the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over property
* the order in which the courts assumed jurisdiction over the parties
* the relative inconvenience of the fora
* the relative progress of the two actions (added by ''[[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital v. Mercury Constr. Corp.]]'' in 1983)
* the desire to avoid piecemeal litigation
* whether federal law provides the rule of decision
* whether the state court will adequately protect the rights of all parties
* whether the federal filing was vexatious (intended to harass the other party) or reactive (in response to adverse rulings in the state court).

===Note on the ''Rooker-Feldman'' doctrine===
The [[Rooker-Feldman doctrine|''Rooker-Feldman'' doctrine]] has some characteristics of an abstention doctrine, because it prohibits federal court review of state court actions. However, it does not require federal courts to abstain from hearing cases pending action in the state court, but instead deems that federal courts lack [[jurisdiction]] to hear cases already fully decided in state courts. The doctrine is not a judicially created exception to federal jurisdiction. Rather, the Rooker and Feldman cases simply recognized the fact that Congress has not granted the federal district or appeals courts statutory jurisdiction to consider appeals of state court decisions, only the [[US Supreme Court]] via a [[writ of certiorari|writ of ''certiorari'']]). It is an open question whether Congress could grant such jurisdiction.

==State court abstention doctrines==
No national rule requires state courts to abstain from hearing cases brought in federal courts or in courts of other states, though the [[All Writs Act]] permits federal courts to enjoin state courts from hearing matters if necessary to preserve the jurisdiction of the federal court. But every state has some doctrine that lets its courts stay actions to avoid duplicative litigation.

Some states have doctrines that let state courts abstain from hearing cases already pending in other kinds of tribunals. For example, in ''Gavle v. Little Six, Inc.,'' 555 N.W.2d 284 (Minn. 1996), the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] upheld abstention where the state court might "undermine the authority of the tribal courts over Reservation affairs" or "infringe on the right of Indians to govern themselves".

In the Indian religious and philosophical traditions, all knowledge is traced back to the Gods and to the [[Rishis]] who saw the [[vedas]]. Thus, the advaita guru-paramparā (''Lineage of Gurus in Non-dualism'') begins with the '''Daiva-paramparā''', followed by the '''Ṛṣi-paramparā''', which includes the vedic seers [[Vasistha|Vaśiṣṭha]], his son [[Śakti Maharṣi|Śakti]], his son [[Parāśara]], his son [[Vyāsa]], (the famous redactor of the [[vedas]], he is also traditionally identified with [[Bādarāyaṇa]], the composer of the [[Brahma Sutra|Brahmasūtras]]), and Vyāsa's son [[Śuka]]. After Śuka, we turn to the '''Mānava-paramparā''', which brings us to historical times and personalities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/advaita-parampara.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apramada''' (Sanskrit, also ''apramāda''; Pali: ''appamada''; Tibetan Wylie: ''bag yod pa'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as "conscientious"  or "concern". It is defined as taking great care concerning what should be adopted and what should be avoided.&lt;ref name=g1&gt;Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 634-635.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eric1&gt;Kunsang (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is identified as one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)#Eleven virtuous mental factors|eleven virtuous mental factors]] within the Mahayana [[Abhidharma]] teachings. 

==Explanation==

}}
The [[Abhidharma-samuccaya]] states:&lt;ref name="g1"/&gt;

:What is concern? From taking its stand on non-attachment ([[alobha]]), non-hatred ([[adveṣa]]), and non-deludedness ([[amoha]]) coupled with diligence ([[vīrya]]), it considers whatever is positive and protects the mind against things which cannot satisfy. Its function is to make complete and to realize all worldly and transworldly excellences.

Alexander Berzin states:&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Berzin (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
: A caring attitude (bag-yod, carefulness) is a subsidiary awareness that, while remaining in a state of detachment, imperturbability, lack of naivety, and joyful perseverance, causes us to meditate on constructive things and safeguards against leaning toward tainted (negative) things. In other words, being disgusted with and not longing for compulsive existence, not wanting to cause harm in response to its suffering, not being naive about the effects of our behavior, and taking joy in acting constructively, a caring attitude brings us to act constructively and to refrain from destructive behavior. This is because we care about the situations of others and ourselves and about the effects of our actions on both; we take them seriously.

Robert Thurman emphasizes the high degree of apramada of someone who has realized [[sunyata|emptiness]] (a.k.a. "voidness"):&lt;ref&gt;Thurman (2008), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;
: This denotes a type of awareness of the most seemingly insignificant aspects of daily life, an awareness derived as a consequence of the highest realization of the ultimate nature of reality. As it is stated in the ''Anavataptaparipṛcchasutra'': "He who realizes voidness, that person is consciously aware." "Ultimate realization," far from obliterating the relative world, brings it into highly specific, albeit dreamlike, focus.

This term is described at length in chapter four of the [[Bodhicharyavatara]].

[[File:Venugopal2.JPG|thumb|Bhagvan Krishna]]{{Contains Indic text}}

'''Bhagavān''' (Sanskrit: {{lang|sa|भगवान्}}, {{IAST|Bhagavān}}) is an epithet for [[deity]], particularly for [[Krishna]] and other [[avatar]]s of [[Vishnu]] in [[Vaishnavism]], as well as for [[Shiva]] in the [[Shaivism]] tradition of [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref name=james&gt;James Lochtefeld (2000), "Bhagavan", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=friha/&gt; and is used by [[Jains]] to refer to the [[Tirthankara]]s, more particularly [[Mahavira]] and is used by [[Buddhists]] to refer to the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|title=The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[north India]], ''Bhagavān'' also represents the concept of abstract God to Hindus who are religious but do not worship a specific deity.&lt;ref name=james/&gt;

The term ''Bhagavān'' does  appear in [[Vedas]], in early or middle [[Upanishad]]s. The oldest Sanskrit texts use the term [[Brahman]] to represent an abstract Supreme Soul, Absolute Reality, while using names of deities like Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva to represent gods and goddesses. The term [[Ishvara]] appears in later Vedas and middle Upanishads where it is used to discuss spiritual concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/mwquery/ Search for Izvara], University of Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Ishvara", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0823931798}}, page 306&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Bhagavān'' is found in later era literature, such as the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' and the ''[[Purana]]''s.&lt;ref name=friha&gt;Friedhelm Hardy (1990), The World's Religions: The Religions of Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415058155}}, pages 79-83&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhakti]] school literature, the term is typically used for any deity to whom prayers are offered; for example, [[Rama]], [[Ganesha]], [[Kartikeya]], Krishna, Shiva or Vishnu. Often the deity is the devotee's one and only Bhagavan.&lt;ref name=friha/&gt; Bhagavan is male in Bhakti traditions, and the female equivalent of Bhagavān is [[Bhagavati|Bhagavatī]].&lt;ref&gt;Friedhelm Hardy (1990), The World's Religions: The Religions of Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415058155}}, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Caldwell (1998), Bhagavati, in Devi: Goddesses of India (Editors: John Stratton Hawley, Donna Marie Wulff), Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814912}}, pages 195-198&lt;/ref&gt; To some Hindus the word Bhagavan is an abstract, genderless God concept.

In Buddhism's [[Pali Canon|Pali scriptures]], the term is used with [[Gautama Buddha]], referring to him as ''Bhagavān Buddha'' (translated with the phrase 'Lord Buddha' or 'The Blessed One') and ''Bhagavān Shakyamuni''.&lt;ref&gt;The latter term preferred by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his English translations of the Pali Canon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ju-Hyung Rhi (1994), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3250056 From Bodhisattva to Buddha: The Beginning of Iconic Representation in Buddhist Art], Artibus Asiae, Vol. 54, No. 3/4, pages 207-225&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Bhagavān'' is also found in other [[Theravada]], [[Mahayana]] and [[Vajrayana|Tantra]] Buddhist texts.&lt;ref name=johncampbell/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterharvey/&gt;

Bhagavān is generally translated as ''idol''. In modern usage, ''Bhagavān'' is synonymous with ''Ishvara'', ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|Devatā]]'', ''[[Hari]]'' or ''[[Prabhu]]'', in some schools of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=apte/&gt; Bhagavan is alternatively spelled as ''Bhagvān'', ''Bhagwan'' or ''Bhagawan''. The word is, in some sects, used as an honorific title for a spiritual leader considered fully enlightened by the sect. The word is also a proper noun and used as a first name for boys.

==Etymology and meaning==
''Bhagavān'' literally means "fortunate, blessed" (from the noun ''{{IAST|[[bhaga]]}}'', meaning "fortune, wealth", cognate to Slavic ''{{lang|sla-Latn|bog}}'' "[[Bog (disambiguation)|god]]", Polish ''bogaty'' Serbo-Croatian ''bogat'', Russian ''{{lang|ru|богатый}} (bogatyj)'' "wealthy"), and hence "illustrious, divine, venerable, holy", etc.&lt;ref name="MD"&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/romadict.pl?query=bhagavat&amp;display=simple&amp;table=macdonell Macdonell Sanskrit-English dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Vishnu Purana]]'' defines ''Bhagavān'' as follows,
{{quote|
&lt;nowiki&gt;
उत्पत्तिं प्रलयं चैव भूतानामागतिं गतिम् |&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
वेत्तिं विद्यामविद्यां च स वाच्यो भगवानिति ||&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He who understands the creation and dissolution, the appearance and disappearance of beings, the wisdom and ignorance, should be called ''Bhagavān''.
|Vishnu Purana, VI.5.78 &lt;ref&gt;[[Alain Daniélou]], The Myths and Gods of India, Princeton/Bollingen Paperbacks, {{ISBN|978-0892813544}}, page 36&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same text defines [[Bhaga]] and provides the etymological roots as follows as translated by Wilson,&lt;ref name=hhwilson/&gt;
{{quote|
Knowledge is of two kinds, that which is derived from scripture, and that which is derived from reflection. Brahma that is the word is composed of scripture; Brahma that is supreme is produced of reflection. Ignorance is utter darkness, in which knowledge, obtained through any sense (as that of hearing), shines like a lamp; but the knowledge that is derived from reflection breaks upon the obscurity like the sun. (...) That which is imperceptible, undecaying, inconceivable, unborn, inexhaustible, indescribable; which has neither form, nor hands, nor feet; which is almighty, omnipresent, eternal; the cause of all things, and without cause; permeating all, itself unpenetrated, and from which all things proceed; that is the object which the wise behold, that is Brahma, that is the supreme state, that is the subject of contemplation to those who desire liberation, that is the thing spoken of by the Vedas, the infinitely subtile, supreme condition of '''Vishnu'''.

That essence of the supreme is defined by the term Bhagavat. The word Bhagavat is the denomination of that primeval and eternal god: and he who fully understands the meaning of that expression, is possessed of holy wisdom, the sum and substance of the Vedas. The word Bhagavat is a convenient form to be used in the adoration of that supreme being, to whom no term is applicable; and therefore Bhagavat expresses that supreme spirit, which is individual, almighty, and the cause of causes of all things. The letter '''Bh''' implies the cherisher and supporter of the universe. By '''ga''' is understood the leader, impeller, or creator. The disyllable '''Bhaga''' indicates the six properties, dominion, might, glory, splendour, wisdom, and dispassion. The purport of the letter '''va''' is that elemental spirit in which all beings exist, and which exists in all beings. And thus this great word '''Bhagavan''' is the name of Vásudeva, who is one with the supreme Brahma, and of no one else. This word therefore, which is the general denomination of an adorable object, is not used in reference to the supreme in a general, but a special signification. When applied to any other (thing or person) it is used in its customary or general import. In the latter case it may purport one who knows the origin and end and revolutions of beings, and what is wisdom, what ignorance. In the former it denotes wisdom, energy, power, dominion, might, glory, without end, and without defect.
|Vishnu Purana, VI.5 &lt;ref name=hhwilson&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp160.htm The Vishnu Purana] HH Wilson (Translator)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bhagavan is related to the root ''Bhaj'' (भज्, "to revere, adore"), and implies someone "glorious, illustrious, revered, venerable, divine, holy (an epithet applied to gods, holy or respectable personages)".&lt;ref name=apte&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=118|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%97%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8D&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The root ''Bhaj'' also means "share with, partake of, aportion".&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=bhaj&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 bhaj], Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=francixc&gt;Francis  Clooney and Tony Stewart, in S Mittal and GR Thursby (Editors): The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 163-178&lt;/ref&gt; Clooney and Stewart state that this root, in Vaishnava traditions, implies Bhagavan as one perfect creator that a devotee seeks to partake from, share his place with, by living in god, in the way of god, the loving participation between the two being its own reward.&lt;ref name=francixc/&gt;

[[Buddha]] is referred to as Bhagavan in ancient and medieval Theravada, Mahayana and Tantra Buddhist texts, where it connotes, "Lord, Blessed One, Fortunate One".&lt;ref name=peterharvey&gt;Peter Harvey, Buddhism, Bloomsbury Academic, {{ISBN|978-0826453501}}, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D Keown (2008), A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800626}}, page 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alexwayman/&gt;

==Hinduism==

===Literature===
The Vedic texts neither mention nor provide a basis to explain the origin of the ''Bhagavān'' concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World’s Religions|publisher=Routledge|page=611|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HAg3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA612&amp;dq=bhagavan+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-TCJVNawLoufuQTUj4E4&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagavan%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Upanishads

The root of ''Bhagavan'', ''Bhaga'' is mentioned in the ''[[Mundaka Upanishad]]'', but it does not mean or imply ''Bhagavan'':

:शौनको ह वै महाशालोऽङ्गिरसं विधिवदुपसन्नः पप्रच्छ ।
:कस्मिन्नु '''भगवो''' विज्ञाते सर्वमिदं विज्ञातं भवतीति ॥ ३ ॥

:Shaunaka asked: Can knowledge of the world's reality be so complete that all the many things we see are understood in it?
:Can something so complete, excellent be found that knowing it, one knows everything?
:– ''Mundaka Upanishad'' I.1.3 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=45|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Constructive_Survey_of_Upanishadic_Phi.html?id=fk8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ananda Wood (1996), Interpreting the Upanishads, pages 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Mundaka Upanishad'' then answers this question in two parts over verses 1.1.4 through 3.2.11&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Muller]], The Upanishads, Part 2, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads02ml#page/26/mode/2up Mundaka Upanishad], Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; - lower knowledge and higher knowledge. The lower knowledge includes Vedas, phonetics, grammar, etymology, meter, astronomy and ceremony rituals. The higher knowledge, the Upanishad asserts, is Self-knowledge and realizing its oneness with Brahman - the one which cannot be seen, nor seized, which has no origin, no qualities, no hips, nor ears, no hands, nor feet, one that is the eternal, all-pervading, infinitesimal, imperishable. The word Bhagavan does not appear in the ''Mundaka Upanishad'' and other early or middle Upanishads.&lt;ref name=friha/&gt;

Later and medieval era Upanishads mention ''Bhagavān''. For example, the very first verse of the ''Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣhad'' includes it, as follows,&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt;

{{quote|
द्वापरान्ते नारदो ब्रह्माणं जगाम कथं '''भगवन्''' गां पर्यटन् कलिं सन्तरेयमिति

At the start of the Dvapara [Yuga] [[Narada]] went to Brahma and asked, "O Lord, how shall I, roaming over the earth, be able to overcome the effects of Kali [Yuga]?"
|''[[Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad]]'', 1.1 &lt;ref name=knaiyar&gt;Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कलि-सण्टारण_उपनिषद् कलि-सण्टारण उपनिषद्] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation: KN Aiyar, Thirty Minor Upanishads, Madras (1914), Reprinted in 1980 as {{ISBN|978-0935548006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa, a minor Upanishad, then proceeds to disclose, among other things, two Bhagavan names in the [[Hare Krishna mantra]] in verse 2,&lt;ref&gt;Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare&lt;br&gt;Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare&lt;/ref&gt; which is sung by [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)]] devotees.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt;

;Purana

In ''Bhagavata Dharma'' it denotes Narayana Vasudeva's four vyuha formations. [[Ishvara]] or God is called Bhagavan and the person consecrated to Bhagavan is called a [[Bhagavata]]. The [[Bhagavata Purana]] (I.iii.28) identifies [[Krishna]] as [[Narayana]], [[Vāsudeva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Hari]] – ''Bhagavan'' present in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Body of God|author=Dennis Hudson|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=578, 33, 34|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IMCxbOezDi4C&amp;pg=PA578&amp;dq=Bhagavan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1uaHVLHAG9Xd8AWMkoCoBg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhagavan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bhagavan'' is the complete revelation of the Divine; [[Brahman]], the impersonal Absolute, is unqualified and therefore, never expressed; [[Paramatman]] is Bhagavan in relation to [[Prakṛti]] and the [[Jiva]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sword and the Flute-Kali and Krsna|author=David R.Kinsley|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=69|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qKE93CHnRwgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=Bhagavan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=neqHVJ3-MsGm8AWR2YLQDg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBjgy#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhagavan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, the Yoga of Devotion implies that if a ''Bhagavata'', the devotee of ''Bhagavan'', seeks and longs for ''Bhagavan'', then ''Bhagavan'' too seeks his devotee in equal measure, for there can be no Yoga of knowledge without a human seeker of the knowledge, the supreme subject of knowledge and the divine use by the individual of the universal faculties of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Synthesis of Yoga|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Lotus Press|page=32|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Ex6cSqqBSwC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=Bhagavan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8-yHVJaGC5fg8AXIhYCIDA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Bhagavan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bhagavad Gita

The term Bhagavan appears extensively in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', as Krishna counsels Arjuna.&lt;ref name=friha/&gt; For example,

{{quote|
श्री'''भगवानु'''वाच&lt;nowiki&gt; । कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् । अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन ॥ २-२॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Shri Bhagavan said, "from where had this weakness arisen, at this inconvenient time?&lt;br&gt;It is not noble, neither will it lead you to heaven, nor will it earn you valor, O Arjuna.
|[[Bhagavad Gita]], 2.2 &lt;ref&gt;GK Marballi (2013), Journey Through The Bhagavad Gita, {{ISBN|978-1304558480}}, page 26&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Vaishnavism===
{{Vaishnavism}}
The ''Bhāgavat'' traditions of [[Hinduism]] invoke Bhagavan in ''Narayan Upakheyam'' and in Bhagavad Gita of [[Bhishma Parva]] of the [[Mahabharata]]. The devotion to Lord Vishnu (identified as Vasudeva in Mahabharata) is described as ten incarnations of Vishnu.

In [[Hinduism]], the word, ''Bhagavān'', indicates the Supreme Being or Absolute Truth conceived as a [[Personal God]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.krishna.com/node/118 Who is Krishna?] "God the person, or Bhagavan"&lt;/ref&gt; This ''personal'' feature indicated by the word ''Bhagavān'' differentiates its usage from other similar terms&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/2/11/en1 Bhag-P 1.2.11] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235140/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/1/2/11/en1 |date=26 September 2007 }} "Learned transcendentalists who know the Absolute Truth call this the non-dual "Brahman", "Paramatmān " or "Bhagavān"&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Brahman]], the "Supreme Spirit" or "spirit", and thus, in this usage, ''Bhagavan'' is analogous to the [[Christianity|Christian]] conception of [[God the Father]]. In ''Vaisnavism'', a devotee of ''Bhagvān'' Krishna is called a ''[[Bhagavata|Bhāgavata]]''.

The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' (1.2.11) states the definition of ''Bhagavān'' to mean the supreme most being: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Learned Know the Absolute Truth call this non-dual substance ''[[Brahman]]'', ''[[Paramatma]]'' or ''Bhagavan''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{IAST|vadanti tat tattva-vidas}}/ {{IAST|tattvam yaj jnanam advayam}}/ {{IAST|brahmeti paramatmeti}}/ {{IAST|bhagavan iti sabdyate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; ''Bhagavān'' used as a title of [[veneration]] is often directly used as "Lord", as in ''"Bhagavān [[Rama]]"'', ''"Bhagavān [[Krishna]]"'', ''"Bhagavān [[Shiva]]"'', etc. In [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Mahavira]] and other [[Tirthankara]]s, [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[bodhisattva]]s are also venerated with this title. The feminine of ''Bhagavat'' is '''''Bhagawatī''''' and is an epithet of [[Durga]] and other [[Goddesses#Hinduism|goddesses]]. This title is also used by a number of contemporary spiritual teachers in [[India]] who claim to be Bhagavan or have realized impersonal Brahman.

''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotion to God) consists in actions performed dedicated to the [[Paramatman]], the individuated existence which has free-will and who is the final cause of the world; the [[Vedic]] [[Rishi]]s describe the goals originated from God as ''Bhagavān'', the [[Ananda]] aspect of God where God has manifested His personality is called ''Bhagavān'' when consciousness (pure self-awareness) aligns with those goals to cause the unified existence and commencement of works follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Creationism|author=Ashish Dalela|publisher=iUniverse|page=337|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qLe-aZfl7YEC&amp;pg=PA333&amp;dq=bhagavan+vedas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-TCJVNawLoufuQTUj4E4&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagavan%20vedas&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Bhagavā in Buddhist texts

Some Buddhist texts, such as the Pali ''suttas'', use the word ''"Bhagavā"'' for [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], meaning as 'the fortunate one'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Buddhist Philosophy|author=David J. Kalupahana|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=111|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SlDArya3YvcC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;dq=bhagava++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oh-IVOjIK8W8uATMpIHABQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagava%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''"Bhagavā"'' has been used in Pali [[Anussati]] or recollections as one of the terms that describes the "[[Tathāgata]]" as one full of good qualities, as ''arahant'', ''sammā-sambuddho'' and ''sugato'' (Dīgha Nikāya II.93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|publisher=Routledge|page=94|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NFpcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94&amp;dq=bhagava++buddhism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Oh-IVOjIK8W8uATMpIHABQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bhagava%20%20buddhism&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Buddha Anussati, ''Bhagavan'' is defined the following way:

:''{{IAST|Iti pi so '''Bhagavā''' Arahaṃ Sammā-sambuddho Vijjā-caraṇa sampanno Sugato Lokavidū Anuttaro purisa-damma-sārathi Satthā deva-manusānaṃ Buddho '''Bhagavā'''ti}}''

:Thus is Buddha, deserving homage, perfectly awakened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, well gone to [[Nirvana|Nibbana]], knower of the worlds, incomparable leader (lit. charioteer) of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, awakened one and Blessed One.

;Bhagavān in Buddhist texts

Several Tibetan Buddhist tantra texts use the word Bhagavān. For example, the Pradipoddyotana manuscript of [[Guhyasamāja tantra]]-Samdhivyakarana uses the word ''Bhagavān'', which Alex Wayman translates as "Lord".&lt;ref name=alexwayman&gt;Alex Wayman (1974), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397800 Two Traditions of India: Truth and Silence] Philosophy East and West, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Oct., 1974), pages 389-403, for the original verse see footnote 13 on page 402, for Wayman's translation see page 391&lt;/ref&gt; The text, elsewhere refers to ''Bhagavan Sarvatathagatakayavakcittadipatih'', which John Campbell translates as "Lord, Master of the Vajras of Body, Speech, and Mind of all Buddhas."&lt;ref&gt;John Campbell (2009), [http://gradworks.umi.com/33/74/3374090.html Vajra hermeneutics: A study of Vajrayana scholasticism in the "Pradipoddyotana"], PhD Thesis accepted by Columbia University (Advisor: Robert Thurman), page 210&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, it states,&lt;ref name=johncampbell&gt;John Campbell (2009), [http://gradworks.umi.com/33/74/3374090.html Vajra hermeneutics: A study of Vajrayana scholasticism in the "Pradipoddyotana"], PhD Thesis accepted by Columbia University (Advisor: Robert Thurman), page 355&lt;br&gt;Christian K.

[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]], a sutra of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, for example, uses the word ''Bhagavān'' over three hundred times, which is either left untranslated by scholars, or translated as "Lord or Blessed One".&lt;ref&gt;'''English Translation''': Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, [http://huntingtonarchive.osu.edu/resources/downloads/sutras/08technicalMayayana/Lankavatara%20Sutra.doc.pdf Mahayana Lankavatara Sutra] Ohio State University;&lt;br&gt;'''Sanskrit''': [http://lirs.ru/do/lanka_skt/Lankavatara-Sanskrit-Vaidya_edition.pdf Lankavatara Sutra] Archived original at a Buddhist Library in Russia&lt;/ref&gt; The devotional meditational text ''Sukhavati Vyuhopadesa'' by [[Vasubandhu]] uses the term ''Bhagavān'' in its invocations.&lt;ref&gt;Minoru Kiyota (2009), Mahāyāna Buddhist Meditation: Theory and Practice, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807600}}, pages 274-275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance===
The term ''Bhagavān'' is found in liturgical practices of [[Theravada]] Buddhism, where it is used as an epithet that means the "Blessed One". Examples of such usage is found in Sri Lanka's ''Bodhi Puja'' (or ''Atavisi Buddha Puja'', Worship of the Twenty Eight Buddhas).&lt;ref&gt;Frank Reynolds and Jason A.

In philosophy, the '''Cartesian Self''', part of a [[thought experiment]], is an individual's mind, separate from the body and the outside world, thinking about itself and its existence. It is distinguished from the [[Cartesian Other]], anything other than the Cartesian self. According to the philosopher [[Descartes]], there is a divide intrinsic to [[consciousness]], such that one cannot ever bridge the space between one's own consciousness and that of another.

Descartes concluded famously that [[Cogito ergo sum]], "I think, therefore I am", but realized that according to his [[wax argument]] you could never similarly demonstrate the existence of the 'other'.  However, the Cartesian Self, he concluded, is thus almost entirely [[Self-evidence|self-evident]]: the existence of some being ''asking'' about itself necessarily implied that such a being existed.  Because of this, while humans can know everything of the self and its mysteries, we cannot actually know anything of anything that is not the self.

It is based on the whole of the Cartesian Pure Inquirer, where cognitive capabilities and methods of achieving knowledge are alike to all knowers. However, the "knower" (particularly to Descartes) is treated as a featureless abstract, and not an actual person.

{{hatnote|This article concerns Chinese units of measurement as generally used in [[mainland China]]. For local modifications of it, see [[Taiwanese units|Taiwanese]], [[Hong Kong units|Hong Kong]], and [[Singaporean units of measurement]].}}

'''Chinese units of measurement''', known in Chinese as the '''''shìzhì''''' ("market system"), are the traditional [[units of measurement]] of the [[Han Chinese]]. Although [[Chinese numerals]] have been [[decimal]] (base-10) since the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]], several Chinese measures use [[hexadecimal]] (base-16). Local applications have varied, but the [[Chinese dynasties]] usually proclaimed standard measurements and recorded their predecessor's systems in [[Chinese dynastic histories|their histories]]. 

In the present day, the [[People's Republic of China]] maintains some customary units based upon the market units but standardized to round values in the [[metric system]], for example the common ''jin'' or [[catty (unit)|catty]] of exactly 500{{nbsp}}[[gram (unit)|g]]. The Chinese name for most metric units is based on that of the closest traditional unit; when confusion might arise, the word "market" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|市}}}}, ''shì'') is used to specify the traditional unit and "common" or "public" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|公}}}}, ''gōng'') is used for the metric value. [[Taiwan]], like [[Korean units|Korea]], saw [[Taiwanese units of measurement|its traditional units]] standardized to [[Japanese units of measurement|Japanese values]] and their conversion to a metric basis, such as the Taiwanese ''[[ping (unit)|ping]]'' of about 3.306{{nbsp}}m² based on the square ''[[Ken (unit)|ken]]''. The [[Hong Kong SAR]] continues to use [[Hong Kong units of measurement|its traditional units]], now legally defined based on a local equation with metric units. For instance, the Hong Kong catty is precisely 604.78982{{nbsp}}g.

Note: The names ''lí'' ({{lang|zh|厘}}) and ''fēn'' ({{lang|zh|分}}) for small units are the same for length, area, and mass; however, they refer to different kinds of measurements.

[[File:Bronze ruler. Han Dynasty 206 BCE to CE 220. Excavated in Zichang County. Shaanxi History Museum, Xi'an.jpg|thumb|Bronze ruler from the Han Dynasty (206 BCE to CE 220); excavated in [[Zichang County]]; [[Shaanxi History Museum]], [[Xi'an]]]]
{{History of science and technology in China}}
According to the ''[[Liji]]'', the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]] created the first measurement units. The ''[[Xiao Erya]]'' and the ''[[Kongzi Jiayu]]'' state that length units were derived from the human body. According to the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', these human body units caused inconsistency, and [[Yu the Great]], another legendary figure, unified the length measurements. [[Ruler]]s with decimal units have been unearthed from [[Shang Dynasty]] tombs.

In the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the king conferred nobles with powers of the state and the measurement units began to be inconsistent from state to state. After the [[Warring States period]], [[Qin Shi Huang]] unified China, and later standardized measurement units. In the [[Han Dynasty]], these measurements were still being used, and were documented systematically in the [[Book of Han]].

Astronomical instruments show little change of the length of chi in the following centuries, since the calendar needed to be consistent. It was not until the introduction of decimal units in the [[Ming Dynasty]] that the traditional system was revised.

===Republican Era===
{{see also|Taiwanese units of measurement}}
On 7 January 1915, the [[Beiyang Government]] promulgated a measurement law to use not only metric system as the standard but also a set of Chinese-style measurement.&lt;ref name="ROC1915"&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://gaz.ncl.edu.tw/eng/detail.jsp?sysid=D1500002 |contribution=權度法 [''Quándù Fǎ''] |title=''政府公報 [''Zhèngfǔ Gōngbào'', ''Government Gazette'']'' |location=Beijing |volume=No. 957 |publisher=Office of the President |date=7 January 1915 |pp=85–94 }}. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 February 1929, the [[Nationalist Government]] adopted and promulgated ''The Weights and Measures Act''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawHistory.aspx?PCode=J0100052 |title=The Weights and Measures Act: Legislative History |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (Republic of China)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to adopt the [[metric system]] as the official standard and to limit the newer Chinese units of measurement ({{zh|c=市用制|p=shìyòngzhì|l=market-use system}}) to private sales and trade in Article 11, effective on 1 January 1930.&lt;ref name="ROC1930"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01926/0192618020200.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425025351/http://lis.ly.gov.tw/lghtml/lawstat/version2/01926/0192618020200.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-25 |title=The Weights and Measures Act (1929) |publisher=[[Legislative Yuan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===People's Republic of China===
The [[Government of the People's Republic of China]] continued using the market system along with metric system, as decreed by the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] on 25 June 1959, but 1 [[catty]] being 500 grams, would become divided into 10 (new) [[tael]]s, instead of 16 (old) taels, to be converted from [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|province to province]], while exempting [[Chinese herbology|Chinese prescription drugs]] from the conversion to prevent errors.&lt;ref name="PRC1959"&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2011-11/09/content_1988933.htm 1959 Gazette of the State Council of the People's Republic of China], [http://www.gov.cn/gongbao/shuju/1959/gwyb195916.pdf No. 180], pages 311 to 312&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 1984, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decreed the market system to remain acceptable till the end of 1990 and ordered the transition to the national legal measures by that time, but [[Agricultural land|farmland]] measures would be exempt from this mandatory [[metrication]] until further investigation and study.&lt;ref name="PRC1984"&gt;[http://www.yfzs.gov.cn/gb/info/LawData/gjf2001q/gwyfg/2003-07/10/1425371513.html Decree of the State Council Concerning the Use of Uniform Legal Measures in the Country] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409152907/http://www.yfzs.gov.cn/gb/info/LawData/gjf2001q/gwyfg/2003-07/10/1425371513.html |date=2015-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metric length units====
The Chinese word for [[metre]] is {{lang|zh|米}} ''mǐ''; this can take the [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "kilo-", "centi-", etc.). A [[kilometre]], however, may also be called {{lang|zh|公里}} ''gōnglǐ'', i.e. a metric ''[[li (Chinese unit)|lǐ]]''.

In the engineering field, traditional units are rounded up to metric units.For example, the Chinese word {{lang|zh|丝}} sī is used to express 0.01&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Metric volume units====
In the case of volume, the market and metric ''shēng'' coincide, being equal to one litre as shown in the table. The [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "milli-", "centi-", etc.) may be added to this word ''shēng''.

Units of volume can also be obtained from any standard unit of length using the prefix {{lang|zh|立方}} ''lìfāng'' ("cubic"), as in {{lang|zh|立方米}} ''lìfāng mǐ'' for a cubic metre.

====Metric mass units====
The Chinese word for [[gram]] is {{lang|zh|克}} ''kè''; this can take the [[Chinese numerals#SI prefixes|Chinese standard SI prefixes]] (for "milli-", "deca-", etc.). A kilogram, however, is commonly called {{lang|zh|公斤}} ''gōngjīn'', i.e. a metric ''[[catty|jīn]]''.

==Historiography==
As there were hundreds of unofficial measures in use, the bibliography is quite vast. The editions of Wu Chenglou's 1937 ''History of Chinese Measurement''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wu |first=Chenglou |authormask=吳承洛 |title=''《中國度量衡史》 [''Zhōngguó Dùliànghéng Shǐ'']'' |date=1937 }}, 2nd ed. in 1957, 3rd ed. in 1993. {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the usual standard up to the 1980s or so, but rely mostly on surviving literary accounts. Newer research has put more emphasis on archeological discoveries.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2000"/&gt; [[Qiu Guangming]] &amp; Zhang Yanming's 2005 bilingual ''Concise History of Ancient Chinese Measures and Weights'' summarizes these findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Qiu |first=Guangming |authorlink=Qiu Guangming |authormask=丘光明 |editor-first=Yanming |editor-last=Zhang |editor-mask=张延明 |title=''《中国古代计量史图鉴》 [''Zhōngguó Gǔdài Jìliàng Shǐ Tújiàn'']'' |location=Hefei |publisher=Hefei University Press |date=2005 |isbn=7-81093-284-5 }}. {{zh icon}}{{nbsp}}&amp; {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively recent and comprehensive bibliography, organized by period studied, has been compiled in 2012 by Cao &amp; al.;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cao |first=Jin |authormask=Cao Jin |author2=Ulrich Theobald |author3=Hans Ulrich Vogel |author4=others |display-authors=1 |url=https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/47035 |title=Chinese, Japanese and Western Research in Chinese Historical Metrology: A Classified Bibliography (1925-2012) |publisher=Institute for Chinese and Korean Studies at the University of Tübingen |location=Tübingen |date=2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a shorter list, see [[Endymion Wilkinson|Wilkinson]]'s year 2000 ''Chinese History''.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson2000"&gt;{{citation |first=Endymion |last=Wilkinson |authorlink=Endymion Wilkinson |title=Chinese History: A Manual |year=2000 |publisher=Harvard University Asia Center |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] |isbn=978-0-674-00249-4 |pages=244–245 |edition=2nd }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12755">The '''chronology protection conjecture''' is a conjecture first proposed by [[Stephen Hawking]] which hypothesizes that the [[laws of physics]] are such as to prevent [[time travel]] on all but submicroscopic scales.  The permissibility of time travel is represented mathematically by the existence of [[closed timelike curve]]s in some [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions to General Relativity]]. The chronology protection conjecture should be distinguished from [[cosmic censorship hypothesis|chronological censorship]] under which every closed timelike curve passes through an [[event horizon]], which might prevent an observer from detecting the '''causal violation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Are Causality Violations Undesirable? |date=2008-10-29 |doi=10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9 | volume=38 |issue=11 |journal=Foundations of Physics |pages=1065–1069|arxiv = gr-qc/0609054 |bibcode = 2008FoPh...38.1065M |last1=Monroe |first1=Hunter }}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''chronology violation''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Visser, Matt| title= Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | arxiv=gr-qc/9702043 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212 | volume=55 | issue= 8 | journal=Physical Review D | pages=5212–5214| bibcode=1997PhRvD..55.5212V| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
In a 1992 paper, Hawking uses the metaphorical device of a "''Chronology Protection Agency''" as a [[personification]] of the aspects of physics that make time travel impossible at macroscopic scales, thus apparently preventing [[time paradox]]es. He says:

{{quote|It seems that there is a Chronology Protection Agency which prevents the appearance of closed timelike curves and so makes the universe safe for historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawking | first1 = S. W. | year = 1992 | title = Chronology protection conjecture | url = | journal = Phys. Rev. D | volume = 46 | issue = 2| page = 603 | doi=10.1103/physrevd.46.603| bibcode = 1992PhRvD..46..603H}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The idea of the Chronology Protection Agency appears to be drawn playfully from the Time Patrol or Time Police concept, which has been used in many works of [[science fiction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/time_police |title=Time Police : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia |publisher=Sf-encyclopedia.com |date=December 21, 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s series of [[Time Patrol]] stories or [[Isaac Asimov]]'s novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]'', or in the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  [[Phil D'Amato#"The Chronology Protection Case"|"The Chronology Protection Case"]] by [[Paul Levinson]], posits a universe that goes so far as to murder any scientists who are close to inventing any means of time travel.

==General relativity and quantum corrections==
Many attempts to generate scenarios for closed timelike curves have been suggested, and the theory of [[general relativity]] does allow them in certain circumstances. Some theoretical solutions in general relativity that contain closed timelike curves would require an infinite universe with certain features that our universe does not appear to have, such as the universal rotation of the [[Gödel metric]] or the rotating cylinder of infinite length known as a [[Tipler cylinder]]. However, some solutions allow for the creation of closed timelike curves in a bounded region of spacetime, with the [[Cauchy horizon]] being the boundary between the region of [[spacetime]] where closed timelike curves can exist and the rest of spacetime where they cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gott | first=J. Richard | authorlink=J. Richard Gott | title=Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time | publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] | year= 2001 | page=117 | isbn=978-0-395-95563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first such bounded time travel solutions found was constructed from a [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]], based on the idea of taking one of the two "mouths" of the wormhole on a round-trip journey at relativistic speed to create a time difference between it and the other mouth (see the discussion at [[Wormhole#Time travel]]).

General relativity does not include [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] effects on its own, and a full integration of general relativity and quantum mechanics would require a theory of [[quantum gravity]], but there is an approximate method for modeling quantum fields in the curved spacetime of general relativity, known as [[semiclassical gravity]]. Initial attempts to apply semiclassical gravity to the traversable wormhole time machine indicated that at exactly the moment that wormhole would first allow for closed timelike curves, quantum [[Virtual particle#Virtual particles in vacuums|vacuum fluctuations]] build up and drive the [[energy density]] to infinity in the region of the wormholes. This occurs when the two wormhole mouths, call them A and B, have been moved in such a way that it becomes possible for a particle or wave moving at the speed of light to enter mouth B at some time T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and exit through mouth A at an earlier time T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then travel back towards mouth B through ordinary space, and arrive at mouth B at the same time T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that it entered B on the previous loop; in this way the same particle or wave can make a potentially infinite number of loops through the same regions of spacetime, piling up on itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thorne | first=Kip S. | authorlink=Kip Thorne | title=Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher=[[W. W.

Uncertainty about this conclusion remained, because the semiclassical calculations indicated that the pileup would only drive the energy density to infinity for an infinitesimal moment of time, after which the energy density would die down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Everett | first=Allen |author2=Roman, Thomas | title=Time Travel and Warp Drives | publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] | year= 2012 | page=190 | isbn=978-0-226-22498-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But semiclassical gravity is considered unreliable for large energy densities or short time periods that reach the [[Planck scale]]; at these scales, a complete theory of quantum gravity is needed for accurate predictions. So, it remains uncertain whether quantum-gravitational effects might prevent the energy density from growing large enough to destroy the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;Everett and Roman 2012, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Hawking conjectured that not only would the pileup of vacuum fluctuations still succeed in destroying the wormhole in quantum gravity, but also that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] would ultimately prevent ''any'' type of time machine from forming; this is the chronology protection conjecture.&lt;ref name="EvRom191"&gt;Everett and Roman 2012, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent works in semiclassical gravity provided examples of spacetimes with closed timelike curves where the energy density due to vacuum fluctuations does not approach infinity in the region of spacetime outside the Cauchy horizon.&lt;ref name="EvRom191" /&gt; However, in 1997 a general proof was found demonstrating that according to semiclassical gravity, the energy of the quantum field (more precisely, the expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor) must ''always'' be either infinite or undefined on the horizon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Bernard | last=Kay | last2=Radzikowski | first2=Marek | last3=Wald | first3=Robert | author3-link=Robert Wald | title=Quantum Field Theory on Spacetimes with a Compactly Generated Cauchy Horizon | journal=Communications in Mathematical Physics | volume=183 | year=1997 | issue=3 | pages=533–556 | doi=10.1007/s002200050042 | arxiv=gr-qc/9603012v2 |bibcode=1997CMaPh.183..533K | citeseerx=10.1.1.339.6036 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cases indicate that semiclassical methods become unreliable at the horizon and quantum gravity effects would be important there, consistent with the possibility that such effects would always intervene to prevent time machines from forming.&lt;ref name="EvRom191" /&gt;

A definite theoretical decision on the status of the chronology protection conjecture would require a full theory of [[quantum gravity]]&lt;ref&gt;Thorne 1994, p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to semiclassical methods (there are also some arguments from [[string theory]] that seem to support chronology protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Semeniuk | first=Ivan | title=No going back | newspaper=[[New Scientist]] | date=20 September 2003 | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17924134.800-no-going-back.html | accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=C.A.R. | last=Herdeiro | title=Special properties of five-dimensional BPS rotating black holes | journal=Nuclear Physics B | volume=582 | year=2000 | issue=1–3 | pages=363–392 | doi=10.1016/S0550-3213(00)00335-7 | arxiv=hep-th/0003063 |bibcode=2000NuPhB.582..363H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Marco | last=Caldarelli | last2=Klemm | first2=Dietmar | last3=Silva | first3=Pedro | title=Chronology protection in anti-de Sitter | journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity | volume=22 | year=2005 | issue=17 | pages=3461–3466 | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/22/17/007 | arxiv=hep-th/0411203 |bibcode=2005CQGra..22.3461C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Marco | last=Caldarelli | last2=Klemm | first2=Dietmar | last3=Sabra | first3=Wafic | title=Causality violation and naked time machines in AdS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; | journal=Journal of High Energy Physics | year=2001 | issue=5 | doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2001/05/014 | arxiv=hep-th/0103133 |bibcode=2001JHEP...05..014C | volume=2001 | pages=014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raeymaekers |first=Joris |last2=Van den Bleeken |first2=Dieter |last3=Vercnocke |first3=Bert |arxiv=0911.3893 |title=Relating chronology protection and unitarity through holography |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/JHEP04(2010)021 |volume=2010 |issue=4 |pages=21 |journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|bibcode=2010JHEP...04..021R }}&lt;/ref&gt; but string theory is not yet a complete theory of quantum gravity). Experimental observation of closed timelike curves would of course demonstrate this conjecture to be [[falsifiability|false]], but short of that, if physicists had a theory of quantum gravity whose predictions had been well-confirmed in other areas, this would give them a significant degree of confidence in the theory's predictions about the possibility or impossibility of time travel.

Other proposals that allow for backwards time travel but prevent [[Physical paradox#Causality paradoxes|time paradoxes]], such as the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]], which would ensure the timeline stays consistent, or the idea that a time traveler is taken to a [[Many-worlds interpretation|parallel universe]] while his original timeline remains intact, do not qualify as "chronology protection".

'''Civil mobilization''' is the legal compulsion for civilians to work, in distinction to military [[mobilization]].  It has been used on a number of occasions by a number of governments.   This generally makes [[General strike|striking]] illegal for the duration of the mobilization.

==Belgium 1964==
To prevent a doctors strike the Belgium government, in April 1964, issued a civil mobilization order for hospital doctors and [[military doctors]].

==Greece 2010-2015==
In Greece civil mobilization orders were made for dock workers, teachers&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2013/05/11/greek-govt-to-issue-86000-civil-mobilization-orders-for-teachers-before-the-strike/&lt;/ref&gt; and power workers .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stopcartel.org/civil-mobilization/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clean coal technology''' is a collection of technologies being developed to attempt to help lessen the [[environmental impact of coal|environmental impact of coal energy generation]] and to mitigate worldwide [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c01.html |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists |title= Coal vs. Wind |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When coal is used as a fuel source, the gaseous emissions generated by the thermal decomposition of the coal include [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), mercury, and other chemical byproducts that vary depending on the type of the coal being used. These emissions have been established to have a negative impact on the environment and human health, contributing to acid rain, lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. As a result, clean coal technologies are being developed to remove or reduce pollutant emissions to the atmosphere. Some of the techniques that would be used to accomplish this include chemically washing [[mineral]]s and impurities from the coal, [[gasification]] (see also [[Integrated gasification combined cycle|IGCC]]), improved technology for treating [[flue]] gases to remove pollutants to increasingly stringent levels and at higher efficiency, [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to capture the carbon dioxide from the [[flue gas]] and dewatering lower rank coals ([[brown coal]]s) to improve the [[calorific value]], and thus the efficiency of the conversion into [[electricity]].  Concerns exist regarding the economic viability of these technologies and the timeframe of delivery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/30/fossilfuels-carbonemissions |publisher=The Guardian |title=Time to bury the ‘clean coal’ myth |accessdate=2008-12-23 | location=London | date=2008-10-30 | first=Fred | last=Pearce}}&lt;/ref&gt; potentially high hidden economic costs in terms of social and [[environmental degradation|environmental damage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/raw/content/international/press/reports/cost-of-coal.pdf |publisher=Greenpeace |title=The True Cost of Coal |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the costs and viability of disposing of removed carbon and other toxic matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs/ |publisher=University of Edinburgh, School of Geosciences |title=Carbon Capture and Storage |accessdate=2008-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219221240/http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/ccs |archivedate=2007-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/07/02/carbon-capture-storage.html |publisher=Discovery Channel |title=Carbon Capture Plans get Reality Check |accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original usage, the term "Clean Coal" was used to refer to technologies that were designed to reduce emission of pollutants associated with burning coal, such as washing coal at the mine.  This step removes some of the sulfur and other contaminants, including rocks and soil.  This makes coal cleaner and cheaper to transport.  More recently, the definition of clean coal has been expanded to include carbon capture and storage.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silent Epidemic: Coal and the Hidden Threat to Health|last=Lockwood|first=Alan|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=9780262017893|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clean coal technology usually addresses atmospheric problems resulting from burning coal.  Historically, the primary focus was on SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, the most important gases in causation of [[acid rain]], and particulates which cause visible air pollution and have [[Coal#Health effects|deleterious effects on human health]]. 

==Technology==
Several different technological methods are available for the purpose of carbon capture as demanded by  the clean coal concept:
*Pre-combustion capture – This involves [[gasification]] of a feedstock (such as coal) to form [[synthesis gas]], which may be [[water-gas shift reaction|shifted]] to produce a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-[[rich burn|rich gas mixture]], from which the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be efficiently captured and separated, transported, and ultimately sequestered,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-combustion Carbon Capture Research|url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/carbon-capture-and-storage-research/carbon-capture-rd/pre-combustion-carbon|website=Energy.gov|publisher=Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is usually associated with [[Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle]] process configurations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/18398/|title= Picking a Winner in Clean-Coal Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Post-combustion capture – This refers to capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from exhaust gases of combustion processes.
*[[Oxy-fuel combustion]] – Fossil fuels such as coal are burned in a mixture of recirculated [[flue gas]] and oxygen, rather than in air, which largely eliminates nitrogen from the flue gas enabling efficient, low-cost CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R&amp;D Facts - Oxy-Fuel Combustion|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/publications/factsheets/rd/R&amp;D127.pdf|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Kemper Project|Kemper County IGCC Project]], a proposed 582 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] [[coal gasification]]-based power plant, was expected to use pre-combustion capture of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to capture 65% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the plant produces, which would have been utilized and geologically sequestered in [[enhanced oil recovery]] operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IGCC Project Examples - Kemper County IGCC Project|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/research/Coal/energy-systems/gasification/gasifipedia/project-examples#kemper|website=Gasifipedia|publisher=National Energy Technology Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after many delays and a cost runup to $7.5 billion (triple the initial budget), the coal gasification project was abandoned and as of late 2017, Kemper is under construction as a cheaper [[natural gas]] power plant.&lt;ref name='ars_nat_gas_2017'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geuss|first1=Megan|title=$7.5 billion Kemper power plant suspends coal gasification|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2017/06/7-5-billion-kemper-power-plant-suspends-coal-gasification/ |publisher=Ars Technica|date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saskatchewan Government's [[Boundary Dam Power Station|Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project]] will use post-combustion, amine-based scrubber technology to capture 90% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emitted by Unit 3 of the power plant; this CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be pipelined to and utilized for enhanced oil recovery in the Weyburn oil fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boundary Dam Integrated Carbon Capture and Sequestration Demonstration Project|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/project/boundary-dam-integrated-carbon-capture-and-sequestration-demonstration-project|publisher=Global CCS Institute|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oxyfuel CCS fossil fuel power plant operation.png|thumb|right|An oxyfuel CCS power plant operation processes the exhaust gases so as to separate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so that it may be stored or sequestered]]
An early example of a coal-based plant using (oxy-fuel) carbon-capture technology is Swedish company [[Vattenfall]]’s [[Schwarze Pumpe power station]] located in [[Spremberg]], [[Germany]], built by German firm [[Siemens]], which went on-line in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |publisher=Vattenfall |title=Vattenfall's Project on CSS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026074817/http://www2.vattenfall.com/www/co2_en/co2_en/index.jsp |archivedate=2010-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"/&gt; The facility captures CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acid rain producing pollutants, separates them, and compresses the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into a liquid. Plans are to inject the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into depleted natural gas fields or other geological formations. Vattenfall opines that this technology is considered not to be a final solution for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction in the atmosphere, but provides an achievable solution in the near term while more desirable alternative solutions to power generation can be made economically practical.&lt;ref name="discovermagazine"&gt;http://discovermagazine.com/2009/feb/25-can-clean-coal-actually-work/?searchterm=clean%20coal "Can Clean Coal Actually Work?" article in Feb. 2009 issue, p. 18, Retrieved 2009-05-11&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples of oxy-combustion carbon capture are in progress. [[Callide Power Station]] has retrofitted a 30-MWth existing PC-fired power plant to operate in oxy-fuel mode; in Ciuden, Spain, Endesa has a newly built 30-MWth oxy-fuel plant using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Oxy-fuel Combustion Technology for CO2 Capture|url=http://cornerstonemag.net/overview-of-oxy-fuel-combustion-technology-for-co2-capture/|website=Cornerstone Magazine|publisher=World Coal Association|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babcock-ThermoEnergy's Zero Emission Boiler System (ZEBS) is oxy-combustion-based; this system features near 100% carbon-capture and according to company information virtually no air-emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[leads nowhere previously cited - http://ww25.thermoenergy.com/Zm9yY2VTUg]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other carbon capture and storage technologies include those that [[Dewatering|dewater]] low-rank coals. [[Coal rank|Low-rank coals]] often contain a higher level of moisture content which contains a lower energy content per tonne. This causes a reduced burning efficiency and an increased emissions output. Reduction of moisture from the coal prior to combustion can reduce emissions by up to 50 percent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The UK government is working towards a clean energy future and supported clean coal projects across the country. In August 2010, UK-based company [[B9 Coal]] announced a clean coal project with 90% carbon capture to be put forward to DECC. This proposed project was to create pure streams of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen was then to be used as an emissions-free fuel to run an [[AFC Energy|alkaline fuel cell]] whilst the carbon dioxide was to be captured.

==Demonstration projects in the United States==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) began conducting a joint program with the industry and State agencies to demonstrate clean coal technologies large enough for commercial use. The program, called the Clean Coal Technology &amp; Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), has had a number of successes that have reduced emissions and waste from coal-based electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://energy.gov/fe/science-innovation/clean-coal-research/major-demonstrations/clean-coal-power-initiative | publisher= U.S. Department of Energy | title= Clean Coal Technology &amp; The Clean Coal Power Initiative }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Energy Technology Laboratory]] has administered three rounds of CCPI funding and the following projects were selected during each round:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/cctc/ccpi/index.html# |title= Major Demonstrations: Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) |publisher= NETL |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These programs have helped to meet regulatory challenges by incorporating pollution control technologies into a portfolio of cost-effective regulatory compliance options for conventional and developmental coal-fired power plants. This portfolio has positioned the U.S. as a top exporter of clean coal technologies such as those used for SOx, NOx and mercury, and more recently for carbon capture, consistent with a goal of deploying advanced coal-based power systems in commercial service with improved efficiency and environmental performance to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations and market demands, leading to widespread, global deployment which will contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The DOE continues its programs and initiatives through regional sequestration partnerships, a carbon sequestration leadership forum and the Carbon Sequestration Core Program, a CCS research and development program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/sequestration/index.html | publisher=U.S. Department of Energy | title= Carbon Sequestration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the U.S. Department of Energy, clean coal technology has paid measurable dividends. Technological innovation introduced through the CCT Program now provides consumers cost-effective, clean, coal-based energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/publications/Clean_Coal_Topical_Reports/Investment_pays_off.pdf | publisher= U.S. Department of Energy | title= Clean Coal Technology: The Investment Pays Off}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean coal and the environment==
{{Further|Environmental effects of coal}}

According to [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]], the burning of coal, a [[fossil fuel]], is a major contributor to  [[global warming]]. (See the UN [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]).  As 26% of the world's electrical generation in 2004 was from coal-fired generation (see [[World energy resources and consumption]]), reaching the carbon dioxide reduction targets of the [[Kyoto Protocol]] will require modifications to how coal is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |title= CRS Issue Brief for Congress - IB89005: Global Climate Change |publisher= National Council for Science and the Environment |date= August 13, 2001 |accessdate= 2008-09-13 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226020613/http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/Climate/clim-2.cfm?&amp;CFID=1255395&amp;CFTOKEN=96369856 |archivedate= December 26, 2008 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coal industry has responded by running advertising touting clean coal in an effort to counter negative perceptions and claiming  more than $50 billion towards the development and deployment of "traditional" clean coal technologies over the past 30 years; and promising $500 million towards carbon capture and storage research and development.&lt;ref name="ACCCE"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americaspower.org/News/Press-Room/Press-Releases/ACCCE-Details-More-than-80-CO2-Capture-and-Storage-Projects | publisher= America's Power | title=ACCCE Details More than 80 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture and Storage Projects | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still concern about clean coal technology being perceived as more environmentally friendly than it is, and the term "Clean Coal" has been used as an example of "[[greenwashing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Louise|date=2008-12-01|title=Greenwashing Coal|url=|journal=Chain Reaction|volume=104|pages=25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Sierra Club, "Despite the industry's hype, there's no such thing as 'clean coal.'

Conjunction with enhanced oil recovery and other applications; commercial-scale CCS is currently being tested in the U.S. and other countries.{{by whom|date=November 2010}} Proposed CCS sites are subjected to extensive investigation and monitoring to avoid potential hazards, which could include leakage of sequestered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere, induced geological instability, or contamination of water sources such as oceans and aquifers used for drinking water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302185350/http://www.awwa.org/publications/MainStreamArticle.cfm?itemnumber=39815 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 2, 2009 |title=AWWA warns Congress about CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; injection concerns |publisher=American Water Works Association |date=July 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ohvec.org/links/news/archive/2005/fair_use/10_16.html |title=‘Clean coal’ push concerns environmental activists |publisher=Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition |date=October 16, 2005 |accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/green-science/clean-coal.htm|title=What is clean coal technology?|date=2007-07-18|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Plains Synfuels plant supports the technical feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration. Carbon dioxide from the coal gasification is shipped to Canada where it is injected into the ground to aid in oil recovery. A drawback of the carbon sequestration process is that it is expensive compared to traditional processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=1300126 |publisher=SSRN | title=Carbonomics: How to Fix the Climate and Charge it to OPEC |accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clean coal and health ==
Both traditional coal technology and clean coal technologies result in a release of hazardous air pollutants and many of them have an adverse affect on human health.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to Alan H. Lockwood, MD, coal is linked to diseases of the Respiratory System, Cardiovascular System, and Nervous System.  A key point that Dr. Lockwood brings up is that “the most obvious threats to health posed by the carbon capture and storage strategies… would occur in the event of the release of large amounts of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The potential releases could occur at any of the stages: at the site of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture, during transport, or transfer… or escape during or after storage.” Dr. Lockwood goes on to explain that this can lead to “symptoms of death by displacing oxygen from inhaled air, leading to hypoxia and asphyxiation, or by causing symptomatic or fatal acidification of the blood and body fluids after inhalation” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Cosmic Bliss''' is a term that originated in [[Buddhism]], but is commonly referred to in various human endeavors, with the meaning of [[wikt:bliss|'bliss']]: ultimate [[contentment]].  For example, cosmic bliss in music could refer to an awe inspiring piece of music, or a very enjoyable music listening session.  In [[Buddhism]], cosmic bliss is a state of being: the state of cosmic bliss.    [[Ānanda]], means [[wikt:bliss|'bliss']] in [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]] as well as other Indian languages.

'''Deferred obedience''' is a psychological phenomenon first articulated by [[Sigmund Freud]], whereby a onetime rebel becomes subservient to the very rules and standards against which they had previously been rebelling.

==To father figures==
Deferred obedience was linked by Freud to the effects of [[psychological repression|repression]],&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition X'' (London 1955), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; with especial reference to the [[father complex]].  In the case of the [[Rat Man]], Freud described the different phases of his complex attitude towards his father: 'As long as his father was alive it showed itself in unmitigated rebelliousness and open discord, but immediately after his death it took the form of a [[neurosis]] based on abject submission and deferred obedience to him'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Totem and Taboo'' Freud generalised the principle to the [[cultural sphere]], arguing that the basis of the social bond underpinning civilisation was equally rooted in deferred obedience to the authority of the father.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Bruner, ''Freud and the Politics of Psychoanalysis'' (2001), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;  It was no contradiction, but rather a confirmation, of the theory to see outbreaks of [[Carnival]]-like licence as occasions when the controls of deferred obedience were temporarily lifted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Kristeva]]/Jeanine Herman, ''The Sense and Non-Sense of Revolt'' (Columbia 2001), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==To the mother/parents==
In a later development of the idea, [[Jacqueline Rose]] would speak of "deferred obedience to the mother, as the return of the (cultural) repressed".&lt;ref&gt;J. Rose, ''The Haunting of Sylvia Plath'' (1991) p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;  The death of the parents would seem to reinforce, rather than weaken, the force of their commands,&lt;ref&gt;E. Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; and so often to precipitate deferred obedience.&lt;ref&gt;S. Akhtar, ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (2009) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''digital timing diagram''' is a representation of a set of signals in the time domain. A timing diagram can contain many rows, usually one of them being the clock. It is a tool that is commonly used in digital electronics, hardware debugging, and digital communications. Besides providing an overall description of the timing relationships, the digital timing diagram can help find and diagnose digital logic [[hazard (logic)|hazards]].

==Diagram convention==
Most timing diagrams use the following conventions:
* Higher value is a logic one
* Lower value is a logic zero
* A slot showing a high and low is an either or (such as on a data line)
* A Z indicates [[high impedance]]
* A greyed out slot is a [[don't-care (logic)|don't-care]] or indeterminate.

==Example: SPI bus timing==
[[File:SPI timing diagram2.svg|thumb|400px|A timing diagram for the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]]]]

The timing diagram example on the right describes the [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Bus]].
Most SPI master nodes have the ability to set the clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA) with respect to the data.
This timing diagram shows the clock for both values of CPOL and the values for the two data lines (MISO &amp; MOSI) for each value of CPHA.
Note that when CPHA=1 then the data is delayed by one-half clock cycle.

SPI operates in the following way:
* The master determines an appropriate CPOL &amp; CPHA value
* The master pulls down the [[slave select]] (SS) line for a specific slave chip
* The master clocks SCK at a specific frequency
* During each of the 8 clock cycles the transfer is [[full duplex]]:
** The master writes on the MOSI line and reads the MISO line
** The slave writes on the MISO line and reads the MOSI line
* When finished the master can continue with another [[byte]] transfer or pull SS high to end the transfer

When a slave's SS line is high then both of its MISO and MOSI line should be high impedance so to avoid disrupting a transfer to a different slave.
Prior to SS being pulled low, the MISO &amp; MOSI lines are indicated with a "z" for high impedance.
Also, prior to the SS being pulled low the "cycle #" row is meaningless and is shown greyed-out.

Note that for CPHA=1 the MISO &amp; MOSI lines are undefined until after the first clock edge and are also shown greyed-out before that.

A more typical timing diagram has just a single clock and numerous data lines

In computer software and media, an '''Easter egg''' is an intentional [[in-joke|inside joke]], [[hidden message]] or image, or secret feature of a work. It is usually found in a [[computer program]], [[video game]], or [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray|Blu-ray Disc]] menu screen. The name is used to evoke the idea of a traditional [[egg hunt|Easter egg hunt]].&lt;ref name="Wolf"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Mark J.P.|title=Encyclopedia of Video Games: The Culture, Technology, and Art of Gaming|date=2012|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9780313379369|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined to describe a hidden message in the [[Atari]] video game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' that encouraged the player to find further hidden messages in later games, leading them on a 'hunt'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yarwood|first=Jack|title=Easter Eggs: The Hidden Secrets of Videogames|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html|access-date=November 23, 2017|work=Paste|date=March 27, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
{{see also|Adventure (Atari 2600)#Easter egg}}
The use of the term "Easter egg" to describe secret features originates from the 1979 video game ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]] game console, programmed by employee [[Warren Robinett]]. At the time, [[Atari Corporation|Atari]] did not include programmers' names in the game credits, fearing that competitors would attempt to steal their employees. Robinett, who disagreed with his supervisor over this lack of acknowledgment, secretly inserted the message "Created by Warren Robinett". This message would only appear if a player moved his/her [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]] over a specific pixel (the "Gray Dot") during a certain part of the game. When Robinett left Atari, he did not inform the company of the acknowledgment that he included in the game. Shortly after his departure, the Gray Dot and his message were exposed by a player who told Atari about his discovery. Atari's management initially wanted to remove the message and release the game again, but this was deemed too costly an effort. Instead, Steve Wright, the Director of Software Development in the Atari Consumer Division, suggested that they keep the message and, in fact, encourage the inclusion of such messages in future games, describing them as Easter eggs for consumers to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Play Atari Adventure|url=http://my.ign.com/atari/adventure|website=IGN|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|title=How One Man Invented the Console Adventure Game|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/warren-robinett-adventure/|website=WIRED|access-date=2 September 2016|date=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salen|first1=Katie|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Eric|title=The Game Design Reader: A Rules of the Play Anthology|date=2005|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0262195364|pages=690–713|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/58919795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Atari|url=http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf|website=2600 Connections|publisher=Wayback Machine|access-date=September 2, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013192403/http://www.2600connection.com/eastereggs/adventure_letter.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2016|date=August 4, 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In video games==
In addition to Robinett's name appearing in ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1979), there are many other instances where the Easter egg idea has been implemented. The first text adventure game, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1976), from which ''Adventure'' was fashioned, included several secret words. One of these was "[[Xyzzy (computing)|xyzzy]]", a command which enabled the player to move between two points in the game world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerz|first1=Dennis G.|title=Somewhere Nearby is Colossal Cave: Examining Will Crowther's Original "Adventure" in Code and in Kentucky|journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly|date=2007|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/001/2/000009.html|access-date=4 November 2017|publisher=The Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, an Easter egg displaying programmer Bradley Reid-Selth's surname was found in ''Video Whizball'' (1978), a game for the [[Fairchild Channel F]] system.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt; According to research by [[Ed Fries]], the first known Easter egg in an arcade game was in ''[[Starship 1]]'' (1977), programmed by [[Ron Milner]]. By triggering the cabinet's controls in the right order, the player could get the message "Hi Ron!" to appear on the screen. Fries described it as "the earliest arcade game yet known that clearly meets the definition of an Easter egg". The existence of this Easter egg wasn't published until 2017, leading Fries to suggest that, as more than one hundred arcade games predate ''Starship 1'', earlier Easter eggs may still be undiscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Machkovech|first1=Sam|title=The arcade world’s first Easter egg discovered after fraught journey|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/the-arcade-worlds-first-easter-egg-discovered-after-fraught-journey/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|access-date=22 March 2017|language=en-us|date=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fries"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fries|first1=Ed|title=The Hunt For The First Arcade Game Easter Egg|url=http://kotaku.com/the-hunt-for-the-first-arcade-game-easter-egg-1793593889|website=[[Kotaku]]|access-date=24 March 2017|date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fries noted that some Atari arcade cabinets were resold under the [[Kee Games]] label and included changes to the hardware that would make the game appear different from the Atari version. ''[[Anti-Aircraft (video game)|Anti-Aircraft II]]'' (1975) included a means to modify the circuit board to make the airplanes in the game appear as alien UFOs. Fries surmised that this feature may have been intended for a Kee Games release. For this reason, and because it required a hardware modification, Fries questioned whether it met the definition of an Easter egg.&lt;ref name="Fries"/&gt;

Since ''Adventure'', there has been a long history of video game developers placing Easter eggs in their games.&lt;ref name="Consalvo"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Consalvo|first1=Mia|title=Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Videogames|date=2007|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262033657}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} Most Easter eggs are intentional - an attempt to communicate with the player or a way of getting even with management for a slight. Easter eggs in video games have taken a variety of forms, from purely ornamental screens to aesthetic enhancements that change some element of the game during play. The Easter egg included in the original ''[[Age of Empires (video game)|Age of Empires]]'' (1997) is an example of the latter; [[catapult]] projectiles are changed from stones to cows.&lt;ref name="Consalvo"/&gt;{{rp|19}}

More elaborate Easter eggs include [[Level (video gaming)#Secret levels|secret levels]] and developers' rooms - fully functional, hidden areas of the game. Developers' rooms often include inside jokes from the [[fandom]] or development team and differ from a [[debug menu|debug room]] in that they are specifically intended for the player to find. Some games even include hidden [[minigame]]s as Easter eggs. In the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' (1993), the original ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' (1987) game can be played in its full version by using a home computer in a character's room.&lt;ref name="Björk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Björk|first1=Staffan|last2=Holopainen|first2=Jussi|title=Patterns In Game Design|date=2005|publisher=Charles River Media|location=Hingham, Massachusetts|isbn=9781584503545|page=235|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFQfyODK4wAC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage&amp;f=false|access-date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Optical Information Systems Update/library &amp; Information Center Applications|journal=CD-ROM World|date=February 1994|volume=9|issue=1-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Day+of+the+Tentacle+easter+egg&amp;dq=Day+of+the+Tentacle+easter+egg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HlMCUb6ELYSoiALI1gE&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ|access-date=4 November 2017|publisher=Meckler Publishing|language=en|quote=The best Easter egg of all is the entire Maniac Mansion game, which appears on a computer in Doctor Fred's mansion. Users can play the original game in its entirety.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Easter eggs originated unintentionally. The [[Konami Code]], a type of [[cheat code]], became an intentional Easter egg in most games, but originated from Konami's ''[[Gradius]]'' (1985) for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The programmer, Kazuhisa Hashimoto, created the code as a means to rapidly [[debug]] the game by giving the player's avatar additional health and powers to easily traverse the game. These types of codes are normally removed from the game before it is shipped but, in the case of ''Gradius'', Hashimoto forgot to remove it and the code was soon discovered by players. Its popularity inspired Konami to reuse the code and purposely retain it for many of its future games as an Easter egg.&lt;ref name="Wolf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Björk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garmon|first1=Jay|title=Geek Trivia: The cheat goes on|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/geek-trivia-the-cheat-goes-on/|website=TechRepublic|access-date=16 April 2008|language=en|date=5 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical issues may also create unintentional Easter eggs. [[Jon Burton]], founder of [[Traveller's Tales]], announced that many seemingly apparent Easter eggs in their [[Sega Genesis]] games came about as a result of introducing programming tricks to get around some of the difficulty they had in getting Sega's strict certification for their games, [[Exception handling|catching any exceptions during execution]] to bring the game back to a usable state as to pass certification. For example, [[Cartridge tilting|hitting the side]] of the ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996) cartridge while it was slotted in the console would bring the game back to the Level Select screen, which Burton explained was the default exception handling for any unidentified processor error, such as when connectivity between the cartridge and the console's microprocessor was temporarily lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=How hitting a game cartridge unlocks gaming’s weirdest Easter egg|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/smack-cartridge-for-level-select-behind-gamings-weirdest-easter-egg/|website=Ars Technica|access-date=4 October 2017|language=en-us|date=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In computing==
===Software===
[[File:Google Maps "Mordor" easter egg.png|thumb|Asking Google Maps for walking directions between fictional locations from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' produced this "Easter egg" response, quoting a character's warning from the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wagstaff|first1=Keith|title=Google Maps Easter Egg: ‘One Does Not Simply Walk Into Mordor’|url=http://techland.time.com/2011/12/21/google-maps-easter-egg-one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor/|website=Time|access-date=4 November 2017|date=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[computer software]], Easter eggs are secret responses that occur as a result of an undocumented set of commands. The results can vary from a simple printed message or image to a page of programmer credits or a small video game hidden inside an otherwise serious piece of software.

In the [[TOPS-10]] operating system (for the DEC [[PDP-10]] computer), the {{code|make}} command is used to invoke the [[Text Editor and Corrector|TECO]] editor to create a file. If given the file name argument {{code|love}}, so that the command reads {{code|make love}}, it will pause and respond [[Make love, not war|{{code|not war?}}]] before creating the file.&lt;ref name="Montfort"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montfort|first1=Nick|last2=Bogost|first2=Ian|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System |date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262012577|page=59|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DqePfdz_x6gC&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;f=false |access-date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same behavior occurred on the [[RSTS/E]] operating system, where TECO will provide this response.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Other [[Unix]] [[operating system]]s respond to "{{code|why}}" with "{{code|why not}}" (a reference to ''[[The Prisoner (computer game)|The Prisoner]]'' in [[BSD|Berkeley Unix]], 1977).{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Some versions of the DEC [[OpenVMS]] operating system have concealed [[exit status]] codes, including a reference to the [[Monty Python]] [[Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook]] skit; "{{code|exit %xb70}}" returns the message "%SYSTEM-W-FISH, my hovercraft is full of eels" while "{{code|exit %x34b4}}" returns a reference to an early Internet meme: "%SYSTEM-F-GAMEOVER, [[All your base are belong to us]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OpenVMS Undocumented Features|url=https://www.parsec.com/os/openvms/undocumented.php?page=12|website=PARSEC Group|access-date=6 April 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[personal computers]] have much more elaborate eggs hidden in [[read-only memory|ROM]], including lists of the developers' names, political exhortations, snatches of music, or images of the entire development team. Easter eggs in the 1997 version of [[Microsoft Office]] include a hidden [[flight simulator]] in [[Microsoft Excel]] and a [[pinball]] game in [[Microsoft Word]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Anonymous|title=Excel Easter Egg - Excel 97 Flight to Credits|url=http://eeggs.com/items/718.html|website=The Easter Egg Archive|access-date=4 January 2011|language=en|date=19 July 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arima|first1=Kevin|title=Word (Microsoft) Easter Egg - Pinball in Word 97|url=http://eeggs.com/items/763.html|website=The Easter Egg Archive|access-date=4 January 2011|language=en|date=20 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, Microsoft does not allow any hidden or undocumented code as part of its [[Trustworthy computing|trustworthy computing]] initiative.&lt;ref name=Larry&gt;{{cite web |author1=Larry Osterman |title=Why no Easter Eggs? |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/10/21/483608.aspx |website=Larry Osterman's WebLog |publisher=MSDN Blogs |access-date=July 10, 2018 |date=October 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security concerns==
Security author Michel E. Kabay discussed security concerns of Easter eggs in 2000, saying that, while software quality assurance requires that all code be tested, it is not known whether Easter eggs are. He said that, as they tend to be held as programming secrets from the rest of the product testing process, a "[[logic bomb]]" could also bypass testing. Kabay asserts that this undermined the [[Trusted Computing Base]], a paradigm of trustworthy hardware and software in place since the 1980s, and is of concern wherever personal or confidential information is stored, as this may then be vulnerable to damage or manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kabay|first1=M.E.|title=Easter eggs and the Trusted Computing Base|url=http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/sec/0327sec1.html|website=Network World|access-date=4 November 2017|language=en|date=27 March 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615213259/http://www.networkworld.com/newsletters/sec/0327sec1.html|archivedate=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- For this reason, many developers have stopped the practice of adding Easter eggs to their software. -- UNSOURCED since May 15, 2006, highly replicated after that.

In 2006, [[Douglas W. Jones]] said, "some Easter eggs may be [[copyright trap|intentional tools used to detect illegal copying]], others are clearly examples of unauthorized functionality that has slipped through the quality-control tests at the vendor". While hidden Easter eggs themselves are harmless, it may be possible for [[malware]] to be hidden in similar ways in voting machines or other computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuman|first1=Peter G.|title=A Conversation with Douglas W.

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|section|date=November 2017}}
Easter eggs have become more widely known to the general public and are referenced in contemporary artworks. They feature as key plot devices in:
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]]", in which the existence of video Easter eggs across a number of [[DVD]]s leads to solving the protagonists' dilemma.
* [[Pixar]] Animation Studios are known for their inclusion of multiple Easter eggs in their films, the most notable one being a faded yellow 1978 [[Toyota Hilux]] pickup that is a delivery vehicle for the fictional &lt;nowiki&gt;''Pizza Planet''&lt;/nowiki&gt; fast food restaurant from the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' franchise]]. The pickup, dubbed the &lt;nowiki&gt;''Pizza Planet Truck''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, appears in every Pixar film (starting with ''[[Toy Story]]'', with the exception of ''[[The Incredibles]]'').
* The Disney Channel Original Show ''[[A.N.T. Farm]]'' had a [[scavenger hunt]] themed episode in Season 2 episode 15. In this episode, while the main characters are out on an educational scavenger hunt, the character Gibson (played by [[Zach Steel]]) is hidden in several scenes and it is the job of the viewer to find him and count the amount of times they see him (or his likeness) until the end of the episode.
* In the novel ''[[Ready Player One]]'' and its [[Ready Player One (film)|film adaptation]], several Easter eggs are discovered in video games in a virtual reality setting, in particular highlighting the ''Adventure'' Easter egg.
* In the first season of the TV sit-com ''[[The Thundermans]]'', multiple objects or characters can be seen upside down, a prank often used by television channels for Easter egg hunts.

'''Egg donation''' is the process by which a woman donates [[ovum|eggs]] to enable another woman to conceive as part of an assisted reproduction treatment or for biomedical research. For assisted reproduction purposes, egg donation typically involves [[in vitro fertilization]] technology, with the eggs being fertilized in the laboratory; more rarely, unfertilized eggs may be frozen and stored for later use. Egg donation is a [[third party reproduction]] as part of [[assisted reproductive technology]].

In the United States, the [[American Society for Reproductive Medicine]] has issued guidelines for these procedures, and the Food and Drug Administration has a number of guidelines as well. There are boards in countries outside of the US which have the same regulations. However, egg donation agencies in the U.S. can choose whether to abide by the society's regulations or not.

==History==
The first child born from egg donation was reported in Australia in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monashivf.com/treatment/qld/treatments-available/egg-donation/|title=Egg Donation|work=Monash IVF|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1983, a clinic in Southern California reported a pregnancy using egg donation, which led to the birth of the first American child born from egg donation on February 3, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9404EEDC143BF937A35751C0A962948260|title=Infertile Woman Has Baby Through Embryo Transfer|first=Sandra|last=Blakeslee|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=1984-02-04|accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure was performed at the Harbor UCLA Medical Center and the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humc.edu/calendar/careacc.html|title=HUMC - Celebrating 50 Years of Caring|publisher=Humc.edu|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the procedure, which is no longer used today, a fertilized egg that was just beginning to develop was transferred from one woman in whom it had been conceived by artificial insemination to another woman who gave birth to the infant 38 weeks later. The sperm used in the artificial insemination came from the husband of the woman who bore the baby.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517,00.html | work=Time |title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare |date=1984-09-10 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |first1=Otto |last1=Friedrich |first2=Anne |last2=Constable |first3=Raji |last3=Samghabadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neworigins"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952514,00.html |title=The New Origins of Life |magazine=[[TIME]] |first=Claudia |last=Wallis |date=1984-09-10 |accessdate=2009-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, thousands of infertile women, single men and gay male couples had adoption as the only path to parenthood. Advances in IVF and egg donation set the stage to allow open and candid discussion of oocyte and embryo donation as a common practice.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="neworigins"/&gt; This breakthrough has given way to the donation of human oocytes and embryos as a common practice similar to other donations such as blood and major organ donations. At the time of this announcement the event was captured by major news carriers and fueled healthy debate and discussion on this practice which affected the future of reproductive medicine by creating a platform for further advancements in woman's health.

This scientific breakthrough changed the outlook for those who were unable to have children due to female infertility and for women who are at high risk for passing on genetic disorders. As IVF developed, the procedures used in egg donation paralleled that development: the egg donor's eggs are now harvested from her ovaries in an outpatient surgical procedure and fertilized in the laboratory, the same procedure used on IVF patients, but the resulting embryo or embryos is then transferred into the intended mother instead of into the woman who provided the egg. Donor oocytes thus give women a mechanism to become pregnant and give birth to a child that will be their biological child (assuming that the recipient woman carries the baby), but not their genetic child. In cases where the recipient's womb is absent or unable to carry a pregnancy, or in cases involving gay male couples, a gestational surrogate is used and the embryos are implanted into her per an agreement with the recipients. The combination of egg donation and surrogacy has enabled gay men, including singer Elton John and his partner, to have biological children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8235149/Elton-John-baby-Thanks-to-Zacahary-gay-surrogacy-will-become-more-acceptable.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Olga | last=Craig | title=Elton John baby: "Thanks to Zacahary, gay surrogacy will become more acceptable" | date=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oocyte and embryo donation now account for approximately 18% of in vitro fertilization recorded births in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sartcorsonline.com/rptCSR_PublicMultYear.aspx?ClinicPKID=0|title=Clinic Summary Report|publisher=Sartcorsonline.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ideas.time.com/2013/08/24/get-used-to-embryo-adoption |title=Get Used to Embryo Adoption[|magazine=TIME |first=Sarah Elizabeth |last=Richards |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work established the technical foundation and legal-ethical framework surrounding the clinical use of human oocyte and embryo donation, a mainstream clinical practice, which has evolved over the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952517-6,00.html | work=Time | title=Medicine: A Legal, Moral, Social Nightmare | date=1984-09-10 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | first1=Otto | last1=Friedrich | first2=Anne | last2=Constable | first3=Raji | last3=Samghabadi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building upon this groundbreaking research and since the initial birth announcement in 1984, well over 47,000 live births resulting from donor oocyte embryo transfer have been and continue to be recorded by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220015146/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm/pdf/first_live_birth_donation.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071008194941/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm.asp?id=5030] &lt;/ref&gt; in the United States to infertile women, who otherwise would not have had children by any other existing method.

The legal status and cost/compensation models of egg donation vary significantly by country. It may be totally illegal (e.g., Italy, Germany, Austria);&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/04/13/fertility-treatment-bans-in-europe-draw-criticism/ | work=Fox News | title=Fertility treatment bans in Europe draw criticism | date=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/germanys-egg-donation-prohibition-is-outdated-experts-say/a-2999675-1|title=Germany′s Egg Donation Prohibition Is Outdated, Experts Say - Germany - DW.DE - 12.12.2007|work=DW.DE|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal only if anonymous and gratuitous—that is, without any compensation for the egg donor (e.g., France);&lt;ref name="dondovocytes.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dondovocytes.fr/comment-faire/ce-que-dit-la-loi/|title=Ce que dit la loi - Don d'ovocytes|publisher=Dondovocytes.fr|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; legal only if ''non''-anonymous and gratuitous (e.g., Canada); legal only if anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (the compensation is often described as being to offset her inconvenience and expenses) (e.g., Spain, Czech Republic, South Africa, Greece); legal only if ''non''-anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the UK);&lt;ref name="ngdt.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdt.co.uk/donation-and-the-law|title=Donation and the Law|publisher=Ngdt.co.uk|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105151107/http://www.ngdt.co.uk/donation-and-the-law|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or legal whether or not it is anonymous, and egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the US).

==Indication==
A need for egg donation may arise for a number of reasons. Infertile couples may resort to egg donation when the female partner cannot have genetic children because her own eggs cannot generate a viable pregnancy, or because they could generate a viable pregnancy but the chances are so low that it is not advisable or not financially feasible to do IVF with her own eggs. This situation is often, but not always based on advanced reproductive age. It can also be due to early onset of menopause, which can occur as early as their 20s. In addition, some women are born without ovaries, while some women's reproductive organs have been damaged or surgically removed due to disease or other circumstances. Another indication would be a genetic disorder on part of the woman that either renders her infertile or would be dangerous for any offspring, problems that can be circumvented by using eggs from another woman. Many women have none of these issues, but continue to be unsuccessful using their own eggs—in other words, they have undiagnosed infertility—and thus turn to donor eggs or donor embryos. As stated above, egg donation is also helpful for gay male couples using [[surrogacy]] (see [[LGBT parenting]]).

In the US and UK, if desired (and if the egg donor agrees), the couple can meet and get acquainted with the egg donor, her children and family members. More often, egg donations are anonymous or semi-anonymous (i.e. the egg donor may provide personal and medical information, photographs of herself and/or family members, and an email or third party willing to convey communications between the donor and recipients). In some countries, the law requires non-anonymity (e.g., the UK). In other countries, the law requires anonymity (e.g., France, Spain, the Czech Republic, South Africa). In the US the choice between anonymity, semi-anonymity and non-anonymity is made by the donor and recipient, although some IVF clinics that maintain their own databases of egg donors strongly encourage or require anonymity.

==Types of donors==
Donors includes the following types:
*Donors unrelated to the recipients who do it for altruistic and/or monetary reasons. In the US they are ''anonymous donors'' or ''semi-anonymous donors'' recruited by ''egg donor agencies'' or IVF clinics. Such donors may also be ''non-anonymous donors'', i.e., they may exchange identifying and contact information with the recipients. In most countries other than the US and UK, the law requires such donors to remain anonymous.
*'''Designated donors''', e.g. a friend or relative brought by the patients to serve as a donor specifically to help them. In Sweden and France, couples who can bring such a donor still get another person as a donor, but instead get advanced on the waiting list for the procedure, and that donor rather becomes a "cross donor".&lt;ref&gt;''cross donor'' is termed ''korsdonator'' in Swedish.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the couple brings a designated donor, she donates anonymously to another couple, and the couple that brought her receives eggs from another anonymous donor much more quickly than they would have if they had not been able to provide a designated donor.

==Procedure==
{{Expert needed|Medicine|date=November 2008}}
Egg donors are first recruited, screened, and give consent before participating in the IVF process. Once the egg donor is recruited, she undergoes [[IVF]] stimulation therapy, followed by the egg retrieval procedure. After retrieval, the ova are fertilized by the sperm of the male partner (or sperm donor) in the laboratory, and, after several days, the best resulting embryo(s) is/are placed in the uterus of the recipient, whose [[uterine lining]] has been appropriately prepared for [[embryo transfer]] beforehand. The recipient is usually, but [[surrogacy|not always]], the person who requested the service and then will carry and deliver the [[pregnancy]] and keep the baby.

===The egg donor's process in detail===
Before any intensive medical, psychological, or genetic testing is done on a donor, they must first be chosen by a recipient from the profiles on agency or clinic databases (or, in countries where donors are required to remain anonymous, they are chosen by the recipient's doctor based on their physical and temperamental resemblance to the recipient woman). This is due to the fact that all of the mentioned examinations are expensive and the agencies must first confirm that a match is possible or guaranteed before investing in the process.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"&gt;Almeling, Rene. American Sociological Review. Vol. 72, No. 3 (Jun 2007), pp. 319-340.&lt;/ref&gt; Each egg donor is first referred to a psychologist who will evaluate if she is mentally prepared to undertake and complete the donation process. These evaluations are necessary to ensure that the donor is fully prepared and capable of completing the donation cycle safely and successfully. The donor is then required to undergo a thorough medical examination, including a pelvic exam, blood draw to check hormone levels and to test for infectious diseases, Rh factor, blood type, and drugs and an ultrasound to examine her ovaries, uterus and other pelvic organs. A family history of approximately the past three generations is also required, meaning that adoptees are usually not accepted because of the lack of past health knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; Genetic testing is also usually done on donors to ensure that they do not carry mutations (e.g., cystic fibrosis) that could harm the resulting children; however, not all clinics automatically perform such testing and thus recipients must clarify with their clinics whether such testing will be done.

Once the screening is complete and a legal contract signed, the donor will begin the donation cycle, which typically takes between three and six weeks. An egg retrieval procedure comprises both the '''Egg Donor's Cycle''' and the '''Recipient's Cycle'''. Birth control pills are administered during the first few weeks of the egg donation process to synchronize the donor's cycle with the recipient's, followed by a series of injections which halt the normal functioning of the donor's ovaries. These injections may be self-administered on a daily basis for a period of one to three weeks. Next, [[follicle-stimulating hormone]]s (FSH) are given to the donor to stimulate egg production and increases the number of mature eggs produced by the ovaries. Throughout the cycle the donor is monitored often by a physician using blood tests and ultrasound exams to determine the donor's reaction to the hormones and the progress of [[ovarian follicle|follicle]] growth.

Once the doctor decides the follicles are mature, he/she will establish the date and time for the egg retrieval procedure. Approximately 36 hours before retrieval, the donor must administer one last injection of [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|HCG]] hormone to ensure that her eggs are ready to be harvested. The egg retrieval itself is a minimally invasive surgical procedure lasting 20–30 minutes, performed under sedation (but sometimes without any). A small ultrasound-guided needle is inserted through the vagina to [[:wikt:aspirate|aspirate]] the follicles in both ovaries, which extracts the eggs. After resting in a recovery room for an hour or two, the donor is released. Most donors resume regular activities by the next day.

==Results==
In the United States, egg donor cycles have a success rate of over 60%. (See statistics at http://www.sart.org.) When a "fresh cycle" is followed by a "frozen cycle", the success rate with donor eggs is approximately 80%.

With egg donation, women who are past their reproductive years or [[menopause]] can still become pregnant. [[Adriana Iliescu]] held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and donated egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006.

==Recipient and donor motivation==

===Intended parent motivation===
Women may resort to egg donation because their ovaries may not be able to produce a substantial number of viable eggs. Women may experience premature ovarian failure and stop producing viable eggs during their reproductive years. Some women may be born without ovaries. Ovaries damaged by chemotherapy or radiotherapy may also no longer produce healthy eggs. Older women with diminished ovarian reserves or older women who are going through menopause could also become pregnant with egg donation.&lt;ref name="Sophia tsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dunyaivf.blogspot.gr/2014/11/why-people-choose-to-proceed-with-egg.html|title=Why people choose to proceed with egg donation? - Egg Donation|publisher=dunyaivf.co.uk|accessdate=11 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who produce healthy eggs may also elect to use a donor egg so they will not pass on genetic diseases.

===Donor motivation===
An egg donor may be motivated to donate eggs for altruistic reasons. A survey of 80 American women showed that 30% were motivated by altruism alone, another 20% were attracted only by monetary compensation, while 40% of donors were motivated by both reasons. The same study found that 45% of egg donors were students the first time they donated and averaged $4,000 for each donation.&lt;ref name="Kara N. Maxwell 2008"&gt;Kara N. Maxwell, Ina N. Cholst, Zev Rosenwaks. (2008). The incidence of both serious and minor complications in young women undergoing oocyte donation, Fertility and Sterility. 90: 2165-2171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the donors may be motivated by both monetary and altruistic reasons, egg agencies desire and prefer to choose donors that are strictly providing eggs for altruistic reasons.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; The European Union limits any financial compensation for donors to at most $1500. In some countries, most notably Spain and Cyprus, this has limited donors to the poorest segments of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/blog/untold-stories/it%E2%80%99s-not-altruism-it%E2%80%99s-selling|title=The Cyprus Scramble: An Investigation into Human Egg Markets - Pulitzer Center|publisher=Pulitzercenter.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, donors are paid regardless of how many eggs she produces. A donor’s compensation may increase for each additional time she provides eggs, especially if the donor’s eggs have a history of reliably resulting in the recipient becoming pregnant.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; In the United States, egg-broker agencies are known for advertising to college students who are more likely to be in financial situations that motivate them to participate for the financial compensation. It is not unusual for one student to donate many times. Often, this is done without consideration of potential long-term health consequences. Such a student is arguably not making the decision to donate her eggs autonomously due to her unfavorable financial situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbmojournal.com/article/S1472-6483%2810%2960647-5/abstract|title=DEFINE_ME_WA|publisher=rbmojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==

===Egg donor===
The procedures for the donor and the medication given to her are identical to the procedures and medications used in autologous IVF (i.e., IVF on patients who are using their own eggs). The egg donor thus has the same low risk of complications from IVF as an autologous IVF patient would, such as bleeding from the oocyte recovery procedure and reaction to the hormones used to induce hyperovulation (producing more than one egg), including [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] (OHSS) and, rarely, liver failure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Textbook of Assisted Reproductive Techniques, Laboratory and Clinical Perspectives, edited by David K. Gardner, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen and Tucker, writing in the same assisted reproductive technologies textbook referenced above,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; the risk of OHSS varies with the clinic administering the hormones, from 6.6 to 8.4% of cycles, half of them "severe." The most severe form of OHSS is life-threatening. Recent studies have found that donors were at less risk of OHSS when the final maturation of oocytes was induced by GnRH agonist than with recombinant hCG. Both hormones were comparable in the number of mature oocytes produced and fertilization rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/09513590802404013 | last1 = Galindo | first1 = A. | last2 = Bodri | first2 = D. | last3 = Guillen | first3 = J.J. | last4 = Colodron | first4 = M. | last5 = Vernaeve | first5 = V. | last6 = Coll | first6 = O. | year = 2009 | title = Triggering with HCG or GnRH agonist in GnRH antagonist treated oocyte donation cycles: a randomized clinical trial | url = | journal = Gynecol Endocrinol | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 60–6 | pmid = 19165664 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2007.11.049 | last1 = Bodri | first1 = D. | last2 = Guillen | first2 = J.J. | last3 = Galindo | first3 = A. | last4 = Mataro | first4 = D. | last5 = Pujol | first5 = A. | last6 = Coll | first6 = O. | year = 2009 | title = Triggering with human chorionic gonadotropin or a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist-treated oocyte donor cycles:findings of large retrospective cohort study | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 91 | issue = 2| pages = 365–71 | pmid = 18367175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger study in the Netherlands found 10 documented cases of deaths from IVF, with a rate of 1:10,000. "All of these patients were treated with GnRH agonists and none of these cases have been published in the scientific literature."

The long-term effect of egg donation on donors has not been well studied, but because the same medications and procedures are used, it should be essentially the same as the long-term effect (if any) of IVF on patients using their own eggs. The evidence of increased cancer risk is equivocal; some studies have pointed to a slightly increased risk while other studies have found no such risk or even a slightly reduced risk in most patients (women with a family history of breast cancer, however, may have a higher risk).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2008/12/26/risks-and-benefits-of-egg-donation-reported.html?PageNr=1|title=Risks and Benefits of Egg Donation Reported|work=US News &amp; World Report|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=In vitro fertilization and breast cancer risk: a review|first=M|last=Salhab|newspaper=International journal of fertility and women's medicine|date=November 2005|pmid=16526416|volume=50|issue=6|pages=259–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 in 5 women report psychological effects—which may be positive or negative—from donating their eggs, and two-thirds of egg donors were happy with the decision to donate their eggs. The same study found that 20% of women did not recall being aware of any physical risks.&lt;ref name="Kara N. Maxwell 2008"/&gt; In accordance with the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines, female donors are given a limit of 6 cycles that they may donate in order to minimize the possible health risks.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt;

However, it appears that repetitive oocyte donation cycles does not cause accelerated ovarian aging, evidenced by absence of decreased [[anti-Müllerian hormone]] (AMH) in such women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bukulmez O |author2=Li Q |author3=Carr BR |author4=Leader B |author5=Doody KM |author6=Doody KJ |title=Repetitive oocyte donation does not decrease serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=905–12 |date=July 2009 |pmid=19631321 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.05.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intended parent===
The recipient has a minimal risk of contracting a transmittable disease. While the donor may test negative for HIV, such testing does not exclude the possibility that the donor has contracted [[HIV]] very recently, so the recipient faces a residual risk of exposure. However, the FDA governs this and requires full infectious disease testing no more than 30 days prior to retrieval and/or transfer. Most clinics now require, however, that donors be retested a few days prior to retrieval so the risk to the recipient is minimal. Intimate partners of both the egg donor and the recipient are also tested.

The recipient also trusts that the medical history of the donor and her family is accurate. This factor of trust should not be underestimated in importance. Donors in the US are paid thousands of dollars; such compensation may attract unscrupulous individuals inclined to conceal their true motivations. However, a full psychological evaluation is required by most IVF clinics, giving an indication if the donor is trustworthy or not.

In more cases than not, there is no ongoing relationship between the donor and recipient following the cycle. Both the donor and recipient agree in formal legal documents that the donation of the eggs is final at the time of retrieval, and typically both parties would like any "relationship" to conclude at that point; if they prefer continued contact, they may provide for that in the contract. Even if they prefer anonymity, however, it remains theoretically possible that in the future, some children may be able to identify their donor(s) using DNA databanks and/or registries (e.g., if the donor submits her DNA to a genealogy site and a child born from her donation later submits its DNA to the same site).

[[Multiple birth]] is a common complication. Incidence of twin births is very high. At the present time, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends that no more than 1 or 2 embryos be transferred in any given cycle. Remaining embryos are frozen, whether for future transfers if the first one fails, for siblings, or for eventual embryo donation.

There appears to be a slightly higher risk of [[pregnancy-induced hypertension]] in pregnancies of egg donation.&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"/&gt;

===Fetus===
Pregnancies with egg donation are associated with a slightly increased risk of [[placental pathology]].&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"/&gt; The local and systemic immunologic changes are also more pronounced than in natural pregnancies, so it has been suggested that the association is caused by reduced [[maternal immune tolerance]] towards the fetus, as the genetic similarity between the carrier and fetus from an egg donation is less than in a natural pregnancy.&lt;ref name="van-der-Hoorn2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq017| last1 = Van Der Hoorn | first1 = M.

===Custody===
Generally legal documents are signed renouncing rights and responsibilities of custody on the part of the donor. Most IVF doctors will not proceed with administering medication to any donor until these documents are in place and a legal "clearance letter" confirming this understanding is provided to the doctor.

==Legality and financial issues==
The legal status and cost/compensation models of egg donation vary significantly by country. It may be totally illegal (e.g., Italy, Germany);&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dw.de"/&gt; legal only if anonymous and gratuitous—that is, without any compensation for the egg donor (e.g., France);&lt;ref name="dondovocytes.fr"/&gt; legal only if ''non''-anonymous and gratuitous (e.g., Canada); legal only if anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (the compensation is often described as being to offset her inconvenience and expenses) (e.g., Spain, Czech Republic, South Africa); legal only if ''non''-anonymous, but egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the UK);&lt;ref name="ngdt.co.uk"/&gt; or legal whether or not it is anonymous, and egg donors may be compensated (e.g., the US). Because most countries prohibit the sale of body parts, egg donors generally are paid for undergoing the necessary medical procedures rather than for their eggs. In other words, if they complete the cycle, they will be paid the agreed price regardless of how many (or how few) eggs are retrieved.

In countries that prohibit compensation there is an extreme dearth of young women willing to go through this procedure. Additionally, in most countries where it is legal and compensated, the law places a cap on the compensation and that cap tends to be in the vicinity of $1000–$2000. In the US, no law caps the compensation, but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine requires member clinics to abide by their standards, which provide that "sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate."&lt;ref name="asrm.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Ethics_Committee_Reports_and_Statements/financial_incentives.pdf|format=PDF|title=Financial compensation of oocyte donors|publisher=Asrm.org|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "justification" for payments over $5000 may include previous successful donations, unusually good family health history, or membership in minority ethnicities for which it is more difficult to find donors.

As a result of these legal and financial differences around the world, egg donation in the US is much more expensive than it is in other countries. For instance, at one top US clinic it costs more than $26,000 plus the donor's medications (another several thousand dollars).&lt;ref name="sdfertility.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sdfertility.com/secure_fees.htm|title=San Diego IVF (In Vitro Fertilization) Guarantee|publisher=Sdfertility.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having an attorney draft a contract is recommended in order to ensure that the donor has no possible legal rights or responsibilities over the child or any frozen embryos. Hiring an attorney who specializes in reproductive law is thus strongly recommended, at least in the United States; other countries may have other procedures for clarifying the parties' rights, or may simply have legislation that defines the parties' rights. In the US, before the egg donor's IVF cycle begins she typically must sign the Egg Donor Contract, which specifies the rights of the donor and the recipient(s) with respect to the retrieved eggs, the embryos, and any children conceived from the donation. Such contracts should specify that the recipients are the legal parents of the child and the legal owners of any eggs or embryos resulting from the cycle; in other words, while the donor has the right to cancel the cycle at any time prior to egg donation (although if she does so the contract generally provides that she will not be paid), once the eggs are retrieved they belong to the recipient(s). In individual cases the donors and parents may also wish to negotiate terms relating to any unused embryos (e.g., some donors would prefer that unused embryos be destroyed or donated to science, while others would prefer or allow them to be donated to another infertile couple). Some states have also adopted the [[Uniform Parentage Act]], which provides that the recipient or recipients have complete parental responsibility of the conceived child.

In ''Buzzanca v. Buzzanca'', 72 Cal. Rptr.2d 280 (Cal. Ct. App. 1998), the court held that both the recipient and the father of a child conceived through anonymous sperm and egg donation and carried by a surrogate were the legal parents of the child by virtue of their procreative intent. Therefore, the father was required to pay child support even though he sought a divorce before the child was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uh.edu/healthlaw/perspectives/Reproductive/980408Child.html|title=California Appellate Court Holds Divorcing Spouses Who Were Intended Parents of Child Resulting from Anonymous Egg and Sperm Donors and Brought to Term by Surrogate to Be Legal Parents of Child|publisher=Law.uh.edu|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donor registries==
{{Main article|Donor registration}}
A donor registry is a registry to facilitate [[donor conceived people]], sperm donors and [[egg donor]]s to establish contact with genetic kindred. They are mostly used by donor conceived people to find genetic half-siblings from the same egg- or sperm donor.

Some donors are non-anonymous, but most are anonymous, i.e. the donor conceived person doesn't know the true identity of the donor. Still, he/she may get the donor number from the fertility clinic. If that donor had donated before, then other donor conceived people with the same donor number are thus genetic half-siblings. In short, donor registries match people who type in the same donor number.

Alternatively, if the donor number isn't available, then known donor characteristics, e.g. hair, eye and skin color may be used in matching.

Donors may also register, and therefore, donor registries may also match donors with their genetic children.

The largest registry is the Donor Sibling Registry- with more than 25,000 members, the DSR has matched almost 7,000 donor conceived people with their egg and sperm donors, as well as with their half siblings. Alternate methods of providing an information link between the donor and recipient (both agreeing to stay registered on the DSR) are often provided for in the legal document (referred to as the "Egg Donor Agreement".)

==Embryo donation==
An alternative to egg donation in some couples, especially those in whom the male partner cannot provide viable sperm, is [[embryo donation]]. Embryo donation is the use of embryos remaining after a couple’s IVF treatments have been completed, to another individual or couple, followed by the placement of those embryos into the recipient woman’s uterus, to facilitate pregnancy and childbirth. Embryo donation is more cost-effective than egg donation on a "per live birth" basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Finger R, Sommerfelt C, Freeman M, Wilson CK, Wade A, Daly D | year = 2010 | title = A cost-effectiveness comparison of embryo donation with oocyte donation | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 93 | issue = | pages = 379–81 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2009.03.019 | pmid=19406398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has found that embryos created for one couple, using an egg donor, are often made available for donation to another couple if the first couple chooses not to use them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill GA, Freeman MR | year = 2011 | title = Embryo disposition: Choices made by patients and donor oocyte recipients | url = | journal = Fertil Steril | volume = 95 | issue = | pages = 940–3 | doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2010.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological and social issues==
{{Further information|Donor conceived people#Psychological and social}}

&lt;big&gt;'''Quality of Parent-Infant Relationships'''&lt;/big&gt; 

Quality of parent-child attachment in early infancy has been recognized as a crucial influencer of a child’s socioemotional development. The formation of a quality and secure attachment is largely influenced by parental representations of the parent-child relationship (Imrie, Jadva, Golombok, &amp; Fishel, 2018). Concern regarding relationship quality and attachment security in egg donor families is understandable and typically stems from the absence of genetic material shared between the mother and child. In recent years, researchers have begun to question if lack of genetic commonality between mother and child inhibits the ability to form a quality attachment. 

In a recent study, quality of infant-parent relationships was examined among egg donor families in comparison to in vitro fertilization families (Imrie et al., 2018). Infants were between the ages of 6-18 months. Through use of the Parent Development Interview (PDI) and observational assessment, the study found few differences between family types on the representational level, yet significant differences between family types on the observational level (Imrie et al., 2018). Egg donation mothers were less sensitive and structuring than IVF mothers, and egg donation infants were less emotionally responsive, and involving than IVF infants (Imrie et al., 2018). No differences were found in relationship quality between egg donor fathers and IVF fathers representationally or observationally. Due to the developmental implications of forming healthy parent-child relationships in early infancy, the finding that egg donor mothers were less sensitive and structuring towards their infants raises concern about attachment styles among egg donor families, and the impacts it may have on infants’ future socioemotional development. 


===Telling the child===
Most psychologists recommend being open and honest with children from an early age. Groups for donor conceived children make a strong case for the rights of children to have access to information about their genetic background. For donor conceived children who find out after a long period of secrecy, their main grief is usually not the fact that they are not the genetic child of the mother who raised (and, usually, gave birth to) them, but the fact that their parents lied to them, causing loss of trust.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt; Furthermore, assuming that egg-donor conceived children have essentially the same reaction as sperm-donor conceived children, the overturning of one's lifelong understanding of who one's genetic parents were may cause a lasting sense of imbalance and loss of control.

Telling the children that they were donor conceived is recommended, based on decades of experience with adoption (and more recent feedback from donor-conceived children) showing that not telling children is harmful to the parent-child relationship and to the child psychologically.&lt;ref name="aboutourkids.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutourkids.org/articles/where_did_i_come_answering_kids039_questions_about_donor_eggs_or_sperm|title=Where did I come from?

*When anyone other than the parents know about the donation, such that the child might find it out from somebody else.&lt;ref name=barratt&gt;Donor insemination Edited by C.L.R. Barratt and I.D. Cooke. Cambridge (England): Cambridge University Press, 1993. 231 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
*When the recipient carries a significant genetic disease, since telling the child will reassure the child that he or she does not carry the disease.&lt;ref name=barratt/&gt;
*Where the child is found to suffer from a genetically-transmitted disorder and it is necessary to take legal action which then identifies the donor.

Conversely, when the child is being raised in a religion or a culture that strongly disapproves of donor conception (e.g., a Catholic country where egg donation is illegal), that may counsel against telling the child, at least until the child is much older and clearly capable of understanding why he or she was not told earlier and of keeping that information to him or herself.

A systematic review of factors contributing to parental decision-making in disclosing donor conception has shown that parents cite the child’s best interest as the main factor they use to make the decision &lt;ref&gt;A. Indekeu, K. Dierickx, P. Schotsmans, K.R. Daniels, P. Rober, and T. D'Hooghe

===Other family members===
Parents of donors may regard the donated eggs as a family asset and may regard the donor conceived people as grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/my-scattered-grandchildren/article1286201/|title=My scattered grandchildren|work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donor marketing==
For a donor to be accepted by an agency and repeatedly used she must be marketable and appealing to the recipients. Although egg donation is a significant, life-giving act, the companies participating in this industry still have to operate with an economical mind-set. Matches between egg recipients and egg donors are what make the profit for the company and achievable to continue these processes for others. The most sought-after donors tend to be those who are (1) proven (i.e., have donated before and produced a pregnancy from it, proving themselves both fertile and reliable); (2) conventionally attractive; (3) healthy, with good family health histories; and (4) smart, well educated. 
 
Donor profiles presented on agency websites are their primary marketing tool to find recipients and learn what these future consumers want. On the donor profiles listed on the agency website for recipients, or "clients", to peruse for their desired egg match, "physical characteristics, family health history, educational attainment (in some cases, standardized test scores, GPA, and IQ scores are requested), as well as open-ended questions about hobbies, likes and dislikes, and motivations for donating"&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt; are included. Donors are encouraged to submit attractive photos and are advised of what the recipient finds as desirable. Profiles that are at some point deemed unacceptable are deleted, whether it be because their personalities did not stand out or their portrayals were viewed as negative in some way. Overweight volunteers for donation are also most often not accepted, not just because of conventional views on physical attractiveness but also because women with a higher body-mass index tend to respond differently (less well) to ovarian stimulation drugs and IVF clinics thus generally recommend that patients not use donors with higher BMIs. Egg donors also have a higher standard of physical appearance than sperm donors; many sperm donors are not required to provide adult photographs of themselves, or in some cases, any photographs.&lt;ref name="Rene Almeling"/&gt;

== Religious views ==
Some Christian leaders indicate that IVF is acceptable (provided that no fertilized embryos are discarded in the process). Many Christian couples who cannot have children thus can go for IVF, with both the husband's sperm and the wife's egg and this is in line with the church's teaching.

However the issue is more problematic with donor eggs.

There are also some Christian leaders (especially Catholic) who are concerned about all in vitro fertility therapies because they disrupt the natural act of conceiving a child where gamete donations, both egg and [[sperm donation]]s, are seen to "compromise the marital bond and family integrity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albertmohler.com/commentary_read.php?cdate=2006-05-10|title=AlbertMohler.com|work=AlbertMohler.com|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they encourage infertile couples to consider adoption instead.

In the Orthodox Jewish community there is no consensus as to whether an egg donor needs to be Jewish in order for the child to be considered Jewish from birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=112|title=Egg Donation|publisher=Yoatzot.org|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105174451/http://www.yoatzot.org/article.php?id=112|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s religious authorities said that if the birth mother was Jewish that the child would be Jewish as well, but in the past few years rabbis in Israel have begun to reconsider, which in turn is causing more debate around the world. Conservative Rabbi Elliot Dorff has suggested that there are arguments for both sides (birth mother or genetic mother) in religious scripture. Dean of the Center for the Jewish Future at Yeshiva University believes that any child where the birth mother or the genetic mother isn't Jewish should go through a conversion process in infancy, to be sure that their Judaism isn't questioned later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/what-makes-a-jewish-mother/|title=What Makes a Jewish Mother|first=Caren|last=Chesler|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not an issue in the reform community for two reasons. First, only one parent must be Jewish for the child to be considered Jewish; thus, if the father is Jewish, the mother's religion is irrelevant. Second, if the mother who carries the pregnancy and gives birth is Jewish, reform Jews will generally consider that child to be Jewish from birth because it was born of a Jewish mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/patrilineal1.html|title=Reform Movement's Resolution on Patrilineal Descent (March 1983) - Jewish Virtual Library|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ellsberg paradox''' is a [[paradox]] in [[decision theory]] in which people's choices violate the postulates of [[subjective expected utility]].&lt;ref name=Ellsberg1961&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ellsberg|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Ellsberg|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=75|title=Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms|year=1961|pages=643–669 |doi=10.2307/1884324|issue=4 |jstor=1884324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally taken to be evidence for [[ambiguity aversion]]. The paradox was popularized by [[Daniel Ellsberg]], although a version of it was noted considerably earlier by [[John Maynard Keynes]].{{sfn|Keynes|1921|pp=75–76, paragraph 315, footnote 2}}

The basic idea is that people overwhelmingly prefer taking on risk in situations where they know specific odds rather than an alternative risk scenario in which the odds are completely ambiguous—they will always choose a known probability of winning over an unknown probability of winning even if the known probability is low and the unknown probability could be a guarantee of winning. For example, given a choice of risks to take (such as bets), people "prefer the devil they know" rather than assuming a risk where odds are difficult or impossible to calculate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econport.org/econport/request?page=man_ru_experiments_ellsberg EconPort discussion of the paradox]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellsberg proposed two separate thought experiments, the proposed choices in which contradict subjective expected utility. The 2-color problem involves bets on two urns, both of which contain balls of two different colors. The 3-color problem, described below, involves bets on a single urn, which contains balls of three different colors.

==The one-urn paradox==
Consider an [[urn problem|urn]] containing 30 red balls and 60 other balls that are either black or yellow. It is unknown how many black or how many yellow balls there are, but that the total number of black balls plus the total number of yellow equals 60. The balls are well mixed so that each individual ball is as likely to be drawn as any other. Given a choice between two gambles:

:{| class="wikitable" align=center
!Gamble A !! Gamble B
|-
|You receive $100 if you draw a red ball || You receive $100 if you draw a black ball
|}

Also you are given the choice between these two gambles (about a different draw from the same urn):

:{| class="wikitable" align=center
!Gamble C !! Gamble D
|-
|You receive $100 if you draw a red or yellow ball ||You receive $100 if you draw a black or yellow ball
|}

This situation poses both ''[[Knightian uncertainty]]'' – how many of the non-red balls are yellow and how many are black, which is not quantified – and ''probability'' – whether the ball is red or non-red, which is {{sfrac|1|3}} vs. {{sfrac|2|3}}.

===Utility theory interpretation===
Utility theory models the choice by assuming that in choosing between these gambles, people assume a ''probability'' that the non-red balls are yellow versus black, and then compute the ''expected utility'' of the two gambles.

Since the prizes are the same, it follows that you will ''prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B [[if and only if]] you believe that drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball (according to expected utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that you will ''prefer'' Gamble C to Gamble D ''if, and only if'', you believe that drawing a red or yellow ball is more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball, then drawing a red or yellow ball is also more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. So, supposing you ''prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B, it follows that you will also ''prefer'' Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that you ''prefer'' Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that you will also ''prefer'' Gamble D to Gamble C.

When surveyed, however, most people ''strictly prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B and Gamble D to Gamble C. Therefore, some assumptions of the expected utility theory are violated.

===Numerical demonstration===
Mathematically, the estimated probabilities of each color ball can be represented as: ''R'', ''Y'', and ''B''. If you ''strictly prefer'' Gamble A to Gamble B, by utility theory, it is presumed this preference is reflected by the expected utilities of the two gambles: specifically, it must be the case that

: &lt;math&gt;R \cdot U(\$100) + (1-R) \cdot U(\$0) &gt; B\cdot U(\$100) + (1-B) \cdot U(\$0) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''U''(&amp;nbsp;) is your utility function. If ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''U''($0) (you strictly prefer $100 to nothing), this simplifies to:

: &lt;math&gt;R [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] &gt; B [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] \Longleftrightarrow R &gt; B \; &lt;/math&gt;

If you also strictly prefer Gamble D to Gamble C, the following inequality is similarly obtained:

: &lt;math&gt;B\cdot U(\$100) + Y\cdot U(\$100) + R \cdot U(\$0) &gt; R \cdot U(\$100) + Y\cdot U(\$100) + B \cdot U(\$0) &lt;/math&gt;

This simplifies to:

: &lt;math&gt;B [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] &gt; R [U(\$100) - U(\$0)] \Longleftrightarrow B &gt; R \;&lt;/math&gt;

This contradiction indicates that your preferences are inconsistent with expected-utility theory.

===Generality of the paradox===
The result holds regardless of your [[utility function]]. Indeed, the amount of the payoff is likewise irrelevant. Whichever gamble is selected, the prize for winning it is the same, and the cost of losing it is the same (no cost), so ultimately, there are only two outcomes: receive a specific amount of money, or receive nothing. Therefore, it is sufficient to assume that the preference is to receive some money to nothing (and, this assumption is not necessary: in the mathematical treatment above, it was assumed ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;''U''($0), but a contradiction can still be obtained for ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''U''($0) and for ''U''($100)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''U''($0)).

In addition, the result holds regardless of your [[risk aversion]]. All the gambles involve risk. By choosing Gamble D, you have a 1 in 3 chance of receiving nothing, and by choosing Gamble A, you have a 2 in 3 chance of receiving nothing. If Gamble A was less risky than Gamble B, it would follow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Segal |first=Uzi |last2= |first2= |date=1987 |title=The Ellsberg Paradox and Risk Aversion: An Anticipated Utility Approach  |url= |journal=[[International Economic Review]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=175–202 |doi=10.2307/2526866 |jstor=2526866  }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Gamble C was less risky than Gamble D (and vice versa), so, risk is not averted in this way.

However, because the exact chances of winning are known for Gambles A and D, and not known for Gambles B and C, this can be taken as evidence for some sort of [[ambiguity aversion]] which cannot be accounted for in expected utility theory. It has been demonstrated that this phenomenon occurs only when the choice set permits comparison of the ambiguous proposition with a less vague proposition (but not when ambiguous propositions are evaluated in isolation).&lt;ref name=FoxTversky1995&gt;
{{Cite journal | last1=Fox | first1= Craig R. |last2=Tversky |first2=Amos |authorlink2=Amos Tversky|year=1995|title=Ambiguity Aversion and Comparative Ignorance|journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]]|volume=110|pages=585–603 | doi=10.2307/2946693|issue=3 | jstor=2946693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible explanations===

There have been various attempts to provide decision-theoretic explanations of Ellsberg's observation. Since the probabilistic information available to the decision-maker is incomplete, these attempts sometimes focus on quantifying the non-probabilistic ambiguity which the decision-maker faces – see [[Knightian uncertainty]]. That is, these alternative approaches sometimes suppose that the agent formulates a subjective (though not necessarily [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]]) probability for possible outcomes.

One such attempt is based on [[info-gap decision theory]]. The agent is told precise probabilities of some outcomes, though the practical meaning of the probability numbers is not entirely clear. For instance, in the gambles discussed above, the probability of a red ball is {{sfrac|30|90}}, which is a precise number. Nonetheless, the agent may not distinguish, intuitively, between this and, say, {{sfrac|30|91}}. No probability information whatsoever is provided regarding other outcomes, so the agent has very unclear subjective impressions of these probabilities.

In light of the ambiguity in the probabilities of the outcomes, the agent is unable to evaluate a precise expected utility. Consequently, a choice based on ''maximizing'' the expected utility is also impossible. The info-gap approach supposes that the agent implicitly formulates info-gap models for the subjectively uncertain probabilities. The agent then tries to [[satisficing|satisfice]] the expected utility and to maximize the robustness against uncertainty in the imprecise probabilities. This robust-satisficing approach can be developed explicitly to show that the choices of decision-makers should display precisely the preference reversal which Ellsberg observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ben-Haim |first=Yakov |year=2006 |title=Info-gap Decision Theory: Decisions Under Severe Uncertainty |edition=2nd |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-373552-1 |nopp=true |pages=section 11.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible explanation is that this type of game triggers a deceit aversion mechanism. Many humans naturally assume in real-world situations that if they are not told the probability of a certain event, it is to deceive them. People make the same decisions in the [[experiment]] that they would about related but not identical real-life problems where the experimenter would be likely to be a deceiver acting against the subject's interests. When faced with the choice between a red ball and a black ball, the probability of {{sfrac|30|90}} is compared to the ''lower part'' of the {{sfrac|0|90}}–{{sfrac|60|90}} range (the probability of getting a black ball). The average person expects there to be fewer black balls than yellow balls because in most real-world situations, it would be to the advantage of the experimenter to put fewer black balls in the urn when offering such a gamble. On the other hand, when offered a choice between red and yellow balls and black and yellow balls, people assume that there must be fewer than 30 yellow balls as would be necessary to deceive them. When making the decision, it is quite possible that people simply forget to consider that the experimenter does not have a chance to modify the contents of the urn in between the draws. In real-life situations, even if the urn is not to be modified, people would be afraid of being deceived on that front as well.&lt;ref name=lima09&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lima Filho|first1=Roberto IRL|title=Rationality Intertwined: Classical vs Institutional View |date=July 2, 2009|pages=5–6|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2389751|ssrn=2389751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modification of utility theory to incorporate uncertainty as distinct from risk is [[Choquet expected utility]], which also proposes a solution to the paradox.

===Alternative explanations===
Other alternative explanations include the competence hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Preference and Belief: Ambiguity and Competence in Choice under Uncertainty |journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty |volume=4 |year=1991 |pages=5–28 |doi=10.1007/bf00057884|last1 = Heath|first1 = Chip|last2=Tversky |first2=Amos }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comparative ignorance hypothesis.&lt;ref name="FoxTversky1995"/&gt; These theories attribute the source of the ambiguity aversion to the participant's pre-existing knowledge.

{{Republicanism sidebar}}
'''Equality before the law''', also known as '''equality under the law''', '''equality in the eyes of the law''', '''legal equality''', or '''legal egalitarianism''', is the principle that each independent being must be treated equally by the law (principle of [[isonomy]]) and that all are subject to the same laws of justice ([[due process]]).&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the law must guarantee that no individual nor group of individuals should be privileged or discriminated against by the government. Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name="kukathas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="evans" /&gt; This principle arises from various important and complex questions concerning equality, fairness, and [[justice]]. The principle of equality before the law is incompatible and ceases to exist with legal systems such as [[slavery]], [[Indentured servitude|servitude]], [[colonialism]], or [[monarchy]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

Article 7 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) states that "All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|author=|date=|website=www.un.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, everyone must be treated equally under the law regardless of [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[national origin]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[disability]], or other characteristics, without [[privilege (social inequality)|privilege]], [[discrimination]] or [[bias]]. The general guarantee of equality is provided by most of the world's national constitutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;q=Equality|title=Read about "Equality" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but specific implementations of this guarantee vary. For example, while many constitutions guarantee equality regardless of race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=equalgr4|title=Read about "Equality regardless of race" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a few mention the right to equality regardless of nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=equalgr2|title=Read about "Equality regardless of nationality" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] [[Guan Zhong]] (720–645 BC) declared that all persons under the jurisdiction of the ruler are equal before the law.

The 431{{nbsp}}BCE [[Pericles' Funeral Oration|funeral oration]] of [[Pericles]], recorded in [[Thucydides]]'s ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]'', includes a passage praising the equality among the [[slavery in ancient Greece|free]] male citizens of the [[Athenian democracy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences; if to social standing, advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/plpwr10.txt The History of the Peloponnesian War]'', Written 431 BCE, Translated by [[Richard Crawley]] (1874), retrieved via Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ancient times, violent repression of even basic equality was commonplace. Despite the [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|recent overthrow]] of the [[Roman Kingdom|Roman monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[sacrosanct]] [[Tribunes of the Plebs]], [[Cincinnatus]]'s son [[Caeso Quinctius|Caeso]] led a gang that chased plebs from the [[Roman Forum|forum]] to prevent the creation of equitable written laws. In Rome's case, the organization of the plebs and the patricians' dependence upon them as both laborers and soldiers meant the [[Conflict of the Orders]] was resolved by the establishment of the [[Twelve Tables]] and greater equality. Nominally, all [[Roman citizen|citizens]] except the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] were equal under [[Roman law]] in the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]]. However, this principle was not implemented in most of the world and, even in Europe, the rise of [[aristocracy|aristocracies]] and [[nobility]] created unequal legal systems that lasted into the modern era.

==Classical liberalism==
Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law for all persons.&lt;ref name=kukathas&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many Pacqiuo and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed.

Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), p. 61 ({{ISBN|0-691-09993-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism, as embraced by libertarians and modern American conservatives, opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), p. 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Lockean liberalism (the foundation for classical liberalism) is interpreted by others, however, as including social rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. ''Two Treatises of Government.'' Peter Laslett, ed., Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1960 (see "Introduction," pp. 114–26).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Equality before the law is a tenet of some branches of feminism. In the nineteenth century, gender equality before the law was a radical goal, but some later feminist views hold that formal legal equality is not enough to create actual and social equality between women and men. An ideal of formal equality may penalize women for failing to conform to a male norm, while an ideal of different treatment may reinforce sexist stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;Jaggar, Alison. (1994) "Part One: Equality. Introduction." In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ph-2F94pR_0C Living with Contradictions: Controversies in Feminist Social Ethics]''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, prior to serving as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote: "Generalizations about the way women or men are – my life experience bears out – cannot guide me reliably in making decisions about particular individuals. At least in the law, I have found no natural superiority or deficiency in either sex. In class or in grading papers from 1963 to 1980, and now in reading briefs and listening to arguments in court for over seventeen years, I have detected no reliable indicator or distinctly male or surely female thinking – even penmanship.".&lt;ref name=rosen&gt;[[Jeffrey Rosen|Jeff Rosen]], "The Book of Ruth," New Republic, August 2, 1993, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[ACLU]]'s Women's Rights Project in the 1970s, Ginsburg challenged, in ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]]'', the laws that gave health service benefits to wives of servicemen but not to husbands of servicewomen.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dea, Suzanne. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Si6ZVqdOqIgC&amp;pg=PA282 From Suffrage to the Senate: An Encyclopedia of American Women in Politics]'', ABC-CLIO, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 150 national constitutions that currently mention equality regardless of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=equalgr1|title=Read about "Equality regardless of gender" on Constitute|author=|date=|website=constituteproject.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[radical feminists]], however, have opposed equality before the law, because they think that it maintains the weak position of the weak.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Chamallas, "Feminist Constructions of Objectivity: Multiple Perspectives in Sexual and Racial Harassment Litigation," Texas Journal of Women and the Law 1 (1992): pp. 95, 125, 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal matters==
{{Expand section|date=October 2017}}
Article 200 of the [[Criminal Code of Japan]], the penalty regarding [[parricide]], was declared unconstitutional for violating the equality under the law by the [[Supreme Court of Japan]] in 1973.  This was a result of the trial of the [[Tochigi patricide case]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Meryll (2002).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3045">'''Feighner Criteria''' is the informal name given to influential [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria developed at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.

The criteria are named after a psychiatric paper published in 1972 of which John Feighner was the first listed author.&lt;ref&gt;Feighner JP, Robins E, Guze SB, Woodruff RA, Winokur G, Munoz R (1972) Diagnostic criteria for use in psychiatric research. ''Archives of General Psychiatry.'' '''26''': 57-63  {{PMID|5009428}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the most cited article in psychiatry for some time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/essays/v12p321y1989.pdf  A Tribute to Eli &amp; Lee Robbins - Citation Superstars. A Citationist Perspective on Biological Psychiatry - v12p321y1989.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The development of the criteria had been led by a trio of psychiatrists working together on the project for a [[medical model]] of psychiatric diagnosis since the late 1950s: [[Eli Robins]], [[Samuel Guze]] and [[George Winokur]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16527361 Training at Washington University School of Medicine in Psychiatry in the late 1950s, from the perspective of an affective disorder researcher.] Clayton PJ., J Affect Disord. 2006 May;92(1):13-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4AuzzBIKvlIC The Making of DSM-III: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry] Hannah Decker, Oxford University Press, 29 Mar 2013. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen conditions were defined, including primary affective disorders (such as depression), [[schizophrenia]], [[anxiety disorder|anxiety neurosis]] and [[antisocial personality disorder]]. In the early 1970s [[homosexuality]] was considered a psychiatric illness by the medical community, and was also included as one of the fourteen conditions. 

The criteria were expanded in the publication of the [[Research Diagnostic Criteria]] on which many of the criteria of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[DSM_III#DSM-III_.281980.29|DSM III]] (1980) were based, which in turn shaped the [[World Health Organization]]'s ICD manual. "The historical record shows that the small group of individuals who created the Feighner criteria instigated a paradigm shift that has had profound effects on the course of American and, ultimately, world psychiatry."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=102104 The Development of the Feighner Criteria: A Historical Perspective]  Kenneth S.

'''Identity formation''', also known as '''individuation''', is the development of the distinct personality of an [[individual]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Individuation|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/individuation|accessdate=11 October 2012|author=The Free Dictionary|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as a persisting [[entity]] (known as [[personal continuity]]) in a particular stage of life in which individual characteristics are possessed and by which a person is recognized or known (such as the establishment of a [[reputation]]). This process defines individuals to others and [[Self (psychology)|themselves]]. Pieces of the person's actual identity include a sense of continuity, a sense of [[uniqueness]] from others, and a sense of [[need for affiliation|affiliation]]. Identity formation leads to a number of issues of [[personal identity]] and an [[Identity (social science)|identity]] where the individual has some sort of comprehension of themselves as a discrete and separate entity. This may be through [[individuation]] whereby the undifferentiated individual tends to become unique, or undergoes stages through which differentiated facets of a person's life tend toward becoming a more indivisible whole.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Identity is often described as finite and consisting of separate and distinct parts (family, cultural, personal, professional, etc.), yet according to Parker J. Palmer, it is an ever-evolving core within where our genetics (biology), culture, loved ones, those we cared for, people who have harmed us and people we have harmed, the deeds done (good and ill) to self and others, experiences lived, and choices made come together to form who we are at this moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmer|first=P. J.|title=The heart of a teacher: Identity and integrity in teaching|year=2008|url=http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/events/afc99/articles/heartof.pdf|accessdate=October 1, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105062059/http://www.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/events/afc99/articles/heartof.pdf|archivedate=January 5, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Many theories of development have aspects of identity formation included in them. Two theories stand out in regards to this topic{{Why?|date=August 2017}}: [[Erik Erikson]]'s theory of psychosocial development (specifically the "identity versus role confusion" stage of his theory) and [[James Marcia]]'s identity status theory.

===Erikson===
Erikson's belief is that throughout each person's lifetime, they experience different crises or conflicts. Each of the conflicts arises at a certain point in life and must be successfully resolved for progression to the next of the eight stages. The particular stage relevant to identity formation takes place during adolescence, called "Identity versus Role Confusion."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Identity: Youth and Crisis|last = Erikson|first = Erik H.|publisher = Norton|year = 1968|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Identity versus Role Confusion" stage consists of adolescents trying to figure out who they are in order to form a basic identity that they will build on throughout their life, especially concerning social and occupational identities. They face the complexities of determining one's own identity. Erikson said this crisis is resolved with identity achievement, the point at which an individual has extensively considered various goals and values, accepting some and rejecting others, and understands who they are as a unique person.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span, Second Edition|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an adolescent has attained identity achievement, they are ready to enter the next stage of Erikson's theory "Intimacy versus Isolation" where they will form strong friendships and a sense of companionship with others. If the "Identity versus Role Confusion" crisis is not solved, an adolescent will face confusion about future plans, particularly their roles in adulthood. Failure to form one's own identity leads to failure to form a shared identity with others, which could lead to instability in many areas as an adult. The identity formation stage of Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development is a crucial stage in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Marcia===
James Marcia created a structural [[interview]] designed to classify adolescents into one of four statuses of identity. The identity statuses are used to describe and pinpoint the progression of an adolescent's identity formation process. In James Marcia's theory, the operational definition of identity is whether an individual has explored various alternatives and made firm commitments to: an [[Job (role)|occupation]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation]] and a set of [[political]] values.

The four identity statuses in James Marcia's theory are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Development and validation of egoidentity status|last = Marcia|first = James E.|date = 1966|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = |doi = 10.1037/h0023281 |pmid = 5939604|volume=3 |pages=551–558}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Identity Diffusion'' (also known as'' Role Confusion''): This is the opposite of identity achievement. The individual has not yet resolved their identity crisis, failing to commit to any goals or values and establish future life direction. In adolescents, this stage is characterized by disorganized thinking, procrastination, and avoidance of issues and action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Identity Foreclosure'': This occurs when teenagers accept traditional values and cultural norms, rather than determining their own values. In other words, the person conforms to an identity without exploration as to what really suits them best. For instance, teenagers might follow the values and roles of their parents or cultural norms. They might also foreclose on a negative identity, the direct opposite of their parent's values or cultural norms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Identity Moratorium'': This postpones identity achievement by providing temporary shelter. This status provides opportunities for exploration, either in breadth or in depth. Examples of moratoria common in American society include college or the military.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Identity Achievement'': This status is attained when the person has solved the identity issues by making commitments to goals, beliefs and values after extensive exploration of different areas.

==Self-concept==
[[Self-concept]] or self-identity is the sum of a being's knowledge and understanding of their self. The self-concept is different from [[self-consciousness]], which is an awareness of one's self. Components of the self-concept include physical, psychological, and social attributes, which can be influenced by the individual's attitudes, habits, beliefs and ideas. These components and attributes can not be condensed to the general concepts of [[self-image]] and [[self-esteem]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as different types of identity coming together in one person. These types of identity can be broken down into the following.

===Cultural identity===
{{Main|Cultural identity}}

Cultural identity is the (feeling of) identity of a group or culture, or of an individual as far as they are influenced by their belonging to a group or culture. Cultural identity is similar to and has overlaps with, but is not synonymous with, [[identity politics]]. There are modern questions of culture that are transferred into questions of identity. Historical culture also influences individual identity, and as with modern cultural identity, individuals may pick and choose aspects of cultural identity, while rejecting or disowning other associated ideas.

=== Professional identity ===
[[Professional identification|Professional identity]] is the identification with a [[profession]], exhibited by an aligning of [[role]]s, [[Professional responsibility|responsibilities]], [[Value (ethics)|values]], and [[ethical standards]] as accepted by the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goltz|first=Heather Honoré|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew Lee|date=2014-11-01|title=Forming and Developing Your Professional Identity Easy as PI|url=http://hpp.sagepub.com/content/15/6/785|journal=Health Promotion Practice|language=en|volume=15|issue=6|pages=785–789|doi=10.1177/1524839914541279|issn=1524-8399|pmid=25015568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic and national identity===
An [[ethnic identity]] is the identification with a certain [[ethnicity]], usually on the basis of a presumed common genealogy or ancestry. Recognition by others as a distinct ethnic group is often a contributing factor to developing this bond of identification. Ethnic groups are also often united by common cultural, behavioral, linguistic, ritualistic, or religious traits.

Processes that result in the emergence of such identification are summarised as ethnogenesis. Various cultural studies and social theory investigate the question of cultural and ethnic identities. Cultural identity remarks upon: place, gender, race, history, nationality, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and ethnicity.

[[National identity]] is an ethical and philosophical concept whereby all humans are divided into groups called nations. Members of a "nation" share a common identity, and usually a common origin, in the sense of ancestry, parentage or descent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Religious identity===
A [[religious identity]] is the set of beliefs and practices generally held by an individual, involving adherence to codified beliefs and rituals and study of ancestral or cultural traditions, writings, history, and mythology, as well as faith and mystic experience. The term "religious identity" refers to the personal practices related to communal faith and to rituals and communication stemming from such conviction.  This identity formation begins with association in the parents' religious contacts, and individuation requires that the person chooses to the same—or different—religious identity than that of their parents.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

===Gender identity===
In sociology, [[gender identity]] describes the gender with which a person identifies (i.e., whether one perceives oneself to be a man, a woman, outside of the gender binary, etc.), but can also be used to refer to the gender that other people attribute to the individual on the basis of what they know from gender role indications (social behavior, clothing, hair style, etc.). Gender identity may be affected by a variety of social structures, including the person's ethnic group, employment status, religion or irreligion, and family.

===Disability identity===
Disability identity refers to the particular disabilities with which an individual identifies. This may be something as obvious as a paraplegic person identifying as such, or something less prominent such as an Deaf person regarding themselves as part of a local, national, or global community of Deaf People Culture.

Disability identity is almost always determined by the particular disabilities that an individual is born with, however it may change later in life if an individual later becomes disabled or when an individual later discovers a previously overlooked disability (particularly applicable to mental disorders), and in some rare cases it may be influenced by exposure to disabled people as with [[BIID]].

==Interpersonal identity development==
[[Interpersonal relationship|Social relation]] can refer to a multitude of social interactions, regulated by social norms, between two or more people, with each having a social position and performing a social role. In sociological hierarchy, [[social relation]] is more advanced than behavior, action, social behavior, social action, social contact and social interaction. Social relations form the basis of concepts such as social organization, social structure, social movement and social system.

Interpersonal identity development is composed of three elements: 
* Categorisation: Labeling others (and ourselves) into categories. (Tajfel &amp; Turner,1986) 
* Identification: Associating others with certain [[Group (sociology)|groups]].
* Comparison: Comparing groups.
Interpersonal identity development allows an individual to question and examine various personality elements, such as ideas, beliefs, and behaviors. The actions or thoughts of others create social influences that change an individual. Examples of social influence can be seen in socialisation and peer pressure. This is the effect of other people on a person's behavior, thinking about one's Self, and subsequent acceptance or rejection of how other people attempt to influence the individual.  Interpersonal identity development occurs during exploratory self-analysis and self-evaluation, ending at various times with the establishment of an easy-to-understand and consolidative sense of self or identity.

===Interaction===
{{main|Hegelian dialectic}}

During the interpersonal identity development an exchange of propositions and counter-propositions occurs, resulting in a qualitative transformation of the individual in the direction of the interaction.  The aim of the interpersonal identity development is to try to resolve the undifferentiated facets of an individual. The individual's existence is undifferentiated but this, upon examination, is found to be indistinguishable from others. Given this, and with other admissions, the individual is led to a contradiction between self and others, thus forcing the withdrawal of the undifferentiated self as a truth. In resolution of this incongruence, the person integrates or rejects the encountered elements.  This process results in a new identity. During each of these exchanges which human beings encounter as they go through life, the person must resolve the exchange and then face future exchanges. The exchanges are recurring, since the changing world constantly presents exchanges between individuals and thus allows individuals to redefine themselves.

===Collective identity===
The term [[collective identity]] is a sense of belonging to a group (the collective) that is so strong that a person who identifies with the group will dedicate their life to the group over individual identity: they will defend the views of the group and assume risks for the group, sometimes as great as loss of life. The cohesiveness of the collective goes beyond community, as the collective suffers the pain of grief from the loss of a member.

===Social support===
Individuals gain a [[social identity]] and [[group identity]] by their affiliation. This is from membership in various groups. These groups include, among various categories,: 
{{Colbegin|colwidth=25em}}
* [[family]] 
* [[ethnic]] 
* [[education]] and [[Job (role)|occupational]] status&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hurd | first1 = E | year = 2010 | title = Confessions of Belonging: My Emotional Journey as a Medical Translator | url = | journal = Qualitative Inquiry | volume = 16 | issue = 10| pages = 783–791 | doi = 10.1177/1077800410383117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[friendship]] 
* [[dating]]
* [[religion]]
{{colend}}

===Family===
One of the most important affiliations is that  of their family, whether they be biological, extended or even adoptive families.  Each has their own influence on identity through the interaction that takes place between the family members and with the individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grotevant | first1 = H. D. | year = 1997 | title = Family processes, identity development, and behavioral outcomes for adopted adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 139–161 | doi=10.1177/0743554897121008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Information regarding possible identities of possible selves comes from various contexts that surround adolescents and temporal commitments are tested and practiced in interaction with others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goossens | first1 = L | year = 2008 | title = Dynamics of perceived parenting and identity formation in late adolescence | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 31 | issue = 2| pages = 165–184 | doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2007.04.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers and theorists basically state that an individual's identity(more specifically an adolescent's identity) is influenced by the people around them and the environment in which they live. Also if a family does not have integration this seems to help create identity diffusion (this is one of [[James Marcia]]'s 4 identity statuses, meaning that an individual has not made commitments and does not try to make commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L. (2008). Adolescence. Boston: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;)  This is true for both males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Willemsen | first1 =  | last2 = Waterman | first2 = K. | year = 1991 | title = EGO IDENTITY STATUS AND FAMILY ENVIRONMENT: A CORRELATIONAL STUDY | url = | journal = Psychological Reports | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 1203–1212 | doi = 10.2466/pr0.1991.69.3f.1203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts prove that a family has influence on an individual no matter if the influence be good or bad.

===Peer relationships===
The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of same-sex friendships in the development of one's identity. This study involved the use of 24 same-sex college student friendship triads, consisting of 12 males and 12 females, with a total of 72 participants. Each triad was required to have known each other for a minimum of six months. A qualitative method was chosen, as it is the most appropriate in assessing development of identity. Semi-structured group interviewers took place, where the students were asked to reflect on stories and experiences with relationship problems. The results showed 5 common responses when assessing these relationship problems. The responses involved joking about the relationship problems, providing support, offering advice, relating others' experiences to their own similar experiences, and providing encouragement. The results concluded that adolescents are actively constructing their identities through common themes of conversation between same-sex friendships, in this case, involving relationship issues. The common themes of conversation that close peers seem to engage in, help to further their identity formation in life.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Elizabeth M. &amp; Korobov, Neill. (2011).

Friends About Dating Relationships. "Journal of Adolescence".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on identity==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
There is an abundant amount of influences on identity formation. Some of which have already been touched on in other sections of this article. Among the many influences, four influences stand out to be especially important. Those include: [[cognitive]] influences, [[School|scholastic]] influences, [[sociocultural]] influences and [[parenting]] influences.

===Cognitive influences===
Cognitive development influences identity formation. When adolescents are able to think abstractly and reason logically they have an easier time exploring and contemplating possible identities. When an adolescent has advanced cognitive development and maturity they tend to resolve identity issues more so than age mates that are less cognitively developed. When identity issues are solved quicker and better, there is more time and effort put into developing that identity. Having a solid identity earlier is a preferred situation and is one of the first steps in forming the desired life and goals of the individual.

===Scholastic influences===
Adolescents that have a post-secondary education tend to make more concrete goals and stable occupational commitments. So going to college or university can influence identity formation in a productive way. Of course, the opposite can also be true, where identity influences education and academics. The two can influence each other, ultimately forming identity in the process. Education's effect on identity can be beneficial for the individual's identity; the individual will be getting educated on different approaches and paths to take in the process of identity formation. Ultimately scholastics are important for our brains as well as our identities.

===Sociocultural influences===
Sociocultural influences are those of a broader social and historical context. For example, in the past, adolescents would likely just adopt the job, religious beliefs, etc. that was expected of them or that were the same as their parents. In a society like today's, adolescents have more resources to explore identity choices as well as more options for commitments. This influence is becoming less significant due to the growing acceptance of identity options that were once less accepted. Also, more of the identity options from the past are becoming unrecognized and less popular today. The changing sociocultural situation is forcing individuals to develop a unique identity based on their own aspirations. Sociocultural influences are playing a different role identity formation now than they have in the past. However, it still affects identity, just in a different way.

===Parenting influences===
The type of relationship that adolescents have with their parents has a significant role in identity formation. For example, when there is a solid and positive relationship between parent and adolescent they are more likely to feel freedom in exploring identity options for themselves. A study found that for boys and girls, identity formation is positively influenced by parental involvement specifically in the areas of: support, social monitoring and school monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Sartor, Carolyn E. &amp; Youniss, James. (2002). The relationship between positive parental involvement and identity achievement during adolescence. ''Adolescence, 37, 221-234''.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, when the relationship is not as close and the adolescent fears rejection from the parent, they are more likely to feel less confident in forming a separate identity from their parent(s).{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} These are just examples; of course there are other outcomes possible in adolescent identity formation when examining the parenting as well as the parent-child relationship.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== Cyber-socializing and the Internet ===
{{See also|Online identity|Cyberpsychology|Sociology of the Internet}}
The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, [[image]] or [[video]] they [[upload]], they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of identity construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In business ==
In business, a professional identity is the "persona" of a professional which is designed to accord with and facilitate the attainment of business objectives. A professional identity comes into being when there is a philosophy which is manifest in a distinct corporate culture - the corporate personality. A business professional is a person in a profession with certain types of skills that sometimes requires formal training or education.

The [[career development]] of an individual focuses on how individuals manage their careers within and between organisations and how organisations structure the career progress of their members, and can be tied into succession planning within some organizations.

Within the business realm and many careers is the role of management. Management tasks enhance leadership, by creating an environment where all team members know and assume responsibility for their roles. Employees' self-concept and affiliation are often aligned with their roles in the organization.

''Training'' is a form of identity setting, since it has not only effects on knowledge, but also affects the team member's self-concept. Knowledge, on the other hand, of the position introduces a new path of less effort to the trainee, which prolong the effects of training and promote a stronger self-concept. Other forms of identity setting in an Organization include ''Business Cards'', ''Specific Benefits by Role'', and ''Task Forwarding''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salvador, José]] (2009). MBA CookBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''illusory truth effect''' (also known as the '''validity effect''', '''truth effect''' or the '''reiteration effect''') is the tendency to believe information to be correct after repeated exposure.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Truth Effect and Other Processing Fluency Miracles|url=http://scienceblogs.com/mixingmemory/2007/09/18/the-truth-effect-and-other-pro/|website=Science Blogs|publisher=Science Blogs|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was first identified in a 1977 study at [[Villanova University]] and [[Temple University]].&lt;ref name="Hasher1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PLOS ONE"&gt;{{cite journal|title=People with Easier to Pronounce Names Promote Truthiness of Claims|journal=PLOS ONE|date=September 6, 2014|url=http://www.oalib.com/references/8155256|accessdate=29 December 2016|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0088671}}&lt;/ref&gt; When truth is assessed, people rely on whether the information is in line with their understanding or if it feels familiar. The first condition is logical as people compare new information with what they already know to be true. Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new, unrepeated, statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful. The illusory truth effect has also been linked to "hindsight bias", in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth has been received.

In a 2015 study, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality and that repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can affect the hearer's beliefs.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt; Researchers attributed the illusory truth effect's impact on participants who knew the correct answer to begin with, but were persuaded to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood, to "[[processing fluency]]".

The illusory truth effect plays a significant role in such fields as [[election campaigns]], [[advertising]], [[news media]], and [[propaganda|political propaganda]].

==Initial study==

The effect was first named and defined following the results in a study from 1977 at [[Villanova University]] and [[Temple University]] where participants were asked to rate a series of trivia statements as true or false.&lt;ref name="Hasher1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasher |first1=Lynn |last2=Goldstein |first2=David |last3=Toppino |first3=Thomas |title=Frequency and the conference of referential validity |journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior |date=1977 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=107–112 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5371(77)80012-1 |url=http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515062305/http://www.psych.utoronto.ca/users/hasher/PDF/Frequency%20and%20the%20conference%20Hasher%20et%20al%201977.pdf |archivedate=2016-05-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt; On three occasions, Lynn Hasher, David Goldstein, and Thomas Toppino presented the same group of college students with lists of sixty plausible statements, some of them true and some of them false. The second list was distributed two weeks after the first, and the third two weeks after that. Twenty statements appeared on all three lists; the other forty items on each list were unique to that list. Participants were asked how confident they were of the truth or falsity of the statements, which concerned matters about which they were unlikely to know anything. (For example, "The first air force base was launched in New Mexico." Or "[[Basketball]] became an Olympic discipline in 1925.") Specifically, the participants were asked to grade their belief in the truth of each statement on a scale of one to seven. While the participants' confidence in the truth of the non-repeated statements remained steady, their confidence in the truth of the repeated statements increased from the first to the second and second to third sessions, with an average score for those items rising from 4.2 to 4.6 to 4.7. The conclusion made by the researchers, who were from Villanova and Temple universities, was that repeating a statement makes it more likely to appear factual.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hasher1977" /&gt;

In 1989, Hal R. Arkes, Catherine Hackett, and Larry Boehm replicated the original study, with similar results showing that exposure to false information changes the perceived truthfulness and plausibility of that information.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Polage|first1=Danielle|title=Making up History: False Memories of Fake News Stories|journal=Europe's Journal of Psychology|date=May 31, 2012|volume=8|pages=245–250|doi=10.5964/ejop.v8i2.456|url=http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/viewFile/456/pdf|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect works because when people assess truth, they rely on whether the information agrees with their understanding or whether it feels familiar. The first condition is logical as people compare new information with what they already know to be true and consider the credibility of both sources. However, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality—so much so that repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can have a paradoxical effect.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

==Relation to other phenomena==
===Processing fluency===
At first, the truth effect was  believed to occur only when individuals are highly uncertain about a given statement.&lt;ref name="Science Blogs"/&gt; Psychologists also assumed that "outlandish" headlines wouldn't produce this effect however, recent research shows the illusory truth effect is indeed at play with false news.&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt; This assumption was challenged by the results of a 2015 study by Lisa K. Fazio, Nadia M. Brasier, B. Keith Payne, and Elizabeth J. Marsh. Published in the ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology]]'', the study suggested that the truth effect can influence participants who actually knew the correct answer to begin with, but who were swayed to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood. For example, when participants encountered on multiple occasions the statement "A sari is the name of the short plaid skirt worn by Scots," some of them were likely to come to believe it was true, even though these same people were able to correctly answer the question "What is the name of the short pleated skirt worn by Scots?"

After replicating these results in another experiment, Fazio and her team attributed this curious phenomenon to "[[processing fluency]]", a term that describes the facility with which people comprehend statements. "Repetition," explained the researcher, "makes statements easier to process (i.e. fluent) relative to new statements, leading people to the (sometimes) false conclusion that they are more truthful."&lt;ref name="Fazio2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fazio |first1=Lisa K. |last2=Brashier |first2=Nadia M. |last3=Payne |first3=B.

===Hindsight bias===
In a 1997 study, Ralph Hertwig, [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], and Ulrich Hoffrage linked the truth effect to the phenomenon known as "[[hindsight bias]]", described as a situation in which the recollection of confidence is skewed after the truth or falsity has been received. They have described the truth effect (which they call "the reiteration effect") as a subset of hindsight bias.&lt;ref name="Hertwig"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertwig|first1=Ralph|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=Gerd|last3=Hoffrage|first3=Ulrich|title=The Reiteration Effect in Hindsight Bias|journal=Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition|date=1997|url=https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/volltexte/institut/dok/full/hertwig/hrreipr__/hrreipr__.html|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other studies==
In a 1979 study, participants were told that repeated statements were no more likely to be true than unrepeated ones. Despite this warning, the participants perceived repeated statements as being more true than unrepeated ones.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;

Studies in 1981 and 1983 showed that information deriving from recent experience tends to be viewed as "more fluent and familiar" than new experience. A 2011 study by Jason D. Ozubko and Jonathan Fugelsang built on this finding by demonstrating that, generally speaking, information retrieved from memory is "more fluent or familiar than when it was first learned" and thus produces an illusion of truth. The effect grew even more pronounced when statements were repeated twice and yet more pronounced when they were repeated four times. The researchers thus concluded that memory retrieval is a powerful method for increasing the so-called validity of statements and that the illusion of truth is an effect that can be observed without directly polling the factual statements in question.&lt;ref name="University of Waterloo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozubko|first1=JD|last2=Fugelsang|first2=J|title=Remembering makes evidence compelling: retrieval from memory can give rise to the illusion of truth.|journal=University of Waterloo|date=January 2011|doi=10.1037/a0021323|pmid=21058878|volume=37|pages=270–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1992 study by Ian Maynard Begg, Ann Anas, and Suzanne Farinacci suggested that a statement will seem true if the information seems familiar.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;

A 2012 experiment by Danielle C. Polage showed that some participants exposed to false news stories would go on to have false memories. The conclusion was that repetitive false claims increase believability and may also result in errors.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox"/&gt;

In a 2014 study, Eryn J. Newman, Mevagh Sanson, Emily K. Miller, Adele Quigley-McBride, Jeffrey L. Foster, Daniel M. Bernstein, and [[Maryanne Garry]] asked participants to judge the truth of statements attributed to various people, some of whose names were easier to pronounce than others. Consistently, statements by persons with easily pronounced names were viewed as being more truthful than those with names that were harder to pronounce. The researchers' conclusion was that subjective, tangential properties can matter when people evaluate sourced information.&lt;ref name="PLOS ONE"/&gt;

==Examples==
Although the truth effect has been demonstrated scientifically only in recent years, it is a phenomenon with which people have been familiar for millennia. One study notes that the Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] closed each of his speeches with a call to destroy [[Carthage]] ("''[[Carthago delenda est|Ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam]]''"), knowing that the repetition would breed agreement, and that [[Napoleon]] reportedly "said that there is only one figure in rhetoric of serious importance, namely, repetition", whereby a repeated affirmation fixes itself in the mind "in such a way that it is accepted in the end as a demonstrated truth". Others who have taken advantage of the truth effect have included [[Quintilian]], [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Marcus Antonius]] in [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.&lt;ref name="Hertwig" /&gt;

The truth effect plays a significant role in various fields of activity. During [[election campaigns]], false information about a candidate, if repeated in [[TV commercials]], can cause the public to believe it. Similarly, advertising that repeats unfounded claims about a product may boost sales because some viewers may come to think that they heard the claims from an objective source.&lt;ref name="Europe's Journal of Psychology"/&gt; The truth effect is also used in news media and is a staple of political propaganda.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dreyfuss|first1=Emily|title=Want to Make a Lie Seem True?

An '''invasive species''' is a species that is not native to a specific location (an [[introduced species]]), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ecosystem Consequences of Biological Invasions |author=Joan G.

The term is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for [[noxious weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plant Council]. p. 1. accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kudzu|kudzu vine]] (''Pueraria lobata''), [[Cortaderia jubata|Andean pampas grass]] (''Cortaderia jubata''), and [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis'') are examples.

Dispersal and subsequent proliferation of species is not solely an anthropogenic phenomenon. There are many mechanisms by which species from all Kingdoms have been able to travel across continents in short periods of time such as via floating rafts, or on wind currents. Charles Darwin performed many experiments to better understand long distance seed dispersal, and was able to germinate seeds from insect frass, faeces of waterfowl, dirt clods on the feet of birds, all of which may have traveled significant distances under their own power, or be blown off course by thousands of miles.

Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio-regions is a natural phenomenon, which has likely been accelerated via hominid-assisted migration although this has not been adequately directly measured.

The definition of "native" is controversial in that there is no way to precisely determine nativity. For example, the ancestors of Equus ferus (modern horses) evolved in North America and radiated to Eurasia before becoming locally extinct. Upon returning to North America in 1493 during their hominid-assisted migration, it is debatable as to whether they were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.

==Causes==
Scientists include species and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that, when combined, establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.

===Species based mechanisms===
While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete [[native species]]. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.

Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers. One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.&lt;ref name="kolar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kolar |first=C.S. |author2=D.M.

Typically, an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location.&lt;ref name="tilm"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tilman|first=D. |year=2004

Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment (also known as a high [[propagule pressure]]).&lt;ref name="verl"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Verling|first=E. |author2=G.M.

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as [[nutrient]]s, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great [[Competition (biology)|competition]] or [[predation]], then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly. Ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as [[zero-sum]] systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such [[unilateral]] competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule.&lt;ref name="stoh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |author2= D.

An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long [[taproot]], or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass (''[[Aegilops triuncialis]]'') was introduced to [[California]] on [[serpentine soil]]s, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high [[magnesium]]/[[calcium]] ratio, and possible [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huenneke |first=L. |author2=S.

Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds, modifying [[abiotic]] factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, creating a positive or negative impact on other species. Some species, like ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Kalanchoe daigremontana]]'', produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic compounds]], that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species, and influence some soil processes like carbon and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="HERRERAFERRER-PARIS2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HERRERA|first1=Ileana|last2=FERRER-PARIS|first2=José R.|last3=BENZO|first3=Diana|last4=FLORES|first4=Saúl|last5=GARCÍA|first5=Belkis|last6=NASSAR|first6=Jafet M.|title=An Invasive Succulent Plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) Influences Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Mineralization in a Neotropical Semiarid Zone|journal=Pedosphere|volume=28|issue=4|year=2018|pages=632–643|issn=1002-0160|doi=10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species like ''[[Stapelia gigantea]]'' [[ecological facilitation|facilitates]] the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrera|first1=Ileana|last2=Ferrer-Paris|first2=José R.|last3=Hernández-Rosas|first3=José I.|last4=Nassar|first4=Jafet M.|title=Impact of two invasive succulents on native-seedling recruitment in Neotropical arid environments|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=2016|volume=132|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.04.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301927334|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples are ''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'' (yellow starthistle) and ''Centaurea diffusa'' ([[diffuse knapweed]]). These [[Eastern Europe]]an [[noxious weed]]s have spread through the [[Western United States|western]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast states]]. Experiments show that [[8-hydroxyquinoline]], a chemical produced at the root of ''C. diffusa'', has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. ''C. diffusa'' and ''C. solstitialis'' do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others. Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hierro |first=J.L. |author2=R.M. Callaway |year=2003 |title=Allelopathy and exotic plant invasion |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1026208327014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vivanco|first=J.M. |last2=Bais |first2=H.P. |last3=Stermitz |first3=F.R. |last4=Thelen |first4=G.C. |last5=Callaway |first5=R.M. |year=2004 |title=Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: Novel weapons and exotic invasion |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7|issue=4 |pages= 285–292 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by providing large amounts of dry [[detritus]] during the fire season in western North America. In areas where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing ''B. tectorum'' to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt; |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=42480&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species. For example, [[zebra mussel]]s increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which [[invertebrate]]s live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]], increases the density and diversity of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrate communities.&lt;ref name="silv"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Silver Botts |first=P. |last2=Patterson |first2=B.A. |last3=Schlosser |first3=D. |year=1996 |title=Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |volume= |issue=15 |pages= 179–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystem-based mechanisms===
In [[ecosystem]]s, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance, which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |year=2002 |title=Impact of non-indigenous species on natives enhanced by anthropogenic alteration of selection regimes |journal=Oikos |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=449–458 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970316.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When changes such as a [[forest fire]] occur, normal succession favors native [[grass]]es and [[forb]]s. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing them out. [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are often the limiting factors in these situations.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis|first=M.A. |last2=Grime |first2=J.P. |last3=Thompson |first3=K. |year=2000 |title=Fluctuating resources in plant communities: A general theory of invisibility |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=528–534 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00473.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every species occupies a ''[[Ecological niche|niche]]'' in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology|last=Fath|first=Brian D.|publisher=Elsevier Science; 1 edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0444520333|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type can be found within the ''[[Lampropholis delicata]]'' species of skink.

Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example, [[edge effect]]s describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alverson|first=William S.|last2=Waller|first2=Donald M.|last3=Solheim|first3=Stephen L.|date=1988|title=Forests Too Deer: Edge Effects in Northern Wisconsin|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00199.x|jstor=2386294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments. When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Cheng-Yuan|last2=Tang|first2=Shaoqing|last3=Fatemi|first3=Mohammad|last4=Gross|first4=Caroline L.|last5=Julien|first5=Mic H.|last6=Curtis|first6=Caitlin|last7=van Klinken|first7=Rieks D.|date=2015-09-01|title=Population structure and genetic diversity of invasive Phyla canescens: implications for the evolutionary potential|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=1–21|doi=10.1890/ES14-00374.1|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt; the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance. This conversion can actually lead to increased variance in the founding populations which then allows for rapid adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name="Prentis 2008 288-294"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Prentis |first= Peter |title= Adaptive evolution in invasive species |journal= Trends in Plant Science |volume= 13|issue= 6 |pages= 288–294 |doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2008.03.004 |pmid= 18467157 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following invasion events, selection may initially act on the capacity to disperse as well as physiological tolerance to the new stressors in the environment. Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment. These responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change, or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey.&lt;ref name="Eunmi 2002 386-391"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lee |first= Carol Eunmi | title= Evolutionary genetics of invasive species |journal= Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume= 17 |issue= 8 |pages= 386–391 | doi = 10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02554-5 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations include changes in morphology, physiology, phenology, and plasticity.

Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment. Intraspecific phenotypic plasticity, pre-adaptation and post-introduction evolution are all major factors in adaptive evolution.&lt;ref name="Zenni 2013 635-644"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Zenni |first= R.D. |title= Adaptive Evolution and Phenotypic Plasticity During Naturalization and Spread of Invasive Species: Implications for Tree Invasion Biology |journal= Biological Invasions |volume= 16 |issue= 3 |pages= 635–644 |doi=10.1007/s10530-013-0607-8 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasticity in populations allows room for changes to better suit the individual in its environment. This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This, in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive.

==Ecology==
===Traits of invaded ecosystems===
In 1958, Charles S. Elton&lt;ref name="elton"&gt;{{cite book |last= Elton|first=C.S. |others=Foreword by Daniel Simberloff |title=The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants |origyear=1958 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-20638-7 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that ecosystems with higher [[species diversity]] were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches. Other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse, but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |last2=Binkley |first2=D. |last3=Chong |first3=G.W. |last4=Kalkhan |first4=M.A. |last5=Schell |first5=L.D. |last6=Bull |first6=K.A. |last7=Otsuki |first7=Y. |last8=Newman |first8=G. |last9=Bashkin |first9=M. |last10=Son |first10=Y. |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0025:EPSIHS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate hinged on the [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scale]] at which invasion studies were performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives' ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |author2=E.G.

Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem.&lt;ref name="tilm"/&gt;

===Vectors===
Non-native species have many ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s'', including biogenic vectors,&lt;!--what is a biogenic vector?--&gt; but most invasions are associated with human activity. Natural [[Range (biology)|range]] extensions are common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassey |first= P |author2=T.M.

[[File:EriocheirSinensis1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis'')]]
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for [[horticulture]]. The [[pet trade]] moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles.

The arrival of invasive [[propagule]]s to a new site is a function of the site's invasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leung |first=B. |author2=N.E. Mandrak  |year=2007 |title= The risk of establishment of aquatic invasive species: joining invasibility and propagule pressure |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=274 |pages=2733–2739|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2007.0841 |pmid=17711834 |issue=1625 |pmc=2275890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at home," American colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands. In 2008, U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles. [[Agricultural Research Service]] entomologists identified them as [[rhinoceros beetle]], [[hercules beetle]], and [[Phalacrognathus muelleri|king stag beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan10/insects0110.htm |title=Our Invaluable Invertebrate Collections |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these species were not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems.&lt;!--were they actually invasive or just non-native?--&gt; To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] programs such as [[Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance]] (SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.

Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, are essential to the ecosystem of that area. If they are removed from the location it could be harmful to that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zavaleta|first1=Erika|last2=Hobbs|first2=Richard|last3=Mooney|first3=Harold|title=Viewing invasive species removal in a whole-ecosystem context|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=August 2001|volume=16|issue=8|page=458|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/invasivesseminar_readings/Zavaleta_etal_2001.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02194-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable [[Chinese mitten crab]] is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marine Pollution and Climate Change|last=Seinfeld|first=John H.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==== Within the Aquatic Environment ====
The development of maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms are transported within the ocean. Two ways marine organisms are transported to new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar|first=Jennifer L|last2=Gamboa|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Revenga|first3=Carmen|last4=Spalding|first4=Mark D|date=2008|title=Assessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=485–492|doi=10.1890/070064|issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1010 Discharging ballast water.jpg|thumb|Cargo ship de-ballasting]]
Many marine organisms have the capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls. Therefore, these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=John|date=2007|title=Hull fouling is a risk factor for intercontinental species exchange in aquatic ecosystems|journal=Aquatic Invasions|volume=2|issue=2|pages=121–131|doi=10.3391/ai.2007.2.2.7|issn=1818-5487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, California and New Zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gard.no/web/updates/content/24305557/biofouling-moves-up-the-regulatory-agenda.|title=Biofouling moves up the regulatory agenda - GARD|website=www.gard.no|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main vector for the transport of non-native aquatic species is ballast water. [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|Ballast water]] taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Invasive species#cite%20note-MolnarGamboa2008-43|[47]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Xu|first=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|date=2014-08-24|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data: data mining for social good|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623330.2623364|publisher=ACM|pages=1699–1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364|isbn=9781450329569}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that 10,000 different species, many of which are non-indigenous, are transported via ballast water each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Streftaris|first=N|last2=Zenetos|first2=Argyro|last3=Papathanassiou|first3=Enangelos|date=2005|title=Globalisation in marine ecosystems: The story of non-indigenous marine species across European seas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253862066|journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology|volume=43|pages=419–453|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively impact their new environment. For example, freshwater [[zebra mussel]]s, native to the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Sea of Azov|Azov seas]], most likely reached the [[Great Lakes]] via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms for oxygen and food, such as algae. Although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988, and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter, the plan had a serious flaw or loophole, whereby ships loaded with cargo when they reached the [[St. Lawrence Seaway|Seaway]] were not tested because their ballast water tanks were empty. However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port (when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/98880204.html/|title=Noxious cargo|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current regulations for the Great Lakes rely on ‘salinity shock’ to kill freshwater organisms left in ballast tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/GLC-BW-Reg-Summary-11.14.16.pdf|title=Status of Ballast Water Discharge Regulations in the Great Lakes Region|last=Great Lake Commission|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10-50 micron size class. For organisms between 10 and 50 microns, such as certain types of phytoplankton, current regulations allow less than 10 cells per milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/5ps/NVIC/2018/NVIC-01_18.pdf|title=Ballast Water Management for Control of Non-Indigenous Species in Waters of the United States|last=USCG|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discharge gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so the discharged water is not necessarily the same as the receiving body of water. Since many species of phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce asexually, only one cell released into the environment could exponentially grow into many thousands of cells over a short amount of time. This loophole could have detrimental effects to the environment. For example, some species in the genus ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic acid, a neurotoxin. If toxic ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' spp. are alive in ballast discharge and get released into their “new environment” they could cause domoic acid poisoning in shellfish, marine mammals and birds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trainer|first=Vera L.|last2=Bates|first2=Stephen S.|last3=Lundholm|first3=Nina|last4=Thessen|first4=Anne E.|last5=Cochlan|first5=William P.|last6=Adams|first6=Nicolaus G.|last7=Trick|first7=Charles G.|date=2012|title=Pseudo-nitzschia physiological ecology, phylogeny, toxicity, monitoring and impacts on ecosystem health|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=14|pages=271–300|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2011.10.025|issn=1568-9883|hdl=1912/5118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, human deaths related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in Canada in 1987.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future ramifications associated with the potential release of toxic and invasive phytoplankton.

Another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is the role of environmental changes associated with climate change, such as an increase in ocean temperature. There have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Occhipinti-Ambrogi|first=Anna|date=2007|title=Global change and marine communities: Alien species and climate change|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=55|issue=7–9|pages=342–352|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.014|pmid=17239404|issn=0025-326X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahel|first=Frank J.|last2=Olden|first2=Julian D.|date=2008|title=Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have detrimental effects on the environment as new species interactions emerge. For example, Hua and Hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from the temperature zone through tropical waters can experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=J.|last2=Hwang|first2=W.H.|date=2012|title=Effects of voyage routing on the survival of microbes in ballast water|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=42|pages=165–175|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.01.013|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further examine the effects of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water, Lenz et al. (2018) carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress experiment. Their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Mark|last2=Ahmed|first2=Yasser|last3=Canning-Clode|first3=João|last4=Díaz|first4=Eliecer|last5=Eichhorn|first5=Sandra|last6=Fabritzek|first6=Armin G.|last7=da Gama|first7=Bernardo A.

Since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of “hijackers” on ships’ hulls or in ballast water, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around the world.

===Impacts of wildfire and firefighting===
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ([[wildfire]]s, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while adding a variety of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"/&gt;  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"/&gt;

Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Effects==
[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]

===Ecological===
Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in Hawaii (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.

Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the East Coast of the United States a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088–1091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].

Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |author2=D.

===Geomorphological===
Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection. For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the southeastern USA in the early 20th century to control soil erosion.  While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation, bioerosion, and bioconstruction.  For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab [[Eriocheir sinensis]] have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fei |first= S. |author2=J. Philips |author3=M. Shouse|year=2015 |title=Biogeomorphic Impacts of Invasive Species |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=45 |pages=69–87 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-120213-091928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Some invaders cause negative benefits towards the economy of the local area. For example, in the Great Lakes Region the [[sea lamprey]] is an invasive species that acts as a predator. In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a parasite without killing the host organism. However, in the Great Lakes Region, this co-evolutionary link is non existent, so the sea lamprey acts as a predator, and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12-18  month feeding period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glfc.org/sea-lamprey.php|title=Great Lakes Fishery Commission - Sea Lamprey|website=www.glfc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon. The sea lampreys' destructive effects towards large fish negatively affects the fishing industry and has helped collapse the population of some economy dependent species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Economic opportunities====
Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits. For instance, [[silver carp]] and [[common carp]] can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product, or processed into [[pet food]]s, or [[mink]] feed. [[Water hyacinth]] can be turned into fuel by [[methane digesters]],&lt;ref name = wolv&gt;''Energy from vascular plant wastewater treatment systems – Eichhornia crassipes, Spirodela lemna, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, Pueraria lobata, [[biomass]] harvested for fuel production''.

Duke.&lt;/ref&gt; and other invasive plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of [[bioenergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biomass of invasive plant species as a potential feedstock for bioenergy production|first1=Koenraad|last1=Van Meerbeek|first2=Lise|last2=Appels|first3=Raf|last3=Dewil|first4=Annelies|last4=Calmeyn|first5=Pieter|last5=Lemmens|first6=Bart|last6=Muys|first7=Martin|last7=Hermy|date=1 May 2015|journal=Biofuels, Bioprod. Bioref.|volume=9|issue=3|pages=273–282|doi=10.1002/bbb.1539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Benefits=====
Although most people focus on the negative effects of invasive and non-native species, they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases. Ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non-native species in order to succeed. There are four major ways that non-natives can be very beneficial for an ecosystem. The first is that they can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. A good example of this is the Tamarisk, a non-native woody plant, and the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatcher were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had nested in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored. The second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species. Many non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the Aldabra giant tortoises, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services. There are many examples of this. The major one being pollinators. The American Honey bee was introduced in the rainforest to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive species. Such as the use of non-native species to control agricultural pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHLAEPFER|first=MARTIN A.|last2=SAX|first2=DOV F.|last3=OLDEN|first3=JULIAN D.|date=2011-02-22|title=The Potential Conservation Value of Non-Native Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=428–437|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01646.x|pmid=21342267|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-native species can have other benefits. [[Chesapeake Bay#Depletion of oysters|Asian oysters]], for example, filter water pollutants better than native{{clarify|reason=native to where?|date=September 2012}} oysters. They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently considering releasing this [[mollusk]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's deteriorating water quality.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pelton, ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- does the asian threaten the local?--&gt; Additionally, some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment, a term referred to as [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]]. For example, ''[[Lasioglossum leucozonium|L. leucozonium]]'', shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Successful Biological Invasion despite a Severe Genetic Load|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2007-09-12|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 1964518|pmid = 17848999|volume = 2|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000868|first = Amro|last = Zayed|first2 = Şerban A.|last2 = Constantin|first3 = Laurence|last3 = Packer|pages=e868}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become an important pollinator of [[Rubus|caneberry]] as well as [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]], [[apple trees]], and blueberry bushes.&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee.

=====Invasivorism=====
''See also [[:Category:Edible invasive species]]''

Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system. In response, Invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control, reduce, or eliminate their populations. Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients. [[Miya's]] of [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] created the first invasive species menu in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invasive-species-menu-of-a-world-class-chef/|title=Invasive Species Menu of a World-Class Chef|journal=Scientific American|volume=309|issue=3|pages=40–43|date=September 1, 2013|author= Bun Lai |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0913-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place—such as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico—eradication is almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2015/feb/06/cooking-cant-solve-the-invasive-threat|title=Cooking can't solve the threat of invasive species|author=Emma Bryce|date=6 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida]]
Proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction—such as the [[Dodo]] bird, the [[Caribbean monk seal]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. Proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of [[lionfish]] by encouraging the consumption of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/invasive-lionfish-kings-caribbean-may-met-match-011600208.html|title=Invasive Lionfish, the Kings of the Caribbean, May Have Met Their Match|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costs====
Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $138&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="pimental"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimentel |first= D. |last2= R. |first2= Zuniga  |last3= Morrison |first3= D |year= 2005 |title=Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=52 |issue= 3|pages=273–288 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues.&lt;ref name="simb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Biological invasions - How are they affecting us, and what can we do about them? |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume= 61 |pages=308–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of [[ecosystem services]], costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions.

It is often argued that the key to reducing the costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2008–2012 National Invasive Species Management Plan.|last=|first=|publisher=National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC.|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it, while the population is small, is less expensive that managing the invasive population when it is widespread and already causing damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant industry====
Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients. Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see [[dynamic accumulator]]) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, ''[[Euphorbia esula]]'') or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., [[yellow starthistle]]). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by [[Western honeybee|honey bees]] infected by the invasive [[varroa mite]]. Introduced rats (''[[Rattus rattus]]'' and ''[[Rattus norvegicus|R. norvegicus]]'') have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock.  Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP).  Because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found.&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Citrus Greening."

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aquaculture====
[[Aquaculture]] is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential (e.g., ''[[Oreochromis niloticus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azevedo-Santos|first= V.M. |author2=O.

====Tourism and recreation====
Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including, but not limited to, water quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eiswerth |first=M.E. |year=2005 |title=Input-output modeling, outdoor recreation, and the economic impacts of weeds |journal=Weed Science |volume=53 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1614/WS-04-022R |last2=Darden |first2=Tim D. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wayne S. |last4=Agapoff |first4=Jeanmarie |last5=Harris |first5=Thomas R.|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1614/WS-04-022R |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiswerth states, "very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions, states, and watersheds".

===Health===
Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and [[tsetse fly]] pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of [[Paragonimus westermani|Asian lung fluke]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aquatic invasive species.

For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}

Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global [[biodiversity loss]] and is increasing because of tourism and [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated [[fresh water]] systems, though [[quarantine]]s and [[ballast water]] rules have improved the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] exclusion, [[Ecological niche|niche]] displacement, or [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world's fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odendaal | first1 = L.

Concern over the impacts of invasive species on biodiversity must therefore consider the actual evidence (either ecological or economic), in relation to the potential risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond Natural Resources to Post-Human Resources: Towards a New Theory of diversity and discontinuity|last=Baofu|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing; 1st Unabridged edition|date=March 1, 2013|isbn=978-1443844536|location=|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Native [[species]] can be threatened with [[extinction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=33232 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |year= 2001 |volume= 98 |issue= 10 |pmid= 11344292|last1= Mooney|first1= HA|last2= Cleland |first2= EE |pages= 5446–51 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.091093398 |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the process of ''[[genetic pollution]]''.

Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression. Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations. For example, ''Spartina alterniflora'' was introduced in the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native ''Spartina foliosa.'' The higher pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in [[introgression]] that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of the native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12469817|title=Anttila CK, King RA, Ferris C, Ayres DR, Strong DR.

== Invasive exotic diseases ==
History is rife with the spread of exotic diseases, such as the introduction of [[smallpox]] into the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the Spanish, where it obliterated entire [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|populations of indigenous civilizations]] before they were ever even seen by Europeans.

Problematic exotic disease introductions in the past century or so include the [[chestnut blight]] which has almost eliminated the [[American chestnut]] tree from its forest habitat.  Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.

Another example is the [[Dutch elm disease]], which has severely reduced the [[American elm]] trees in forests and cities.

Diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as the [[Diaphorina citri|Asian citrus psyllid]] and the bacterial disease [[Citrus greening disease|citrus greening]].&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Pest Alert: Citrus Greening." Clemson University Invasive Species Program. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/Pest%20Alerts/citrus_greening.html. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in recent years some argue that some introduced species may have a positive ecological impact on an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110211095555.htm|title=Invasive plants can create positive ecological change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of [[ecology]] and [[geography]] where the issue of biological invasions is especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] 1958 book ''The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants'' which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|author2=Martha F. Hoopes |author3=Michael P. Marchetti |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182–96|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with [[terrestrial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally "Invasion biology".&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another.&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;

In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on [[biogeography]] rather than on [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colautti| first=Robert I. |author2=Hugh J. MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal=Diversity and Distributions| year=2004 |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf| volume=10 |pages=135–141 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.

=== Introduced species on islands ===
Perhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].

An additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.

The field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species.

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main|Invasive species in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]] the largest commercial crop is ''[[Pinus radiata]]'', the [[California native plants|native Californian]] Monterey pine tree, which grows as well in New Zealand as in [[California]]. However, the pine forests are also occupied by [[deer]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. They are exotic species and have thrived in the New Zealand environment. The pines are seen as beneficial while the deer are regarded as serious pests.

Common [[gorse]], originally a hedge plant in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], was introduced to New Zealand for the same purpose. Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant that threatens to obliterate native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish themselves.

[[Rabbit]]s, introduced as a food source by sailors in the 1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South Island. The [[myxomatosis]] [[virus]] was illegally imported and illegally released, but it had little lasting effect upon the rabbit population other than to make it more resistant to the virus.

Cats, brought later by Europeans, have had a devastating effect upon the native birdlife, particularly as many New Zealand birds are flightless. Feral cats and dogs which were originally brought as pets are also known to kill large numbers of birds. A recent (2006) study in the South Island has shown that even domestic cats with a ready supply of food from their owners may kill hundreds of birds in a year, including natives.

[[Sparrows]], which were brought to control insects upon the introduced [[grain]] crops, have displaced native birds as have [[rainbow lorikeet]]s and [[cockatoos]] (both from Australia) which fly free around areas west of [[Auckland]] City such as the [[Waitakere Ranges]].

In much of New Zealand, the Australian [[black swan]] has effectively eliminated the existence of the previously introduced [[mute swan]].

Two notable varieties of spiders have also been introduced: the [[white tail spider]] and the [[redback spider]]. Both may have arrived inside shipments of fruit. Until then,  the only spider (and the only venomous animal) dangerous to humans was the native [[katipo]], which is very similar to the redback and  interbreed with the more aggressive Australian variety.

==== South Georgia Island ====

In 2018, the [[South Georgia Island]] was declared free of invasive [[rodent]]s after a multi-year extermination effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/rat-begone-record-eradication-effort-rids-sub-antarctic-island-invasive-rodents|title=Rat begone: Record eradication effort rids sub-Antarctic island of invasive rodents|last=Warren|first=Matt|date=2018-05-08|work=Science|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-exterminate-rats-on-an-island&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cernozemski ustaska uniforma.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The assassin of Alexander I of Yugoslavia Chernozemski as instructor in Janka-Puszta, 1934.]]
'''Janka-Puszta''' or '''Jankovac''' was a training camp set up for the [[Ustashe]] terrorist organisation in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Paris| first=Edmond| year=1961| pp=23| title=Genocide in Satellite Croatia 1941-1945|publisher=King's|isbn=1258163462}}&lt;/ref&gt; The camp was located in the [[Zala County]] of [[Hungary]], close to the border of the then [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] near the villages of [[Murakeresztúr]] and [[Belezna]]. The camp was one of a string of training camps established in Hungary and Italy by the [[Ustashe]]. It housed several hundred émigré recruits, mostly manual laborers returning from Western Europe and North America. The recruits swore an oath of loyalty to the leader of the [[Ustashe]], [[Ante Pavelić]], took part in militant exercises, and produced anti-Serb propaganda material.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=175}}

==Background==

In the summer of 1931, the location was leased by the Hungary authorities to [[Gustav Perčec]] who served as the camp commander. [[Ustashe]] members were already active in the region on both sides of the border at the time. Situated on a hill on approximately 150 acres, the camp consisted of two buildings, open fields and a forest. In November 1931, the first members of the [[Ustashe]] terrorist organisation arrived. The camp started out as a sort of [[commune]], a refuge for fugitive members of the [[Ustashe]] group who had recently escaped from Yugoslavia. After months of preparation, Gustav Perčec  began to actively seek members to join the camp.{{sfn|Lampe|2000|p=175}} In co-operation with the Hungarian authorities, [[Ustashe]] fugitives crossing the Yugoslav-Hungarian border were interviewed by Hungarian police and their details were passed onto Percec. After it was confirmed a fugitive was not a Yugoslav spy, the Hungarian police would take them to the camp and would be provided a false name and acceptance into the camp.&lt;ref name="Šadek"&gt;Vladimir Šadek: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/128108 Logor Janka-puszta i razvoj ustaške organizacije u Podravini do 1934.], Podravina, sv. 11, broj 21, Str. 47 - 56 Koprivnica 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Those living at the training camp partook in regimented programs. Alongside [[Croatian nationalism]] indoctrination, [[Ustashe]] members took part in military training and also, conducted duties to keep the camp running. The head instructors of weapons training were Hungarian officers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Toynbee| first=Arnold|year=1935| pp=546–47| title=Survey of International Affairs 1934| publisher=Oxford University Press| asin=B0006DIHDI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the living conditions at the camp were said to have been poor, with camp members receiving severe punishment for any misbehavior. Much of the weaponry came from Italy, and many high ranking and prominent members of the [[Ustashe]] organisation visited the camp including: [[Ante Pavelic]].&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt; In relation with the agreement reached in 1929 between the pro-Bulgarian [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] and the Ustashe on a common struggle against Yugoslavia. As result, Bulgarian [[Vlado Chernozemski]] was designated as their instructor in terrorist attacks and was send to Italy in 1931. Since mid-1932, taking steps to improve its relations with Yugoslavia, the Italian authorities have closed the [[Borgo Val di Taro]] Ustashe camp. Thus [[Vlado Chernozemski]], was transferred  to Janka-Puszta. From the period of 1932-1934, the camp served as the ideological and technical support base for many militant actions including the [[Velebit uprising]] and the assassination of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt;

In the camp lived also the lover of Perčec-Jelka Pogorelec, who was an agent of Serbian intelligence. One night she secretly crossed the border. In October 1933 she published a series of materials for the camp in the "Novosti" newspaper in [[Zagreb]]. This greatly complicated Yugoslavia's relations with Hungary. Cross-border conflicts arose between the two countries, accompanied by mutual attacks. Thus, in April 1934, Belgrade made a formal complaint to the [[League of Nations]]. There was also a complaint filled by the Hungarian regent [[Horthy]]. The League formed a commission to review the case in May. Under these circumstances, the Hungarian authorities were forced to close the camp and urgently move the Ustashe in the nearby town of [[Nagykanizsa]]. When the members of the  international commission arrived at the camp, they recognized that the complaint about a terrorist camp was not correct. In this way the camp fell into disuse in late 1934.&lt;ref name="Šadek"/&gt;

Legal tests are often formulated from the logical analysis of a judicial decision or a court order where it appears that a [[finder of fact]] or the [[court]] made a particular decision after contemplating a well-defined set of circumstances. It is assumed that evaluating any given set of circumstances under a legal test will lead to an unambiguous and repeatable result. &lt;!-- this needs to be clarified --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28407">This [[list of rampage killers]] contains those cases where only vehicles were [[Vehicle-ramming attack|used to attack people]]. Since it may be quite difficult to distinguish accidents, or cases of reckless driving from those incidents where the driver, or pilot, had the intention to harm others, only those cases are included where it is clear that the vehicle was applied as a weapon and crashed deliberately into people, other vehicles, or buildings. Also, those cases where a rampage killer used an armed vehicle, such as a tank, or a fighter aircraft, to shoot others are listed here. [[Airliner]]s are not included in this section but in [[List of rampage killers#Other incidents|other incidents]].

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator is not counted among those killed or injured.

'''''{{lang|la|Magna Carta Libertatum}}''''' ([[Medieval Latin]] for "the Great Charter of the Liberties"), commonly called '''{{lang|la|Magna Carta}}''' (also ''Magna Charta''; "Great Charter"),{{Efn|The document's Latin name is spelled either ''Magna Carta'' or ''Magna Charta'', (the pronunciation is the same) and, in English, with or without the definite article "the".  Latin does not have a definite article equivalent to "the". The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' recommends usage without the definite article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/112237?redirectedFrom=Magna+Carta|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=20 November 2014|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The spelling ''Charta'' originates in the 18th century, as a restoration of [[classical Latin]] ''[[:wikt:charta|charta]]'' for the [[Medieval Latin]] spelling ''carta''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Glossarium ad scriptores mediae et infimae latinitatis|Du Cange]] s.v. [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/charta#CHARTA1 1 carta]&lt;/ref&gt; While "Charta" remains an acceptable variant spelling it never became prevalent in English usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|date=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195142365|page=541|url=https://books.google.com/?id=35dZpfMmxqsC&amp;pg=PA541#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} "The usual—and the better—form is ''Magna Carta''. [...] ''Magna Carta'' does not take a definite article".
''Magna Charta'' is the recommended spelling in German-language literature. ([http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Magna_Charta Duden online])&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a [[charter]] of [[rights]] agreed to by [[John, King of England|King John of England]] at [[Runnymede]], near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], on 15 June 1215.{{Efn|Within this article, dates before 14 September 1752 are in the Julian calendar. Later dates are in the Gregorian calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, however, the date would have been 22 June 1215.}} First drafted by the [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop of Canterbury]] to make peace between the unpopular King and a group of rebel [[baron]]s, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on [[Feudalism|feudal]] payments to [[the Crown]], to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by [[Pope Innocent III]], leading to the [[First Barons' War]]. After John's death, the regency government of his young son, [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], reissued the document in 1216, stripped of some of its more radical content, in an unsuccessful bid to build political support for their cause.  At the end of the war in 1217, it formed part of the peace [[Treaty of Lambeth|treaty agreed at Lambeth]], where the document acquired the name Magna Carta, to distinguish it from the smaller [[Charter of the Forest]] which was issued at the same time. Short of funds, Henry reissued the charter again in 1225 in exchange for a grant of new taxes. His son, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], repeated the exercise in 1297, this time confirming it as part of England's [[Statutory law|statute law]].

The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the [[Anglo-Saxons]], that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]] had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as ''[[habeas corpus]]''. Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir [[Edward Coke]] used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the [[divine right of kings]] propounded by the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] monarchs. Both [[James VI and I|James I]] and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the [[English Civil War]] of the 1640s and the execution of Charles.

The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and the formation of the [[United States Constitution|American Constitution]] in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States.{{Efn|The United States (US) Constitution was written in 1787, went into effect in 1788, after ratification by nine of the 13 states, and the US Federal government started operation in 1789.}} Research by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries. Magna Carta still forms an important symbol of liberty today, often cited by politicians and campaigners, and is held in great respect by the British and American legal communities, [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] describing it as "the greatest constitutional document of all times&lt;!-- [sic]; should be "of all time", of course, but this is the quotation in the book --&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot".{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=268}}

In the 21st century, four [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the original 1215 charter remain in existence, two at the [[British Library]], one at [[Lincoln Cathedral]] and one at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]. There are also a handful of the subsequent charters in public and private ownership, including copies of the 1297 charter in both the United States and Australia. The original charters were written on [[parchment]] sheets using [[quill]] pens, in [[Scribal abbreviation|heavily abbreviated]] [[medieval Latin]], which was the convention for legal documents at that time. Each was sealed with the royal [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]] (made of [[beeswax]] and [[resin]] [[sealing wax]]): very few of the seals have survived. Although scholars refer to the 63 numbered "clauses" of Magna Carta, this is a modern system of numbering, introduced by Sir [[William Blackstone]] in 1759; the original charter formed a single, long unbroken text. The four original 1215 charters were displayed together at the British Library for one day, 3 February 2015, to mark the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta.

====Background====
{{Main article|John, King of England}}
[[File:King John from De Rege Johanne.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An illuminated picture of King John riding a white horse and accompanied by four hounds. The King is chasing a stag, and several rabbits can be seen at the bottom of the picture.|King [[John, King of England|John]] on a [[Deer hunting|stag hunt]]]]
Magna Carta originated as an unsuccessful attempt to achieve peace between royalist and rebel factions in 1215, as part of the events leading to the outbreak of the [[First Barons' War]]. England was ruled by King [[John, King of England|John]], the third of the [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin kings]]. Although the kingdom had a robust administrative system, the nature of government under the Angevin monarchs was ill-defined and uncertain.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=8}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}} John and his predecessors had ruled using the principle of ''vis et voluntas'', or "force and will", taking executive and sometimes arbitrary decisions, often justified on the basis that a king was above the law.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}} Many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law, with the counsel of the leading members of the realm, but there was no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=149}}

John had lost most of his ancestral lands in France to King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] in 1204 and had struggled to regain them for many years, raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money to fight a war which ended in expensive failure in 1214.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=7}} Following the defeat of his allies at the [[Battle of Bouvines]], John had to sue for peace and pay compensation.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=168}} John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons, many of whom owed money to the Crown, and little trust existed between the two sides.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=139}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=181}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=6–7}} A triumph would have strengthened his position, but in the face of his defeat, within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=9}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=174}}

The rebels took an oath that they would "stand fast for the liberty of the church and the realm", and demanded that the King confirm the [[Charter of Liberties]] that had been declared by King [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] in the previous century, and which was perceived by the barons to protect their rights.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=256–58}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=174}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|pp=131–32}} The rebel leadership was unimpressive by the standards of the time, even disreputable, but were united by their hatred of John;{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=130}} [[Robert FitzWalter]], later elected leader of the rebel barons, claimed publicly that John had attempted to rape his daughter,{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=104}} and was implicated in a plot to assassinate John in 1212.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=165}}

[[File:Innozenz3.jpg|thumb|A contemporaneous mural of [[Pope Innocent III]]]]
{{anchor|Unknown Charter of Liberties}}&lt;!--[[Unknown Charter of Liberties]] redirects here--&gt;John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms, and sponsored discussions in [[Oxford]] between his agents and the rebels during the spring.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=178}} Both sides appealed to [[Pope Innocent III]] for assistance in the dispute.{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=132}} During the negotiations, the rebellious barons produced an initial document, which historians have termed "the Unknown Charter of Liberties", which drew on Henry I's Charter of Liberties for much of its language; seven articles from that document later appeared in the "Articles of the Barons" and the subsequent charter.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=115}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=471–72}}{{sfn|Vincent|2012|pp=59–60}}

It was John's hope that the Pope would give him valuable legal and moral support, and accordingly John played for time; the King had declared himself to be a papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=179}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=132}} John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France, although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=178}} In a further move to shore up his support, John took an oath to become a [[crusades|crusader]], a move which gave him additional political protection under church law, even though many felt the promise was insincere.{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=233}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=258–59}}

Letters backing John arrived from the Pope in April, but by then the rebel barons had organised into a military faction. They congregated at [[Northampton]] in May and renounced their feudal ties to John, marching on [[London]], [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], and [[Exeter]].{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=174, 179–80}} John's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful, but once the rebels held London, they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}} The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter, but this was not attractive to the rebels.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=112}} [[Stephen Langton]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], had been working with the rebel barons on their demands, and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed, John instructed Langton to organise peace talks.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}

====Great Charter of 1215====
[[File:Article-barons-add-ms-4838.jpg|thumb|upright|The Articles of the Barons, 1215, held by the [[British Library]]]]
John met the rebel leaders at [[Runnymede]], a [[water-meadow]] on the south bank of the [[River Thames]], on 10 June 1215. Runnymede was a traditional place for assemblies, but it was also located on neutral ground between the royal fortress of [[Windsor Castle]] and the rebel base at [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]], and offered both sides the security of a rendezvous where they were unlikely to find themselves at a military disadvantage.{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|2015|p=36}}{{sfn|Holt|2015|p=219}} Here the rebels presented John with their draft demands for reform, the 'Articles of the Barons'.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}} Stephen Langton's pragmatic efforts at mediation over the next ten days turned these incomplete demands into a charter capturing the proposed peace agreement; a few years later, this agreement was renamed Magna Carta, meaning "Great Charter".{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=180, 182}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}} By 15 June, general agreement had been made on a text, and on 19 June, the rebels renewed their oaths of loyalty to John and copies of the charter were formally issued.{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=236}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=137}}

Although, as the historian [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] has noted, the charter "wasted no time on political theory", it went beyond simply addressing individual baronial complaints, and formed a wider proposal for political reform.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=180}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=182}} It promised the protection of church rights, protection from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and, most importantly, limitations on taxation and other feudal payments to the Crown, with certain forms of feudal taxation requiring baronial consent.{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=184–85}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=9}} It focused on the rights of free men—in particular the barons{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=182}} - however, the rights of serfs were included in articles 16, 20, and 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-english-translation
|title=Magna Carta|publisher=British Library|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The Runnymede Charter of Liberties did not apply to [[Chester]], which at the time was a [[Earl of Chester|separate feudal domain]]. [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Earl Ranulf]] granted his own [[Magna Carta of Chester]].{{sfn|Hewit|1929|p=9}} Some of its articles were similar to the Runnymede Charter.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=379–80}}}} Its style and content reflected Henry I's Charter of Liberties, as well as a wider body of legal traditions, including the royal charters issued to towns, the operations of the Church and baronial courts and European charters such as the Statute of Pamiers.{{sfn|Vincent|2012|pp=61–63}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|pp=293–94}}

Under what historians later labelled "clause 61", or the "security clause", a council of 25 barons would be created to monitor and ensure John's future adherence to the charter.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}} If John did not conform to the charter within 40 days of being notified of a transgression by the council, the 25 barons were empowered by clause 61 to seize John's castles and lands until, in their judgement, amends had been made.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261–62}} Men were to be compelled to swear an oath to assist the council in controlling the King, but once redress had been made for any breaches, the King would continue to rule as before. In one sense this was not unprecedented; other kings had previously conceded the right of individual resistance to their subjects if the King did not uphold his obligations. Magna Carta was however novel in that it set up a formally recognised means of collectively coercing the King.{{sfn|Goodman|1995|pp=260–61}} The historian [[W. L. Warren|Wilfred Warren]] argues that it was almost inevitable that the clause would result in civil war, as it "was crude in its methods and disturbing in its implications".{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=239–40}} The barons were trying to force John to keep to the charter, but clause 61 was so heavily weighted against the King that this version of the charter could not survive.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=261–62}}

John and the rebel barons did not trust each other, and neither side seriously attempted to implement the peace accord.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=189}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|p=479}} The 25 barons selected for the new council were all rebels, chosen by the more extremist barons, and many among the rebels found excuses to keep their forces mobilised.{{sfn|Turner|2009|pp=189–91}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=262}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=239, 242}} Disputes began to emerge between the royalist faction and those rebels who had expected the charter to return lands that had been confiscated .{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}

Clause 61 of Magna Carta contained a commitment from John that he would "seek to obtain nothing from anyone, in our own person or through someone else, whereby any of these grants or liberties may be revoked or diminished".{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=13}}&lt;ref name="All clauses"/&gt; Despite this, the King appealed to Pope Innocent for help in July, arguing that the charter compromised the Pope's rights as John's feudal lord.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190–91}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}} As part of the June peace deal, the barons were supposed to surrender London by 15 August, but this they refused to do.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190}} Meanwhile, instructions from the Pope arrived in August, written before the peace accord, with the result that papal commissioners excommunicated the rebel barons and suspended Langton from office in early September.{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=244–45}} Once aware of the charter, the Pope responded in detail: in a letter dated 24 August and arriving in late September, he declared the charter to be "not only shameful and demeaning but also illegal and unjust" since John had been "forced to accept" it, and accordingly the charter was "null, and void of all validity for ever"; under threat of excommunication, the King was not to observe the charter, nor the barons try to enforce it.{{sfn|Rothwell|1975|pp=324–26}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|pp=245–46}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=190}}

By then, violence had broken out between the two sides; less than three months after it had been agreed, John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the failed charter: the First Barons' War erupted.{{sfn|Holt|1992a|p=1}}{{sfn|Crouch|1996|p=114}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}} The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], for help, offering him the English throne.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|pp=264–67}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}{{efn|Louis' claim to the English throne, described as "debatable" by the historian David Carpenter, derived from his wife, [[Blanche of Castile]], who was the granddaughter of King [[Henry II of England]]. Louis argued that since John had been legitimately deposed, the barons could then legally appoint him king over the claims of John's son Henry.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=12}}}} The war soon settled into a stalemate. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October 1216, leaving the nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] as his heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warren|1990|pp=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Great Charter of 1216====
Although the Charter of 1215 was a failure as a peace treaty, it was resurrected under the new government of the young Henry III as a way of drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], one of the most famous knights in England.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=14–15}} William knighted the boy, and Cardinal [[Guala Bicchieri]], the [[papal legate]] to England, then oversaw his coronation at [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 28 October.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=189}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

The young King inherited a difficult situation, with over half of England occupied by the rebels.{{sfn|Weiler|2012|p=1}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=1}} He had substantial support though from Guala, who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=259–60}} Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, during which Henry gave [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord.{{sfn|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=260}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}} [[Pope Honorius III]] declared that Henry was the Pope's [[vassal]] and [[Ward (law)|ward]], and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}} As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a crusader and thereby entitled to special protection from Rome.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}

The war was not going well for the loyalists, but Prince Louis and the rebel barons were also finding it difficult to make further progress.{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=301}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}} John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country.{{sfn|Aurell|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}} Henry's government encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the 1215 Charter, albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy and clause 61, which had set up the council of barons.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=21–22, 24–25}}{{sfn|Powicke|1963|p=5}} The move was not successful, and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=25}}

====Great Charter of 1217====
{{see also|First Barons' War|Charter of the Forest|English land law}}
[[File:Forest-charter-1225-C13550-78.jpg|thumb|upright|The Charter of the Forest, 1217, held by the British Library]]
In February 1217, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=27}} In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis' French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was the equivalent of a religious crusade.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=28–29}} This declaration resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=127–28}} Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Battle of Lincoln]] in May.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=36–40}}{{sfn|McGlynn|2013|p=216}}

Meanwhile, support for Louis' campaign was diminishing in France, and he concluded that the war in England was lost.{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=173}} He negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which Louis would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of [[excommunication]] would be lifted, and Henry's government would promise to enforce the charter of the previous year.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=41–42}} The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=42}}

In the absence of a settlement, Louis remained in London with his remaining forces, hoping for the arrival of reinforcements from France.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=42}} When the expected fleet did arrive in August, it was intercepted and defeated by loyalists at the [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=44}} Louis entered into fresh peace negotiations, and the factions came to agreement on the final [[Treaty of Lambeth]], also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on 12 and 13 September 1217.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=44}} The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit; it included a promise, however, that Louis' followers would be allowed to enjoy their traditional liberties and customs, referring back to the Charter of 1216.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=41, 44–45}} Louis left England as agreed and joined the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in the south of France, bringing the war to an end.{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=173}}

A [[Magnum Concilium|great council]] was called in October and November to take stock of the post-war situation; this council is thought to have formulated and issued the Charter of 1217.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=60}} The charter resembled that of 1216, although some additional clauses were added to protect the rights of the barons over their feudal subjects, and the restrictions on the Crown's ability to levy taxation were watered down.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=60–61}} There remained a range of disagreements about the management of the royal forests, which involved a special legal system that had resulted in a source of considerable royal revenue; complaints existed over both the implementation of these courts, and the geographic boundaries of the royal forests.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=61–62}} A complementary charter, the [[Charter of the Forest]], was created, pardoning existing forest offences, imposing new controls over the forest courts, and establishing a review of the forest boundaries.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=61–62}} To distinguish the two charters, the term ''magna carta libertatum'', "the great charter of liberties", was used by the scribes to refer to the larger document, which in time became known simply as Magna Carta.{{sfn|White|1915|pp=472–75}}{{sfn|White|1917|pp=545–55}}

====Great Charter of 1225====
[[File:Magna Carta (1225 version with seal).jpg|thumb|upright|The 1225 version of Magna Carta issued by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], held in the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]]]]
Magna Carta became increasingly embedded into English political life during Henry III's [[Minor (law)|minority]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=402}} As the King grew older, his government slowly began to recover from the civil war, regaining control of the counties and beginning to raise revenue once again, taking care not to overstep the terms of the charters.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=333–35, 382–83}} Henry remained a minor and his government's legal ability to make permanently binding decisions on his behalf was limited. In 1223, the tensions over the status of the charters became clear in the [[Court (royal)|royal court]], when Henry's government attempted to reassert its rights over its properties and revenues in the counties, facing resistance from many communities that argued—if sometimes incorrectly—that the charters protected the new arrangements.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=295–96}}{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=6}} This resistance resulted in an argument between Archbishop Langton and [[William Brewer (justice)|William Brewer]] over whether the King had any duty to fulfil the terms of the charters, given that he had been forced to agree to them.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=296–97}} On this occasion, Henry gave oral assurances that he considered himself bound by the charters, enabling a royal inquiry into the situation in the counties to progress.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=297}}

Two years later, the question of Henry's commitment to the charters re-emerged, when Louis VIII of France invaded Henry's remaining provinces in France, [[Poitou]] and [[Gascony]].{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=176}}{{sfn|Weiler|2012|p=20}} Henry's army in Poitou was under-resourced, and the province quickly fell.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=371–73}} It became clear that Gascony would also fall unless reinforcements were sent from England.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=374–75}} In early 1225, a great council approved a tax of £40,000 to dispatch an army, which quickly retook Gascony.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|pp=376, 378}}{{sfn|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=176–77}} In exchange for agreeing to support Henry, the barons demanded that the King reissue Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=379}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=307}} The content was almost identical to the 1217 versions, but in the new versions, the King declared that the charters were issued of his own "spontaneous and free will" and confirmed them with the royal seal, giving the new Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than the previous versions.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=383}}{{sfn|Carpenter|2004|p=307}}

The barons anticipated that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by the advice of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=2–3, 383, 386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal.{{sfn|Clanchy|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=71}} This brought into question the validity of the previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid.{{sfn|Clanchy|1997|p=147}}{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=71}} In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=174}}

Henry placed a symbolic emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=76, 99}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}} He generally acted within the terms of the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=76, 99}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}} The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked any means of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them.{{sfn|Carpenter|1990|p=3}} The inconsistency with which he applied the charters over the course of his rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

Despite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, while on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|pp=26, 29, 37, 43}} The royal courts, which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=105}} Henry's rule became lax and careless, resulting in a reduction in royal authority in the provinces and, ultimately, the collapse of his authority at court.{{sfn|Carpenter|1996|p=105}}{{sfn|Ridgeway|2010}}

In 1258, a group of barons seized power from Henry in a ''[[coup d'état]]'', citing the need to strictly enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the [[Provisions of Oxford]].{{sfn|Davis|2013|pp=195–97}} The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to [[Louis IX of France]] in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, suggesting that it was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=104}}

Louis came down firmly in favour of Henry, but the French arbitration failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons refused to accept the verdict. England slipped back into the [[Second Barons' War]], which was won by Henry's son, [[Edward I of England|the Lord Edward]]. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and were themselves acting against Magna Carta.{{sfn|Davis|2013|p=224}} In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the [[Statute of Marlborough]], which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.{{sfn|Jobson|2012|p=163}}

====Great Charter of 1297: statute====
[[File:Magna Carta (1297 version with seal, owned by David M Rubenstein).png|thumb|upright|1297 version of the Great Charter, on display in the [[National Archives Building]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] reissued the Charters of 1225 in 1297 in return for a new tax.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=427}} It is this version which remains in [[statute]] today, although with most articles now repealed.&lt;ref name=natarch&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta (1297)|publisher=The National Archive|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/contents|accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw1cc1929/25/9/contents|title=Magna Carta (1297)|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{anchor|Confirmatio}}

The ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' (Confirmation of Charters) was issued in [[Norman language|Norman French]] by Edward I in 1297.{{sfn|Edwards|1943}} Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, and they had armed themselves against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/cartarum.html|title=Confirmatio Cartarum|accessdate=30 November 2007|publisher=britannia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nobles had sought to add another document, the ''De Tallagio'', to Magna Carta. Edward I's government was not prepared to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the ''Confirmatio'', confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent,{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=427}} although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|p=434}}

A passage mandates that copies shall be distributed in "cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall be read before the people two times by the year",{{sfn|Cobbett|Howell|Howell|Jardine|1810|p=980}} hence the permanent installation of a copy in [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/magna-carta|publisher=Salisbury Cathedral|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Confirmation's second article, it is confirmed that

With the reconfirmation of the Charters in 1300, an additional document was granted, the ''Articuli super Cartas'' (The Articles upon the Charters).{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=62}} It was composed of 17 articles and sought in part to deal with the problem of enforcing the Charters. Magna Carta and the Forest Charter were to be issued to the [[sheriff]] of each county, and should be read four times a year at the meetings of the county courts. Each county should have a committee of three men who could hear complaints about violations of the Charters.{{sfn|Fritze|Robison|2002|pp=34–35}}

[[Pope Clement V]] continued the papal policy of supporting monarchs (who ruled by divine grace) against any claims in Magna Carta which challenged the King's rights, and annulled the ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' in 1305. Edward I interpreted Clement V's [[papal bull]] annulling the ''Confirmatio Cartarum'' as effectively applying to the ''Articuli super Cartas'', although the latter was not specifically mentioned.{{sfn|Prestwich|1997|pp=547–48}} In 1306 Edward I took the opportunity given by the Pope's backing to reassert forest law over large areas which had been "disafforested". Both Edward and the Pope were accused by some contemporary chroniclers of "perjury", and it was suggested by Robert McNair Scott that [[Robert the Bruce]] refused to make peace with Edward I's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], in 1312 with the justification: "How shall the king of England keep faith with me, since he does not observe the sworn promises made to his liege men..."{{sfn|Menache|2003|pp=253–55}}{{sfn|Scott|2014}}

====Magna Carta's influence on English medieval law====
The Great Charter was referred to in legal cases throughout the medieval period. For example, in 1226, the knights of [[Lincolnshire]] argued that their local sheriff was changing customary practice regarding the local courts, "contrary to their liberty which they ought to have by the charter of the lord king".{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=44–45}} In practice, cases were not brought against the King for breach of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter, but it was possible to bring a case against the King's officers, such as his sheriffs, using the argument that the King's officers were acting contrary to liberties granted by the King in the charters.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=45–46}}

In addition, medieval cases referred to the clauses in Magna Carta which dealt with specific issues such as wardship and dower, debt collection, and keeping rivers free for navigation.{{sfn|Holt|2008|p=56}} Even in the 13th century, some clauses of Magna Carta rarely appeared in legal cases, either because the issues concerned were no longer relevant, or because Magna Carta had been superseded by more relevant legislation. By 1350 half the clauses of Magna Carta were no longer actively used.{{sfn|Holt|2008|pp=56–57}}

===14th–15th centuries===
[[File:Magna charta cum statutis angliae p1.jpg|upright|thumb|''Magna carta cum statutis angliae'' (Great Charter with English Statutes), early 14th-century]]
During the reign of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] six measures, later known as the ''Six Statutes'', were passed between 1331 and 1369. They sought to clarify certain parts of the Charters. In particular the third statute, in 1354, redefined clause 29, with "free man" becoming "no man, of whatever [[Estates of the realm|estate]] or condition he may be", and introduced the phrase "[[Due process|due process of law]]" for "lawful judgement of his peers or the law of the land".{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=123}}

Between the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was reconfirmed 32 times according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], and possibly as many as 45 times.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Turner|2003a}} Often the first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, as in the previous century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch.{{sfn|Turner|2003a}} The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=800th anniversary of Magna Carta|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/media/1910459/gs%201945b%20-%20background%20note%20from%20mpa.pdf|publisher=Church of England General Synod|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.britroyals.com/magnacarta.htm|publisher=Royal Family History|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Ben|title=The Origins of the Magna Carta|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofEngland/The-Origins-of-the-Magna-Carta/|publisher=Historic UK|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta ceased to occupy a central role in English political life, as monarchs reasserted authority and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=132}} The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=133}}

===16th century===
[[File:Magna Carta confirmed by Henry III.jpg|thumb|A version of the Charter of 1217, produced between 1437 and c. 1450]]
During the 16th century, the interpretation of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=185–87}} [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] took power at the end of the turbulent [[Wars of the Roses]], followed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=185–86}}

Tudor historians rediscovered the [[Barnwell chronicler]], who was more favourable to King John than other 13th-century texts, and, as historian Ralph Turner describes, they "viewed King John in a positive light as a hero struggling against the papacy", showing "little sympathy for the Great Charter or the rebel barons".{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=138}} Pro-Catholic demonstrations during the [[Pilgrimage of Grace|1536 uprising]] cited Magna Carta, accusing the King of not giving it sufficient respect.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}}

The first mechanically printed edition of Magna Carta was probably the ''Magna Carta cum aliis Antiquis Statutis'' of 1508 by [[Richard Pynson]], although the early printed versions of the 16th century incorrectly attributed the origins of Magna Carta to Henry III and 1225, rather than to John and 1215, and accordingly worked from the later text.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|p=146}}{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=324}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=187}} An abridged English-language edition was published by [[John Rastell]] in 1527.
[[Thomas Berthelet]], Pynson's successor as the royal printer during 1530–1547,
printed an edition of the text along with other "ancient statutes" in 1531 and 1540.&lt;ref&gt;

revised edition by Thomas Marshe (1556), ''Magna Carta et cetera antiqua statuta nunc nouiter per diuersa exemplaria examinata et summa diligentia castigata et correcta cui adiecta est noua tabula valde necessaria.'' .&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1534, [[George Ferrers]] published the first unabridged English-language edition of Magna Carta, dividing the Charter into 37 numbered clauses.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=147–49}}

At the end of the 16th century, there was an upsurge in antiquarian interest in England.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}} This work concluded that there was a set of ancient English customs and laws, temporarily overthrown by the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion of 1066]], which had then been recovered in 1215 and recorded in Magna Carta, which in turn gave authority to important 16th century legal principles.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=140}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=188}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}} Modern historians note that although this narrative was fundamentally incorrect—many refer to it as a "[[Political myth|myth]]"—it took on great importance among the legal historians of the time.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}{{efn|Among the historians to have discussed the "myth" of Magna Carta and the ancient English constitution are Claire Breay, Geoffrey Hindley, [[J. C. Holt|James Holt]], [[J. G. A. Pocock|John Pocock]], Danny Danziger, and John Gillingham.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=183}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=124}}{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=9}}}}

The antiquarian [[William Lambarde]], for example, published what he believed were the Anglo-Saxon and Norman law codes, tracing the origins of the 16th-century English Parliament back to this period, albeit misinterpreting the dates of many documents concerned.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=140}} [[Francis Bacon]] argued that clause 39 of Magna Carta was the basis of the 16th-century jury system and judicial processes.{{sfn|Eele|2013|p=20}} Antiquarians [[Robert Beale (diplomat)|Robert Beale]], [[James Morice]], and [[Richard Cosin]] argued that Magna Carta was a statement of liberty and a fundamental, supreme law empowering English government.{{sfn|Thompson|1948|pp=216–30}} Those who questioned these conclusions, including the Member of Parliament [[Arthur Hall (English politician)|Arthur Hall]], faced sanctions.{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=154}}{{sfn|Wright|1919|p=72}}

===17th–18th centuries===

====Political tensions====
[[File:Edward coke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jurist]] [[Edward Coke]] made extensive political use of Magna Carta.]]
In the early 17th century, Magna Carta became increasingly important as a political document in arguments over the authority of the English monarchy.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}} [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] both propounded greater authority for the Crown, justified by the doctrine of the [[divine right of kings]], and Magna Carta was cited extensively by their opponents to challenge the monarchy.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}

Magna Carta, it was argued, recognised and protected the liberty of individual Englishmen, made the King subject to the common law of the land, formed the origin of the trial by jury system, and acknowledged the ancient origins of Parliament: because of Magna Carta and this [[ancient constitution]], an English monarch was unable to alter these long-standing English customs.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}}{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=300}}{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=148}} Although the arguments based on Magna Carta were historically inaccurate, they nonetheless carried symbolic power, as the charter had immense significance during this period; antiquarians such as Sir [[Henry Spelman]] described it as "the most majestic and a sacrosanct anchor to English Liberties".{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=188–89}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}}

Sir Edward Coke was a leader in using Magna Carta as a political tool during this period. Still working from the 1225 version of the text—the first printed copy of the 1215 charter only emerged in 1610—Coke spoke and wrote about Magna Carta repeatedly.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=280}} His work was challenged at the time by [[Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley|Lord Ellesmere]], and modern historians such as Ralph Turner and Claire Breay have critiqued Coke as "misconstruing" the original charter "anachronistically and uncritically", and taking a "very selective" approach to his analysis.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=46}}{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=148}} More sympathetically, [[J. C. Holt]] noted that the history of the charters had already become "distorted" by the time Coke was carrying out his work.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=20–21}}

[[File:John Lilburne.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Lilburne]] criticised Magna Carta as an inadequate definition of English liberties.]]
In 1621, a bill was presented to Parliament to renew Magna Carta; although this bill failed, lawyer [[John Selden]] argued during [[Darnell's Case]] in 1627 that the right of ''habeas corpus'' was backed by Magna Carta.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=156}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=189}} Coke supported the [[Petition of Right]] in 1628, which cited Magna Carta in its preamble, attempting to extend the provisions, and to make them binding on the judiciary.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|pp=189–90}}{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=157}} The monarchy responded by arguing that the historical legal situation was much less clear-cut than was being claimed, restricted the activities of antiquarians, arrested Coke for treason, and suppressed his proposed book on Magna Carta.{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=189}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=280–81}} Charles initially did not agree to the Petition of Right, and refused to confirm Magna Carta in any way that would reduce his independence as King.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=41}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=190}}

England descended into [[English Civil War|civil war]] in the 1640s, resulting in Charles I's execution in 1649. Under the [[Commonwealth of England|republic]] that followed, some questioned whether Magna Carta, an agreement with a monarch, was still relevant.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=271}} An anti-[[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwellian]] pamphlet published in 1660, ''The English devil'', said that the nation had been "compelled to submit to this Tyrant Nol or be  cut off by him; nothing but a word and a blow, his Will was his Law; tell him of Magna Carta, he would lay his hand on his sword and cry Magna Farta".{{sfn|Woolwrych|2003|p=95}} In a 2005 speech the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], repeated the claim that Cromwell had referred to Magna Carta as "Magna Farta".&lt;ref name=woolfspeech/&gt;

The radical groups that flourished during this period held differing opinions of Magna Carta. The [[Levellers]] rejected history and law as presented by their contemporaries, holding instead to an "anti-Normanism" viewpoint.{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=127}} [[John Lilburne]], for example, argued that Magna Carta contained only some of the freedoms that had supposedly existed under the Anglo-Saxons before being crushed by the [[Norman yoke]].{{sfn|Kewes|2006|p=279}} The Leveller [[Richard Overton (Leveller)|Richard Overton]] described the charter as "a beggarly thing containing many marks of intolerable bondage".{{sfn|Kewes|2006|p=226}} Both saw Magna Carta as a useful declaration of liberties that could be used against governments they disagreed with.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|pp=281–82}} [[Gerrard Winstanley]], the leader of the more extreme [[Diggers]], stated "the best lawes that England hath, [viz., the Magna Carta] were got by our Forefathers importunate petitioning unto the kings that still were their Task-masters; and yet these best laws are yoaks and manicles, tying one sort of people to be slaves to another; Clergy and Gentry have got their freedom, but the common people still are, and have been left servants to work for them."{{sfn|Hill|2006|pp=111–22}}{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|p=85}}

====Glorious Revolution====
[[File:Magna Carta - John Pine engraving 1733.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1733 engraving of the Charter of 1215 by [[John Pine]]]]
The first attempt at a proper [[historiography]] was undertaken by [[Robert Brady (writer)|Robert Brady]],{{sfn|Pocock|1987|pp=182–228}} who refuted the supposed antiquity of Parliament and belief in the immutable continuity of the law. Brady realised that the liberties of the Charter were limited and argued that the liberties were the grant of the King. By putting Magna Carta in historical context, he cast doubt on its contemporary political relevance;{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=165}} his historical understanding did not survive the [[Glorious Revolution]], which, according to the historian [[J. G. A. Pocock]], "marked a setback for the course of English historiography."{{sfn|Pocock|1987|p=228}}

According to the [[Whig interpretation of history]], the Glorious Revolution was an example of the reclaiming of ancient liberties. Reinforced with [[John Locke|Lockean]] concepts, the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] believed England's constitution to be a [[social contract]], based on documents such as Magna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]].{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=169–70}}  The ''English Liberties'' (1680, in later versions often ''British Liberties'') by the Whig propagandist [[Henry Care]] (d. 1688) was a cheap polemical book that was influential and much-reprinted, in the American colonies as well as Britain, and made Magna Carta central to the history and the contemporary legitimacy of its subject.{{sfn|Breay|Harrison|2015|pp=110–11, 134}}

Ideas about the nature of law in general were beginning to change. In 1716, the [[Septennial Act 1716|Septennial Act]] was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer considered its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the [[Triennial Acts|Triennial Act]] (1694) (enacted less than a quarter of a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|pp=113–14}}

It also greatly extended the powers of Parliament. Under this new constitution, monarchical [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]] was replaced by [[Parliamentary sovereignty|parliamentary supremacy]]. It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would be challenged by the likes of [[Granville Sharp]]. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal any part of it. He also held that the Charter prohibited [[slavery]].{{sfn|Linebaugh|2009|pp=113–14}}

Sir [[William Blackstone]] published a critical edition of the 1215 Charter in 1759, and gave it the numbering system still used today.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=67–68}} In 1763, Member of Parliament [[John Wilkes]] was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, ''No. 45, 23 April 1763''; he cited Magna Carta continually.{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=207}} [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden#John Wilkes MP|Lord Camden]] denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodrich|first1=Chauncey A.|title=The Speeches of Lord Chatham|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/cbo/chatham/chat09.htm|publisher=Classic Persuasion}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Paine]], in his ''[[Rights of Man]]'', would disregard Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights on the grounds that they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord Irvine of Lairg 'The Spirit of Magna Carta Continues to Resonate in Modern Law'|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/lairg|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=7 November 2014|date=December 2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070809/http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Research_and_Education/pops/pop39/lairg|archivedate=6 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use in the Thirteen Colonies and the United States====

When English colonists left for the New World, they brought royal charters that established the colonies. The [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay Company]] charter, for example, stated that the colonists would "have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural subjects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brink|first1=Robert J.|title=History on display: one lawyer's musings on Magna Carta|journal=Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly|date=18 August 2014|url=http://masslawyersweekly.com/reprints/history-on-display-one-lawyers-musings-on-the-magna-carta/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Virginia Company|Virginia Charter]] of 1606, which was largely drafted by Sir Edward Coke, stated that the colonists would have the same "liberties, franchises and immunities" as people born in England.{{sfn|Howard|2008|p=28}} The [[Massachusetts Body of Liberties]] contained similarities to clause 29 of Magna Carta; when drafting it, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] viewed Magna Carta as the chief embodiment of English common law.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|p=194}} The other colonies would follow their example. In 1638, [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] sought to recognise Magna Carta as part of the law of the province, but the request was denied by Charles I.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|p=195}}

In 1687, [[William Penn]] published ''The Excellent Privilege of Liberty and Property: being the birth-right of the Free-Born Subjects of England'', which contained the first copy of Magna Carta printed on American soil.

The development of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the [[Thirteen Colonies]], which retained an adherence to [[English common law]], but it directly affected the relationship between Britain and the colonies.{{sfn|Hazeltine|1917|pp=183–84}} When American colonists fought against Britain, they were fighting not so much for new freedom, but to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta.&lt;ref name="NARA-legacy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta and Its American Legacy|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/legacy.html|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the [[United States Constitution]] became the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law of the land]], recalling the manner in which Magna Carta had come to be regarded as fundamental law.&lt;ref name="NARA-legacy"/&gt; The Constitution's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] guarantees that "no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law", a phrase that was derived from Magna Carta.&lt;ref name="NARA-Magna Carta"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Magna Carta|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Constitution included a similar writ in the [[Denied powers|Suspension Clause]], Article 1, Section 9: "The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Habeas Corpus|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/habeas+corpus|publisher=Free Dictionary|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these proclaim that no person may be imprisoned or detained without evidence that he or she committed a crime. The [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] states that "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." The writers of the U.S. Constitution wished to ensure that the rights they already held, such as those that they believed were provided by Magna Carta, would be preserved unless explicitly curtailed.{{sfn|Stimson|2004|p=124}}{{sfn|Black|1999|p=10}}

===19th–21st centuries===

====Interpretation====
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 226 - John Signs the Great Charter.jpg|thumb|A romanticised 19th-century recreation of King John signing Magna Carta]]
Initially, the Whig interpretation of Magna Carta and its role in constitutional history remained dominant during the 19th century. The historian [[William Stubbs]]'s ''Constitutional History of England'', published in the 1870s, formed the high-water mark of this view.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=199–200}} Stubbs argued that Magna Carta had been a major step in the shaping of the English nation, and he believed that the barons at Runnymede in 1215 were not just representing the nobility, but the people of England as a whole, standing up to a tyrannical ruler in the form of King John.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=199–200}}{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=1}}

This view of Magna Carta began to recede. The late-Victorian jurist and historian [[Frederic William Maitland]] provided an alternative academic history in 1899, which began to return Magna Carta to its historical roots.{{sfn|Simmons|1998|pp=69–83}} In 1904, [[Edward Jenks]] published an article entitled "The Myth of Magna Carta", which undermined the previously accepted view of Magna Carta.{{sfn|Galef|1998|pp=78–79}} Historians such as [[Albert Pollard]] agreed with Jenks in concluding that Edward Coke had largely "invented" the myth of Magna Carta in the 17th century; these historians argued that the 1215 charter had not referred to liberty for the people at large, but rather to the protection of baronial rights.{{sfn|Pollard|1912|pp=31–32}}

This view also became popular in wider circles, and in 1930 [[Sellar and Yeatman]] published their parody on English history, ''[[1066 and All That]]'', in which they  mocked the supposed importance of Magna Carta and its promises of universal liberty: "Magna Charter was therefore the chief cause of Democracy in England, and thus a ''Good Thing'' for everyone (except the Common People)".{{sfn|Barnes|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=283}}

In many literary representations of the medieval past, however, Magna Carta remained a foundation of English national identity. Some authors used the medieval roots of the document as an argument to preserve the social status quo, while others pointed to Magna Carta to challenge perceived economic injustices.{{sfn|Simmons|1998|pp=69–83}} The [[Baronial Order of Magna Charta]] was formed in 1898 to promote the ancient principles and values felt to be displayed in Magna Carta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magnacharta.com/|title=Home|publisher=The Baronial Order of Magna Charta|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal profession in England and the United States continued to hold Magna Carta in high esteem; they were instrumental in forming the Magna Carta Society in 1922 to protect the meadows at Runnymede from development in the 1920s, and in 1957, the [[American Bar Association]] erected the [[Magna Carta Memorial]] at Runnymede.&lt;ref name="NARA-Magna Carta"/&gt;{{sfn|Wright|1990|p=167}}{{sfn|Holt|1992b|pp=2–3}} The prominent lawyer [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning]] described Magna Carta in 1956 as "the greatest constitutional document of all times&lt;!-- [sic]; see note above --&gt;&amp;nbsp;– the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot".{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}

====Repeal of articles and constitutional influence====
Radicals such as Sir [[Francis Burdett]] believed that Magna Carta could not be repealed,{{sfn|Burdett|1810|p=41}} but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] (9 [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Geo. 4]] c. 31 s. 1)&lt;!-- ie section 1 of the 31st statute issued in the 9th year of George IV --&gt;&lt;!-- "nor will We not" in clause 29 is correctly quoted from this source --&gt;,&lt;ref name=UKStatute/&gt; was the first time a clause of Magna Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was repealed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta|url=http://www.sagamoreinstitute.org/library-article/magna-carta/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105004655/http://www.sagamoreinstitute.org/library-article/magna-carta/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=5 November 2014|publisher=Segamore Institute|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1863]], and in modern [[Northern Ireland]] and also in the modern [[Republic of Ireland]] by the [[Statute Law (Ireland) Revision Act 1872]].&lt;ref name=UKStatute/&gt;

Many later attempts to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta. The British dominions, Australia and New Zealand,{{sfn|Clark|2000}} Canada{{sfn|Kennedy|1922|p=228}} (except [[Quebec]]), and formerly the [[Union of South Africa]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], reflected the influence of Magna Carta in their laws, and the Charter's effects can be seen in the laws of other states that evolved from the [[British Empire]].{{sfn|Drew|2004|pp=pxvi–pxxiii}}

====Modern legacy====
[[File:ABA-wyrdlight-815935.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Magna Carta Memorial]] at Runnymede, designed by Sir [[Edward Maufe]] and erected by the [[American Bar Association]] in 1957. The memorial stands in the meadow known historically as Long Mede: it is likely that the actual site of the sealing of Magna Carta lay further east, towards [[Egham]] and [[Staines-upon-Thames|Staines]].{{sfn|Tatton-Brown|2015|p=36}}]]

Magna Carta continues to have a powerful iconic status in British society, being cited by politicians and lawyers in support of constitutional positions.{{sfn|Danziger|Gillingham|2004|p=278}}{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} Its perceived guarantee of trial by jury and other civil liberties, for example, led to [[Tony Benn]]'s reference to the debate in 2008 over whether to increase the maximum time terrorism suspects could be [[Remand (detention)|held without charge]] from 28 to 42 days as "the day Magna Carta was repealed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/so-will-the-revolution-start-in-haltemprice-and-howden-846938.html|title=So will the revolution start in Haltemprice and Howden?|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=14 June 2008|accessdate=16 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although rarely invoked in court in the modern era, in 2012 the [[Occupy London]] protestors attempted to use Magna Carta in resisting their eviction from [[St. Paul's Churchyard]] by the [[City of London]]. In his judgment the [[Master of the Rolls]] gave this short shrift, noting somewhat drily that although clause 29 was considered by many the foundation of the rule of law in England, he did not consider it directly relevant to the case, and the two other surviving clauses actually concerned the rights of the Church and the City of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=David Allen|url=http://blogs.ft.com/david-allen-green/2014/06/16/the-myth-of-magna-carta/|title=The myth of Magna Carta|registration=yes|date=16 June 2014|accessdate=21 January 2015|authorlink=David Allen Green|work=Financial Times|quote=The sarcasm of the Master of the Rolls was plain|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/160.html|title=The Mayor Commonalty and Citizens of London v Samede|date=22 February 2012|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Carta carries little legal weight in modern Britain, as most of its clauses have been repealed and relevant rights ensured by other statutes, but the historian James Holt remarks that the survival of the 1215 charter in national life is a "reflexion of the continuous development of English law and administration" and symbolic of the many struggles between authority and the law over the centuries.{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=2}} The historian W. L. Warren has observed that "many who knew little and cared less about the content of the Charter have, in nearly all ages, invoked its name, and with good cause, for it meant more than it said".{{sfn|Warren|1990|p=240}}

It also remains a topic of great interest to historians; [[Natalie Fryde]] characterised the charter as "one of the holiest of cows in English medieval history", with the debates over its interpretation and meaning unlikely to end.{{sfn|Fryde|2001|p=1}} In many ways still a "sacred text", Magna Carta is generally considered part of the [[uncodified constitution]] [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|of the United Kingdom]]; in a 2005 speech, the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Harry Woolf, Baron Woolf|Lord Woolf]], described it as the "first of a series of instruments that now are recognised as having a special constitutional status".{{sfn|Holt|1992b|p=21}}&lt;ref name=woolfspeech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magnacarta800th.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Precedent_Recent_Constitutional_Change.pdf|title=Magna Carta: a precedent for recent constitutional change|work=Judiciary of England and Wales Speeches|date=15 June 2005|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magna Carta was reprinted in [[New Zealand]] in 1881 as one of the Imperial Acts in force there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nzlii.org/nz/legis/imp_act_1881/mc25ei84/ |title= Magna Carta (25 Ed I) |publisher= New Zealand Law online |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clause 29 of the document remains in force as part of New Zealand law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/imperial/1297/0029/latest/whole.html#DLM10926|title=Magna Carta 1297 No 29 (as at 03 September 2007), Imperial Act – New Zealand Legislation|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|language=en-NZ|access-date=2018-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document also continues to be honoured in the United States as an antecedent of the [[United States Constitution]] and [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].&lt;ref name=ChartersOfFreedom&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_q_and_a.html|title=United States Constitution Q + A|work=The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the UK lent one of four surviving originals of the 1215 Magna Carta to the United States for their bicentennial celebrations and also donated an ornate display case for it. The original was returned after one year, but a replica and the case are still on display in the [[United States Capitol]] Crypt in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magna Carta Replica and Display|url=http://www.aoc.gov/capitol-hill/other/magna-carta-replica-and-display|publisher=[[Architect of the Capitol]]|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Physical format===
Numerous copies, known as [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]], were made of the various charters, and many of them still survive.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=37}} The documents were written in heavily abbreviated medieval Latin in clear handwriting, using [[quill]] pens on sheets of [[parchment]] made from sheep skin, approximately {{convert|15|by|20|in}} across.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=143}} They were sealed with the royal great seal by an official called the spigurnel, equipped with a special seal press, using beeswax and resin.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=38–39}}{{sfn|Hindley|1990|p=143}} There were no signatures on the charter of 1215, and the barons present did not attach their own [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] to it.{{sfn|Browning|1898|p=50}} The charters were not numbered or divided into paragraphs or separate clauses at the time; the numbering system used today was introduced by the jurist Sir [[William Blackstone]] in 1759.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|pp=67–68}}

===Exemplifications===

====1215 exemplifications====
[[File:Magna-carta-1225-C6257-03.jpg|thumb|upright|1225 charter, held in the British Library, with the [[Great Seal of the Realm|royal great seal]] attached]]
At least thirteen original copies of the charter of 1215 were issued by the royal chancery during that year, seven in the first tranche distributed on 24 June and another six later; they were sent to county sheriffs and bishops, who were probably charged for the privilege.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=34–35}} Slight variations exist between the surviving copies, and there was probably no single "master copy".{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=34}} Of these documents, only four survive, all held in England: two now at the [[British Library]], one at [[Lincoln Cathedral]], and one at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=35}} Each of these versions is slightly different in size and text, and each is considered by historians to be equally authoritative.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=34–36}}

The two 1215 charters held by the British Library, known as ''Cotton MS. Augustus II.106'' and ''Cotton Charter XIII.31a'', were acquired by the antiquarian [[Sir Robert Cotton, 1st Baronet, of Connington|Sir Robert Cotton]] in the 17th century.{{sfn|Breay|2010|pp=35–36}} One of these had been found by Humphrey Wyems, a London lawyer, who may have discovered it in a tailor's shop.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=36}} The other was found in [[Dover Castle]] in 1630 by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]]. The Dering charter is usually identified as the copy originally sent to the [[Cinque Ports]] in 1215.{{sfn|Turner|2003b|p=65}} (In 2015 it was announced that [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] had found the Dering copy to be identical to a transcription made in the 1290s from [[Canterbury Cathedral]]'s copy of 1215, and so he suggests that the Dering copy's destination was the Cathedral rather than the Cinque Ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/news/newsRelease.asp?newsPk=2372|title=Canterbury's Magna Carta rediscovered in time for 800th anniversary|publisher=Canterbury Christ Church University|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123005702/http://www.canterbury.ac.uk/news/newsRelease.asp?newsPk=2372|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/remarkable_discovery_says_copy_of_magna_carta_in_british_library_was_canterbury_charter_1_3923530|title=Remarkable discovery says copy of Magna Carta in British Library was 'Canterbury charter'|publisher=kentnews|accessdate=31 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123010037/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/news/remarkable_discovery_says_copy_of_magna_carta_in_british_library_was_canterbury_charter_1_3923530|archivedate=23 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) This copy was damaged in the [[Cotton library#The Ashburnham House fire|Cotton library fire]] of 1731, when its seal was badly melted. The parchment was somewhat shrivelled but otherwise relatively unscathed, and an engraved [[facsimile]] of the charter was made by [[John Pine]] in 1733.

===Clauses===
[[File:John penny.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the "heads" side of a silver King John penny|upright|A [[silver]] King John [[penny]]; much of Magna Carta concerned how royal revenues were raised]]
Most of the 1215 charter and later versions sought to govern the feudal rights of the Crown over the barons.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} Under the Angevin kings, and in particular during John's reign, the rights of the King had frequently been used inconsistently, often in an attempt to maximise the royal income from the barons. [[Feudal relief]] was one way that a king could demand money, and clauses 2 and 3 fixed the fees payable when an heir inherited an estate or when a minor came of age and took possession of his lands.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} [[Scutage]] was a form of medieval taxation; all knights and nobles owed military service to the Crown in return for their lands, which theoretically belonged to the King, but many preferred to avoid this service and offer money instead; the Crown  often used the cash to pay for mercenaries.{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=16–17}} The rate of scutage that should be payable, and the circumstances under which it was appropriate for the King to demand it, was uncertain and controversial; clauses 12 and 14 addressed the management of the process.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}}

The English judicial system had altered considerably over the previous century, with the royal judges playing a larger role in delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, and the role of the Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=29}} Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=29}} In the United States, for example, the [[Supreme Court of California]] interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential of incarceration be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Justice Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/12C3d323.htm 12 Cal. 3d 323] (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John of England (John Lackland).jpg|thumb|upright|left|King John holding a church, painted c. 1250–59 by [[Matthew Paris]]]]
[[Royal forest]]s were economically important in medieval England and were both protected and exploited by the Crown, supplying the King with hunting grounds, raw materials, and money.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=29–30}} They were subject to special royal jurisdiction and the resulting forest law was, according to the historian Richard Huscroft, "harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will".{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=97}} The size of the forests had expanded under the Angevin kings, an unpopular development.{{sfn|Poole|1993|p=29}}

The 1215 charter had several clauses relating to the royal forests; clauses 47 and 48 promised to deforest the lands added to the forests under John and investigate the use of royal rights in this area, but notably did not address the forestation of the previous kings, while clause 53 promised some form of redress for those affected by the recent changes, and clause 44 promised some relief from the operation of the forest courts.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}} Neither Magna Carta nor the subsequent Charter of the Forest proved entirely satisfactory as a way of managing the political tensions arising in the operation of the royal forests.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}}

Some of the clauses addressed wider economic issues. The concerns of the barons over the treatment of their debts to Jewish moneylenders, who occupied a special position in medieval England and were by tradition under the King's protection, were addressed by clauses 10 and 11.{{sfn|Poole|1993|pp=353, 474}} The charter concluded this section with the phrase "debts owing to other than Jews shall be dealt with likewise", so it is debatable to what extent the Jews were being singled out by these clauses.{{sfn|Hillaby|2013|p=23}} Some issues were relatively specific, such as clause 33 which ordered the removal of all [[fishing weir]]s—an important and growing source of revenue at the time—from England's rivers.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=32}}

The role of the English Church had been a matter for great debate in the years prior to the 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=190}} After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=189}}{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=121}}

[[Investiture Controversy|These changes]] brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question.{{sfn|Huscroft|2005|p=189}} As described above, John had come to a compromise with Pope Innocent III in exchange for his political support for the King, and clause 1 of Magna Carta prominently displayed this arrangement, promising the freedoms and liberties of the church.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}} The importance of this clause may also reflect the role of Archbishop Langton in the negotiations: Langton had taken a strong line on this issue during his career.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=28}}

====Clauses remaining in English law====
Only three clauses of Magna Carta still remain on statute in England and Wales.{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} These clauses concern 1) the freedom of the English Church, 2) the "ancient liberties" of the City of London (clause 13 in the 1215 charter, clause 9 in the 1297 statute), and 3) a right to due legal process (clauses 39 and 40 in the 1215 charter, clause 29 in the 1297 statute).{{sfn|Breay|2010|p=48}} In detail, these clauses (using the numbering system from the 1297 statute) state that:

{{quotation|
* I. FIRST, We have granted to God, and by this our present Charter have confirmed, for Us and our Heirs for ever, that the Church of England shall be free, and shall have all her whole Rights and Liberties inviolable. We have granted also, and given to all the Freemen of our Realm, for Us and our Heirs for ever, these Liberties under-written, to have and to hold to them and their Heirs, of Us and our Heirs for ever.
* IX. THE [[City of London]] shall have all the old Liberties and Customs which it hath been used to have. Moreover We will and grant, that all other Cities, Boroughs, Towns, and the Barons of the [[Cinque Ports|Five Ports]], as with all other Ports, shall have all their Liberties and free Customs.
* XXIX. NO Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or be disseised of his Freehold, or Liberties, or free Customs, or be outlawed, or exiled, or any other wise destroyed; nor will We not pass upon him, nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his Peers, or by the [[Law of the land]]. We will sell to no man, we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right.&lt;ref name=UKStatute&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 |title=(Magna Carta) (1297) (c. 9) |work=UK Statute Law Database |accessdate=2 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905014018/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1517519 |archivedate=5 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Male expendability''' is the idea that society can better cope with the loss of a typical man than with the loss of a typical woman.

[[Øystein Gullvåg Holter]] argues that the male-led Russian government's belief in male expendability contributed to their delay in seeking international help during the [[Kursk submarine disaster]], in which an all-male crew was lost. He notes, "If 118 women had been killed, alarm bells regarding discrimination against women would probably have gone off around the world." He notes that able-bodied males were viewed as a more legitimate target during wars in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]], [[Kosovan War|Kosovo]], [[Timorese War|Timor]], [[Rwandan War|Rwanda]], and [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holter |first=Øystein Gullvåg |authorlink=Øystein Gullvåg Holter |title=A theory of gendercide |journal=[[Journal of Genocide Research]] |date=March 2002 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=11–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ivana Milojević notes that while patriarchy assigns the role of [[sex object]] to women, it assigns to men the role of violence-object, with male expendability being corollary to the sexual objectification of girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ivana Milojević |title=Why the Creation of a Better World is Premised on Achieving Gender Equity and on Celebrating Multiple Gender Diversities |journal=[[Journal of Futures Studies]] |date=June 2012 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' or ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' often are about all-male combat teams. Michael D. Clark notes that [[Adolf Hitler]] considered gay men expendable by means of [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[Nazi medical experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=J. Michael |title=From Gay Men's Lives: Toward a More Inclusive, Ecological Vision |journal=[[The Journal of Men's Studies]] |date=May 1993 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=347–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manosphere]] critics of feminism have argued that poor and working-class men "are cannon fodder abroad and expendable labor at home, trapped beneath a glass floor in jobs nobody really wants—farm workers, roofers, garbage men—and injured at far higher rates than women".&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/mens-rights-activism-the-red-pill|author=[[Jeff Sharlet (writer)|Jeff Sharlet]] |date=February 3, 2014 |title=What Kind of Man Joins the Men's Rights Movement? |publisher=GQ |accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Block]] argues in ''The Case for Discrimination'' that male expendability is the result of women's being the bottleneck of reproductive capacity in a population. This theme was echoed in [[Warren Farrell]]'s ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]''.

With further research, large-scale chemical processing in a refinery-style environment could help process millions of gallons of "pig biocrude" per day.  However, this technology is still in its infancy and could produce only {{convert|18|USoz}} of oil per {{convert|1|USgal}} of manure.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;  In 2006, preparations for a construction of a pilot plant started.&lt;ref name=feedstuffs&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  It is developed by Snapshot Energy, a start-up firm.&lt;ref name=gazette/&gt;

According to the tests conducted by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] pig manure biocrude produced by current technology contains 15% water, [[sulfur]] and char waste containing heavy metals, which should be removed to improve the quality of oil.&lt;ref name=india&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21286">'''Medicalization''' or '''medicalisation''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise, -ize (-isation, -ization)|see spelling differences]]) is the process by which human conditions and problems come to be defined and treated as [[medical conditions]], and thus become the subject of medical study, diagnosis, [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], or treatment. Medicalization can be driven by new evidence or hypotheses about conditions; by changing social attitudes or economic considerations; or by the development of new medications or treatments.

Medicalization is studied from a [[sociology|sociologic perspective]] in terms of the role and power of professionals, patients, and corporations, and also for its implications for ordinary people whose self-identity and life decisions may depend on the prevailing concepts of health and illness. Once a condition is classified as medical, a [[medical model of disability]] tends to be used in place of a [[social model of disability|social model]]. Medicalization may also be termed "'''pathologization'''" or (pejoratively) "[[disease mongering]]". Since medicalization is the social process through which a condition becomes a medical disease in need of treatment, medicalization may be viewed as a benefit to human society. Upon identification of a condition as a disease, certain symptoms and conditions can be treated, and this will improve the overall quality of life.

The concept of medicalization was devised by sociologists to explain how medical knowledge is applied to behaviors which are not self-evidently medical or biological.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Kevin|title=An introduction to the sociology of health and illness|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-6400-2|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5bHxQBNWGHMC&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''medicalization'' entered the sociology literature in the 1970s in the works of [[Irving Zola]], [[Peter Conrad (sociologist)|Peter Conrad]] and [[Thomas Szasz]], among others. According to Dr. Cassell's book, ''The Nature of Suffering and the Goals of Medicine (2004),'' the expansion of medical social control is being justified as a means of explaining deviance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173843216|title=The nature of suffering and the goals of medicine|last=1928-|first=Cassell, Eric J.,|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195156164|edition=2nd|location=New York|oclc=173843216}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sociologists viewed medicalization as a form of social control in which medical authority expanded into domains of everyday existence, and they rejected medicalization in the name of liberation. This critique was embodied in works such as Conrad's "The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on medicalization of deviance", published in 1973 ([[Hyperkinetic disorder|hyperkinesis]] was the term then used to describe what we might now call [[ADHD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Conrad P |title=The discovery of hyperkinesis: notes on the medicalization of deviant behavior |journal=Soc Probl |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=12&amp;ndash;21 |date=October 1975 |pmid=11662312 |doi= 10.1525/sp.1975.23.1.03a00020|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[opium]] was used to pacify children in ancient Egypt before 2000 BC.

These sociologists did not believe medicalization to be a new phenomenon, arguing that medical authorities had always been concerned with social behavior and traditionally functioned as agents of social control (Foucault, 1965; Szasz,1970; Rosen). However, these authors took the view that increasingly sophisticated technology had extended the potential reach of medicalization as a form of social control, especially in terms of "psychotechnology" (Chorover,1973).

In the 1975 book ''Limits to medicine: Medical nemesis'' (1975), [[Ivan Illich]] put forth one of the earliest uses of the term "medicalization". Illich, a philosopher, argued that the medical profession harms people through [[iatrogenesis]], a process in which illness and social problems increase due to medical intervention. Illich saw iatrogenesis occurring on three levels: the ''clinical'', involving serious [[side effects]] worse than the original condition; the ''social'', whereby the general public is made docile and reliant on the medical profession to cope with life in their society; and the ''structural'', whereby the idea of aging and dying as medical illnesses effectively "medicalized" human life and left individuals and societies less able to deal with these "natural" processes.

The concept of medicalization dovetailed with some aspects of the 1970s [[feminist]] movement. Critics such as [[Barbara Ehrenreich|Ehrenreich]] and English (1978) argued that women's bodies were being medicalized by the predominantly male medical profession. Menstruation and pregnancy had come to be seen as medical problems requiring interventions such as [[hysterectomies]].

[[Marxist]]s such as Vicente Navarro (1980) linked medicalization to an oppressive [[capitalist]] society. They argued that medicine disguised the underlying causes of disease, such as [[social inequality]] and poverty, and instead presented health as an individual issue. Others&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Culture, Health and Illness|last = Helman|first = Cecil|publisher = Arnold|year = 2007|isbn = 9780340914502|location = London|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/?id=C3BoQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the power and prestige of the medical profession, including the use of terminology to mystify and of professional rules to exclude or subordinate others.

Tiago Correia (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Correia |first=Tiago |year=2017 |title=Revisiting Medicalization: A Critique of the Assumptions of What Counts As Medical Knowledge |journal=Front. Sociol. |volume=2 |issue=14 |doi=10.3389/fsoc.2017.00014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; offers an alternative perspective on medicalization. He argues that medicalization needs to be detached from biomedicine to overcome much of the criticism it has faced, and to protect its value in contemporary sociological debates. Building on [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer]]'s hermeneutical view of medicine, he focuses on medicine's common traits, regardless of empirical differences in both time and space. Medicalization and social control are viewed as distinct analytical dimensions that in practice may or may not overlap. Correia contends that the idea of "making things medical" needs to include all forms of medical knowledge in a global society, not simply those forms linked to the established (bio)medical professions. Looking at "knowledge", beyond the confines of professional boundaries, may help us understand the multiplicity of ways in which medicalization can exist in different times and societies, and allow contemporary societies to avoid such pitfalls as "demedicalization" (through a turn towards [[complementary and alternative medicine]]) on the one hand, or the over-rapid and unregulated adoption of biomedical medicine in non-western societies on the other. The challenge is to determine what medical knowledge is present, and how it is being used to medicalize behaviors and symptoms.

== Professionals, patients, corporations and society ==
Several decades on the definition of medicalization is complicated, if for no other reason than because the term is so widely used. Many contemporary critics position [[pharmaceutical companies]] in the space once held by doctors as the supposed [[catalysts]] of medicalization. Titles such as ''"The making of a disease"'' or ''"Sex, drugs, and marketing"'' critique the [[pharmaceutical industry]] for shunting everyday problems into the domain of professional [[biomedicine]]. At the same time, others reject as implausible any suggestion that society rejects [[drugs]] or [[drug companies]] and highlight that the same drugs that are allegedly used to treat [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]s from [[societal norms]] also help many people live their lives. Even scholars who critique the societal implications of brand-name drugs generally remain open to these drugs' curative effects — a far cry from earlier calls for a revolution against the biomedical establishment.  The emphasis in many quarters has come to be on "overmedicalization" rather than "medicalization" in itself.

Others, however, argue that in practice the process of medicalization tends to strip subjects of their social context, so they come to be understood in terms of the prevailing biomedical [[ideology]], resulting in a disregard for overarching social causes such as unequal distribution of power and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15210098 | doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.01.003 | volume=59 | issue=6 | title=The medical text: between biomedicine and hegemony |date=September 2004 | author=Filc D | journal=Soc Sci Med | pages=1275–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of publications by [[Mens Sana Monographs]] have focused on medicine as a [[corporate]] capitalist enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=2;spage=19;epage=51;aulast=Singh "Medicine as a corporate enterprise, patient welfare centered profession, or patient welfare centered professional enterprise?"] Mens Sana Monographs, 3(2), p19-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=5;epage=35;aulast=Singh "The connection between academia and industry"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p5-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajai R Singh, Shakuntala A Singh, 2005, [http://www.msmonographs.org/article.asp?issn=0973-1229;year=2005;volume=3;issue=1;spage=41;epage=80;aulast=Singh "Public welfare agenda or corporate research agenda?"], Mens Sana Monographs, 3(1), p41-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Relación Médico Paciente.png|thumb|right|Conversation between doctor and patient]]

The physician's role in this present-day notion of medicalization is similarly complex. On the one hand, the doctor remains an authority figure who [[prescribes]] [[pharmaceuticals]] to [[patient]]s. However, in some countries, such as the USA, ubiquitous [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] encourages patients to ask for particular drugs by name, thereby creating a conversation between consumer and drug company that threatens to cut the doctor out of the loop. Additionally, there is a widespread concern regarding the extent of the [[pharmaceutical marketing]] direct to doctors and other healthcare professionals. Examples of this direct marketing are visits by salespeople, funding of journals, training courses or conferences, incentives for prescribing, and the routine provision of "information" written by the pharmaceutical company.

The role of patients in this economy has also changed. Once regarded as passive victims of medicalization, patients can now occupy active positions as [[advocates]], [[consumer]]s, or even agents of change.

The antithesis of medicalization is the process of [[paramedicalization]], where human conditions come under the attention of [[alternative medicine]], [[traditional medicine]] or any of numerous non-medical health approaches. Medicalization and paramedicalization can sometimes be contradictory and conflicting, but they also support and strengthen each other since they both ensure that questions of health and illness stay in sharp focus in defining human conditions and problems.

== Areas ==
A 2002 editorial in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' warned of inappropriate medicalization leading to disease mongering, where the boundaries of the definition of illnesses are expanded to include personal problems as medical problems or risks of diseases are emphasized to broaden the market for medications. The authors noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Inappropriate medicalisation carries the dangers of unnecessary labelling, poor treatment decisions, iatrogenic illness, and economic waste, as well as the opportunity costs that result when resources are diverted away from treating or preventing more serious disease. At a deeper level it may help to feed unhealthy obsessions with health, obscure or mystify sociological or political explanations for health problems, and focus undue attention on pharmacological, individualised, or privatised solutions.&lt;ref name=Moynihan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moynihan|first1=Ray|last2=Heath|first2=Iona|last3=Henry|first3=David|title=Selling sickness: the pharmaceutical industry and disease mongering|journal=[[BMJ]]|date=13 April 2002|volume=324 | issue = 7342 |pages=886–891|pmid=11950740|pmc=1122833|doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7342.886}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For many years, marginalized psychiatrists (such as [[Peter Breggin]], [[Paula Caplan]], [[Thomas Szasz]]) and outside critics (such as [[Stuart A. Kirk]]) have "been accusing psychiatry of engaging in the systematic medicalization of normality". More recently these concerns have come from insiders who have worked for and promoted the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (e.g., [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]], [[Allen Frances]]).&lt;ref name=stuarta&gt;{{cite book |author= Kirk, S. A., Gomory, T., &amp; Cohen, D. |title=Mad Science: Psychiatric Coercion, Diagnosis, and Drugs |year=2013 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |page= 185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Rush]], the father of American psychiatry, claimed that Black people had black skin because they were ill with hereditary leprosy. Consequently, he considered [[vitiligo]] as a "spontaneous cure".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Thomas Szasz | title=The Manufacture of Madness | publisher=Syracuse University Press | year=1970 | pages=153–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Franco Basaglia]] and his followers, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups.&lt;ref name="Sapouna"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sapouna|first1=Lydia |last2=Herrmann|first2=Peter|title=Knowledge in Mental Health: Reclaiming the Social |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1-X6iP-m9UC&amp;pg=PA70|publisher=Nova Publishers |location=Hauppauge|year=2006|page=70|isbn=1-59454-812-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances.&lt;ref name="Metzl"&gt;{{cite book|last=Metzl|first=Jonathan|title=The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease|year=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-8592-8|page=14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1Bg9QEiCAMC&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}

The [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] allegedly caused from the 1980s a "profound re-medicalization of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Aggleton, Peter |author2=Parker, Richard Bordeaux |author3=Barbosa, Regina Maria |title=Framing the sexual subject: the politics of gender, sexuality, and power |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=0-520-21838-8 |oclc= |doi=}} p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carole S.

According to Kittrie, a number of phenomena considered "deviant", such as [[alcoholism]], [[drug addiction]], [[prostitution]], [[pedophilia]], and [[masturbation]] ("self-abuse"), were originally considered as moral, then legal, and now medical problems.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Nick |title=The therapeutic community movement: charisma and routinization |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lc4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1|publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1989 |page=1 |isbn=0-415-02913-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Kittrie"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittrie |first=Nicholas |title=The right to be different: deviance and enforced therapy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sIVqAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |location= |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-1319-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innumerable other conditions such as obesity, smoking cigarettes, draft malingering, bachelorhood, divorce, unwanted pregnancy, kleptomania, and grief, have been declared a disease by medical and psychiatric authorities who hold impeccable institutional credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Thomas Szasz | title=The Theology of Medicine | publisher=Harper &amp; Row | year=1977 | page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these perceptions, peculiar deviants were subjected to moral, then legal, and now medical modes of social control.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;{{rp|1}} Similarly, Conrad and Schneider concluded their review of the medicalization of deviance by identifying three major paradigms that have reigned over deviance designations in different historical periods: deviance as sin; deviance as crime; and deviance as sickness.&lt;ref name="Manning"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conrad|first1=Peter|last2=Schneider |first2=Joseph |title=Deviance and medicalization: from badness to sickness|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYpZjDD67dkC&amp;pg=PA36|publisher=Temple University Press|location=|year=1992|page=36|isbn=0-87722-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}}

According to Mike Fitzpatrick, resistance to medicalization was a common theme of the [[gay liberation]], [[anti-psychiatry]], and [[feminist movement]]s of the 1970s, but now there is actually no resistance to the advance of government intrusion in lifestyle if it is thought to be justified in terms of public health.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Mike|title=From ‘nanny state’ to ‘therapeutic state’|journal=[[The British Journal of General Practice]]|date=August 2004|volume=1|issue=54(505)|pages=645|pmid=15517694|pmc=1324868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the pressure for medicalization also comes from society itself.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt; Feminists, who once opposed state intervention as oppressive and patriarchal, now demand more coercive and intrusive measures to deal with child abuse and domestic violence.&lt;ref name=Fitzpatrick/&gt;

According to [[Thomas Szasz]], "the [[Therapeutic State|therapeutic state]] swallows up everything human on the seemingly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of health and medicine, just as the theological state had swallowed up everything human on the perfectly rational ground that nothing falls outside the province of God and religion".&lt;ref name="Szasz, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szasz|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Szasz|title=The Therapeutic State: The Tyranny of Pharmacracy|journal=[[The Independent Review]]|date=Spring 2001|volume=V|issue=4|pages=485–521|url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_05_4_szasz.pdf|accessdate=20 January 2012|issn=1086-1653}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|515}}

{{Campaignbox War of 1812: Naval}}

The '''Nuku Hiva Campaign''' was an armed conflict between the United States and the [[French Polynesia|Polynesian]] inhabitants of [[Nuku Hiva]] during the [[War of 1812]]. It occurred in 1813, following [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s decision to sail his fleet to the island for repairs before continuing his [[commerce raiding|raid]] against British shipping. Upon arrival, the Americans became involved in a tribal war and allied themselves with the [[Te I'i]] people against the [[Happah]] and [[Tai Pi (province)|Tai Pi]] clans.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/war-of-1812-commodore-david-porter-and-the-essex-in-the-south-pacific.htm|title=War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific|work=Military History ''Magazine''|publisher=History Net/Weider History Network|date=June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Operations in the Pacific began in early 1813 when Captain Porter entered the Pacific, via [[Cape Horn]], in the thirty-two gun [[frigate]] {{USS|Essex|1799|6}}. Originally Porter was assigned to rendezvous with two other warships but both encountered enemy resistance before their meeting and Porter went around the Horn alone. The mission was to harass the British whaling industry off South America and around the [[Galápagos Islands]]. For months the Americans cruised the [[Pacific Ocean|South Seas]] and they [[Action off James Island|captured]] several British whalers that they placed under navy command. By October 1813, ''Essex'' was in serious need of repairs so Porter decided to head for Nuku Hiva, an island in the [[Marquesas]], fearing that a British squadron would find him if he chose to take refuge in a South American port. The American fleet that went to the Marquesas included USS ''Essex'' and the liberated American whaler ''Barclay'', and nine captured British whalers: {{ship||Seringapatam|1799 ship|2}} (22 guns), ''Greenwich'' (10 guns), {{ship||Montezuma|1804 ship|2}} (18 guns), ''[[Essex Junior]]'' (16 guns), {{ship||Hector|1809 ship|2}} (11 guns), ''Charlton'' (10 guns), {{ship||Sir Andrew Hammond|1800 ship|2}}, and ''Catherine'' and {{ship||New Zealander|1808 ship|2}}, both of eight guns. In total, Captain Porter had just over 200 [[United States Navy]] officers and sailors, accompanied by a small detachment of no more than twenty [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] under the command of [[Lieutenant]] [[John M. Gamble]]. One of the sailors was the young [[midshipman]] [[David Farragut]], later the first United States Navy [[admiral]]. (Porter's son [[David Dixon Porter]] was the second U.S. Navy admiral.) Additionally, many of the prisoners from the prize enemy ships were Americans and they volunteered for service; some of the British captives too volunteered.&lt;ref name="HistoryNet" /&gt;

==Campaign==
===Founding of Madisonville===
Porter arrived off Nuku Hiva, on October 25, 1813 and he renamed it Madison's Island after United States President [[James Madison]]. Then Porter began making preparations to establish the first American naval base in the Pacific, as well as a small [[colony]], named [[Madisonville, Nuku Hiva|Madisonville]], to house the sailors. The small [[Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva|Fort Madison]], of four guns, was also constructed on a hill next to [[Massachusetts Bay, Nuku Hiva|Massachusetts Bay]] where an official flag raising ceremony took place on November 19, a seventeen gun salute was fired and some sort of message was buried in the ground for future Europeans to find, should they attempt to colonize the island after Porter and his men left. The declaration stated that the Te I'is were subjects of the United States and that the latter had officially laid claim to the island which Porter hoped would become an important naval base. In this time the sailors also scraped the [[copper sheathing|copper bottom]] hull of ''Essex'' and used smoke to drive out over 1,000 rats hiding in her works. The Americans described the native warriors as being tall and copper colored, with tattoos over their entire bodies. They wore loin cloths and some had capes made of tree bark; the warriors also carried large clubs or spears. The women were clothed in similar fashion to the men, and friendly to the sailors. A half-naked Englishman named Wilson was found to be living on the island, and had been for many years. He served as interpreter between the Americans and the native [[tribal chief|chiefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 31-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downes Expedition===
[[File:Nuku Hiva warrior 1813.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''A warrior of Nuku Hiva'' by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]], 1813]]
Nuku Hiva, at the time, was inhabited by many tribes of indigenous peoples, separated in villages by mountain peaks thousands of feet high. The area of land around Massachusetts Bay, which became the town of Madisonville, was controlled by Chief Gattanewa of the Te I'i and in return for rights to build the base, Gattanewa demanded that the Americans become his allies and help fight the war against the Happah. While the majority of the Americans were still building their settlement, [[Lieutenant]] [[John Downes (naval officer)|John Downes]], Marine Lieutenant John Gamble and a platoon of forty Marines, were ordered to proceed to an in-land [[redoubt]], located high in the mountains. The main effort of this expedition dragged along a wheeled 6 pound cannon for added effect. The amazement of the aboriginals at gunpowder weapons had already been noted upon their landing on the island. Several hundred Te I'i warriors accompanied the expedition which left the coast in the first week of November. After a journey through the jungle Downes and his men found the fort occupied by 3,000 to 4,000 hostiles. The Te I'i and their American allies attacked; during the fighting a rock hit Downes in the stomach, hurting him. A sailor was wounded by a spear to the neck, but he apparently survived. Lt. Gamble was singled out by a heavily built Happah warrior, who charged at him with a wooden club. Drawing his Mameluke sword Gamble blocked the club from knocking him unconscious as another Marine, seeing Gamble struggling, leveled his musket at the Happah's head. The shot, fired from only a foot away, nearly decapitated the warrior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The assault on the fort was successful and Downes reported that his men had killed five enemies and that the Te I'i massacred the wounded with clubs. Lieutenant Downes also said that he was very surprised that his allies did not eat the dead; instead they used their bones to make necklaces and fan handles. Over the next few days the chiefs of the Happah arrived at the coast to settle a peace agreement. One of the stipulations required the Happah to fight alongside the Te I'i and Americans in another operation against the Tai Pi.&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porter expedition===
Not long after subduing the Happah, the Tai Pi declared war on the Te I'i, the Happah, and the Americans. Thus followed one of the most significant amphibious landings in the history of American operations in the Pacific during the 1800s. It was unopposed but Captain Porter's fleet, combined with around 5,000 friendly warriors, in at least 200 [[canoe|war-canoe]]s, attacked the Tai Pi-held coastline. After that, thirty-six officers and men with a cannon, personally commanded by Porter, led the expedition to a fortress with seven-foot-high walls. A battle began when the Tai Pis ambushed the column in the jungle near the fort. Porter wrote "''We entered the bushes, and at every instant assailed by spears and stones, which came from different parties in the ambuscade. We could hear the snapping of the slings, the whistling of the stones, and the spears came quivering by us, but we could not percieve [sic] from whom they came.''" Skirmishing broke out and the expedition continued forward, encountering heavier resistance the farther they went. The column eventually made it to the fort where a pitched battle began that would last for hours. The Te I'is and Happahs provided the brunt of the attack while the Americans picked off enemy warriors with their muskets; the cannon was aimed at the fortifications. Upon arrival, a Marine sergeant notified Lt. Gamble and Capt. Porter of the hopelessness of their situation. The Marines in his squad were down to three or four cartridges of ammunition. Lt. Gamble and four men were given permission to run back to the beach for a resupply but upon their arrival the situation with their natives allies had deteriorated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Thousands of Tai Pis occupied the heavily defended position and they managed to repel the native attacks. Near the end of the engagement, the Te I'is and Happahs fled, leaving the thirty-six Americans to fend for themselves. Capt. Porter notified Lt. Gamble to order his Marines to cover the retreat back to the beach. Gamble positioned his men at the edge of a bush for one last decisive volley to ensure a strong enemy force did not pursue them. The American force lost one man killed and two wounded. One of the casualties was Lieutenant Downes, who suffered a badly broken leg. "''We returned to the beach much fatigued and harassed with marching and fighting,''" said Porter, who then sailed back to Madisonville.&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 35–36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Typee Valley===
[[File:Atlas pittoresque pl 054.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''An 1846 lithograph of Nuka Hiva.'']]
Once word spread that Porter and his allies had been defeated, the Te I'i and the Happah warriors began to turn on the Americans which led them to fear that Madisonville would be overrun and the inhabitants massacred. Porter wrote; "''I had now no alternative, but to prove our superiority by a successful attack upon the Typees.''" Porter organized and led most of his men on a second mission into enemy territory, this time overland to [[Typee Valley]] and with limited assistance from the Te I'i. The valley is a dense nine miles across by three miles and was the heartland of the Tai Pi where their villages were located and where they harvested [[coconut]] and [[breadfruit]]. By making a detour to avoid the heavily defended fort near the coast, Porter could make a surprise attack and use terrain and his superior weapons to their advantage. During one night the column marched to the top of a ridge overlooking the valley but because the Americans were exhausted from a long march, Porter decided to wait until the next morning to attack. The following day was rainy and windy according to reports, moisture had temporarily ruined the gunpowder, so the expedition spent another day resting and waiting for the powder to dry. Finally on November 30, the expedition launched their attack and soon after the Americans and Te I'is found themselves in another ambush which they fought off. After that Captain Porter sent the Tai Pi leaders a message advising them to cease hostilities at once or else their villages would be burned. The captain waited for some time and when it became apparent that the message had been ignored, the advance was continued. American forces and the Te I'is eventually won the day when night came and the enemy disengaged. There were no American casualties&lt;ref&gt;Boot, pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Porter claimed he took no pleasure in conquering a "''happy and heroic people''" and he described the aftermath of the battle as "''a scene of desolation and horror''". The captain also wrote that he left behind a "''line of smoking ruins''" when he started the return march to Madisonville. Tai Pi emissaries were not far behind and they brought the Americans "''countless''" [[hog (swine)|hog]]s as a peace offering. A British magazine later said that Porter was guilty of &lt;blockquote&gt; "''wantonly murdering unoffending savages''" to which the captain replied; "''Many may censure my conduct as wanton and unjust.... But let such reflect on our peculiar situation--a handful of men residing among numerous war-like tribes, liable every moment to be attacked by them and all cut off; our only hopes on safety was in convincing them of our great superiority over them and from what we have already seen, we must either attack them or be attacked.... Wars are not always just, and are rarely free from excesses--my conscience acquits me of any injustice, and no excesses were committed but what the Typees had in their power to stop by ceasing hostilities.''"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Boot, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Seringapatam'' Mutiny===
By 9 December 1813, USS ''Essex'' was repaired and ready for sailing. The sailors were not happy about leaving their Marquesan girlfriends and Porter had to suppress one [[mutiny]] by declaring that he "''would at once put a match to the magazine, and blow them all to eternity.''" A former Royal Navy sailor by the name of Robert White, was brought before Porter, having been accused of mutinous talk about ''Essex Junior''. White denied the accusations, now confirmed by other sailors, infuriating Porter. Porter thus drew his sword, face turning red, and yelled: "Run you scoundrel! Run for your life!" White ran off, jumped overboard, and swam to a nearby canoe.&lt;ref&gt;''Gamble of the Marines'', Raymond J Toner USN&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 250 crew members remained loyal and ''Essex'' made sail on 9 December 1813 to continue raiding. Most of the fleet left, though ''Sir Andrew Hammond'', ''Seringapatam'', and ''Greenwich'' remained at Nuku Hiva with Lieutenant John Gamble, two midshipmen, nineteen sailors and six prisoners, with the prisoners and some of the sailors being British nationals.

The situation was quiet until on 7 May 1814, the British sailors among the [[garrison]] mutinied. First they released the six prisoners and then attacked Fort Madison before taking over ''Seringapatam'' and getting away. Gamble was wounded in the foot and he was left adrift in a small boat with four others but they eventually made it to ''Sir Andrew Hammond''. Meanwhile the British interpreter Wilson was arousing trouble with the Te I'i by telling them that Porter would not come back. A few days later on 9 May, six of the American sailors were attacked on the beach by the Te I'i; a sixteen-year-old midshipman was killed along with four sailors while two others escaped, one of whom was wounded. Meanwhile, Gamble was alone on his ship, recovering from his wounded foot, when two war-canoes approached for an attack. The cannon of the ship were pre-loaded so single handedly Gamble limped from gun to gun, firing them as fast as possible, until the enemy fell back. On the next morning he gave the order to evacuate Madisonville, there being only eight men left on shore and all were either wounded or ill. Thus ended the existence of America's first naval base and colony in the Pacific Ocean. Captain Porter never returned to the island due to his capture by the British at the [[Battle of Valparaíso]] on March 28, 1814.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Post-script==
The mutineers sailed ''Seringapatam'' to [[New South Wales]]. From there she was sailed back to Great Britain where she was returned to her owners on payment of salvage.

''Cherub'' and {{HMS|Phoebe|1795|2}} had caught up with ''Essex'' and ''Essex Junior'' at Valparaiso. Eventually ''Phoebe'' was able to bring ''Essex'' to battle. The British were able to capture Porter and both American vessels.

Before he left Nuku Hiva, Gamble set fire to ''Greenwich''.&lt;ref&gt;James (1837), Vol. 6, pp.288-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He and seven men (four unfit for duty) then sailed ''Sir Andrew Hammond'' {{convert|2500|mi}} before they had the misfortune to meet up with {{HMS|Cherub|1806|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney (1976), Vol. 6, p.517.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|A first-class share of the salvage money was worth [[£sd|£]]72 13[[shilling|s]] 5[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, that of an ordinary seaman, was worth 16s 6d.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10958">In [[complex analysis]], the '''Phragmén–Lindelöf principle''' (or '''method'''), first formulated by [[Lars Edvard Phragmén]] (1863–1937) and [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]] (1870-1946) in 1908, is a technique which employs an auxiliary, parameterized function to prove the boundedness of a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (i.e, &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;M\ \ (z\in \Omega)&lt;/math&gt;) on an unbounded domain &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; when an additional (usually mild) condition constraining the growth of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is given.  It is a generalization of the [[maximum modulus principle]], which is only applicable to bounded domains.

==Background==

In the theory of complex functions, it is known that the [[Absolute value|modulus]] (absolute value) of a [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] (complex differentiable) function in the interior of a ''[[Bounded set|'''bounded''']]'' region is bounded by its modulus on the boundary of the region.  More precisely, if a non-constant function &lt;math&gt;f:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in a bounded region&lt;ref&gt;The term ''region'' is not uniformly employed in the literature; here, a ''region'' is taken to mean a nonempty connected open subset of the complex plane.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and [[continuous function|continuous]] on its closure &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}=\Omega\cup\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|f(z_0)|&lt;\sup_{z\in \partial \Omega} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z_0\in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. This is known as the ''maximum modulus principle.'' (In fact, since &lt;math&gt;\overline{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt; is compact and &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, there actually exists some &lt;math&gt;w_0\in\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;|f(w_0)|=\sup_{z\in \partial \Omega} |f(z)|&lt;/math&gt;.)  The maximum modulus principle is generally used to conclude that a holomorphic function is bounded in a region after showing that it is bounded on its boundary.

However, the maximum modulus principle cannot be applied to an unbounded region of the complex plane.  As a concrete example, let us examine the behavior of the holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \exp(\exp(z))&lt;/math&gt; in the unbounded strip

:&lt;math&gt;S = \Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Although &lt;math&gt;|f(x\pm \pi i/2)|=1&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is bounded on boundary &lt;math&gt;\partial S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; grows rapidly without bound when &lt;math&gt;|z|\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; along the positive real axis.  The difficulty here stems from the extremely fast growth of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; along the positive real axis.  If the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;|f|&lt;/math&gt; is guaranteed to not be "too fast," as specified by an appropriate growth condition, the ''Phragmén–Lindelöf principle'' can be applied to show that boundedness of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on the region's boundary implies that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is in fact bounded in the whole region, effectively extending the maximum modulus principle to unbounded regions.

''The technique:'' Suppose we are given a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and an unbounded region &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  In a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument, we introduce a certain multiplicative factor &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} h_\epsilon= 1&lt;/math&gt; to "subdue" the growth of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|&lt;M&lt;/math&gt; on the boundary of a bounded subregion &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}\subset S&lt;/math&gt;. This allows us to apply the maximum modulus principle to &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and conclude that it is bounded on &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then argue that the subregion could be expanded so as to encompass all points in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, establishing the boundedness of &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, we let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon\to f&lt;/math&gt; in order to conclude that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must also be bounded on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

In the literature of complex analysis, there are many examples of the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle applied to unbounded regions of differing types, and also a version of this principle may be applied in a similar fashion to [[subharmonic function|subharmonic]] and superharmonic functions.

== Example of application ==
To continue the example above, we can impose a growth condition on a holomorphic function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that prevents it from "blowing up" and allows the Phragmén–Lindelöf principle to be applied.   To this end, we now include the condition that 

:&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;\exp\big(A\exp(c\cdot|\Re(z)|)\big)&lt;/math&gt;

for some real constants &lt;math&gt;c&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  It can then be shown that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; in fact holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, we have the following proposition:

'''Proposition.''' ''Let'' 

:'''''&lt;math&gt;S=\Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big)\Big\},\quad \overline{S}=\Big\{z:\Im(z)\in \big[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\big]\Big\}&lt;/math&gt;'''''.

''Let'' &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; ''be holomorphic on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and continuous on &lt;math&gt;\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt;, and suppose there exist real constants  &lt;math&gt;c&lt;1,\ A&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;'' ''such that''
:'''''&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|&lt;\exp\big(A\exp(c\cdot|\Re(z)|)\big)&lt;/math&gt;'''''

''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;'' ''and &lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\overline{S}\setminus S=\partial S&lt;/math&gt;.  Then'' ''&lt;math&gt;|f(z)|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;'' ''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;''.

Note that this conclusion fails when &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt;, precisely as the motivating counterexample in the previous section demonstrates.  The proof of this statement employs a typical Phragmén–Lindelöf argument:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/RudinW.RealAndComplexAnalysis3e1987|title=Real and Complex Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1987|isbn=0070542341|location=New York|pages=257–259|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sketch of Proof:'' We fix &lt;math&gt;b\in(c,1)&lt;/math&gt;, define for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the auxiliary function &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;h_\epsilon(z)=e^{-\epsilon(e^{b z}+e^{-b z})}&lt;/math&gt;, and consider the function &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  The growth properties of &lt;math&gt;fh_\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; allow us to find an &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq1&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;z\in\overline{S}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|\Re(z)|\geq x_0&lt;/math&gt;.  In particular, &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; holds for all &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the open rectangle in the complex plane defined by the vertices &lt;math&gt;\{x_0\pm i\pi/2,-x_0\pm i\pi/2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  Because &lt;math&gt;S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;is a bounded region, the maximum modulus principle implies that &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S_{x_0}&lt;/math&gt;.  But since &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; can be made arbitrarily large, this result extends to all of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;|fh_\epsilon|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  Finally, since &lt;math&gt;h_\epsilon\to 1&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\epsilon\to 0&lt;/math&gt;, we conclude that &lt;math&gt;|f|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Tombstone (typography)|&lt;big&gt;□&lt;/big&gt;]]

== Phragmén–Lindelöf principle for a sector in the complex plane ==
A particularly useful statement proved using the Phragmén–Lindelöf  principle bounds holomorphic functions on a sector of the complex plane if it is bounded on its boundary.  This statement can be used to give a complex analytic proof of the [[G. H. Hardy|Hardy's]] [[Fourier transform#Uncertainty principle|uncertainty principle]], which states that a function and its Fourier transform cannot both decay faster than exponentially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/02/18/hardys-uncertainty-principle/#more-1716|title=Hardy's Uncertainty Principle|last=Tao|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Tao|date=2009-02-18|website=Updates on my research and expository papers, discussion of open problems, and other maths-related topics. By Terence Tao|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Proposition.'''  ''Let &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; be a function that is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] in a [[Circular sector|sector]]''

:''&lt;math&gt; S = \left\{ z \, \big| \, \alpha &lt; \arg z &lt; \beta \right\} &lt;/math&gt;''

''of central angle &lt;math&gt;\beta-\alpha=\pi/\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and continuous on its boundary. If''

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|F(z)| \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}

''for &lt;math&gt;z\in\partial S&lt;/math&gt;, and''

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;|F(z)| \leq e^{C |z|^\rho}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
 
''for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho\in[0,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then ({{EquationNote|1}}) holds also for all &lt;math&gt;z\in S&lt;/math&gt;.''

===Remarks===
* The condition ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be relaxed to

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\liminf_{r \to \infty} \sup_{\alpha &lt; \theta &lt; \beta} \frac{\log|F(re^{i\theta})|}{r^\rho} = 0 \quad \text{for some} \quad 0 \leq \rho &lt; \lambda~,&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}

with the same conclusion.

== Special cases ==
In practice the point 0 is often transformed into the point ∞ of the [[Riemann sphere]]. This gives a version of the principle that applies to strips, for example bounded by two lines of constant [[real part]] in the complex plane. This special case is sometimes known as [[Lindelöf's theorem]].

[[Carlson's theorem]] is an application of the principle to functions bounded on the imaginary axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10882">A '''pretext''' (adj: '''pretextual''') is an excuse to do something or say something that is not accurate. Pretexts may be based on a half-truth or developed in the context of a misleading fabrication. Pretexts have been used to conceal the true purpose or rationale behind actions and words.

In [[Law of the United States|US law]], a pretext usually describes false reasons that hide the true intentions or motivations for a legal action. If a party can establish a [[prima facie]] case for the proffered evidence, the opposing party must prove that these reasons were "pretextual" or false. This can be accomplished by directly demonstrating that the motivations behind the presentation of evidence is false, or indirectly by evidence that the motivations are not "credible".&lt;ref name=uslegal&gt;{{cite web|title=Pretext Law &amp; Legal Definition|url=http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/pretext/|publisher=uslegal.com|accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Griffith v. Schnitzer'', an employment discrimination case, a jury award was reversed by a [[Court of Appeals]] because the evidence was not sufficient that the defendant's reasons were "pretextual". That is, the defendant's evidence was either undisputed, or the plaintiff's  was "irrelevant subjective assessments and opinions".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omwlaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Defining-Pretext-In-Discrimination-Cases.pdf Defining "pretext" in discrimination cases] by Karen Sutherland (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marbleboot.jpg|thumb|right|140px|[[Marble Boat]] on [[Kunming Lake]] near Beijing]]
As one example of pretext, in the 1880s, the Chinese government raised money on the pretext of modernizing the Chinese navy. Instead, these funds were diverted to repair a ship-shaped, two-story pavilion which had been originally constructed for [[Empress Xiaoshengxian|the mother]] of the [[Qianlong Emperor]]. This pretext and the Marble Barge are famously linked with [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. This architectural [[folly]], known today as the [[Marble Boat]] (''Shifang''), is "moored" on Lake Kunming in what the empress renamed the "Garden for Cultivating Harmony" (''Yiheyuan'').&lt;ref&gt;Min, Anchee.

Another example of pretext was demonstrated in the speeches of the Roman orator [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149 BC). For Cato, every public speech became a pretext for a comment about Carthage. The Roman statesman had come to believe that the prosperity of ancient Carthage represented an eventual and inevitable danger to Rome. In the Senate, Cato famously ended every speech by proclaiming his opinion that [[Carthage]] had to be destroyed (''[[Carthago delenda est]]''). This oft-repeated phrase was the ultimate conclusion of all logical argument in every oration, regardless of the subject of the speech. This pattern persisted until his death in 149, which was the year in which the Third Punic War began. In other words, any subject became a pretext for reminding his fellow senators of the dangers Carthage represented.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, William Davis ''et al.'' (1934).

The early years of Japan's [[Tokugawa shogunate]] were unsettled, with warring factions battling for power. The causes for the fighting were in part pretextural, but the outcome brought diminished armed conflicts after the [[Siege of Osaka]] in 1614-1615.
* '''1614''' (''Keichō 19''): The Shogun vanquished Hideyori and set fire to [[Osaka Castle]], and then he returned for the winter to [[Edo]].&lt;ref name="t410"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA410,M1  p. 410.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''August 24, 1614''' (''Keichō 19, 19th day of the 7th month''): A new bronze bell for the Hōkō-ji was cast successfully [http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=4771] [http://oldphoto.lb.nagasaki-u.ac.jp/en/target.php?id=3093]; but despite the dedication ceremony planning, Ieyasu forbade any further actions concerning the great bell:
::"[T]he tablet over the Daibutsu-den and the bell bore the inscription ''"Kokka ankō"'' (meaning "the country and the house, peace and tranquility"), and at this [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] affect to take umbrage, alleging that it was intended as a curse on him for the character 安 (''an,'' "peace") was placed between the two characters composing his own name 家康 (''"ka-kō",'' "house tranquility") [suggesting subtly perhaps that peace could only be attained by Ieyasu's dismemberment?] ... This incident of the inscription was, of course, a mere pretext, but Ieyasu realized that he could not enjoy the power he had usurped as long as Hideyori lived, and consequently, although the latter more than once Hideyori dispatched his vassal Katagiri Kastumoto to Ieyasu's residence ([[Sunpu Castle]]) with profuse apologies, Ieyasu refused to be placated."&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). ''Kyoto, the Old Capital of Japan,'' p. 292; Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA410,M1  p. 410.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''October 18, 1614''' (''Keichō 19, 25th day of the 10th month''): A strong earthquake shook Kyoto.&lt;ref name="t410"/&gt;
* '''1615''' (''Keichō 20''): Osaka Summer Battle begins.

The next two-and-a-half centuries of Japanese history were comparatively peaceful under the successors of Tokugawa Ieyasu and the [[bakufu]] government he established.

===United States===
* During the War of 1812, US President [[James Madison]] was often accused of using impressment of American sailors by the [[Royal Navy]] as a pretext to invade [[Canada]].

{{main|Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge debate}}
* Some have argued that United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941 as a pretext to enter [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Richard. [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/15/books/books-of-the-times-on-dec-7-did-we-know-we-knew.html "On Dec. 7, Did We Know We Knew?"] ''New York Times.'' December 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; American soldiers and supplies had been assisting British and Soviet operations for almost a year by this point, and the United States had thus "chosen a side", but due to the political climate in the States at the time and some campaign promises made by Roosevelt that he would not send American boys to fight in foreign wars. Roosevelt could not declare war for fear of public backlash. The attack on Pearl Harbor united the American people's resolve against the Axis powers and created the bellicose atmosphere in which to declare war.
* Critics have accused United States President [[George W. Bush]] of using the [[September 11th, 2001 attacks]] and faulty intelligence about the existence of [[weapons of mass destruction]] as a pretext for the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Borger, Julian.

A '''process reference model''' is a [[Conceptual model|model]] that has generic functionality and can be used more than once in different models. The creator of a process model benefits from existing process reference models by not needing to reinvent the process model but only reusing it as a starting point in creating a process model for a specific purpose.

==Process model reuse==
During the identification of processes ideal for reuse, the designer needs to (1) Get approval (2) Provide Organization Scope Context and (3) Identify Process [[Standardization]] Opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Marne de Vries, Alta van der Merwe, Paula Kotze and Aurona Gerber.

In [[information science]], '''profiling''' refers to the process of construction and application of [[user profile]]s generated by computerized [[data analysis]].

This is the use of algorithms or other mathematical techniques that allow the [[pattern recognition|discovery of patterns]] or [[correlation]]s in large quantities of data, aggregated in [[database]]s. When these patterns or correlations are used to identify or represent people, they can be called ''profiles''. Other than a discussion of profiling ''technologies'' or ''population profiling'', the notion of profiling in this sense is not just about the construction of profiles, but also concerns the ''application'' of [[group profile]]s to individuals, e.&amp;nbsp;g., in the cases of [[credit scoring]], price discrimination, or identification of security risks {{Harv|Hildebrandt|Gutwirth|2008}} {{Harv|Elmer|2004}}.

{{wiktionary|profile}}

Profiling is not simply a matter of computerized pattern-recognition; it enables refined price-discrimination, [[targeted advertising|targeted servicing]], [[fraud detection]], and extensive [[social sorting]]. Real-time machine profiling constitutes the precondition for emerging [[socio-technical]] infrastructures envisioned by advocates of [[ambient intelligence]],&lt;ref&gt;
ISTAG (2001), Scenarios for Ambient Intelligence in 2010, Information Society Technology Advisory Group
&lt;/ref&gt; [[autonomic computing]] {{Harv|Kephart|Chess|2003}} and [[ubiquitous computing]] {{Harv|Weiser|1991}}.

One of the most challenging problems of the [[information society]] involves dealing with increasing data-overload. With the [[digitizing]] of all sorts of content as well as the improvement and drop in cost of recording technologies, the amount of available information has become enormous and increases exponentially. It has thus become important for companies, governments, and individuals to discriminate [[signal-to-noise ratio|information from noise]], detecting useful or interesting data. The development of profiling technologies must be seen against this background.{{cn|date=February 2014}} These technologies are thought{{by whom?|date=February 2014}} to efficiently collect and analyse data in order to find or test knowledge in the form of statistical patterns between data. This process, called [[Knowledge Discovery in Databases]] (KDD) {{Harv|Fayyad|Piatetsky-Shapiro|Smyth|1996}}, provides the profiler with sets of correlated data usable as "profiles".

== The profiling process ==

The technical process of profiling can be separated in several steps:
* ''Preliminary grounding:'' The profiling process starts with a specification of the applicable problem domain and the identification of the goals of analysis.
* ''[[Data collection]]:'' The target dataset or database for analysis is formed by selecting the relevant data in the light of existing domain knowledge and data understanding.
* ''[[Data preparation]]:'' The data are preprocessed for removing noise and reducing complexity by eliminating attributes.
* ''[[Data mining]]:'' The data are analysed with the algorithm or heuristics developed to suit the data, model and goals.
* ''Interpretation:'' The mined patterns are evaluated on their relevance and validity by specialists and/or professionals in the application domain (e.g. excluding spurious correlations).
* ''Application:'' The constructed profiles are applied, e.g. to categories of persons, to test and fine-tune the algorithms.
* ''Institutional decision:'' The institution decides what actions or policies to apply to groups or individuals whose data match a relevant profile.

Data collection, preparation and mining all belong to the phase in which the profile is under construction. However, profiling also refers to the application of profiles, meaning the usage of profiles for the identification or categorization of groups or individual persons. As can be seen in step six (application), the process is circular. There is a feedback loop between the construction and the application of profiles. The interpretation of profiles can lead to the reiterant – possibly real-time – fine-tuning of specific previous steps in the profiling process. The application of profiles to people whose data were not used to construct the profile is based on data matching, which provides new data that allows for further adjustments. The process of profiling is both dynamic and adaptive. A good illustration of the dynamic and adaptive nature of profiling is the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining ([[CRISP-DM]]).

== Types of profiling practices ==

In order to clarify the nature of profiling technologies, some crucial distinctions have to be made between different types of profiling practices, apart from the distinction between the construction and the application of profiles. The main distinctions are those between bottom-up and top-down profiling (or supervised and unsupervised learning), and between individual and group profiles.

=== Supervised and unsupervised learning ===
Profiles can be classified according to the way they have been generated {{Harv|Fayyad|Piatetsky-Shapiro|Smyth|1996}} {{Harv|Zarsky|2002-3}}. On the one hand, profiles can be generated by testing a hypothesized correlation. This is called top-down profiling or [[supervised learning]]. This is similar to the methodology of traditional scientific research in that it starts with a hypothesis and consists of testing its validity. The result of this type of profiling is the verification or refutation of the hypothesis. One could also speak of deductive profiling. On the other hand, profiles can be generated by exploring a data base, using the [[data mining]] process to detect patterns in the data base that were not previously hypothesized. In a way, this is a matter of generating hypothesis: finding correlations one did not expect or even think of. Once the patterns have been mined, they will enter the loop – described above – and will be tested with the use of new data. This is called [[unsupervised learning]].

Two things are important with regard to this distinction. First, unsupervised learning algorithms seem to allow the construction of a new type of knowledge, not based on hypothesis developed by a researcher and not based on causal or motivational relations but exclusively based on stochastical correlations. Second, unsupervised learning algorithms thus seem to allow for an inductive type of knowledge construction that does not require theoretical justification or causal explanation {{Harv|Custers|2004}}.

Some authors claim that if the application of profiles based on computerized stochastical pattern recognition 'works', i.e. allows for reliable predictions of future behaviours, the theoretical or causal explanation of these patterns does not matter anymore {{Harv|Anderson|2008}}. However, the idea that 'blind' algorithms provide reliable information does not imply that the information is neutral. In the process of collecting and aggregating data into a database (the first three steps of the process of profile construction), translations are made from real-life events to [[machine-readable data]]. These data are then prepared and cleansed to allow for initial computability. Potential bias will have to be located at these points, as well as in the choice of algorithms that are developed. It is not possible to mine a database for all possible linear and non-linear correlations, meaning that the mathematical techniques developed to search for patterns will be determinate of the patterns that can be found. In the case of machine profiling, potential bias is not informed by common sense prejudice or what psychologists call stereotyping, but by the computer techniques employed in the initial steps of the process. These techniques are mostly invisible for those to whom profiles are applied (because their data match the relevant group profiles).

=== Individual and group profiles ===
Profiles must also be classified according to the kind of subject they refer to. This subject can either be an individual or a group of people. When a profile is constructed with the data of a single person, this is called individual profiling {{Harv|Jaquet-Chiffelle|2008}}. This kind of profiling is used to discover the particular characteristics of a certain individual, to enable unique identification or the provision of personalized services. However, personalized servicing is most often also based on group profiling, which allows categorisation of a person as a certain type of person, based on the fact that her profile matches with a profile that has been constructed on the basis of massive amounts of data about massive numbers of other people. A group profile can refer to the result of data mining in data sets that refer to an existing community that considers itself as such, like a religious group, a tennis club, a university, a political party etc. In that case it can describe previously unknown patterns of behaviour or other characteristics of such a group (community). A group profile can also refer to a category of people that do not form a community, but are found to share previously unknown patterns of behaviour or other characteristics {{Harv|Custers|2004}}. In that case the group profile describes specific behaviours or other characteristics of a category of people, like for instance women with blue eyes and red hair, or adults with relatively short arms and legs. These categories may be found to correlate with health risks, earning capacity, mortality rates, credit risks, etc.

If an individual profile is applied to the individual that it was mined from, then that is direct individual profiling. If a group profile is applied to an individual whose data match the profile, then that is indirect individual profiling, because the profile was generated using data of other people. Similarly, if a group profile is applied to the group that it was mined from, then that is direct group profiling {{Harv|Jaquet-Chiffelle|2008}}. However, in as far as the application of a group profile to a group implies the application of the group profile to individual members of the group, it makes sense to speak of indirect group profiling, especially if the group profile is non-distributive.

=== Distributive and non-distributive profiling ===
Group profiles can also be divided in terms of their distributive character {{Harv|Vedder|1999}}. A group profile is distributive when its properties apply equally to all the members of its group: all bachelors are unmarried, or all persons with a specific gene have 80% chance to contract a specific disease. A profile is non-distributive when the profile does not necessarily apply to all the members of the group: the group of persons with a specific postal code have an average earning capacity of XX, or the category of persons with blue eyes has an average chance of 37% to contract a specific disease. Note that in this case the chance of an individual to have a particular earning capacity or to contract the specific disease will depend on other factors, e.g. sex, age, background of parents, previous health, education. It should be obvious that, apart from tautological profiles like that of bachelors, most group profiles generated by means of computer techniques are non-distributive. This has far-reaching implications for the accuracy of indirect individual profiling based on data matching with non-distributive group profiles. Quite apart from the fact that the application of accurate profiles may be unfair or cause undue stigmatisation, most group profiles will not be accurate.

== Application domains ==

Profiling technologies can be applied in a variety of different domains and for a variety of purposes. These profiling practices will all have different effect and raise different issues.

Knowledge about the behaviour and preferences of customers is of great interest to the commercial sector. On the basis of profiling technologies, companies can predict the behaviour of different types of customers. Marketing strategies can then be tailored to the people fitting these types. Examples of profiling practices in marketing are customers [[loyalty cards]], [[customer relationship management]] in general, and personalized advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/profiling/|title=EPIC - Privacy and Consumer Profiling|author=Electronic Privacy Information Center|work=epic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/register.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408071632/http://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/register.htm |archivedate=2009-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/kurzgutachten/g041006/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718191155/https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/guetesiegel/kurzgutachten/g041006/ |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the financial sector, institutions use profiling technologies for [[fraud prevention]] and [[credit scoring]]. Banks want to minimise the risks in giving credit to their customers.  On the basis of extensive group profiling customers are assigned a certain scoring value that indicates their creditworthiness. Financial institutions like banks and insurance companies also use group profiling to detect fraud or [[money-laundering]]. Databases with transactions are searched with algorithms to find behaviours that deviate from the standard, indicating potentially suspicious transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Canhoto|first= A.I. |year=2007|title= Profiling behaviour: the social construction of categories in the detection of financial crime, dissertation at London School of Economics|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/informationSystems/pdf/theses/canhoto.pdf|format=PDF|work=lse.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of employment, profiles can be of use for tracking employees by monitoring their online behaviour, for the detection of fraud by them, and for the deployment of human resources by pooling and ranking their skills. {{Harv|Leopold|Meints|2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.org/privacy/workplace/|title=EPIC - Workplace Privacy|author=Electronic Privacy Information Center|work=epic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Profiling can also be used to support people at work, and also for learning, by intervening in the design of [[adaptive hypermedia]] systems personalising the interaction. For instance, this can be useful for supporting the [[attention management|management of attention]] {{Harv|Nabeth|2008}}.

In [[forensic science]], the possibility exists of linking different databases of cases and suspects and mining these for common patterns. This could be used for solving existing cases or for the purpose of establishing risk profiles of potential suspects {{Harv|Geradts|Sommer|2008}} {{Harv|Harcourt|2006}}.

== Risks and issues ==

Profiling technologies have raised a host of ethical, legal and other issues including [[privacy]], [[Equality before the law|equality]], [[due process]], [[security]] and [[Legal liability|liability]]. Numerous authors have warned against the affordances of a new technological infrastructure that could emerge on the basis of semi-autonomic profiling technologies {{Harv|Lessig|2006}} {{Harv|Solove|2004}} {{Harv|Schwartz|2000}}.

Privacy is one of the principal issues raised. Profiling technologies make possible a far-reaching monitoring of an individual's behaviour and preferences. Profiles may reveal personal or private information about individuals that they might not even be aware of themselves {{Harv|Hildebrandt|Gutwirth|2008}}.

Profiling technologies are by their very nature discriminatory tools. They allow unparalleled kinds of social sorting and segmentation which could have unfair effects. The people that are profiled may have to pay higher prices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Odlyzko|first= A.|year=2003|title= Privacy, economics, and price discrimination on the Internet, A. M. Odlyzko.

In most cases they will not be aware of this, since profiling practices are mostly invisible and the profiles themselves are often protected by intellectual property or trade secret. This poses a threat to the equality of and solidarity of citizens. On a larger scale, it might cause the segmentation of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gandy|first=O.|year=2002|title= Data Mining and Surveillance in the post 9/11 environment, Presentation at IAMCR, Barcelona|url=http://www.asc.upenn.edu/usr/ogandy/IAMCRdatamining.pdf|format=PDF|work=asc.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems underlying potential violations of privacy and [[non-discrimination]] is that the process of profiling is more often than not invisible for those that are being profiled. This creates difficulties in that it becomes hard, if not impossible, to contest the application of a particular group profile. This disturbs principles of due process: if a person has no access to information on the basis of which they are withheld benefits or attributed certain risks, they cannot contest the way they are being treated {{Harv|Steinbock|2005}}.

Profiles can be used against people when they end up in the hands of people who are not entitled to access or use them. An important issue related to these breaches of security is [[identity theft]].

When the application of profiles causes harm, the liability for this harm has to be determined who is to be held accountable. Is the software programmer, the profiling service provider, or the profiled user to be held accountable? This issue of liability is especially complex in the case the application and decisions on profiles have also become automated like in [[Autonomic Computing]] or [[ambient intelligence]] decisions of automated decisions based on profiling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5602">In [[quantum geometry]] or [[noncommutative geometry]] a '''quantum differential calculus''' or '''noncommutative differential structure''' on an algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; over a field &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; means the specification of a space of [[differential form]]s over the algebra.  The algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; here is regarded as a [[coordinate ring]] but it is important that it may be noncommutative and hence not an actual algebra of coordinate functions on any actual space, so this represents a point of view replacing the specification of a differentiable structure for an actual space. In ordinary differential geometry one can multiply differential 1-forms by functions from the left and from the right, and there exists an exterior derivative.  Correspondingly, a first order quantum differential calculus means at least the following:

1. An &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-bimodule &lt;math&gt;\Omega^1&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. one can multiply elements of &lt;math&gt;\Omega^1&lt;/math&gt; by elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in an associative way:

: &lt;math&gt; a(\omega b)=(a\omega)b,\ \forall a,b\in A,\ \omega\in\Omega^1&lt;/math&gt;.

2. A linear map &lt;math&gt;{\rm d}:A\to\Omega^1&lt;/math&gt; obeying the Leibniz rule
: &lt;math&gt;{\rm d}(ab)=a({\rm d}b)+({\rm d}a)b,\ \forall a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;

3. &lt;math&gt;\Omega^1=\{a({\rm d}b)\ |\ a,b\in A\}&lt;/math&gt;

4. (optional connectedness condition) &lt;math&gt;\ker\ {\rm d}=k1&lt;/math&gt;

The last condition is not always imposed but holds in ordinary geometry when the manifold is connected. It says that the only functions killed by &lt;math&gt;{\rm d}&lt;/math&gt; are constant functions.

An ''[[exterior algebra]]'' or ''differential [[graded algebra]]'' structure over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; means a compatible extension of &lt;math&gt;\Omega^1&lt;/math&gt; to include analogues of higher order differential forms

: &lt;math&gt;\Omega=\oplus_n\Omega^n,\ {\rm d}:\Omega^n\to\Omega^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

obeying a graded-Leibniz rule with respect to an associative product on &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and obeying &lt;math&gt;{\rm d}^2=0&lt;/math&gt;. Here &lt;math&gt;\Omega^0=A&lt;/math&gt; and it is usually required that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is generated by &lt;math&gt;A,\Omega^1&lt;/math&gt;. The product of differential forms is called the [[wedge product|exterior or wedge product]] and often denoted &lt;math&gt;\wedge&lt;/math&gt;. The noncommutative or quantum [[de Rham cohomology]] is defined as the cohomology of this complex.

A higher order differential calculus can mean an exterior algebra, or it can mean the partial specification of one, up to some highest degree, and with products that would result in a degree beyond the highest being unspecified.

The above definition lies at the crossroads of two approaches to noncommutative geometry. In the Connes approach a more fundamental object is a replacement for the [[Dirac operator]] in the form of a [[spectral triple]], and an exterior algebra can be constructed from this data. In the [[quantum group]]s approach to noncommutative geometry one starts with the algebra and a choice of first order calculus but constrained by covariance under a quantum group symmetry.

==Note==
The above definition is minimal and gives something more general than classical differential calculus even when the algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is commutative or functions on an actual space. This is because we do ''not'' demand that

: &lt;math&gt;a({\rm d}b)=({\rm db})a,\ \forall a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;

since this would imply that &lt;math&gt;{\rm d}(ab-ba)=0,\ \forall a,b\in A&lt;/math&gt;, which would violate axiom 4 when the algebra was noncommutative. As a byproduct, this enlarged definition includes finite difference calculi and quantum differential calculi on finite sets and finite groups (finite group [[Lie algebra]] theory).

==Examples==
1. For &lt;math&gt;A={\Bbb C}[x]&lt;/math&gt; the algebra of polynomials in one variable the translation-covariant quantum differential calculi are parametrized by &lt;math&gt;\lambda\in \Bbb C&lt;/math&gt; and take the form

: &lt;math&gt; \Omega^1={\Bbb C}.{\rm d}x,\quad ({\rm d}x)f(x)=f(x+\lambda)({\rm d}x),\quad {\rm d}f={f(x+\lambda)-f(x)\over\lambda}{\rm d}x&lt;/math&gt;

This shows how finite differences arise naturally in quantum geometry. Only the limit &lt;math&gt;\lambda\to 0&lt;/math&gt; has functions commuting with 1-forms, which is the special case of high school differential calculus.

2. For &lt;math&gt;A={\Bbb C}[t,t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt; the algebra of functions on an algebraic circle, the translation (i.e. circle-rotation)-covariant differential calculi are  parametrized by &lt;math&gt;q\ne 0\in \Bbb C&lt;/math&gt; and take the form

: &lt;math&gt; \Omega^1={\Bbb C}.{\rm d}t,\quad ({\rm d}t)f(t)=f(qt)({\rm d}t),\quad {\rm d}f={f(qt)-f(t)\over q(t-1)}\,{\rm dt}&lt;/math&gt;

This shows how &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;-differentials arise naturally in quantum geometry.

3. For any algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; one has a '''universal differential calculus''' defined by

: &lt;math&gt;\Omega^1=\ker(m:A\otimes A\to A),\quad {\rm d}a=1\otimes a-a\otimes 1,\quad\forall a\in A&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the algebra product. By axiom 3., any first order calculus is a quotient of this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5725">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''reaction formation''' ({{lang-de|Reaktionsbildung}}) is a [[defense mechanism]] in which emotions and impulses which are [[anxiety]]-producing or perceived to be unacceptable are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency.&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"&gt;Charles Rycroft, ''A Critical Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London, 2nd Edn, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;
The reaction formations belong to [[Defence_mechanisms#Level_3:_Neurotic|Level III]] of neurotic [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]], which also include intellectualization, dissociation, displacement and repression.

== Theory ==
Reaction formation depends on the hypothesis that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he instincts and their derivatives may be arranged as pairs of opposites: life versus death, construction versus destruction, action versus passivity, dominance versus submission, and so forth. When one of the instincts produces anxiety by exerting pressure on the ego either directly or by way of the superego, the ego may try to sidetrack the offending impulse by concentrating upon its opposite. For example, if feelings of hate towards another person make one anxious, the ego can facilitate the flow of love to conceal the hostility."&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"&gt;Calvin S. Hall, ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology'' (New York, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form.&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"/&gt; Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely ''masks'' the hate to hide it from awareness.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;

In a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a 'simple' emotion would be suspected where ''[[exaggeration]]'', ''compulsiveness'' and ''inflexibility'' were observed. For example,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[r]eactive love [[The lady doth protest too much, methinks|protests too much]]; it is overdone, extravagant, showy, and affected. It is counterfeit, and [...] is usually easily detected. Another feature of a reaction formation is its compulsiveness. A person who is defending himself against anxiety cannot deviate from expressing the opposite of what he really feels. His love, for instance, is not flexible. It cannot adapt itself to changing circumstances as genuine emotions do; rather it must be constantly on display as if any failure to exhibit it would cause the contrary feeling to come to the surface.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Reaction formation is sometimes described as one of the most difficult defenses for lay people to understand;&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"/&gt; this testifies not merely to its effectiveness as a disguise, but also to its ubiquity and flexibility as a defense that can be utilized in many forms. For example, &lt;blockquote&gt;"solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against coprophilia",&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and it is not unknown for an analyst to explain a client's unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, &lt;blockquote&gt;"[h]igh ideals of virtue and goodness may be reaction formations against primitive object [[cathexis|cathexes]] rather than realistic values that are capable of being lived up to. Romantic notions of chastity and purity may mask crude sexual desires, altruism may hide selfishness, and piety may conceal sinfulness."&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even more counter-intuitively, according to this model
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[a] [[phobia]] is an example of a reaction formation. The person wants what he fears. He is not afraid of the object; he is afraid of the wish for the object. The reactive fear prevents the dreaded wish from being fulfilled.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as [[Stockholm Syndrome]], a hostage or kidnap victim 'falls in love' with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating 'favourites' among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.

'''Reaction–diffusion systems''' are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena: the most common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local [[chemical reaction]]s in which the substances are transformed into each other, and [[diffusion]] which causes the substances to spread out over a surface in space.

Reaction–diffusion systems are naturally applied in [[chemistry]]. However, the system can also describe dynamical processes of non-chemical nature. Examples are found in [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[physics]] (neutron diffusion theory) and [[ecology]]. Mathematically, reaction–diffusion systems take the form of semi-linear [[parabolic partial differential equation]]s. They can be represented in the general form

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t \boldsymbol{q} = \underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{D}}} \,\nabla^2 \boldsymbol{q} + \boldsymbol{R}(\boldsymbol{q}), &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''''q'''''('''''x''''', ''t'')}} represents the unknown vector function, {{math|{{uuline|'''''D'''''}}}} is a [[diagonal matrix]] of [[diffusion coefficient]]s, and {{math|'''''R'''''}} accounts for all local reactions. The solutions of reaction–diffusion equations display a wide range of behaviours, including the formation of [[travelling wave]]s and wave-like phenomena as well as other [[Self-organization|self-organized]] [[pattern formation|patterns]] like stripes, hexagons or more intricate structure like [[dissipative soliton]]s. Such patterns have been dubbed "[[Turing pattern]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Wooley, T. E., Baker, R. E. [[Philip Maini|Maini, P. K.]], Chapter 34, ''Turing's theory of morphogenesis''. In {{cite book |author-link1 = Jack Copeland|last1 = Copeland | first1=B. Jack | authorlink2=Jonathan Bowen | last2=Bowen | first2=Jonathan P. | authorlink3=Robin Wilson (mathematician)| last3=Wilson | first3=Robin | | last4=Sprevak | first4=Mark | title=[[The Turing Guide]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2017 | isbn=978-0198747826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each function, for which a reaction diffusion differential equation holds, represents in fact a ''concentration variable''.

==One-component reaction–diffusion equations==
The simplest reaction–diffusion equation is in one spatial dimension in plane geometry,

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u = D \partial^2_x u + R(u),&lt;/math&gt;

is also referred to as the [[Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov equation]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Kolmogorov et al., Moscow Univ. Bull. Math.

The corresponding equation is [[Fick's law|Fick's second law]].

The dynamics of one-component systems is subject to certain restrictions as the evolution equation can also be written in the variational form

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u=-\frac{\delta\mathfrak L}{\delta u}&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore describes a permanent decrease of the "free energy" &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak L&lt;/math&gt; given by the functional

:&lt;math&gt; \mathfrak L=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \left[\tfrac{D}{2} \left (\partial_xu \right )^2-V(u)\right]\text{d}x&lt;/math&gt;

with a potential {{math|''V''(''u'')}} such that {{math|''R''(''u'') {{=}} {{sfrac|d''V''(''u'')|d''u''}}.}}

[[Image:Travelling wave for Fisher equation.svg|thumb|right|A travelling wave front solution for Fisher's equation.]]  
In systems with more than one stationary homogeneous solution, a typical solution is given by travelling fronts connecting the homogeneous states. These solutions move with constant speed without changing their shape and are of the form {{math|''u''(''x'', ''t'') {{=}} ''û''(''ξ'')}} with {{math|''ξ'' {{=}} ''x'' − ''ct''}}, where {{mvar|c}} is the speed of the travelling wave. Note that while travelling waves are generically stable structures, all non-monotonous stationary solutions (e.g. localized domains composed of a front-antifront pair) are unstable. For {{math|''c'' {{=}} 0}}, there is a simple proof for this statement:&lt;ref name="fife"&gt;P. C. Fife, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJXsCAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mathematical Aspects of Reacting and Diffusing Systems], Springer (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; if {{math|''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a stationary solution and {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') + ''ũ''(''x'', ''t'')}} is an infinitesimally perturbed solution, linear stability analysis yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt; \partial_t \tilde{u}=D\partial_x^2 \tilde{u}-U(x)\tilde{u},\qquad U(x) = -R^{\prime}(u)|_{u=u_0(x)}.&lt;/math&gt;

With the ansatz {{math|''ũ'' {{=}} ''ψ''(''x'')exp(−''λt'')}} we arrive at the eigenvalue problem

:&lt;math&gt; \hat H\psi=\lambda\psi, \qquad \hat H=-D\partial_x^2+U(x),&lt;/math&gt;

of [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger type]] where negative eigenvalues result in the instability of the solution. Due to translational invariance {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} is a neutral [[eigenfunction]] with the [[eigenvalue]] {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}}, and all other eigenfunctions can be sorted according to an increasing number of knots with the magnitude of the corresponding real eigenvalue increases  monotonically with the number of zeros. The eigenfunction {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''u''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'')}} should have at least one zero, and for a non-monotonic stationary solution the corresponding eigenvalue {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}} cannot be the lowest one, thereby implying instability.

To determine the velocity {{mvar|c}} of a moving front, one may go to a moving coordinate system and look at stationary solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;D \partial^2_{\xi}\hat{u}(\xi)+ c\partial_{\xi} \hat{u}(\xi)+R(\hat{u}(\xi))=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation has a nice mechanical analogue as the motion of a mass {{mvar|D}} with position {{math|''û''}} in the course of the "time" {{mvar|ξ}} under the force {{mvar|R}} with the damping coefficient c which allows for a rather illustrative access to the construction of different types of solutions and the determination of {{mvar|c}}.

When going from one to more space dimensions, a number of statements from one-dimensional systems can still be applied. Planar or curved wave fronts are typical structures, and a new effect arises as the local velocity of a curved front becomes dependent on the local [[curvature|radius of curvature]] (this can be seen by going to [[polar coordinates]]). This phenomenon leads to the so-called curvature-driven instability.&lt;ref name="mikhailov"&gt;A. S. Mikhailov, Foundations of Synergetics I. Distributed Active Systems, Springer (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two-component reaction–diffusion equations==
Two-component systems allow for a much larger range of possible phenomena than their one-component counterparts. An important idea that was first proposed by [[Alan Turing]] is that a state that is stable in the local system can become unstable in the presence of [[diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Turing, Phil. Transact. Royal Soc. B 237 (1952): 37&lt;/ref&gt;

A linear stability analysis however shows that when linearizing the general two-component system

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \partial_t u \\ \partial_t v \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} D_u &amp;0 \\0&amp;D_v \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \partial_{xx} u\\ \partial_{xx} v \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} F(u,v)\\G(u,v)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

a [[plane wave]] perturbation

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{\boldsymbol{q}}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(\boldsymbol{x},t) = \begin{pmatrix} \tilde{u}(t)\\\tilde{v}(t) \end{pmatrix} e^{i \boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{x}} &lt;/math&gt;

of the stationary homogeneous solution will satisfy

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} \partial_t \tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t)\\ \partial_t \tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix} = -k^2\begin{pmatrix} D_u \tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t)\\ D_v\tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix} + \boldsymbol{R}^{\prime} \begin{pmatrix}\tilde{u}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \\ \tilde{v}_{\boldsymbol{k}}(t) \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Turing's idea can only be realized in four [[equivalence class]]es of systems characterized by the signs of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] {{math|'''''R'''''′}} of the reaction function. In particular, if a finite wave vector {{math|'''''k'''''}} is supposed to be the most unstable one, the Jacobian must have the signs

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} +&amp;-\\+&amp;-\end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} +&amp;+\\-&amp;-\end{pmatrix}, \quad \begin{pmatrix} -&amp;+\\-&amp;+\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\begin{pmatrix} -&amp;-\\+&amp;+\end{pmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This class of systems is named ''activator-inhibitor system'' after its first representative: close to the ground state, one component stimulates the production of both components while the other one inhibits their growth. Its most prominent representative is the [[FitzHugh–Nagumo equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\partial_t u &amp;= d_u^2 \,\nabla^2 u + f(u) - \sigma v, \\
\tau \partial_t v &amp;= d_v^2 \,\nabla^2 v + u - v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(''u'') {{=}} ''λu'' − ''u''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''κ''}} which describes how an [[action potential]] travels through a nerve.&lt;ref name="fitzhugh"&gt;R. FitzHugh, Biophys. J. 1 (1961): 445&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Nagumo et al., Proc. Inst. Radio Engin. Electr. 50 (1962): 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Here, {{math|''d&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''τ'', ''σ''}} and {{math|''λ''}} are positive constants.

When an activator-inhibitor system undergoes a change of parameters, one may pass from conditions under which a homogeneous ground state is stable to conditions under which it is linearly unstable. The corresponding [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] may be either a [[Hopf bifurcation]] to a globally oscillating homogeneous state with a dominant wave number {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} or a ''Turing bifurcation'' to a globally patterned state with a dominant finite wave number. The latter in two spatial dimensions typically leads to stripe or hexagonal patterns.

&lt;gallery caption="Subcritical Turing bifurcation: formation of a hexagonal pattern from noisy initial conditions in the above two-component reaction-diffusion system of Fitzhugh-Nagumo type." widths="257" heights="235" perrow="3"&gt;
Image:Turing_bifurcation_1.gif| Noisy initial conditions at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Image:Turing_bifurcation_3.gif| Almost converged state at ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;100.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

For the Fitzhugh-Nagumo example, the neutral stability curves marking the boundary of the linearly stable region for the Turing and Hopf bifurcation are given by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
q_{\text{n}}^H(k): &amp;{}\quad \frac{1}{\tau} + \left  (d_u^2 + \frac{1}{\tau} d_v^2 \right )k^2 &amp; =f^{\prime}(u_{h}),\\[6pt]
q_{\text{n}}^T(k): &amp;{}\quad \frac{\kappa}{1 + d_v^2 k^2}+ d_u^2 k^2 &amp; = f^{\prime}(u_{h}).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If the bifurcation is subcritical, often localized structures ([[dissipative solitons]]) can be observed in the [[Hysteresis|hysteretic]] region where the pattern coexists with the ground state. Other frequently encountered structures comprise pulse trains (also known as [[periodic travelling wave]]s), spiral waves and target patterns. These three solution types are also generic features of two- (or more-) component reaction-diffusion equations in which the local dynamics have a stable limit cycle&lt;ref&gt;N. Kopell and L.N. Howard, Stud. Appl. Math. 52 (1973): 291&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Three- and more-component reaction–diffusion equations==
For a variety of systems, reaction-diffusion equations with more than two components have been proposed, e.g. as models for the [[Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction]],&lt;ref&gt;V. K. Vanag and I. R. Epstein, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004): 128301&lt;/ref&gt; for [[blood clotting]]&lt;ref&gt;E. S. Lobanova
and F. I. Ataullakhanov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 93 (2004): 098303&lt;/ref&gt; or planar [[gas discharge]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;H.-G. Purwins et al. in: Dissipative Solitons, Lectures Notes in Physics, Ed. N. Akhmediev and A. Ankiewicz, Springer (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is known that systems with more components allow for a variety of phenomena not possible in systems with one or two components (e.g. stable running pulses in more than one spatial dimension without global feedback),.&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Schenk et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997): 3781&lt;/ref&gt; An introduction and systematic overview of the possible phenomena in dependence on the properties of the underlying system is given in.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Liehr: ''Dissipative Solitons in Reaction Diffusion Systems. Mechanism, Dynamics, Interaction.'' Volume 70 of Springer Series in Synergetics, Springer, Berlin Heidelberg 2013, {{isbn|978-3-642-31250-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications and universality==
In recent times, reaction–diffusion systems have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. The above-mentioned patterns (fronts, spirals, targets, hexagons, stripes and dissipative solitons) can be found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems in spite of large discrepancies e.g. in the local reaction terms. It has also been argued that reaction-diffusion processes are an essential basis for processes connected to [[morphogenesis]] in biology&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Harrison, Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern, Cambridge University Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; and may even be related to animal coats and skin pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;H. Meinhardt, Models of Biological Pattern Formation, Academic Press (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=James D.|title=Mathematical Biology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K3LmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA436|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-08539-4|pages=436–450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications of reaction-diffusion equations include ecological invasions,&lt;ref&gt;E.E. Holmes et al, Ecology 75 (1994): 17&lt;/ref&gt; spread of epidemics,&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Murray et al, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 229 (1986: 111&lt;/ref&gt; tumour growth&lt;ref&gt;M.A.J. Chaplain J. Bio. Systems 3 (1995): 929&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sherratt and M.A. Nowak, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 248 (1992): 261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Gatenby and E.T. Gawlinski, Cancer Res. 56 (1996): 5745&lt;/ref&gt; and wound healing.&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Sherratt and J.D. Murray, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B 241 (1990): 29&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the interest in reaction-diffusion systems is that although they are nonlinear partial differential equations, there are often possibilities for an analytical treatment.&lt;ref name="fife" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mikhailov" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Grindrod, Patterns and Waves: The Theory and Applications of Reaction-Diffusion Equations, Clarendon Press (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Smoller, Shock Waves and Reaction Diffusion Equations, Springer (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. S. Kerner and V. V. Osipov, Autosolitons. A New Approach to Problems of Self-Organization and Turbulence, Kluwer Academic Publishers (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experiments ==
Well-controllable experiments in chemical reaction-diffusion systems have up to now been realized in three ways. First, gel reactors&lt;ref&gt;K.-J. Lee et al., Nature 369 (1994): 215&lt;/ref&gt; or filled capillary tubes&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Hamik and O. Steinbock, New J. Phys. 5 (2003): 58&lt;/ref&gt; may be used. Second, [[temperature]] pulses on [[Catalytic converter|catalytic surfaces]] have been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Rotermund et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 66 (1991): 3083&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Graham et al., J. Phys. Chem. 97 (1993): 7564&lt;/ref&gt; Third, the propagation of running nerve pulses is modelled using reaction-diffusion systems.&lt;ref name="fitzhugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Hodgkin and A. F. Huxley, J. Physiol. 117 (1952): 500&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from these generic examples, it has turned out that under appropriate circumstances electric transport systems like plasmas&lt;ref&gt;M. Bode and H.-G. Purwins, Physica D 86 (1995): 53&lt;/ref&gt; or semiconductors&lt;ref&gt;E. Schöll, Nonlinear Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Chaos in Semiconductors, Cambridge University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; can be described in a reaction-diffusion approach. For these systems various experiments on pattern formation have been carried out.

==Numerical treatments==
A reaction-diffusion system can be solved by using methods of [[numerical mathematics]]. There are existing several numerical treatments in research literature.&lt;ref&gt;S.Tang et al., J.Austral.Math.Soc. Ser.B 35(1993): 223-243&lt;/ref&gt; Also for complex [[geometry|geometries]] numerical solution methods are proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Isaacson | first1 = Samuel A. | last2 = Peskin | first2 = Charles S.| title = Incorporating Diffusion in Complex Geometries into Stochastic Chemical Kinetics Simulations | journal = SIAM J.

[[File:Recycle001.svg|thumb|right|The Universal Recycling Symbol, here rendered with a black outline and green fill. Both filled and outline versions of the symbol are in use.]]
The universal '''recycling symbol''' ({{Unichar|2672|Universal recycling symbol}} or {{Unichar|267B|Black universal recycling symbol}} in [[Unicode]]) is internationally recognized.

==History==
Worldwide attention to environmental issues led to the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970. [[Container Corporation of America]], a large producer of recycled paperboard, sponsored a contest for art and design students at high schools and colleges across the country to raise awareness of environmental issues. It was won by [[Gary Anderson (designer)|Gary Anderson]], then a 23-year-old college student at the [[University of Southern California]], whose entry was the image now known as the universal recycling symbol.&lt;ref name=GaryFound&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Penny|author2=Jerry Powell |title=Gary Anderson has been found!|journal=Resource Recycling: North America's Recycling and Composting Journal|date=May 1999|pages=pg.1–2|url=http://logoblink.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/recycling_symbol_garyanderson.pdf|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbol is not [[trademark]]ed and is in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name=GaryFound/&gt; The public-domain status of the symbol has been challenged, but this challenge was unsuccessful owing to the wide use of the symbol. However, the universal symbol may have been inspired by similar existing recycling symbols, such as one featuring two arrows chasing each other in a circle that Volkswagen stamped in the early 1960s into some automobile parts it remanufactured{{citation_needed|date=September 2018}}.

==Variants==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gary anderson and recycling logo.JPG|right|thumbnail|[[Gary Anderson (recycling)|Gary Anderson]] (right) showing his original design of the recycling logo in 1970]] --&gt;
The recycling symbol is in the [[public domain]], and is not a [[trademark]]. The Container Corporation of America originally applied for a trademark on the design, but the application was challenged, and the corporation decided to abandon the claim.&lt;ref name="GaryFound"/&gt; As such, anyone may use or modify the recycling symbol, royalty-free.

Though use of the symbol is regulated by law in some countries,&lt;ref name=RulesLogo&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules Governing Use of Recycling Logo|url=http://www.recyclingexpert.co.uk/rules-governing-use-recycling-logo.html|work=Recycling Expert [website]|publisher=recyclingexpert.co.uk|accessdate=2011-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  countless variants of it exist worldwide. Anderson's original proposal had the arrows form a triangle standing on its tip—upside down compared with the versions most commonly seen today—but the CCA, in adopting Anderson's design, rotated it 60° to stand on its base instead.&lt;ref name="GaryFound"/&gt;

Both Anderson's proposal and CCA's designs form a Möbius strip with ''one'' half-twist by having two of the arrows fold over each other, and one fold under, thereby canceling out one of the other folds. However, most variants of the symbol used today have all the arrows folding over themselves, producing a Möbius strip with ''three'' half-twists. Existing single half-twist variants of the logo do not generally agree on which of the arrows is the one to fold underneath.  The logo is usually displayed with the arrows circulating clockwise, but the underlying Möbius strip exists in two [[topology|topologically]] distinct mirror-image forms of opposite [[handedness]].

The [[American Paper Institute]] originally promoted four different variants of the recycling symbol for different purposes. The plain Möbius loop, either white with an outline or solid black, was to be used to indicate that a product was ''recyclable''.  The other two variants had the Möbius loop inside a circle—either [[white on black]] or black on white—and were meant for products ''made of recycled materials'', with the white-on-black version to be used for 100% recycled fiber, and the black-on-white version for products containing both recycled and unrecycled fiber.&lt;ref name="GaryFound"/&gt; For example, a paper envelope might have both the first and last of these four symbols, to indicate that it was recyclable, and made from both recycled and unrecycled fibers.

In addition to the [[resin identification code]]s 1–7 in the triangular recycling symbol, Unicode lists the following recycling symbols:
* {{unichar|2672|UNIVERSAL RECYCLING SYMBOL}}
* {{unichar|267A|RECYCLING SYMBOL FOR GENERIC MATERIALS}}
* {{unichar|267B|BLACK UNIVERSAL RECYCLING SYMBOL}}
* {{unichar|267C|RECYCLED PAPER SYMBOL}} (indicates product contains recycled paper)
* {{unichar|267D|PARTIALLY-RECYCLED PAPER SYMBOL}} (indicates product contains partially recycled paper)
* {{unichar|267E|PERMANENT PAPER SIGN}} (e.g. for [[acid-free paper]])

An ISO/IEC working group has researched and documented some of the variations of the recycling logo currently{{when|date=June 2012}} in use, and has made recommendations for adding some more of them to the Unicode standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Everson|first1=Michael (co-editor)|title=Background information on Recycling Symbols|url=http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n2342.pdf|work=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2 N2342|publisher=ISO/IEC|accessdate=2011-05-26|first2=Asmus|last2=Freytag (co-editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rapid expansion of materials converted to [[printer filament]] for [[3-D printing]] using [[recyclebot]] technology, a large expansion of resin identification codes has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Emily J. Hunt, Chenlong Zhang, Nick Anzalone, Joshua M. Pearce, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2015.02.004 Polymer recycling codes for distributed manufacturing with 3-D printers], ''Resources, Conservation and Recycling'', '''97''', pp. 24-30 (2015). [https://www.academia.edu/11229348/Polymer_recycling_codes_for_distributed_manufacturing_with_3-D_printers open access]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resin identification code==
In 1988, the American [[Society of the Plastics Industry]] (SPI) developed the [[resin identification code]] which is used to indicate the predominant plastic material used in the manufacture of the product or packaging.  Their purpose is to assist recyclers with sorting the collected materials, but they do not necessarily mean that the product/packaging can be recycled either through domestic curbside collection or industrial collections.  The SPI symbols are loosely based on the Möbius loop symbol, but feature simpler bent (rather than folded over) arrows that can be embossed on plastic surfaces without loss of detail.  The arrows are formed into a flat, two-dimensional triangle rather than the pseudo-three-dimensional triangle used in the original recycling logo.

The different resin identification codes can be represented by [[Unicode]] icons &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♳&lt;/span&gt; (U+2673), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♴&lt;/span&gt; (U+2674), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♵&lt;/span&gt; (U+2675), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♶&lt;/span&gt; (U+2676), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♷&lt;/span&gt; (U+2677), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♸&lt;/span&gt; (U+2678), &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♹&lt;/span&gt; (U+2679), and &lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;♺&lt;/span&gt; (U+267A).

[[Recycling codes]] extend these numbers above 7 to include various non-plastic materials, including metals, glass, paper, and batteries of various types. 

==Other variants==
[[File:Recycle symbol Taiwan.svg|thumb|[[Taiwan]]'s recycling symbol features the use of [[negative space]] to also create arrows pointing outward]]
♾, an [[infinity]] sign (∞) inside a circle, represents the '''permanent paper symbol''',  used in packaging and publishing to signify the use of durable [[acid-free paper]].   In some ways, this logo expresses the ''opposite'' intention from the recycle logo, in that the acid-free paper is intended to last indefinitely, rather than being recycled.  Nevertheless, acid-free paper does not usually contain toxic materials (although certain inks do), so it is easily recycled or composted.

A satirical version of the classic recycling logo also exists, in which the three arrows are twisted from a circular pattern to pointing radially outward, thus symbolizing wasteful one-time usage rather than environmentally friendly recycling.  This message is reinforced by the circular inscription, "THIS PROJECT WAS ENVIRONMENTALLY UNFRIENDLY", surrounding the modified logo.  The satirical logo appears in the 1998 catalog of an [[installation art]] work in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], in which the artist [[Steven Pippin]] modified a row of glass-doored washing machines in a [[laundromat]] to operate as giant cameras.  The cameras were used to take sequential photographs in the manner of pioneering [[stop motion]] photographer [[Eadweard Muybridge]].  The front-loading washing machines were then used to develop and process the 24&amp;nbsp;inch (61&amp;nbsp;cm) diameter circular film negatives.&lt;ref name=LaundroLoco&gt;{{cite book|last=Pippin|first=Steven John|author2=San Francisco Museum of Modern Art|title=Laundromat locomotion : Mr. Pippin : [on the occasion of the Exhibition Laundromat Locomotion]|year=1998|publisher=Verlag der Kunst|location=[Amsterdam ; Dresden]|isbn=90-5705-094-3|type=Softcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''regional language''' is a [[language]] spoken in an area of a [[sovereign state]], whether it be a small area, a [[Federalism|federated]] [[State (administrative division)|state]] or [[province]], or some wider area.

Internationally, for the purposes of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], ''"regional or minority languages" means languages that are: ''
#''traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and ''
#''different from the official language(s) of that State''&lt;ref name=COE-Charter&gt;{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|website=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an [[official language]].

==Influence of number of speakers==
There are many cases when a regional language can claim greater numbers of speakers than certain languages which happen to be [[official language]]s of sovereign states. For example, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (a regional language of [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], albeit the [[national language]] of [[Andorra]]) has more speakers than [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Danish language|Danish]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Catalan only has 4M L1 speakers}}  A similar situation exists in China, where [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], spoken in southern [[Jiangsu]], northern, and the general area of [[Shanghai]] [[Zhejiang]] by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than [[French language|French]]; [[Yue Chinese]], a [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese regional variety]] spoken in [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]] and nearby areas in [[China]] with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of [[Malaysia]]), outnumbers [[Italian language|Italian]] in number of speakers. Dialects of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in [[Fujian]] and in nearby [[Taiwan]], but also in the [[Southeast Asian]] countries of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

==Relationship with official languages==
In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state's main language or [[official language]]. For example:

*The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.
*The [[Modern Gutnish|Gutnish language]], a regional language spoken in [[Gotland]] and related to the Swedish language.
*[[Westrobothnian]] is another Swedish regional language native to historical [[Westrobothnia]].
*[[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] in [[Kurdistan]], which is an autonomous region in [[Northern Iraq]], Northwestern [[Iran]] and southeastern [[Turkey]].
*[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] in northern Iraq, northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran.
* Regional varieties in China are considered part of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[macrolanguage]], with the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the most commonly spoken and [[Standard Chinese]] based on the [[Beijing dialect]].
**[[Wu Chinese|Wu]], in [[Shanghai]], southern [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]] and eastern [[Jiangxi]].
**[[Yue Chinese]], in [[Guangdong]], parts of [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Cantonese]] is the regional standard variety for Yue-speaking areas
**[[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], in parts of [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]], and [[Taiwan]]
**[[Min Chinese|Min]], in [[Fujian]], [[Taiwan]], eastern [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]].
**[[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], in [[Hunan]].
**[[Gan Chinese|Gan]], in [[Jiangxi]].
*[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], a regional language of [[Poland]].
*[[Limburgish]], a regional language in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and Belgium, has around one million speakers and is closely related to [[Luxembourgish]], [[South Guelderish]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]].
*[[Low German]] (also referred to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of [[Old Saxon]]. Sometimes (e.g. by nds and nds-nl Wikipedia) considered two languages divided by today’s Netherlands–German border on account of Dutch influences in the west and German influences in the east; closely related to [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], more distantly to [[German language|German]].
*[[Scots language|Scots]], a regional language of [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] (both part of the [[United Kingdom]], and where it is known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]] in the latter location), belongs to the same family of [[West Germanic languages]] as [[English language|English]].
* [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] and [[Venetian language|Venetian]], regional languages spoken in [[Italy]] which also belong to the same family of standard Italian ([[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]]).
* Regional languages of [[Languages of Spain|Spain]] and [[Languages of Portugal|Portugal]]:
**[[Aranese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Galician language|Galician]] are each, in the regions where they are the autochthonous language, co-official in status with [[Spanish language|Castilian]] (Spanish) which is official everywhere in the [[Kingdom of Spain]].
**[[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]] are recognized (but unofficial) in [[Asturias]] and [[Castile and León]] (Spain), while [[Mirandese]] is co-official with Portuguese in [[Miranda do Douro]] (Portugal). These Romance languages are classified under the term [[Astur-Leonese linguistic group|Astur-Leonese languages]]. [[Astur-Leonese]] is closely related to both [[Castilian language|Castilian]] and [[Galician language|Galician]], which itself is most closely related to [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is an [[Occitano-Romance languages|Occitano-Romance language]].
**[[Occitan]], most widely spoken across the Pyrenees in France and Catalonia, together with Catalan, forms a subgroup of Romance languages linguistically intermediate between [[Gallo-Romance languages|French]] and the [[Ibero-Romance languages]] of Spain and Portugal. [[Aranese]] is a subdialect of [[Gascon language|Gascon]]
*[[Tibetic languages]]
**[[Amdo tibetan language]] have regional official status in [[amdo]] or [[Qinghai]].
**[[Standard Tibetan]] is currently based on [[Lhasa Tibetan]].
*[[Võro language|Võro]] and [[Seto language|Seto]], regional languages of [[Estonia]], are either dialects of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] or separate [[Finnic languages]] as Estonian.
*[[Walloon language|Walloon]], a regional language of France and [[Belgium]], belongs to the same family of [[Oïl languages]] as [[French language|French]].
*[[Hindi language|Hindi]] and English are the [[official languages]] of [[India]]'s [[Government of India|Central Government]].
** [[Languages of India|Indian regional languages]] are: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri language|Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Urdu]]

In other cases, a regional language may be very different from the state's main language or official language. For example:

*[[Basque language|Basque]], a regional language spoken in [[Spain]] and [[France]] ([[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]]).
*[[Breton language|Breton]], a regional Celtic language spoken in [[France]] ([[Brittany]]).
*[[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] is an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]] language, and one of the many [[Native American languages]] spoken in the [[United States|U.S.]] State of [[Oklahoma]].
*[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a non-living regional Celtic language originating in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Cornwall]]).
*[[Corsican language|Corsican]], a regional language in [[France]] ([[Corsica]]) closely related to the [[Tuscan dialect]] of [[Italian language|Italian]].
*[[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], a regional [[Turkic languages|Turkic language]] spoken in [[Moldova]].
*[[Livonian language|Livonian]], a regional language of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic family]] spoken in [[Latvia]].
*[[Resian dialect|Resian]], a dialect of [[Slovene language|Slovene]] spoken in [[Italy]] ([[Resia, Friuli|Resia valley]]).
*[[Sardinian language|Sardinian]], a regional [[Romance languages|Romance language]] spoken in [[Italy]] ([[Sardinia]]).
*[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], a regional [[Celtic language]] spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Scotland]]).
*[[Sorbian language|Sorbian]], a regional [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] language of [[Germany]].
*[[Welsh language|Welsh]], a regional [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language spoken in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Wales]]).

==Official languages as regional languages==
An official language of a country may also be spoken as a regional language in a region of a neighbouring country. For example:
*[[Afrikaans]], an official language of [[South Africa]], is a regional language of [[Namibia]].
*[[Cantonese]], one of the official standard varieties in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] (both [[Special administrative region (People's Republic of China)|special administrative region]]s of the [[People's Republic of China]]), is used as a regional language of the province of [[Guangdong Province|Guangdong]], [[People's Republic of China]].
*[[Catalan language|Catalan]], the official language of [[Andorra]], is a regional language in [[Spain]] ([[Catalonia]], [[Balearic Islands]] and [[Valencian Community]]), [[France]] ([[Pyrénées Orientales]]) and [[Italy]] ([[Alghero]], [[Sardinia]]).
*[[German language|German]], an official language of [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Switzerland]], is a regional language in [[Italy]] ([[South Tyrol]]), [[Poland]] ([[Silesia]]), [[France]] ([[Alsace]] and [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]), [[Denmark]] and [[Namibia]].

'''''Ressentiment''''' ({{IPA-fr|rɛsɑ̃timɑ̃}}) is the French translation of the English word [[resentment]] (from Latin intensive prefix ''re-'', and ''sentir'' "to feel"). In [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] it is a concept that was of particular interest to the [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophers]]. According to the existentialists, ''ressentiment'' is a sense of  hostility directed at that which one identifies as the [[cause]] of one's [[frustration]], that is, an assignment of blame for one's frustration.  The sense of weakness or inferiority and perhaps [[jealousy]] in the face of the "cause" generates a rejecting/justifying value system, or [[morality]], which attacks or denies the perceived source of one's frustration. This value system is then used as a means of justifying one's own weaknesses by identifying the source of envy as objectively inferior, serving as a [[defense mechanism]] that prevents the resentful individual from addressing and overcoming their insecurities and flaws. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] creates an enemy in order to insulate itself from culpability.{{Citation Needed|date=June 2015}}

== History ==
''Ressentiment'' was first introduced as a philosophical/psychological term by the 19th century philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]].&lt;ref&gt;Poole, Roger. ''Kierkegaard'', University of Virginia Press, 1993, pp. 226–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stivers, Richard. ''Shades of loneliness'', Rowman &amp; Little Field o, 2004, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, John, et al. ''Kierkegaard after MacIntyre'', Open Court , 2001, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] later [[Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche|independently]] expanded the concept; [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] ascribes Nietzsche's use of the term in part to the absence of a proper equivalent term in the [[German language]], contending that this absence alone "would be sufficient excuse for Nietzsche", if not for a translator.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Kaufmann, Walter]]. "Editor's Introduction, Section 3" ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'' in ''Nietzsche: Basic Writings''; Walter Kaufmann, tr. New York: The Modern Library, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; The term came to form a key part of his ideas concerning the psychology of the '[[Master–slave morality|master–slave]]' question (articulated in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]''), and the resultant birth of [[morality]]. Nietzsche's chief development of ressentiment came in his book ''[[On The Genealogy of Morals]]''; see esp §§ 10&amp;ndash;11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Anth/AnthMore.htm][https://web.archive.org/web/20130628040813/http://www.nietzschecircle.com/essayArchive1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ressentiment'' was translated as [[envy]] in [[Howard V. Hong|Hong]]'s translation of Kierkegaard's ''[[Two Ages: A Literary Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see pages 81-87&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was also used by [[Max Scheler]] in his book ''[[Ressentiment (Scheler)|Ressentiment]]'', published in 1912, and later suppressed by the [[Nazis]].

Currently of great import as a term widely used in psychology and [[existentialism]], ressentiment is viewed as an influential force for the creation of identities, moral frameworks and value systems. However there is debate as to what validity these resultant value systems have, and to what extent they are maladaptive and destructive.

== Perspectives ==
===Hegel===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The old conception—due to a one-sided survey of human life—of Nemesis, which made the divinity and its action in the world only a levelling power, dashing to pieces everything high and great,—was confronted by Plato and Aristotle with the doctrine that God is not envious. The same answer may be given to the modern assertions that man cannot ascertain God. These assertions (and more than assertions they are not) are the more illogical, because made within a religion which is expressly called the revealed; for according to them it would rather be the religion in which nothing of God was revealed, in which he had not revealed himself, and those belonging to it would be the heathen “who know not God.” If the word of God is taken in earnest in religion at all, it is from Him, the theme and centre of religion, that the method of divine knowledge may and must begin: and if self-revelation is refused Him, then the only thing left to constitute His nature would be to ascribe envy to Him. But clearly if the word Mind is to have a meaning, it implies the revelation of Him.&lt;br&gt;—''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'' by [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1817), Section 564&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39064/39064-h/39064-h.html#toc39 Hegel's ''Philosophy of Mind'']&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is a fundamental truth of human nature that man is incapable of remaining permanently on the heights, of continuing to admire anything. [[Human nature]] needs variety. Even in the most enthusiastic ages people have always liked to joke enviously about their superiors. That is perfectly in order and is entirely justifiable so long as after having laughed at the great they can once more look upon them with admiration; otherwise the game is not worth the candle. In that way ressentiment finds an outlet even in an enthusiastic age. And as long as an age, even though less enthusiastic, has the strength to give ''ressentiment'' its proper character and has made up its mind what its expression signifies, ressentiment has its own, though dangerous importance. …. the more reflection gets the upper hand and thus makes people indolent, the more dangerous ''ressentiment'' becomes, because it no longer has sufficient character to make it conscious of its significance. Bereft of that character reflection is a cowardly and vacillating, and according to circumstances interprets the same thing in a variety of way. It tries to treat it as a joke, and if that fails, to regard it as an insult, and when that fails, to dismiss it as nothing at all; or else it will treat the thing as a witticism, and if that fails then say that it was meant as a moral satire deserving attention, and if that does not succeed, add that it was not worth bothering about. …. ''ressentiment'' becomes the constituent principle of want of character, which from utter wretchedness tries to sneak itself a position, all the time safeguarding itself by conceding that it is less than nothing. The ''ressentiment'' which results from want of character can never understand that eminent distinction really is distinction. Neither does it understand itself by recognizing distinction negatively (as in the case of ostracism) but wants to drag it down, wants to belittle it so that it really ceases to be distinguished. And ''ressentiment'' not only defends itself against all existing forms of distinction but against that which is still to ''come''. …. The ''ressentiment'' which is ''establishing itself'' is the process of [[Leveling (philosophy)|leveling]], and while a passionate age storms ahead setting up new things and tearing down old, raising and demolishing as it goes, a reflective and passionless age does exactly the contrary; it ''hinders and stifles'' all action; it levels. Leveling is a silent, mathematical, and abstract occupation which shuns upheavals. In a burst of momentary enthusiasm people might, in their despondency, even long for a misfortune in order to feel the powers of life, but the apathy which follows is no more helped by a disturbance than an engineer leveling a piece of land. At its most violent a rebellion is like a volcanic eruption and drowns every other sound. At its maximum the leveling process is a deathly silence in which one can hear one’s own heart beat, a silence which nothing can pierce, in which everything is engulfed, powerless to resist. One man can be at the head a rebellion, but no one can be at the head of the leveling process alone, for in that case he would be leader and would thus escape being leveled. Each individual within his own little circle can co-operate in the leveling, but it is an abstract power, and the leveling process is the victory of abstraction over the individual. The leveling process in modern times, corresponds, in reflection, to fate in antiquity. ... It must be obvious to everyone that the profound significance of the leveling process lies in the fact that it means the predominance of the [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] ‘[[generation]]’ over the [[Categories (Aristotle)|category]] ‘[[individuality]]’." —[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[Present age|The Present Age]]'' (Alexander Dru tr.), 1962, pp. 49–52&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;(T)he problem with the other origin of the “good,” of the good man, as the person of ''ressentiment'' has thought it out for himself, demands some conclusion. It is not surprising that the lambs should bear a grudge against the great birds of prey, but that is no reason for blaming the great birds of prey for taking the little lambs. And when the lambs say among themselves, "These birds of prey are evil, and he who least resembles a bird of prey, who is rather its opposite, a lamb,—should he not be good?" then there is nothing to carp with in this ideal's establishment, though the birds of prey may regard it a little mockingly, and maybe say to themselves, "We bear no grudge against them, these good lambs, we even love them:  nothing is tastier than a tender lamb."&lt;br&gt;—[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], ''[[On the Genealogy of Morality]]''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Ressentiment'' is a reassignment of the pain that accompanies a sense of one's own inferiority/failure onto an external scapegoat. The ego creates the illusion of an enemy, a cause that can be "blamed" for one's own inferiority/failure. Thus, one was thwarted not by a failure in oneself, but rather by an external "evil."

According to Kierkegaard, ''ressentiment'' occurs in a "reflective, passionless age", in which the populace stifles creativity and passion in passionate individuals. Kierkegaard argues that individuals who do not conform to the masses are made scapegoats and objects of ridicule by the masses, in order to maintain status quo and to instill into the masses their own sense of superiority.

''Ressentiment'' comes from reactiveness: the weaker someone is, the less their capability to suppress reaction.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''The Will to Power'', 78.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nietzsche, the more a person is active, strong-willed, and dynamic, the less place and time is left for contemplating all that is done to them, and their reactions (like imagining they are actually better) become less compulsive. The reaction of a strong-willed person (a "wild beast"&lt;ref&gt;''On the Genealogy of Morality'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;), when it happens, is ideally a short action: it is not a prolonged filling of their intellect.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Genealogy of Morality'', 10, last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scheler===
{{main|Ressentiment (Scheler)}}
[[Max Scheler]] attempted to reconcile Nietzsche's ideas of master–slave morality and ressentiment with the Christian ideals of love and humility. Nietzsche saw Christian morality as a kind of slave morality, while Greek and Roman culture was characterized as a master morality. Scheler [[Ressentiment_(Scheler)|disagrees]]. He begins with a comparison of Greek love and Christian love.  Greek love is described as a movement from lower value to higher value. The weaker love the stronger, the less perfect love the more perfect. The perfect do not love the imperfect because that would diminish their value or corrupt their existence. Greek love is rooted in need and want. This is clearly indicated by the Aristotelian concept of God as the "Unmoved Mover". The unmoved mover is self-sufficient being completely immersed in its own existence. The highest object of contemplation, and who moves others through the force of attraction because efficient causality would degrade its nature.

In Christian love, there is a reversal in the movement of love.  The strong bend to the weak, the healthy help the sick, the noble help the vulgar.  This movement is a consequence of the Christian understanding of the nature of God as fullness of being.  God's love is an expression of His superabundance.  The motive for love is not charity nor the neediness of the lover, but it is rooted in a deeply felt confidence that through loving I become more personalized and most real to myself.  The motive for the world is not need or lack (à la Schopenhauer), but a creative urge to express the infinite fullness of being.  Poverty and sickness are not values to be celebrated in order to spite those who are rich and healthy, but they simply provide the opportunity for a person to express his love.  Rich people are harder to love because they are less in need of your generosity.  Fear of death is a sign of a declining, sick, and  broken life (Ressent 60). St. Francis' love and care for the lepers would have mortified the Greek mind, but for St. Francis, the threats to well-being are inconsequential because at the core of his being there is the awareness that his existence is firmly rooted in and sustained by the ground of ultimate being.  In genuine, Christian love, the lower values that are relative to life are renounced not because they are bad, but simply because they are obstacles to those absolute values which allow a person to enter into a relationship with God.  It is through loving like God that we are deified.  This is why Scheler sees the Christian saint as a manifestation of strength and nobility and ''not'' manifesting ressentiment.

===Weber===

[[Max Weber]] in ''The Sociology of Religion'' relates ressentiment to Judaism, an ethical salvation religion of a "pariah people."  Weber defines ressentiment as "a concomitant of that particular religious ethic of the disprivileged which, in the sense expounded by Nietzsche and in direct inversion of the ancient belief, teaches that the unequal distribution of mundane goods is caused by the sinfulness and the illegality of the privileged, and that sooner or later God's wrath will overtake them."  (Max Weber,  ''The Sociology of Religion,''  (Boston: Beacon Press, 1993),  110.

===Sartre===

[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] used the term [[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]] to describe a highly similar phenomenon of blaming one's own failure on external factors and therefore denying [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for oneself.

===Deleuze===

[[Gilles Deleuze]] significantly develops the concept of ressentiment as discussed by Nietzsche in his work ''[[Nietzsche and Philosophy]]''.

=== Girard ===
[[René Girard]] differs from Nietzsche by assessing the ressentiment is a left-over of not pursuing the mimetic rival or the scapegoat. It is the price paid for turning the other cheek. [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] could be achieved only by moving beyond rivalry and ressentiment.

'''Right-wing terrorism''' is [[terrorism]] motivated by a variety of ideologies and beliefs, including [[Islamophobia]], [[anti-communism]], [[neo-fascism]] and [[neo-Nazism]]. This type of terrorism has been sporadic, with little or no international cooperation.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p= 45}} Modern radical right-wing terrorism first appeared in [[Western Europe]] in the 1970s and it first appeared in [[Eastern Europe]] following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|p=57}}

Right-wing terrorists aim to overthrow governments and replace them with [[nationalism|nationalist]] or [[fascism|fascist]]-oriented regimes.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p= 45}} The core of this movement includes [[white power skinhead|neo-fascist skinheads]], [[Far-right politics|far-right]] [[Football hooliganism|hooligans]], youth sympathisers and intellectual guides who believe that the state must rid itself of foreign elements in order to protect its ''rightful'' citizens.{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|pp=57-58}} However, they usually lack a rigid ideology.{{sfn|Moghadam|Eubank|2006|p=58}}

{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
Armin Falk and colleagues suggests that Right-Wing Extremist Crime (REC), which includes anti-foreigner and racist motivations, is associated with unemployment rates (261). Consequently, as unemployment rates increase, REC also increases. This correlation can be found in several countries including Germany, United States, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, this phenomenon is not necessarily associated with individuals, rather unemployment impacts society's humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism. Meaning, as unemployment rates increase, humanitarian values of tolerance and altruism decrease according to Falk. This cause of right-wing terrorism can be associated with a functionalist perspective on employment. Ferrante defines a functionalist approach as "how the parts of society contribute in expected and unexpected way of maintain an existing social order" (26). Work and employment serve several functions for society (University of Minnesota 12.2). The University of Minnesota Library suggests that employment provides workers with an income and also contributes to their self-identity and fulfillment (12.2). When employment is low, this leads to a perceived threat towards self-identity and fulfillment which can then lead to a larger possibility for right-wing terrorism to occur.

A second cause of right-wing terrorism as Thomas Greven suggests, is [[populism]], or more accurately, [[right-wing populism]]. Jan-Werner Muller describes populism as a form of [[identity politics]] that is inherently anti-establishment and anti-pluralist (3). More simply put, populism supports the advancement of 'the average citizen', and it does not support the agendas of the privileged elite.  Furthermore, Greven defines right-wing populist as those who support [[ethnocentrism]], and [[opposition to immigration|oppose immigration]] (3).  Right-wing populist policies that have recently been covered in the media include the [[Executive Order 13769]], which is the travel ban from Muslim-majority countries to the United States, and the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump]] which proposes that a wall should be built between the United States and Mexico in order to prevent illegal immigrants from coming to the United States. Greven suggests that immigration policy not only threatens economic competition, but also threatens traditional values and identities (5).  Due to the ethnocentric motivations behind these policies, they are classified as right-wing populism. Because right-wing populism creates a climate of 'us versus them', terrorism is more likely to occur according to Greven. This cause of right-wing terrorism can be associated with a conflict perspective. Ferrante explains the conflict perspective as a focus on conflict regarding scarce resources and the strategies advantaged groups used to perpetuate social agreement arrangements from which they benefit (30). When people feel as though their traditional values are being threatened by the social elite who contribute to the rise in immigration, conflict ensues, and terrorism follows.

===South Africa===
In 1993 [[Chris Hani]], the General Secretary of the [[South African Communist Party]] was murdered by Polish-born far-right anti-Communist [[Janusz Waluś]] who had been lent a firearm by far-right pro-Apartheid MP [[Clive Derby-Lewis]].
The [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]], a neo-Nazi paramilitary organisation, has often been described as terrorist. 
In 2010 South African authorities foiled a plot by far-right terrorists to commit attacks as revenge for the murder of [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]], seizing explosives and firearms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/07/south-africa-white-extremist-bomb|title=South African police foil white extremist bomb plot|first=David|last=Smith|date=7 May 2010|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
During [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military government]], some right-wing military engaged in violent repression. The [[Riocentro#1981 May Day Attack|Riocentro 1981 May Day Attack]] was a bombing attempt that happened on the night of April 30, 1981. Severe casualties were suffered by the terrorists. While an NGO held a fundraiser fighting for democracy and free elections and celebrating the upcoming holiday, a bomb exploded at Riocentro parking area killing army seargent Guilherme Pereira do Rosário and severely wounding captain Wilson Dias Machado, who survived the bomb explosion. The bomb exploded inside a car where both were preparing it. Rosário died instantaneously. They were the only casualties.

The [[Para-SAR]] example&lt;ref name="para-sar2-br"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brasileiros magazine|url=http://brasileiros.com.br/2014/03/o-paraquedista-que-evitou-um-banho-de-sangue/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="para-sar1-br"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fatos magazine|date=June 1, 1985|url=http://www.arqanalagoa.ufscar.br/pdf/recortes/R04927.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; was revealed by [[Brazilian Air Force]] captain Sérgio Ribeiro Miranda de Carvalho in 1968 before it reached the execution phase as it was made public to the press after a meeting with his superior Brigadier General João Paulo Burnier and chief of Para-SAR unity. Burnier discussed a secret plan to bomb a dense traffic area of [[Rio de Janeiro]] known as "[[Gasômetro]]" during commute and later claim that Communists were the perpetrators. He expected to be able to run a witch-hunt against the growing political military opposition. Burnier also mentioned his intentions on making the Para-SAR, a [[Brazilian Air Force]] rescue unity, a tool for eliminating some military government political oppositors throwing them to the sea at a wide distance of the coast. On both of these events, no military involved on these actions or planning was arrested, charged or faced retaliation from the [[Brazilian military government]]. The only exception is captain Sérgio de Carvalho which had to leave the air force for facing his superiors retaliation after whistleblowing brigadier Burnier's plan.

The term "''white terrorism''" is used by scholars to label terrorism committed against [[African Americans]] during the [[Reconstruction era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schenk|first1=David H.|title=Freedmen with Firearms: White Terrorism and Black Disarmament During Reconstruction|journal=Gettysburg College Journal of the Civil War Era|volume=4|date=April 30, 2014|url=http://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&amp;context=gcjcwe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butchart, Ronald E.

A report in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', published on November 25, 2018, showed violent right-wing-related incidents up, and left-wing-related incidents down.  Total domestic terrorism incidents was down to 41 in 2001, from a high of 468 in 1970, but then went up to 65 in 2017. Of those 65 events in 2017, 36 were right-wing-related (with 11 fatalities), 10 were left-wing-related (with 6 fatalities), 7 were related to Islamist extremism (with 16 fatalities), and 12, including the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], were categorized as "Other/Unknown" (with 62 fatalities, including 58 from the Las Vegas incident). The report found that 2018 was a particularly deadly year, with 11 people dying in the [[Pittsburgh synagogue shooting]], 2 others in an incident in Kentucky, and two more in a [[2018 Tallahassee shooting|shooting in Tallasshee]].  All three incidents were right-wing related.&lt;ref name=wapo112518&gt;Lowery, Wesley; Kindy, Kimberly; and Ba Tran, Andrew (November 25, 2018) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/in-the-united-states-right-wing-violence-is-on-the-rise/2018/11/25/61f7f24a-deb4-11e8-85df-7a6b4d25cfbb_story.html "In the United States, right-wing violence is on the rise"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Post'' reported that the upsurge in right-wing violence began during the [[Barack Obama administration]] and picked up steam under the presidency of [[Donald Trump]], whose remarks after the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlotteville, Virginia]] in 2017 that there were "some very fine people on both sides" is widely seen as giving confidence to the right that the administration looked favorably on their goals, providing them with "tacit support". A former FBI assistant director for counterintelligence, is quoted as saying that "[political leaders] from the White House down, used to serve as a check on conduct and speech that was abhorrent to most people. I see that eroding. ... The current political rhetoric is at least enabling, and certainly not discouraging, violence."&lt;ref name=wapo112518 /&gt;

According to analysis by the newspaper of data from the [[Global Terrorism Database]], 92 of 263 domestic terrorism events &amp;ndash; 35% &amp;ndash;  that occurred from 2010 to 2017 were right-wing related, while 38 (14%) were Islamist extremist-related, and 34 (13%) were left-wing related.   Not only that, but a criminologist from [[John Jay College]] stated that right-wing attacks were statistically more likely to result in fatalities.&lt;ref name=wapo112518 /&gt;

== Europe ==

===Denmark===
Neo-Nazis were suspected to have perpetrated the [[1992 Copenhagen bombing]], in which the office of a left-wing socialist party was attacked, killing one of its members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.b.dk/nationalt/afdoed-nynazist-haevdes-at-staa-bag-brevbombe?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
In the town of [[Toulon]], a far-right extremist group called SOS-France existed. On 18 August 1986, four members were driving a car carrying explosives, apparently in an attempt to bomb the offices of [[SOS Racisme]]. However it exploded while they were still in it, killing all four of them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apnews.com/b94eda4f669fd78ae616120b07cf66e8&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Nazi members of the [[French and European Nationalist Party]] were responsible for a pair of [[1988 Cannes and Nice attacks|anti-immigrant terror bombings]] in 1988. Sonacotra hostels in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] and Cannes were bombed, killing Romanian immigrant George Iordachescu and injuring 16 people, mostly Tunisians. In an attempt to [[False flag|frame Jewish extremists]] for the Cagnes-sur-Mer bombing, the terrorists left leaflets bearing [[Star of David|Stars of David]] and the name [[Masada]] at the scene, with the message "To destroy [[Israel]], Islam has chosen the sword. For this choice, Islam will perish."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhouse|first1=Steven|title=Immigrant Hostel Bombed in France|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/world/immigrant-hostel-bombed-in-france.html|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=New York Times|date=20 December 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2008, members of the neo-Nazi Nomad 88 group fired with machine guns at people from their car in [[Saint-Michel-sur-Orge]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/06/03/un-groupuscule-neonazi-a-l-origine-d-une-fusillade_1053066_3224.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.leparisien.fr/essonne/le-groupuscule-neonazi-decide-de-s-autodissoudre-04-06-2008-3298544168.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in the aftermath of the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]], six mosques and a restaurant were attacked in acts deemed as right-wing terrorism by authorities.&lt;ref name="Europol16"/&gt; The acts included grenade throwing, shooting, and use of an [[improvised explosive device]].

=== Germany ===
{{See also|Far-right politics in Germany|Terrorism in Germany}}

In 1980, a [[Oktoberfest terror attack|right-wing terrorist attack in Munich, Germany]] killed the attacker and 12 other people, injuring 215. Fears of an ongoing campaign of major right-wing terrorist attacks did not materialize.{{sfn|Aubrey|2004|p=45}}

In addition to several bank robberies, the German [[National Socialist Underground]] was responsible for the [[Bosphorus serial murders]] (2000–2006), the [[2004 Cologne bombing]] and the murder of policewoman [[Michéle Kiesewetter]] in 2007. In November 2011, two members of the National Socialist Underground committed suicide after a bank robbery and a third member was arrested some days later.

Right-wing extremist offenses in Germany rose sharply in 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref name="Bleiker"&gt;Carla Bleiker, [http://www.dw.com/en/sharp-rise-in-right-wing-crime-in-germany-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/a-19041652 Sharp rise in right-wing crime in Germany just 'the tip of the iceberg'],  [[Deutsche Welle]] (February 11, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the German government tallied 316 violent xenophobic offences in 2014 and 612 such offenses in 2015.&lt;ref name="Bleiker"/&gt;

In August 2014, a group of four Germans founded a [[Munich]]-based far-right terrorist group, the {{ill|Oldschool Society|de}}.  The group, which held racist, antisemitic, and anti-Muslim views, eventually attracted 30 members.&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"&gt;Associated Press, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/15/germany-far-right-terrorist-group-four-jailed Four jailed in Germany for forming far-right terrorist group] (March 15, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; They stockpiled weapons and explosives and plotted to attack a refugee shelter in [[Saxony]],&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"/&gt; but the group's leaders were arrested in May 2015 before carrying out the attack.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Brady, [http://www.dw.com/en/oldschool-society-neo-nazis-go-on-trial-for-refugee-home-attacks/a-19217024 'Oldschool Society' neo-Nazis go on trial for refugee home attacks], [[Deutsche Welle]] (April 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017 four of the group's leaders were sentenced to prison terms.&lt;ref name="APOldschoolsentence"/&gt; The perpetrator of the [[2016 Munich shooting]] also had far-right views.

=== Italy ===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Italy endured the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterized by frequent terrorist attacks: between 1969 and 1982, the nation suffered 8,800 terrorist attacks, in which a total of 351 people were killed and 768 were injured.&lt;ref name="Hof"&gt;Tobias Hof, "The Success of Italian Anti-terrorism Policy" in ''An International History of Terrorism: Western and Non-Western Experiences'' (editors Jussi M. Hanhimäki &amp; Bernhard Blumenau: Routledge, 2013), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorist attacks have been both ascribed to the far-left and the far-right, yet a lot of terrorist attacks remain without a clear culprit and a lot of people have claimed the authorship of them is to be ascribed to rogue members of the Italian secret service. Even some of the terrorist attacks ascribed to a particular political group may be in reality the work of these rogue agents: this has been claimed, among many others, by [[Francesco Cossiga]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2006/11/21/italia/politica/cossiga-le-spie-ve-le-racconto-io-pAUXKv2TCn4Yp824sScL1O/pagina.html |title=Cossiga: «Le spie?

The [[Years of Lead]] are considered to have begun with the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] in [[Milan]] in December 1969,&lt;ref name="Hof"/&gt; perpetrated by [[Ordine Nuovo]], a right-wing [[neofascist]] group.&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;Richard McHugh, "Ordine Nuovo" in ''The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism'', 2d ed. (editor Gus Martin: SAGE Publications, 2011), pp. 451-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen people were killed, and 90 injured, in the bombing.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt;

In July 1970, this same group carried out a bombing on a train going from Rome to Messina, killing six and wounding almost 100.  The group also carried out the [[Piazza della Loggia bombing]] in 1974, killing eight antifascist activists.&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt; Perhaps the most infamous right-wing terrorist attack in post-war Italy is the  [[August 1980 Bologna bombing]], in which neo-fascist [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] ("Armed Revolutionary Nuclei"), an Ordine Nuovo offshoot, killed 85 people and injured 200 at the [[Bologna Centrale railway station|Bologna railroad station]].&lt;ref name="McHugh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1988Convictions"&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Four-Convicted-Of-Mass-Murder-In-Italian-Bombing-That-Killed-85/id-370c14ae3f77e87d266b0257bf7d2f62 Four Convicted of Mass Murder in Italian Bombing that Killed 85], Associated Press (July 11, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valerio Fioravanti]], Francesca Mambro, and two others were convicted of mass murder in the attacks,&lt;ref name="1988Convictions"/&gt; although both have always denied any connection with them.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Cento Bull &amp; Philip Cooke, ''Ending Terrorism in Italy'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 141-42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Hanley, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-accidental-terrorist-1259973.html The accidental terrorist], ''Independent'' (May 5, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

First he bombed several government buildings in [[Oslo]], killing eight people and injuring more than 30. After the bombings, he went to [[Utøya]] island in a fake police uniform and began firing on people attending a political youth camp for the [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Worker's Youth League]] (AUF), a left-wing political party, killing 68 and injuring more than 60.

===Poland===
{{See also|Far-right politics in Poland}}
Despite the country being nearly ethnically and religiously homogenous, Polish far-right targets, via propaganda or physical violence, religious and ethnic minorities such as Jews, [[Romani people]], people with darker complexion or Middle Eastern appearance. In 1991, an [[Mława riot|anti-Romani pogrom broke out in Mława]]. During the [[UEFA Euro 2012]], Polish hooligans targeted random Russian football supporters.

[[The Savior (paramilitary organization)|The Savior]] was a [[neo-Nazi]] militant [[nationalist]] organization which claimed credit for the August [[2006 Moscow market bombing]], which killed 13.

In [[mathematics]], a '''smooth maximum''' of an [[indexed family]] ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of numbers is a [[smooth approximation]] to the [[maximum]] function &lt;math&gt;\max(x_1,\ldots,x_n),&lt;/math&gt; meaning a [[parametric family]] of functions &lt;math&gt;m_\alpha(x_1,\ldots,x_n)&lt;/math&gt; such that for every {{mvar|''α''}}, the function {{tmath|m_\alpha}} is smooth, and the family converges to the maximum function {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha\to\infty}}. The concept of '''smooth minimum''' is similarly defined. In many cases, a single family approximates both: maximum as the parameter goes to positive infinity, minimum as the parameter goes to negative infinity; in symbols, {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \max}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to \infty}} and {{tmath|m_\alpha \to \min}} as {{tmath|\alpha \to -\infty}}. The term can also be used loosely for a specific smooth function that behaves similarly to a maximum, without necessarily being part of a parametrized family.

== Examples ==
For large positive values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the following formulation is one smooth, [[differential (calculus)|differentiable]] approximation of the maximum function.  For negative values of the parameter that are large in absolute value, it approximates the minimum.

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n e^{\alpha x_i}}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; has the following properties:
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \max&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[arithmetic mean]] of its inputs
#&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_\alpha\to \min&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\alpha\to -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

The gradient of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is closely related to [[softmax function|softmax]] and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla_{x_i}\mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{e^{\alpha x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^n e^{\alpha x_j}} [1 + \alpha(x_i - \mathcal{S}_\alpha (x_1,\ldots,x_n))].
&lt;/math&gt;

This makes the softmax function useful for optimization techniques that use [[gradient descent]].

=== LogSumExp ===
{{main|LogSumExp}}
Another smooth maximum is [[LogSumExp]]:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{LSE}(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n))
&lt;/math&gt;

This can also be normalized if the &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are all non-negative, yielding a function with domain &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)^n&lt;/math&gt; and range &lt;math&gt;[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
g(x_1, \ldots,  x_n) = \log( \exp(x_1) + \ldots + \exp(x_n) - (n - 1) )
&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;(n - 1)&lt;/math&gt; term corrects for the fact that &lt;math&gt;\exp(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; by canceling out all but one zero exponential, and &lt;math&gt;\log 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; if all &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5191">In [[engineering]], '''technical peer review''' is a type of engineering review. Technical peer reviews are a well defined review process for finding and fixing defects, conducted by a team of peers with assigned roles. Technical peer reviews are carried out by peers representing areas of life cycle affected by material being reviewed (usually limited to 6 or fewer people). Technical peer reviews are held within development phases, between milestone reviews, on completed products or completed portions of products.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"&gt;{{cite book| title=NASA Systems Engineering Handbook| id=SP-610S | year=2007|publisher=[[NASA]]|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080008301_2008008500.pdf}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

A technical peer review may also be called a ''engineering peer review'', a ''product peer review'', a ''peer review/inspection'' or an ''inspection.''

== Overview ==
The purpose of technical peer reviews is to remove defects as early as possible in the development process. By removing defects at their origin (e.g., requirements and design documents, test plans and procedures, software code, etc.), technical peer reviews prevent defects from propagating through multiple phases and work products, and reduce the overall amount of rework necessary on projects.

In addition, improved team efficiency is a side effect of technical peer reviews (e.g., by improving team communication, integrating the viewpoints of various engineering specialty disciplines, more quickly bringing new members up to speed, and educating project members about effective development practices).

In [[CMMI]], peer reviews are used as a principal means of verification in the Verification process area and as an objective evaluation method in the Process and Product Quality Assurance process area. The results of technical peer reviews can be reported at milestone reviews. (See [[Milestone (project management)]].)

==Roles of participants==
;Moderator
Responsible for conducting the technical peer review process and collecting inspection data. Plays key role in all stages of the technical peer review process except rework. Required to perform several duties during a technical peer review in addition to inspector’s tasks.

;Inspectors
Responsible for finding defects in work product from a general point of view, as well as defects that affect their area of expertise.

;Author
Provides information about work product during all stages of process. Responsible for correcting all major defects and any minor and trivial defects that cost and schedule permit. Performs duties of an inspector.

;Reader
Guides team through work product during the technical peer review meeting. Reads or paraphrases work product in
detail. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to reader’s role.

;Recorder
Accurately records each defect found during inspection meeting on the Inspection Defect List. Performs duties of an inspector in addition to recorder’s role.

== Vested interest of reviewers ==
There are two philosophies about the vested interest of the inspectors in the product under review. On one hand, project personnel who have a vested interest in the work product under review have the most knowledge of the product and are motivated to find and fix defects. On the other hand, personnel from outside the project
who do not have a vested interest in the work product bring objectivity and a fresh viewpoint to the technical peer review team. 

Each inspector is invited to disclose vested interests to the rest of the technical peer review panel so the Moderator can exercise sound judgement in evaluating the inspector's inputs.

== Distinction from other types of technical review ==
Peer reviews are distinct from management reviews, which are conducted by management representatives rather than by colleagues, and for management and control purposes rather than for technical evaluation. They are also distinct from [[software audit review]]s, which are conducted by personnel external to the project, to evaluate compliance with specifications, standards, contractual agreements, or other criteria.

A [[software peer review]] is a type of technical peer review. The [[IEEE]] defines formal structures, roles, and processes for software peer reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[[IEEE]] Std. 1028-1997, "IEEE Standard for Software Reviews"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management involvement ==
Management representatives are typically not involved in the conduct of a peer review. This is especially true of line managers of the author or other participants in the review. A policy of encouraging management to stay out of peer reviews encourages the peer review team to concentrate on the product being reviewed and not on the people or personalities involved.

== Detailed instructions ==
For detailed instructions on conducting a technical peer review/inspection, see NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, Appendix N.&lt;ref name = "NASA-6105"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern instances of terror include [[Red Terror (disambiguation)|red terror]] or [[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]].

Before the late twentieth century, the term ''"terrorism"'' in the English language was often used interchangeably with "''terror''." Some contemporary writers use terrorism to refer to acts by groups with a limited political base or parties on the weaker side in [[asymmetric warfare]] and terror to acts by governments and [[law enforcement]] officials, usually within the legal framework of the state. Others consider state terror to be a specific type of terrorism.

==Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary terror==
{{Main|Revolutionary terror}}
[[Revolutionary terror]], also known as ''"[[Red terror]]"'', was often used by revolutionary governments to suppress [[counterrevolutionaries]]. The first example was the [[Reign of Terror]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy", by Barrington Moore, Edward Friedman, James C. Scott (1993) {{ISBN|0-8070-5073-3}}, p.101: "Social Consequences of  Revolutionary Terror"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April08/Lafayette.cov.cn.html French revolutionary terror was a gross exaggeration, say Lafayette experts. By Chandni Navalkha.] April 28, 2008. accessed 5-20-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include the ''[[Red Terror]]'' in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1918–1922, as well as simultaneous campaigns [[Red Terror (Hungary)|in the Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and [[Red Terror (Finland)|in Finland]]. In China [[Red Terror (China)|Red Terror]] in 1966 and 1967 started the [[Cultural revolution]]. 

Counterrevolutionary terror is usually referred to as ''"[[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]]"''. Notable examples are the terror campaigns [[First White Terror|in France]] (1794–1795), [[White Terror (Russia)|in Russia]] (1917–20), [[White Terror (Hungary)|in Hungary]] (1919–1921), and [[White Terror (Spain)|in Spain]]. Modern examples of counter-revolutionary terror include [[Operation Condor]] in South America.

==Terror and terrorism==
{{Terrorism}}
David Forte states that the primary difference between terror and [[terrorism]] is that while terror can be neutrally evil (i.e., random violence committed by [[robbers]], [[rapists]], and even [[military personnel]]), terrorism has the additional political or moral dimension, being the systematized use of randomly focused violence by organized groups against [[non-combatants]] to effect a political objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forte |first1=David F.|last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Terror and Terrorism: There Is a Difference |journal=Ohio Northern University Law Review |volume=13 |issue= |pages=39–52 |publisher=Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law |doi= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/onulr13&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Charles Tilly defines "terror" as a political strategy defined as "asymmetrical deployment of threats and violence against enemies using means that fall outside the forms of political struggle routinely operating within some current regime," and therefore ranges from:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. Terror, Terrorism, Terrorists. ''Sociological Theory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, Theories of Terrorism: A Symposium (Mar., 2004), pp. 5-13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#intermittent actions by members of groups that are engaged in wider political struggles to
#one segment in the modus operandi of durably organized specialists in coercion, including government-employed and government-backed specialists in coercion to
#the dominant rationale for distinct, committed groups and networks of activists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tilly, the term "terror" spans across a wide range of human cruelties, from Stalin's use of executions to clandestine attacks by groups like the Basque separatists and the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and even ethnic cleansing and genocide&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Voice Project''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit advocacy group focused on promoting freedom of artistic expression as an agent of social change.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://voiceproject.org/movement.php The Voice Project Movement]'', The Voice Project. Retrieved 17 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was founded in 2009 as a response to the [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|Lord's Resistance Army Insurgency]] in Northern [[Uganda]], but has since expanded programs into [[Sudan]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Cuba]], and the [[United States]].

==Background==
The Voice Project works to defend the right of freedom of expression by advocating for artists who use their work as an agent of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/going-forward/ |title=Going Forward |publisher=The Voice Project |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was founded in [[Uganda]] in 2009, having built radio stations and produced broadcast content in support of local singers who were using their songs to engourage combatants to return home from war in that country. The Voice Project has since worked to provide advocacy and legal aid for imprisoned artists as well as fiscal sponsorship and other support to activist-artists who use their artistic work as an agent for social change. In addition to its actions as an advocacy group, The Voice Project serves as a news source for updates in the field of freedom of expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/news/ |title=News and Updates |publisher=The Voice Project |accessdate=March 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originmagazine.com/2012/10/18/the-voice-project-by-hunter-heaney/ |title=The Voice Project by Hunter Heaney |publisher=ORIGIN Magazine |accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Central Africa===
Founded in 2009, The Voice Project was inspired by women's groups in Northern Uganda who have used songs passed by word of mouth and on the radio to let children and soldiers who have been abducted and forced to fight in [[Joseph Kony|Joseph Kony’s]] [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA) know that they are forgiven for the atrocities they were forced to commit and are welcome home. The project was started by Hunter Heaney who in the fall of 2008 was volunteering at an IDP ([[Internally Displaced Persons]]) camp in Agoro, a small village in northern Uganda's war-torn [[Kitgum District]] when he first heard the "dwog paco" ("come home") songs. Upon returning to the United States, Heaney and friends Anna Gabriel (daughter of [[Peter Gabriel]]) and Chris Holmes ([[Ashtar Command (band)|Ashtar Command]]) co-founded the organization, enlisting friends and musicians from around the world and having them pass participation from one to another by word of mouth and through music by covering another artist’s song in "cover chains." &lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Augusta (October 1, 2010).

Participants have included indie rock acts such as [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]], [[Andrew Bird]], [[Dawes (band)|Dawes]], and [[Joe Purdy]] as well as international recording artists such as [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Mike Mills]] ([[R.E.M.]]), [[Angélique Kidjo]] and former child soldier [[Emmanuel Jal]].&lt;ref&gt;Dwyer, Augusta (October 1, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Vine, Lauren (August 11, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kreps, Daniel (June 22, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jonathan Daniel (June 22, 2010).

In 2012 it was reported that The Voice Project had been working with the [[United Nations]] to build [[FM radio]] stations, produce music content, and record family members and ex-combatants in their native [[Luo languages]] encouraging LRA escapes and defections and encouraging former combatants to return home, and that between 2010 and 2012 more than 100 soldiers had escaped or defected from the LRA with many returnees claiming that the radio broadcasts were the main factor in their decision to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, Shannon (February 13, 2012).

====Pussy Riot Support Fund====
[[File:TVP &amp; Pussy Riot in Santa Fe, NM.jpg|thumb|The Voice Project's Hunter Heaney here with Pussy Riot's Nadya Tolokonnikova and Masha Alekhina using a press conference to call artist Tania Bruguera who was being detained in Cuba. May 2015.]]
From 2012 to 2014, The Voice Project coordinated international donations through an international legal defense and support fund for [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]] of [[Pussy Riot]] during their [[Pussy Riot#Imprisonment|imprisonment]] in Russian [[corrective labor colony|corrective labor colonies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20026056 |title=Russia sends Pussy Riot women to camps east of Moscow |date=October 22, 2012 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=November 1, 2012 |archivedate=November 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BqwqmePP?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20026056 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which supported the women's legal expenses, supplied them with provisions while in the prison camps and child care, in addition to safety monitoring by local Russian lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/kim-gordon-james-murphy-and-jake-gyllenhaal-party-for-pussy-riot-20140207 |title= Kim Gordon, James Murphy and Jake Gyllenhaal Party for Pussy Riot |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://voiceproject.org/docs/financials/TVP-2013-Financials.pdf The Voice Project 2013 Financials]"&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 1, 2014, The Voice Project reported that the fund had raised over USD$120,000 in support of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, the majority of which (USD$94,000) went to  support efforts such as hiring local monitoring attorneys, food, clothing and supplies for the women and care for their children via their families, with the rest supporting other Pussy Riot members (USD$16,000) and legal defense efforts ($10,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voiceproject.org/your-voice/2014/01/01/the-pussy-riot-international-support-fund-%E2%80%93-january-1-2014-report/ |title=The Pussy Riot International Support Fund January 1, 2014 Report |date=January 1, 2014 |publisher= The Voice Project |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zona Prava and MediaZona====
In 2014, though the support fund itself had closed with the release of Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, The Voice Project continued in its work with the women promoting human rights, notably by coordinating their first visit to the United States in February, 2014, and the arrangement of the [[New York City|New York]] human rights gala which marked it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304680904579368892816595538 |title=Two Pussy Riot Members Make A Splash In New York |date=February 7, 2014 |publisher= The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=March 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 The Voice Project formed a partnership with Tolokonnikova and Alekhina's newly formed prisoners' rights NGO, Zona Prava, to provide donations-processing and administrative support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/nadya-tolokonnikova.html |title=Nadya Tolokonnikova |date=August 16, 2014 |publisher= The New York Times |accessdate=August 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project's partnership with Zona Prava has continued through its fiscal sponsorship of the organization's US activities, and coordination, participation, and partnership in events such as the Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina's September, 2014 panel at [[Harvard University]] and subsequent meeting with philosopher and activist [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/names/2014/09/15/namesriot/r2hHUjV4UctHWB3BveQtAO/story.html |title=Pussy Riot Bring Message to Harvard |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher= The Boston Globe |accessdate=December 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2015, The Voice Project, Zona Prava, and [[SITE Santa Fe]] made a surprise phone call to detained Cuban activist-artist [[Tania Bruguera]] following an event hosted by SITE and the [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]. During the phone call Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina made a public declaration of their solidarity with Bruguera and stated that they would be working together going forward to address the issues facing each of their groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Pussy-Riot-The-Voice-Project-and-SITE-Santa-Fe-Call-Detained-Artist-Tania-Bruguera-20150515 |title=Pussy Riot, The Voice Project and SITE Santa Fe Call Detained Artist Tania Bruguera |date=May 15, 2015 |publisher= Broadway World Music |accessdate=June 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan===
In 2012, The Voice Project worked in partnership with [[Los Angeles]]-born Afghan-American filmmaker and musician Ariana Delawari in [[Kabul, Afghanistan|Kabul]], sponsoring her appearance at the 2012 [[TED (conference)|TEDx Kabul]] conference and her appearance at the Sound Central music festival, the first of its kind in post-Communist Afghanistan, as such performances were outlawed under the [[Taliban]] and other Afghan regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arianadelawari.com/news/ |title=News – TEDx Kabul |date=September 8, 2012 |publisher=Ariana Delawari |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/06/kabul-school-of-rock-muslims/1615751/ |title=Kabul School of Rock Gains Acceptance Among Muslims |date=October 8, 2012 |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delawari began working with The Voice Project when she traveled to Uganda in order to aid with documenting and filming the Amplify Peace campaign, and it is in Uganda that The Voice Project began to support her work in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tedxkabul.com/videos.html |title=2012 Speakers |date=October 2012 |publisher=TEDx Kabul |accessdate=April 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal shared by The Voice Project, Delawari, and the Sound Central and TEDx Kabul programs has been the creation of a safe and flourishing environment for expression and the arts in Central Asia.

===United States===

====Solidarity Wisconsin====
Beginning with the [[2011 Wisconsin protests]] over [[collective bargaining]] rights, the Solidarity Sing Along has been a continued gathering in the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] building and grounds for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wnpj.org/pdf/2011_AnnReport.pdf |title=2011 Annual Report |publisher=Wisconsin Network for Peace and Justice |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the state government began requiring permits for demonstrations by groups of four or more in the State Capitol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/105254165/Wisconsin-State-Facilities-Access-Policy |title=Wisconsin State Facilities Access Policy |date= December 2011 |publisher=Wisconsin Department of Administration |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began arresting, issuing tickets to, and prosecuting protestors, including the Solidarity Singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=41433 |title=Protesters file some 15,000 complaints against Capitol police over Solidarity Sing Along arrests |date=November 19, 2013 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, [[Isthmus (newspaper)|Isthmus]], through its ''Daily Page'' website, reported on The Voice Project's ''Solidarity Wisconsin'' campaign in support of the Solidarity Singers, calling for the dismissal of the charges brought against the singers, raising the topic on social media, and petitioning Attorney General [[J. B. Van Hollen]] to stop the continued prosecution of the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=42250 |title=Pussy Riot members petition Wisconsin attorney general to stop prosecuting Solidarity Sing Along |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video produced by The Voice Project in 2014 brought increased attention to the cases outside Wisconsin, much of which resulted from the declaration of solidarity from [[Pussy Riot]] members [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]] and [[Maria Alyokhina]], who had previously worked with The Voice Project, with the demonstrations in the capitol. [[The Capital Times]] newspaper, based in Madison, reported on The Voice Project's activism in advocating for demonstration rights in Wisconsin, framed through the context of more familiar human rights abuses in Russia and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://host.madison.com/entertainment/music/pussy-riot-joins-the-cause-of-wisconsin-s-solidarity-singers/article_771e6413-869f-5597-8e96-814615c8713a.html |title=Pussy Riot joins the cause of Wisconsin's solidarity singers |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=The Capitol Times |accessdate=March 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 19, 2014, [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]] Judge John Markson has dismissed 29 tickets based on his ruling in ''State of Wisconsin v. Michael W. Crute'', No. 13FO2108 (1st Cir. Feb. 5, 2014), which found that the permit law was against the [[Constitution of Wisconsin|State Constitution]] but the Department of Justice had issued an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailypage.com/daily/article.php?article=42310 |title=Wisconsin DOJ to appeal Dane County court ruling dismissing Solidarity Sing Along tickets on constitutional grounds |date=March 19, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Page |accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 29, 2015, the Wisconsin Fourth District Court of Appeals dismissed all of the approximately 400 cases brought against the Solidarity Singers, upholding the lower court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/01/29/1360955/-Wisconsin-Appeals-Court-Upholds-Dismissal-of-Solidarity-Sing-Along-Citations |title=Wisconsin Appeals Court Upholds Dismissal of Solidarity Sing Along Citations |date=January 29, 2015 |publisher=The Daily Kos |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project has continued to advocate for the free expression and assembly of the protestors who continue in the Solidarity Sing Along.

====Cecily McMillan====
In 2014, The Voice Project spearheaded a letter-writing campaign in support of [[Occupy Wall Street]] activist [[Cecily McMillan]], who was tried and subsequently convicted of assault on a plainclothes police officer, which she claimed was in self-defense from sexual assault.  A majority of the jurors who convicted McMillan argued that she should not receive a prison sentence, as she faced a potential seven-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/08/cecily-mcmillan-jurors-judge-occupy-activist-jail|publisher=The Guardian|title=Cecily McMillan jurors tell judge Occupy activist should not go to jail|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to McMillan's harsh potential sentence, The Voice Project conducted a campaign, encouraging supporters to write letters petitioning for leniency to Judge Ronald Zweibel, who was overseeing the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/19/cecily-mcmillan-sentencing/|publisher=Mashable|title=Occupy Activist Cecily McMillan Gets 3 Months in Prison: A Rare Interview|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign collected letters from the general public, as well as numerous artists including [[Shepard Fairey]], [[Kim Gordon]], [[Spike Jonze]], [[JD Samson]], [[Lauren Mayberry]], [[Justin Vivian Bond]], and [[Nadezhda Tolokonnikova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://concertblogger.com/2014/05/voice-project-campaign-cecily-mcmillan-w-pussy-riot-kim-gordon-chvrches/|publisher=Concert Blogger|title=The Voice Project Campaign For Cecily McMillan with Pussy Riot, Kim Gordon, Chvrches, and More|accessdate=22 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
In 2014 the Voice Project spearheaded two letter-writing campaigns to the Chinese government, regarding the treatment and detention of activists in Tibet, calling for the release of activist artists and an end to the governmental crackdown on voices of dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/arrested-chinese-artist-guo-jian-must-be-released-the-voice-project/|publisher=Vents Magazine|title=Arrested Chinese Artist Guo Jian Must Be Released – The Voice Project|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One campaign specifically focused on Gebey, a Tibetan singer arrested after a May 24, 2014 concert in which he sang songs promoting use of the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/song-05262014160729.html|publisher=Radio Free Asia|title=Tibetan Singer Held After Belting Out Song Calling for Language Protection|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gebey was released in June, 2014, the campaign in support of the other 10 detained artists is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/tibet/release-06172014154208.html|publisher=Radio Free Asia|title=Chinese Authorities Release Tibetan Singer Who Sought Language Protection|accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and activist organization [[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]] in the Stand By You 2.0 campaign, which featured the projection of messages from supporters around the world onto the Lennon Wall in Downtown Hong Kong, the operational center of the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/peter-gabriel-pussy-riot-show-support-for-hong-kong-protestors-20141129 |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Show Support for Hong Kong Protestors |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images projected included messages from [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Pussy Riot]], and [[Iron &amp; Wine]] in a stated mission for the organizations and supporters to "show [protestors] that we still stand with them, and to help counteract propaganda that they don't have support out there." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2854422/Peter-Gabriel-Pussy-Riot-rally-Hong-Kong-protesters.html |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Rally for Hong Kong Protestors |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=The Daily Mail |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/pussy-riot/81425 |title=Pussy Riot and Peter Gabriel Send Messages of Support to Hong Kong Demonstrators |date=November 29, 2014 |publisher=NME |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of the supporters holding umbrellas, namesake and common symbol of the [[Umbrella Movement]], appeared bearing messages of their solidarity as captions in both English and Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/30/peter-gabriel-pussy-riot-show-support-for-hong-kon/ |title=Peter Gabriel, Pussy Riot Show Support For Hong Kong Protesters |date=November 30, 2014 |publisher=The Washington Times |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba===
In January, 2015, The Voice Project launched an advocacy campaign in support of the [[Cuban American]] artist [[Tania Bruguera]], who was arrested by Cuban government authorities ahead of her planned December 30, 2014 performance art piece "Yo También Exijo" (I Also Demand) which consisted of an open microphone in [[Havana|Havana's]] [[Plaza de la Revolución]], inviting Cubans to openly share their thoughts on the state of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/cultura/arte/20150129/abci-tania-bruguera-izquierda-espana-201501282118.html|publisher=ABC Sevilla|title=Tania Bruguera "La izquierda no debería desentenderse de mi retensión en Cuba"|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bruguera was released, the government has kept her under surveillance while building charges against her, with an extended detention barring her from leaving. In response, The Voice Project launched a campaign in which activists wrote letters to Cuban president [[Raúl Castro]] and [[Council of Ministers (Cuba)|Minister of Justice]] María Esther Reus González, "strongly urging [the government] to unconditionally drop the case against this artist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.artinfo.com/artintheair/2015/02/05/tania-bruguera-detained-in-cuba-for-at-least-60-more-days/|publisher=Blouin Art Info|title=Tania Bruguera Detained in Cuba for At Least 60 More Days|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice Project has continued to work with Bruguera and the Yo También Exijo platform to support the artist through advocacy as her case proceeds, as well as facilitating collaboration between Bruguera and the other artists supported by the group.

[[File:Diverse torture instruments.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A variety of torture instruments. Many, including the large [[Iron Maiden of Nuremberg]], were never used for torture.]]
'''Torture''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''tortus'': to twist, to torment) is the act of deliberately inflicting severe physical or psychological [[suffering]] on someone by another as a punishment or in order to fulfill some desire of the torturer or force some action from the victim. Torture, by definition, is a [[mens rea|knowing and intentional act]]; deeds which unknowingly or negligently inflict suffering or pain, without a specific intent to do so are not typically considered torture.&lt;ref&gt;http://mentalfloss.com/article/23038/9-insane-torture-techniques&lt;/ref&gt;
Torture has been carried out or sanctioned by individuals, groups, and states throughout history from ancient times to modern day, and forms of torture can vary greatly in duration from only a few minutes to several days or longer. Reasons for torture can include [[punishment]], [[revenge]], political [[Brainwashing|re-education]], [[deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[coercion]] of the victim or a third party, [[interrogation]] to extract information or a [[confession]] irrespective of whether it is [[false confession|false]], or simply the [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] gratification of those carrying out or observing the torture. Alternatively, some forms of torture are designed to inflict [[Psychological torture|psychological pain]] or leave as little physical injury or evidence as possible while achieving the same psychological devastation. The torturer may or may not kill or injure the victim, but torture may result in a [[murder|deliberate death]] and serves as a form of [[capital punishment]]. Depending on the aim, even a form of torture that is intentionally fatal may be prolonged to allow the victim to suffer as long as possible (such as [[half-hanging]]). In other cases, the torturer may be indifferent to the condition of the victim.

Although torture is sanctioned by some states, it is prohibited under [[international law]] and the [[domestic laws]] of most countries. Although widely illegal and reviled, there is an ongoing debate as to what exactly is and is not legally defined as torture. It is a serious violation of [[human rights]], and is declared to be unacceptable (but not illegal) by Article 5 of the [[United Nations|UN]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Signatories of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and the [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977 officially agree not to torture captured persons in [[armed conflicts]], whether international or internal. Torture is also prohibited for the signatories of the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], which has 163 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-9&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |title= United Nations Treaty Collection |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National and international legal prohibitions on torture derive from a consensus that torture and similar ill-treatment are immoral, as well as impractical, and information obtained by torture is far less reliable than that obtained by other techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/014/2005/en |title=Torture and Ill-Treatment in the 'War on Terror' |date=1 November 2005 |accessdate=22 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=general/&gt;&lt;ref name=reckoning/&gt; Despite these findings and international conventions, organizations that monitor abuses of human rights (e.g., [[Amnesty International]], the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], [[Freedom from Torture]], etc.) report widespread use condoned by states in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amnesty International]] [https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol10/001/2005/en/ Report 2005]  [https://web.archive.org/web/20070317170847/http://web.amnesty.org/report2006/2af-summary-eng Report 2006] &lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International estimates that at least 81 world governments currently practice torture, some of them openly.&lt;ref name="Amnesty08"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |title=Report 08: At a Glance |year=2008 |accessdate=22 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080708202906/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/report-08-at-a-glance |archivedate = 8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===International level===

====UN Convention Against Torture====
The [[United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]], which is currently in force since 26 June 1987, provides a broad definition of torture. Article 1.1 of the UN Convention Against Torture reads:
{{blockquote|For the purpose of this Convention, the term "torture" means any act by which severe [[pain]] or [[suffering]], whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him, or a third person, information or a [[Confession (law)|confession]], punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or [[intimidating]] or [[Coercion|coercing]] him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a [[public official]] or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/39/a39r046.htm|title=A/RES/39/46. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment|website=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This definition was restricted to apply only to nations and to government-sponsored torture and clearly limits the torture to that perpetrated, directly or indirectly, by those acting in an official capacity, such as [[government agency|government personnel]], [[law enforcement officers|law enforcement personnel]], [[medical personnel]], [[military personnel]], or [[politicians]]. It appears to exclude:
# torture perpetrated by [[gang]]s, [[hate group]]s, [[rebellion|rebel]]s, or [[terrorist]]s who ignore national or international mandates;
# random violence during war; and
# punishment allowed by national laws, even if the punishment uses techniques similar to those used by torturers such as [[mutilation]], [[flagellation|whipping]], or [[corporal punishment]] when practiced as [[criminal justice|lawful punishment]]. Some professionals in the torture rehabilitation field believe that this definition is too restrictive and that the definition of politically motivated torture should be broadened to include all acts of organized violence.&lt;ref&gt;James Jaranson, "The Science and Politics of Rehabilitating Torture Survivors," in ''Caring for Victims of Torture,'' edited by Michael K. Popkin, Amer Psychiatric Pub Inc.1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Declaration of Tokyo====

An even broader definition was used in the 1975 [[Declaration of Tokyo]] regarding the participation of medical professionals in acts of torture:

:For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a confession, or for any other reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo,'' 1975.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218203758/http://www.wma.net/en/30publications/10policies/c18/index.html |date=18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition includes torture as part of [[domestic violence]] or ritualistic abuse, as well as in criminal activities.

====Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court====
The [[Rome Statute]] is the [[treaty]] that set up the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). The treaty was adopted at a diplomatic conference in Rome on 17 July 1998 and went into effect on 1 July 2002. The Rome Statute provides a simplest definition of torture regarding the prosecution of [[war criminals]] by the International Criminal Court. Paragraph 1 under Article 7(e) of the Rome Statute provides that:

{{quote|"Torture" means the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions;&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm ROME STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT], INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT, 17 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture====

The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], which is in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention reads:

{{quote|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/Treaties/a-51.html Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture], Organization of American States, 9 December 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Amnesty International====

Since 1973, [[Amnesty International]] has adopted the simplest, broadest definition of torture. It reads:

:Torture is the systematic and deliberate infliction of acute pain by one person on another, or on a third person, in order to accomplish the purpose of the former against the will of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/001/1984/en/ Amnesty International, (1973) ''Torture in the Eighties.'' USA Edition. Amnesty International Publication.] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal level===

====United States====

=====U.S. Code § 2340=====
[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] contains the definition of torture in 18 U.S.C. § 2340, which is only applicable to persons committing or attempting to commit torture outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="LGT"&gt;{{USC|18|2340A}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It reads:
{{quote|As used in this chapter—
:(1) “torture” means an act committed by a person acting under the [[color of law]] specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control;
:(2) “severe mental pain or suffering” means the prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
:: (A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
:: (B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
:: (C) the threat of imminent death; or
:: (D) the threat that another person will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality; and
: (3) “United States” means the several [[U.S. state|states]] of the United States, the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|commonwealths]], [[Territories of the United States|territories, and possessions of the United States]].}}

In order for the United States to assume control over this jurisdiction, the alleged offender must be a U.S. national or the alleged offender must be present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the victim or alleged offender. Any person who conspires to commit an offense shall be subject to the same penalties (other than the penalty of death) as the penalties prescribed for an actual act or attempting to commit an act, the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="LGT"/&gt;

=====Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991=====
The [[Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991]] provides remedies to individuals who are victims of torture by persons acting in an official capacity of any foreign nation. The definition is similar to the U.S. Code § 2340, which reads:
{{quote|(b) TORTURE.—For the purposes of this Act—
:(1) the term "torture" means any act, directed against an individual in the offender's custody or physical control, by which severe pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering arising only from or inherent in, or incidental to, lawful sanctions), whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on that individual for such purposes as obtaining from that individual or a third person information or a confession, punishing that individual for an act that individual or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, intimidating or coercing that individual or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind; and
:2) mental pain or suffering refers to prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from—
::(A) the intentional infliction or threatened infliction of severe physical pain or suffering;
::(B) the administration or application, or threatened administration or application, of mind altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality;
::(C) the threat of imminent death; or
::(D) the threat that another individual will imminently be subjected to death, severe physical pain or suffering, or the administration or application of mind-altering substances or other procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-106/pdf/STATUTE-106-Pg73.pdf|title=PUBLIC LAW 102-256 — MAR. 12, 1992|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
{{Further information|History of human rights}}
In the study of the history of torture, some authorities rigidly divide the history of torture ''per se'' from the history of capital punishment, while noting that most forms of capital punishment are extremely painful. Torture grew into an ornate discipline, where calibrated violence served two functions: to investigate and produce confessions and to attack the body as a form of punishment. Entire populaces of towns would show up to witness an execution by torture in the public square. Those who had been "spared" torture were commonly locked barefooted into the stocks, where children took delight in rubbing feces into their hair and mouths.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Scott, ''A History of Torture'' (London: Merchant, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

Deliberately painful methods of torture and execution for severe crimes were taken for granted as part of justice until the development of [[Humanism]] in [[17th century philosophy]], and "[[cruel and unusual punishment]]" came to be denounced in the [[English Bill of Rights]] of 1689. The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the [[western world]] further developed the idea of universal [[human rights]]. The adoption of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 marks the recognition at least nominally of a general ban of torture by all UN member states.

Its effect in practice is limited, however, as the Declaration is not ratified officially and does not have legally binding character in international law, but is rather considered part of [[customary international law]]. Several countries still practice torture today. Some countries have legally codified it, and others have claimed that it is not practiced, while maintaining the use of torture in secret.&lt;ref&gt;"Nigeria's Torture Chambers Exposed in New Report." ''Amnesty''. September. 2014. Accessed 20 July. 2017. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/09/nigeria-s-torture-chambers-exposed-new-report/&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the days when Roman law prevailed throughout Europe, torture has been regarded as subtending three ''classes'' or ''degrees'' of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hirsch, ''ed.'', ''The Book of Torture and Executions'' (Toronto: Golden Books, 1944).&lt;/ref&gt; ''First-degree'' torture typically took the forms of whipping and beating but did not mutilate the body. The most prevalent modern example is [[bastinado]], a technique of beating or whipping the soles of the bare feet. ''Second-degree'' torture consisted almost entirely of crushing devices and procedures, including exceptionally clever screw presses or "bone vises" that crushed thumbs, toes, knees, feet, even teeth and skulls in a wide variety of ways. A wide array of [[Boot (torture)|"boots"]]—-machines variously and ingeniously designed to slowly crush feet—-are quite representative. Finally, ''third-degree'' tortures savagely mutilated the body in numerous dreadful ways, incorporating spikes, blades, boiling oil, and extremely carefully controlled fire. The serrated iron tongue shredder; the red-hot copper basin for destroying eyesight ([[abacination]], ''q.v.''); and the stocks that forcibly held the prisoner's naked feet, glistening with lard, directly over red-hot coals ([[foot roasting]], ''q.v.'') until the skin and foot muscles were burnt black and the bones fell to ashes are examples of torture in the third degree.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Antiquity===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
[[File:Flaying of rebels.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Assyria]]ns skinning or flaying their prisoners alive]]
Judicial torture was probably first applied in Persia. Over time torture has been used as a means of reform, inducing public terror, interrogation, spectacle, and sadistic pleasure. The [[ancient Greeks]] and [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] used torture for interrogation. Until the 2nd century AD, torture was used only on [[slave]]s (with a few exceptions).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Younger. ''Epistulae'' : X.96.5: "''Hunc abstinentia sanctitate, quoad viridis aetas, vicit et fregit; novissime cum senectute ingravescentem viribus animi sustinebat, cum quidem incredibiles cruciatus et indignissima tormenta pateretur.''"&lt;/ref&gt; After this point it began to be extended to all members of the [[Proletariat|lower classes]].&lt;ref&gt;de Ste. Croix, Geoffrey Ernst Maurice. ''Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy''. 2006. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A slave's testimony was admissible ''only'' if extracted by torture, on the assumption that slaves could not be trusted to reveal the truth voluntarily. This torture occurred to break the bond between a master and his slave. Slaves were thought to be incapable of lying under torture.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Edward. Torture. New York: Basil Blackwell Inc., 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

[[File:DublinTrinityCollegeMSEi40LifeAlbanFol45rMartyrdomAmphibalus.jpg|thumb|Torture of [[Christian martyrs]]]]
Medieval and early modern European courts used torture, depending on the crime of the accused and his or her social status. Torture was deemed a legitimate means to extract confessions or to obtain the names of accomplices or other information about a crime, although many confessions were greatly invalid due to the victim being forced to confess under great agony and pressure. It was permitted by law only if there was already [[half-proof]] against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001, 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was used in continental Europe to obtain [[corroborating evidence]] in the form of a confession when other evidence already existed.&lt;ref&gt;Langbein, John H., "Torture and Plea Bargaining" (1978). ''Faculty Scholarship Series''. Paper 543.
http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_papers/543&lt;/ref&gt; Often, defendants already sentenced to death would be tortured to force them to disclose the names of accomplices. Torture in the [[Medieval Inquisition]] began in 1252 with a papal bull [[Ad extirpanda|Ad Extirpanda]] and ended in 1816 when another [[papal bull]] forbade its use.

A highly esteemed torture in the times of the Inquisition as a good means of interrogating "taciturn" heretics and wizards was the interrogation chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|title=Please visit our colleagues in Bruges!|website=torturemuseumamsterdam.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714133744/http://www.torturemuseumamsterdam.com/#portfolio|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Torture was usually conducted in secret, in underground dungeons. By contrast, torturous executions were typically public, and woodcuts of English prisoners being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] show large crowds of spectators, as do paintings of Spanish [[auto-da-fé]] executions, in which heretics were burned at the stake. Torture was also used during this time period as a means of reform, spectacle, to induce fear into the public, and most popularly as a punishment for treason.

Medieval torture devices were varied. One old English chronicle from the Early Medieval period reads, "They hanged them by the thumbs, or by the head, and hung fires on their feet; they put knotted strings about their heads, and writhed them so that it went to the brain ... Some they put in a chest that was short, and narrow, and shallow, and put sharp stones therein, and pressed the man therein, so that they broke all his limbs ... I neither can nor may tell all the wounds or all the tortures which they inflicted on wretched men in this land." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bately|first= Janet M.|title= The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition. Vol. 3: MS. A |year= 1986| location=Cambridge |publisher=D.S. Brewer |isbn=978-0-85991-103-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tortures later in the Middle Ages consisted of whipping; the crushing of thumbs, feet, legs, and heads in iron presses; burning the flesh; and tearing out teeth, [[www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy)|fingernails]], and toenails with red-hot iron forceps. Limb-smashing and drowning were also popular medieval tortures. Specific devices were also created and used during this time, including the rack, the Pear (also mentioned in Grose's Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue (1811) as "Choak [''sic.''] Pears," and described as being "formerly used in Holland."), [[thumbscrew (torture)|thumbscrew]]s, animals like rats, the [[iron chair]], and the [[cat o nine tails]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5402/5402.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern period===
[[File:Lingchi (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Lingchi]] – execution by [[slow slicing]] – in Beijing around 1904.]]

During the early modern period, the [[torture of witches]] took place. In 1613, [[Anton Praetorius]] described the situation of the prisoners in the dungeons in his book ''Gründlicher Bericht Von Zauberey und Zauberern'' (''Thorough Report about Sorcery and Sorcerers''). He was one of the first to protest against all means of torture.

While secular courts often treated suspects ferociously, [[Will Durant|Will]] and Ariel Durant argued in ''The Age of Faith'' that many of the most vicious procedures were inflicted upon pious [[heresy|heretics]] by even more pious friars. The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] gained a reputation as some of the most fearsomely innovative torturers in medieval Spain.

Torture was continued by [[Protestants]] during the [[Renaissance]] against teachers who they viewed as [[Heresy|heretics]].

In England the trial by [[jury]] developed considerable freedom in evaluating evidence and condemning on [[circumstantial evidence]], making torture to extort confessions unnecessary. For this reason in England a regularized system of judicial torture never existed and its use was limited to political cases. Torture was in theory not permitted under English law, but in [[Tudors|Tudor]] and early [[Stuarts|Stuart]] times, under certain conditions, torture was used in England. For example, the confession of [[Marc Smeaton]] at the trial of [[Anne Boleyn]] was presented in written form only, either to hide from the court that Smeaton had been tortured on [[Rack (torture)|the rack]] for four hours, or because [[Thomas Cromwell]] was worried that he would recant his confession if cross-examined. When [[Guy Fawkes]] was arrested for his role in the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605 he was tortured until he revealed all he knew about the plot. This was not so much to extract a confession, which was not needed to prove his guilt, but to extract from him the names of his fellow conspirators. By this time torture was not routine in England and a special warrant from King [[James I of England|James I]] was needed before he could be tortured. The wording of the warrant shows some concerns for humanitarian considerations, specifying that the severity of the methods of interrogation were to be increased only gradually until the interrogators were sure that Fawkes had told all he knew. In the end this did not help Fawkes much as he was broken on the only rack in England, which was in the [[Tower of London]].

The [[privy council]] attempted to have [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]] who stabbed [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] to death in 1628 questioned under torture on the rack, but the judges resisted, unanimously declaring its use to be contrary to the [[English law|laws of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jardine|first=David|authorlink=David Jardine (barrister)|title=A Reading on the Use of Torture in the Criminal Law of England|publisher=Baldwin and Cradock|location=London|year=1837|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torture was abolished in England around 1640 (except ''[[peine forte et dure]]'', which was abolished in 1772).

In [[Colonial America]], women were sentenced to the [[stocks]] with wooden clips on their tongues or subjected to the "[[dunking stool]]" for the gender-specific crime of talking too much.&lt;ref&gt;Brizendine, Louann ''The Female Brain'' Broadway Books.

In the 17th century the number of incidents of judicial torture decreased in many European regions. [[Johann Graefe]] in 1624 published ''Tribunal Reformation'', a case against torture. [[Cesare Beccaria]], an Italian lawyer, published in 1764 "An Essay on Crimes and Punishments", in which he argued that torture unjustly punished the innocent and should be unnecessary in proving guilt. [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) also fiercely condemned torture in some of his essays.

While in Egypt in 1798, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] wrote to Major-General Berthier regarding the validity of torture as an interrogation tool:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The barbarous custom of whipping men suspected of having important secrets to reveal must be abolished. It has always been recognized that this method of interrogation, by putting men to the torture, is useless. The wretches say whatever comes into their heads and whatever they think one wants to believe. Consequently, the Commander-in-Chief forbids the use of a method which is contrary to reason and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon Bonaparte, ''Letters and Documents of Napoleon, Volume I: The Rise to Power'', selected and translated by John Eldred Howard (London: The Cresset Press, 1961), 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

European states abolished torture from their statutory law in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. England abolished torture in about 1640 (except [[peine forte et dure]], which England only abolished in 1772), Scotland in 1708, [[Prussia]] in 1740, Denmark around 1770, Russia in 1774, [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1776, Italy &lt;!--anachronism; Italy, as a unified state, didn't exist until 1861--&gt; in 1786, France in 1789, and [[Baden]] in 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/hcc4/htm/i.vi.viii.htm History of the Christian Church, Volume IV: Mediaeval Christianity.

===Methods of torture===
[[File:Modocs Scalping and Torturing Prisoners.jpg|thumb|[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] [[scalping]] and torturing prisoners, published in May 1873]]
Tortures included the chevalet, in which an accused witch sat on a pointed metal horse with weights strung from her feet.&lt;ref name="Naish p27"&gt;Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual humiliation torture included forced sitting on red-hot stools.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Charles Lea, ''Witchcraft'', pg 236 as quoted in Camille Naish, ''Death Comes To The Maiden: Sex and Execution 1431-1933'' (London: Routledge, 1991), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Gresillons, also called pennywinkis in Scotland, or pilliwinks, crushed the tips of fingers and toes in a vise-like device.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Boot, or "leg-screw", used mostly in Germany and Scotland, was a steel boot that was placed over the leg of the accused and was tightened. The pressure from the squeezing of the boot would break the shin bone in pieces. An anonymous Scotsman called it "The most severe and cruel pain in the world".&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"&gt;H.R. Trevor-Roper, ''The European Witch-Craze of The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries and Other Essays,'' (New York: Harper and Row, 1969), 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingenious variants of the Spanish boot were also designed to slowly crush feet between iron plates armed with terrifying spikes. The echelle more commonly known as the "ladder" or "rack" was a long table that the accused would lie upon and be stretched violently. The torture was used so intensely that on many occasions the victim's limbs would be pulled out of the socket and, at times, the limbs would even be torn from the body entirely. On some special occasions a tortillon was used in conjunction with the ladder which would severely squeeze and mutilate the genitals at the same time as the stretching was occurring.&lt;ref name="HRTR p120"/&gt; Similar to the ladder was the "lift". It too stretched the limbs of the accused; in this instance however the victim's feet were strapped to the ground and their arms were tied behind their back before a rope was tied to their hands and lifted upwards. This caused the arms to break before the portion of the stretching began.&lt;ref name="HRTR p121"/&gt; Finally, the judicial system of King James favored the use of the turkas, an ingenious and savage iron instrument for destroying the nails of the fingers and toes. The sharp point of the instrument was first pushed under the nail to the root, splitting the nail down the centerline. Pincers then grabbed either edge of the destroyed nail and slowly tore it away from the nail bed.  Other common tortures included the strappado, a system of weights and pulleys with which the prisoner was trussed up and jerked in order to dislocate his limbs; the water torture, by which he was maintained at the very edge of drowning; and the so-called torture by fire, in which the bare feet, immobilized in an iron stocks and smeared with lard, were slowly barbecued over red-hot coals.

===Since 1948===

{{Main article|Use of torture since 1948}}

Modern sensibilities have been shaped by a profound reaction to the [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by the [[Axis Powers]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] in the [[Second World War]], which have led to a sweeping international rejection of most if not all aspects of the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Elihu Lauterpacht, C. J. Greenwood ''International Law Reports'', Cambridge University Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-521-66122-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-66122-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mutsUVLw7gC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139 p. 139 section 189]&lt;/ref&gt; Even as many states engage in torture, few wish to be described as doing so, either to their own citizens or to the international community. A variety of devices bridge this gap, including state [[plausible deniability|denial]], "[[secret police]]", "[[need to know]]", a denial that given treatments are torturous in nature, appeal to various laws (national or international), the use of [[judicial jurisdiction|jurisdictional argument]] and the claim of "overriding need". Throughout history and today, many states have engaged in torture, albeit unofficially. Torture ranges from physical, psychological, political, interrogations techniques, and also includes rape of anyone outside of law enforcement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Broken Spirits: The Treatment of Traumatized Asylum Seekers, Refugees, War ...

According to scholar [[Ervand Abrahamian]], although there were several decades of prohibition of torture that spread from Europe to most parts of the world, by the 1980s, the taboo against torture was broken and torture "returned with a vengeance," propelled in part by television and an opportunity to break political prisoners and broadcast the resulting public recantations of their political beliefs for "ideological warfare, political mobilization, and the need to win 'hearts and minds.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;safe=active#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Tortured+confessions+abrahamian+%22hearts+and+minds%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=e169c8353451e3d9 Tortured confessions: prisons and public recantations in modern Iran] - Page 3
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the years 2004 and 2005, over 16 countries were documented using torture.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/|title=Human Rights Watch - Defending Human Rights Worldwide|website=hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to bring global awareness, Human Rights Watch, has created an internet site to alert people to news and multimedia publications about torture occurring worldwide.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"/&gt; The International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims [IRCT] made a global analysis of torture based on [Amnesty International, 2001], [Human Rights Watch, 2003], [United Nations, 2002], [U.S. Department of State, 2002] yearly human rights reports. These reports showed that torture and ill treatment are consistently report based on all four sources in 32 countries. At least two reports the use of torture and ill treatment in at least 80 countries. These reports confirm the assumption that torture occurs in a quarter of the world's countries on a regular basis. This global prevalence of torture is estimated on the magnitude of particular high-risk groups and the amount of torture used by these groups. "Such groups comprise refugees and persons who are or have been under torture." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
According to professor Darius Rejali, although dictatorships may have used tortured "more, and more indiscriminately", it was modern democracies, "the United States, Britain, and France" who "pioneered and exported techniques that have become the lingua franca of modern torture: methods that leave no marks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2007/12/16/torture_american_style/?page=1|title=Torture, American style|website=Boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of torture used as the oppression against political opponents or could be a part of criminal investigation or interrogation techniques in order to obtain the desired information and keep law enforcement empowered over everyday citizens.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The modern concept of torture methods that leave no physical evidence is noted in 1995 by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [[DSM-IV]] within the changing definition of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder [[PTSD]]. This revised definition included psychological torture stating: "Expresses concern that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders definition of posttraumatic stress disorder does not include those forms of psychological torture in which the physical integrity of a person is not threatened. It is suggested that any diagnostic criterion that characterizes the traumatic stressors leading to PTSD should be expressed in such a way that psychological forms of torture are included."&lt;ref&gt;[Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV-TR.. 4th ed. Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt;
After 1995, the sweeping definition of changes from 'any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether ''mental'' or ''physical'', is intentionally inflicted on a person' to including the terms ''psychological torture'' and including examples such as, interrogation techniques range from sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, fear and humiliation to severe sexual and cultural humiliation and use of threats and phobias to induce fear of death or injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyes|first=Hernan|title=The Worst Scars are in the Mind: Psychological Torture|journal=The International Review of the Red Cross|year=2007|volume=89|issue=867|pages=591–617|doi=10.1017/s1816383107001300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AbuGhraibAbuse-standing-on-box.jpg|thumb|[[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]].]]
Torture still occurs in a small number{{cn|date=November 2018}} of liberal democracies despite several international treaties such as the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] and the [[UN Convention Against Torture]] making torture illegal. Despite such international conventions, torture cases continue to arise such as the 2004 [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal committed by personnel of the [[United States Army]]. The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of torture, yet such human rights violations occurred during the [[War on Terror]] under the euphemism [[Enhanced interrogation techniques|Enhanced interrogation]]. The United States revised the previous torture policy in 2009 under the Obama Administration. This revision revokes the Executive Order 13440 of 20 July 2007, under which the incident at Abu Ghraib and prisoner abuse occurred. Executive Order 13491 of 22 January 2009 further defines United States policy on torture and interrogation techniques in an attempt to further prevent another torture incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|title=Executive Order 13491 -- Ensuring Lawful Interrogations|website=The White House|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218212240/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/EnsuringLawfulInterrogations|archivedate=18 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet apparently the practice continues, albeit outsourced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://apnews.com/4925f7f0fa654853bd6f2f57174179fe In Yemen's secret prisons, UAE tortures and US interrogates] Associated Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of Dr. Christian Davenport of the [[University of Notre Dame]], Professor William Moore of [[Florida State University]], and David Armstrong of [[Oxford University]] during their torture research, evidence suggests that non-governmental organizations have played the most determinant factor for stopping torture once it gets started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davenport|first=Christian|title=Helsinki Commission Hearing|url=http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|website=Hearing: "Is It Torture Yet?"|publisher=US Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|accessdate=21 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118231903/http://www.csce.gov/index.cfm?Fuseaction=ContentRecords.ViewWitness&amp;ContentRecord_id=907&amp;ContentType=D&amp;ContentRecordType=D&amp;ParentType=H&amp;CFID=5892559&amp;CFTOKEN=28254175|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary research suggests that it is civil society, not government institutions, that can stop torture once it has begun. This inability to control abuse and torture in society creates an imperfect Democracy non-compliant with internationally agreed upon standards for civil and political rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many organizations serve to expose widespread human rights violations and hold individuals accountable to the [[international community]].

===Historical methods of execution and capital punishment===
{{Main article|List of methods of capital punishment}}
{{See also|Execution}}

For most of recorded history, capital punishments were often cruel and inhumane. Severe historical penalties include [[breaking wheel]], [[boiling to death]], [[flaying]], [[slow slicing]], [[disembowelment]], [[crucifixion]], [[impalement]], [[Crushing (execution)|crushing]], [[stoning]], [[execution by burning]], [[dismemberment]], [[sawing (torture)|sawing]], [[decapitation]], [[scaphism]], or [[necklacing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950826,00.html|title=The Death Penalty :Revenge Is the Mother of Invention|date=24 January 1983|website=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Slow slicing'', or ''death by/of a thousand cuts'', was a form of [[execution]] used in China from roughly 900 AD to its abolition in 1905. According to apocryphal lore, ''líng che'' began when the torturer, wielding an extremely sharp knife, began by putting out the eyes, rendering the condemned incapable of seeing the remainder of the torture and, presumably, adding considerably to the psychological terror of the procedure. Successive rather minor cuts chopped off ears, nose, tongue, fingers, toes, and such before proceeding to grosser cuts that removed large collops of flesh from more sizable parts, e.g., thighs and shoulders. The entire process was said to last three days, and to total 3,600 cuts. The heavily carved bodies of the deceased were then put on a parade for a show in the public. More typical was to bribe the executioner to administer hasty death to the victim after a small number of dramatic slices inflicted for showmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|title=Death by a Thousand Cuts at Chinese Arts Centre until 23rd March|website=manchestereventsguide.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418031632/http://www.manchestereventsguide.co.uk/feature/Death_by_a_Thousand_Cuts_at_Chinese_Arts_Centre_18th_January_to_23rd_March/114.html|archivedate=18 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, H. (1927). ''Genghis Khan: Emperor of all men''. (New York: American Reprint Co.)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Impalement'' was a method of torture and [[execution (legal)|execution]] whereby a person is pierced with a long stake. The penetration can be through the sides, from the [[rectum]], or through the [[Human mouth|mouth]] or [[vagina]]. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to slide down the pole. Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Vlad III Dracula]] and [[Ivan the Terrible]] have passed into legend as major users of the method.&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9382120/Dracula Dracula - Britannica Concise] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''breaking wheel'' was a torturous [[capital punishment]] device used in the [[Middle Ages]] and early modern times for public execution by [[Club (weapon)|cudgeling]] to death, especially in France and Germany. In France the condemned were placed on a cart-wheel with their limbs stretched out along the spokes over two sturdy wooden beams. The wheel was made to slowly revolve. Through the openings between the spokes, the executioner hit the victim with an iron hammer that could easily break the victim's bones. This process was repeated several times per limb. Once his bones were broken, he was left on the wheel to die. It could take hours, even days, before shock and dehydration caused death. The punishment was abolished in Germany as late as 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Wheel, Breaking on the |volume=28 |page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The word 'torture' comes from the French ''torture'', originating in the [[Late Latin]] ''tortura'' and ultimately deriving the [[past participle]] of ''torquere'' meaning 'to twist'.&lt;ref name="isbn0877797137 "&gt;{{Cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 10th Edition |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |page= 1246|isbn=978-0-87779-713-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The word is also used loosely to describe more ordinary discomforts that would be accurately described as tedious rather than painful; for example, "making this spreadsheet was torture!"

According to Diderot's ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', torture was also referred to as "the question" in seventeenth century France. This term is derived from torture's use in criminal cases: as the accused is tortured, the torturers would typically ask questions to the accused in an effort to learn more about the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.891 | title = Question or Torture | accessdate = 1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholic Church===
{{main article|Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition|Medieval Inquisition}}
{{see also|Christian views on Hell#Roman Catholicism}}

Throughout the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] generally opposed the use of torture during criminal proceedings. This is evident from a letter sent by Pope [[Pope Nicholas I|Saint Nicholas]] the Great to [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Khan Boris]] of the Bulgars in AD 866, delivered in response to a series of questions from the former and concerned with the ongoing [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianisation of Bulgaria]]. ''Ad Consulta Vestra'' (as entitled in Latin) declared judicial torture to be a practice that was fundamentally contrary to [[divine law]].&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Responses of Pope Nicholas I to the Questions of the Bulgars, 866|url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/866nicholas-bulgar.asp=27}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pontiff made it a point of incontrovertible truth that, in his own words: "confession [to a crime] should be spontaneous, not compelled, and should not be elicited with violence but rather proferred voluntarily". He argued for an alternative and more humane procedure, in which the accused person would be required to swear an oath of innocence upon the "holy Gospel that he did not commit [the crime] which is laid against him and from that moment on the matter is [to be put] at an end".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt; Nicholas likewise stressed in the same letter that "those who refuse to receive the good of Christianity and sacrifice and bend their knees to idols" were to be moved towards accepting the true faith "by warnings, exhortations, and reason rather than by force," emphasising to this end that "violence should by no means be inflicted upon them to make them believe. For everything which is not voluntary, cannot be good".&lt;ref name="legacy.fordham.edu"/&gt;

In the High Middle Ages the Church became increasingly concerned with the perceived threat posed to its existence by resurgent heresy, in particular that attributed to a purported sect known as the [[Cathars]]. Catharism had its roots in the Paulician movement in Armenia and eastern Byzantine Anatolia and the [[Bogomils]] of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. Consequently, the Church began to enjoin secular rulers to extirpate heresy (lest the ruler’s Catholic subjects be absolved from their allegiance), and in order to coerce heretics or witnesses "into confessing their errors and accusing others," decided to sanction the use of methods of torture, already utilized by secular governments in other criminal procedures due to the [[Medieval Roman law|recovery of Roman Law]], in the medieval inquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canons of the Fourth Lateran Council, 1215|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran4.asp|website=canon 3|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SS Innocentius IV – Bulla 'Ad_Extirpanda'|url=http://www.documentacatholicaomnia.eu/01p/1252-05-15,_SS_Innocentius_IV,_Bulla_%27Ad_Extirpanda%27,_EN.pdf|website=1252|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pope Innocent IV, in the Bull [[Ad extirpanda]] (15 May 1252), stipulated that the inquisitors were to "stop short of danger to life or limb".&lt;ref&gt;''Ad extirpanda'', quoted at [http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt119.html ''The Roman Theological Forum'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern Church's views regarding torture have changed drastically, largely reverting to the earlier stance. In 1953, in an address to the 6th International Congress of Penal Law, Pope Pius XII approvingly reiterated the position of Pope Nicholas the Great over a thousand years before him, when his predecessor had unilaterally opposed the use of judicial torture, stating: {{quotation|
Preliminary juridical proceedings must exclude physical and psychological torture and the use of drugs: first of all because they violate a natural right, even if the accused is indeed guilty, and secondly because all too often they give rise to erroneous results...About eleven hundred years ago, in 866, the great Pope Nicholas I replied in the following way to a question posed by a people which had just come into contact with Christianity...Who would not wish that, during the long period of time elapsed since then, justice had never laid this rule aside! The need to recall the warning given eleven hundred years ago is a sad sign of the miscarriages of juridical practice in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pope Pius XII: 6th International Congress of Penal Law |url=https://books.google.com/?id=gyIgwz_lDGkC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=torture+pius+xii+nicholas#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|website=1252|isbn=9789287145147|last1=Carpentier|first1=Jean|last2=Council For Cultural Co-Operation|first2=Council of Europe|date=2001-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Thus, the ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (published in 1994) condemns the use of torture as a grave violation of [[Human Rights]]. In No. 2297-2298 it states:

{{quotation|
Torture, which uses physical or moral violence to extract confessions, punish the guilty, frighten opponents, or satisfy hatred is contrary to respect for the person and for human dignity... In times past, cruel practices were commonly used by legitimate governments to maintain law and order, often without protest from the Pastors of the Church, who themselves adopted in their own tribunals the prescriptions of Roman law concerning torture. Regrettable as these facts are, the Church always taught the duty of clemency and mercy. She forbade clerics to shed blood. In recent times it has become evident that these cruel practices were neither necessary for public order, nor in conformity with the legitimate rights of the human person. On the contrary, these practices led to ones even more degrading. It is necessary to work for their abolition. We must pray for the victims and their tormentors. }}

===Sharia law===
The prevalent view among jurists of [[sharia law]] is that torture is permissible only for the maintenance of law and order.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Violations in some stricter jurisdictions include acts of public indecency or immorality, which can result in floggings. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Other sharia-derived punishments that might overlap with widely held notions of torture include the various forms of [[hudud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=Democracy and the New Religious Pluralism|date=2007|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Judaism===
Torture has no presence within [[halakha]]. There did once exist a system of [[capital and corporal punishment in Judaism]], as well as a [[Flagellation#Judaism|flagellation]] statute for non-capital offences, but it was all abolished by the [[Sanhedrin]] during the [[Second Temple period]].

[[Maimonides]] issued a ruling in the case of a man who was ordered by a [[Beth Din]] to divorce his wife and refuses, that "we coerce him until he states 'I want to.'"&lt;ref&gt;Maimoides; ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' Hilkhot Gerushin 2:20&lt;/ref&gt; This is only true in cases where specific grounds for the verdict exist.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim;[http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"]; ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, some activist rabbis had interpreted this statement to mean that torture could be applied against husbands in troubled marriages in order to force them into granting religious divorces to their wives.&lt;ref&gt;Samaha, Albert (4 December 2013) [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/bad-rabbi-tales-of-extortion-and-torture-depict-a-divorce-brokers-brutal-grip-on-the-orthodox-community-6440276 "Bad Rabbi: Tales of Extortion and Torture Depict a Divorce Broker's Brutal Grip on the Orthodox Community"], ''Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; These rabbis were later implicated in the [[2013 New York divorce torture plot]].&lt;ref&gt;Blau, Reuven (22 April 2015) [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/orthodox-rabbi-guilty-kidnapping-beating-jewish-husbands-article-1.2193597/ "N.J.

==Laws against torture==
On 10 December 1948, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR). Article 5 states, "No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html Universal Declaration of Human Rights], United Nations, 10 December 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, a number of other international treaties have been adopted to prevent the use of torture. The most notable treaties relating to torture are the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] and the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Conventions of 1949]] and their [[Protocol I|Additional Protocols I]] and [[Protocol II|II]] of 8 June 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/faq/torture-law-2011-06-24.htm |title=What does the law say about torture? |publisher=[[International Committee of the Red Cross]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Nations Convention Against Torture===
The [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] came into force in June 1987. The most relevant articles are Articles 1, 2, 3, and 16.

{{quotation|Article 1&lt;br /&gt;
1. For the purposes of this Convention, the word "torture" means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.&lt;br /&gt;
2. This article is without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which does or may contain provisions of wider application.}}

{{quotation|Article 2&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.&lt;br /&gt;
2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of [[war]] or a threat of war, internal [[Failed state|political instability]] or any other [[State of emergency|public emergency]], may be invoked as a justification of torture.&lt;br /&gt;
3. An [[Superior Orders|order from a superior officer or a public authority]] may not be invoked as a justification of torture.}}

{{quotation|Article 3&lt;br /&gt;
1. No State Party shall expel, return ("refouler") or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.&lt;br /&gt;
2. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.}}

{{quotation|Article 16&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each State Party shall undertake to prevent in any territory under its jurisdiction other acts of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment which do not amount to torture as defined in article I, when such acts are committed by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. In particular, the obligations contained in articles 10, 11, 12 and 13 shall apply with the substitution for references to torture of references to other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.&lt;br /&gt;
2. The provisions of this Convention are without prejudice to the provisions of any other international instrument or national law which prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or which relates to extradition or expulsion.}}

{{Main article|International Criminal Court}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], which established the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), provides for criminal prosecution of individuals responsible for [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. The statute defines torture as "intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, upon a person in the custody or under the control of the accused; except that torture shall not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to, lawful sanctions". Under Article 7 of the statute, torture may be considered a crime against humanity "when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack".&lt;ref&gt;Article 7 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute].

===Geneva Conventions===
The four [[Geneva Conventions]] provide protection for people who fall into enemy hands.
The conventions do not clearly divide people into [[combatant]] and [[non-combatant]] roles. The conventions refer to:
* "wounded and sick combatants or non-combatants"
* "civilian persons who take no part in hostilities, and who, while they reside in the zones, perform no work of a military character"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], Article 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces"
* "Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]] belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]]"
* "Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power"
* "Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces"
* "Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the [[merchant marine]] and the crews of [[civil aircraft]] of the Parties to the conflict"
* "Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], Article 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[first Geneva Convention|first]] (GCI), [[second Geneva Convention|second]] (GCII), [[third Geneva Convention|third]] (GCIII), and [[fourth Geneva Convention|fourth]] (GCIV) Geneva Conventions are the four most relevant for the treatment of the victims of conflicts. All treaties states in Article 3, in similar wording, that in a non-international armed conflict, "Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms... shall in all circumstances be treated humanely." The treaty also states that there must not be any "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, [[mutilation]], cruel treatment and torture" or "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment".&lt;ref&gt;[[s:First Geneva Convention|First Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Second Geneva Convention|Second Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Third Geneva Convention|Third Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Fourth Geneva Convention|Fourth Geneva Convention]], 12 August 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

GCI covers wounded combatants in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, members of the armed forces who are sick or wounded "shall be respected and protected in all circumstances. They shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Party to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCII covers shipwreck survivors at sea in an international armed conflict. Under Article 12, persons "who are at sea and who are wounded, sick or shipwrecked, shall be respected and protected in all circumstances, it being understood that the term "shipwreck" means shipwreck from any cause and includes forced landings at sea by or from aircraft. Such persons shall be treated humanely and cared for by the Parties to the conflict in whose power they may be, without any adverse distinction founded on sex, race, nationality, religion, political opinions, or any other similar criteria. Any attempts upon their lives, or violence to their persons, shall be strictly prohibited; in particular, they shall not be murdered or exterminated, subjected to torture or to biological experiments".

GCIII covers the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] (POWs) in an international armed conflict. In particular, Article 17 says that "No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted or exposed to unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind." POW status under GCIII has far fewer exemptions than "Protected Person" status under GCIV. Captured combatants in an international armed conflict automatically have the protection of GCIII and are POWs under GCIII unless they are determined by a competent tribunal to not be a POW (GCIII Article 5).

GCIV covers most [[civilian]]s in an international armed conflict, and says they are usually "Protected Persons" (see exemptions section immediately after this for those who are not). Under Article 32, civilians have the right to protection from "murder, torture, corporal punishments, mutilation and medical or scientific experiments...but also to any other measures of brutality whether applied by civilian or military agents."

====Geneva Convention IV exemptions====
GCIV provides an important exemption:
{{quotation|Where in the territory of a Party to the conflict, the latter is satisfied that an individual protected person is definitely suspected of or engaged in activities hostile to the security of the State, such individual person shall not be entitled to claim such rights and privileges under the present Convention [ie GCIV] as would ... be prejudicial to the security of such State ... In each case, such persons shall nevertheless be treated with humanity (GCIV Article 5)}}

Also, nationals of a State not bound by the Convention are not protected by it, and nationals of a neutral State in the territory of a combatant State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, cannot claim the protection of GCIV if their home state has normal diplomatic representation in the State that holds them (Article 4), as their diplomatic representatives can take steps to protect them. The requirement to treat persons with "humanity" implies that it is still prohibited to torture individuals not protected by the Convention.

The [[George W. Bush administration]] afforded fewer protections, under GCIII, to detainees in the "[[War on Terror]]" by codifying the legal status of an "[[unlawful combatant]]". If there is a question of whether a person is a lawful combatant, he (or she) must be treated as a POW "until their status has been determined by a competent tribunal" (GCIII Article 5). If the tribunal decides that he is an unlawful combatant, he is not considered a protected person under GCIII. However, if he is a protected person under GCIV he still has some protection under GCIV, and must be "treated with humanity and, in case of trial, shall not be deprived of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed by the present Convention" (GCIV Article 5).&lt;ref group=nb&gt;
"Every person in enemy hands must have some status under international law: he is either a prisoner of war and, as such, covered by the Third Convention, a civilian covered by the Fourth Convention, or again, a member of the medical personnel of the armed forces who is covered by the First Convention. ''There is no'' intermediate status; nobody in enemy hands can be outside the law. We feel that this is a satisfactory solution – not only satisfying to the mind, but also, and above all, satisfactory from the humanitarian point of view.", because in the opinion of the ICRC "If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents (the treaties of humanitarian law do not expressly contain these terms). They may be prosecuted under the domestic law of the detaining state for such action" ([[Jean Pictet]] (ed.) – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/380-600007?OpenDocument Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1958)] – 1994 reprint edition). [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/f6c8b9fee14a77fdc125641e0052b079 Geneva Conventions Protocol I] Article 51.3 also covers this interpretation "Civilians shall enjoy the protection afforded by this section, unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions====
There are two additional protocols to the Geneva Convention: [[Protocol I]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts and [[Protocol II]] (1977), relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts. These clarify and extend the definitions in some areas, but to date many countries, including the United States, have either not signed them or have not ratified them.

[[Protocol I]] does not mention torture but it does affect the treatment of POWs and Protected Persons. In Article 5, the protocol explicitly involves "the appointment of Protecting Powers and of their substitute" to monitor that the Parties to the conflict are enforcing the Conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080410223403/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol 1)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol also broadens the definition of a lawful combatant in wars against "alien occupation, colonial domination and racist regimes" to include those who carry arms openly but are not wearing uniforms, so that they are now [[lawful combatant]]s and protected by the Geneva Conventions—although only if the Occupying Power has ratified Protocol I. Under the original conventions, combatants without a recognizable insignia could be treated as war criminals, and potentially be executed. It also mentions spies, and defines who is a mercenary. Mercenaries and spies are considered an unlawful combatant, and not protected by the same conventions.

[[Protocol II]] "develops and supplements Article 3 [relating to the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts] common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 without modifying its existing conditions of application" (Article 1). Any person who does not take part in or ceased to take part in hostilities is entitled to humane treatment. Among the acts prohibited against these persons are, "Violence to the life, health and physical or mental well-being of persons, in particular murder as well as cruel treatment such as torture, mutilation or any form of corporal punishment" (Article 4.a), "Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, rape, enforced prostitution and any form of indecent assault" (Article 4.e), and "Threats to commit any of the foregoing acts" (Article 4.h).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612085204/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol2.htm Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and Relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II)], Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts, 8 June 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Clauses in other articles implore humane treatment of enemy personnel in an internal conflict. These have a bearing on torture, but no other clauses explicitly mention torture.

===Other conventions===
In accordance with the optional [[UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]] (1955), ''"[[corporal punishment]], punishment by placing in a dark cell, and all cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments shall be completely prohibited as punishments for disciplinary offences."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080718003225/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp34.htm Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners], United Nations, Geneva, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], (16 December 1966), explicitly prohibits torture and ''"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment"'' by signatories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] United Nations, 16 December 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

;European agreements
[[File:10CFREU-Article4.jpg|right|thumb|Article 4 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] prohibits torture.]]

In 1950 during the [[Cold War]], the participating member states of the [[Council of Europe]] signed the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. The treaty was based on the [[UDHR]]. It included the provision for a court to interpret the treaty, and Article 3 '''"Prohibition of torture"''' stated; ''"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm European Convention on Human Rights], 4 November 1950(with later protocols).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that the [[five techniques]] of "[[sensory deprivation]]" were not torture as laid out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, but were "''inhuman or degrading treatment''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/eu/cases/ECHR/1978/1.html Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1977]. (Case No. 5310/71)&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Uses of torture in recent times#United Kingdom|Accusations of use of torture by United Kingdom]] for details). This case occurred nine years before the United Nations Convention Against Torture came into force and had an influence on thinking about what constitutes torture ever since.&lt;ref&gt;Michael John Garcia (Legislative Attorney American Law Division) [http://www.ilw.com/immigdaily/news/2005,1223-crs.pdf U.N. Convention Against Torture (CAT):Overview and Application to Interrogation Techniques] [http://www.ilw.com/ CRS Report for Congress] 7 November 2005. pp. 13-15&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 November 1987, the member states of the [[Council of Europe]], meeting at [[Strasbourg]], adopted the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (ECPT). Two additional Protocols amended the Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2002. The Convention set up the [[Committee for the Prevention of Torture]] to oversee compliance with its provisions.

;Inter-American Convention
The [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]], currently ratified by 18 nations of the [[Americas]] and in force since 28 February 1987, defines torture more expansively than the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

{{quotation|For the purposes of this Convention, torture shall be understood to be any act intentionally performed whereby physical or mental pain or suffering is inflicted on a person for purposes of criminal investigation, as a means of intimidation, as personal punishment, as a preventive measure, as a penalty, or for any other purpose. Torture shall also be understood to be the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish.

The concept of torture shall not include physical or mental pain or suffering that is inherent in or solely the consequence of lawful measures, provided that they do not include the performance of the acts or use of the methods referred to in this article.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt;}}

===Supervision of anti-torture treaties===
The [[Istanbul Protocol]], an official UN document, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became a United Nations official document in 1999.

Under the provisions of [[OPCAT]] that entered into force on 22 June 2006 independent international and national bodies regularly visit places where people are deprived of their liberty, to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Each state that ratified the OPCAT, according to Article 17, is responsible for creating or maintaining at least one independent national preventative mechanism for torture prevention at the domestic level.

The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, citing Article 1 of the [[European Convention for the Prevention of Torture]], states that it will, "by means of visits, examine the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty with a view to strengthening, if necessary, the protection of such persons from torture and from inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpt.coe.int/en/about.htm|title=About the CPT|website=coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In times of armed conflict between a signatory of the Geneva Conventions and another party, delegates of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) monitor the compliance of signatories to the Geneva Conventions, which includes monitoring the use of torture. Human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], the [[World Organization Against Torture]], and [[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] work actively to stop the use of torture throughout the world and publish reports on any activities they consider to be torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apt.ch/|title=Association for the Prevention of Torture|website=apt.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal law===
[[Sovereign state|States]] that ratified the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] have a treaty obligation to include the provisions into [[municipal law]]. The laws of many states therefore formally prohibit torture. However, such ''[[de jure]]'' legal provisions are by no means a proof that, ''[[de facto]]'', the signatory country does not use torture. To prevent torture, many legal systems have a [[right against self-incrimination]] or explicitly prohibit undue force when dealing with suspects.

The French 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], of constitutional value, prohibits submitting suspects to any hardship not necessary to secure his or her person.

The [[U.S. Constitution]] and [[U.S. law]] prohibits the use of unwarranted force or coercion against any person who is subject to interrogation, detention, or arrest. The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] includes protection against [[self-incrimination]], which states that "[n]o person...shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself". This serves as the basis of the [[Miranda warning]], which [[Law enforcement in the United States|U.S. law enforcement personnel]] issue to individuals upon their arrest. Additionally, the U.S. Constitution's [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]] forbids the use of "[[cruel and unusual punishments]]," which is widely interpreted as prohibiting torture. Finally, 18 U.S.C. § 2340&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2340}} ''et seq.''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''et seq.'' define and forbid torture committed by U.S. nationals outside the United States or non-U.S. nationals who are present in the United States. As the United States recognizes [[customary international law]], or the [[law of nations]], the U.S. [[Alien Tort Claims Act]] and the [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] also provides legal remedies for victims of torture outside of the United States. Specifically, the status of torturers under the law of the United States, as determined by a famous legal decision in 1980, ''[[Filártiga v. Peña-Irala]]'', 630 [[Federal Reporter|F.2d]] 876 ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2d Cir.]] 1980), is that, "the torturer has become, like the [[maritime piracy|pirate]] and the [[slave trade]]r before him, [[hostis humani generis]], an enemy of all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Filártiga v. Peña-Irala |vol=630 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=876 |pinpoint= |court=2d Cir. |date=1980 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/630/876/238132/ |accessdate=2017-01-06 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of evidence obtained under torture===

====International law====
Article 15 of the 1984 [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] specify that:

{{quotation|Each State Party shall ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.}}

A similar provision is also found in Article 10 of the 1985 [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture]]:

{{quotation|No statement that is verified as having been obtained through torture shall be admissible as evidence in a legal proceeding, except in a legal action taken against a person or persons accused of having elicited it through acts of torture, and only as evidence that the accused obtained such statement by such means.}}

These provisions have the double dissuasive effect of nullifying any utility in using torture with the purpose of eliciting confession, as well as confirming that should a person extract statements by torture, this can be used against him or her in criminal proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Human Rights in Times of Conflict and Terrorism |author=Louise Doswald-Beck |page=220 |date=21 March 2011 |publisher=Praeger; 1 edition |isbn=978-0-1995-7894-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this is because experience has shown that under torture, or even under a threat of torture, a person will say or do anything solely to avoid the pain. As a result, there is no way to know whether or not the resulting statement is actually correct. If any court relies on any evidence obtained from torture regardless of validity, it provides an incentive for state officials to force a confession, creating a marketplace for torture, both domestically and overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apt.ch/en/evidence-obtained-through-torture/ |title=Exclusion of evidence obtained through torture |publisher=[[Association for the Prevention of Torture]] |accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Within national borders====
Most states have prohibit their legal systems from accepting evidence that is extracted by torture. The question of the use of evidence obtained under torture has arisen in connection with prosecutions during the [[War on Terror]] in the United Kingdom and the United States.

=====United Kingdom=====
In 2003, the United Kingdom's Ambassador to [[Uzbekistan]], [[Craig Murray]], suggested that it was "wrong to use information gleaned from torture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1474852/The-envoy-silenced-after-telling-undiplomatic-truths.html|title=The envoy silenced after telling undiplomatic truths|last=Gedye|first=Robin|date=23 October 2004|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|quote=Murray fired off a memorandum to the Foreign Office last July suggesting that Britain's intelligence services were wrong to use information gleaned from torture victims|accessdate=26 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The unanimous [[House of Lords Judicial Committee|Law Lords]] judgment on 8 December 2005 confirmed this position. They ruled that, under English law tradition, "torture and its fruits" could not be used in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0,15935,1662107,00.html Torture evidence inadmissible in UK courts, Lords rules],''[[The Guardian]]'', 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; But the information thus obtained could be used by the British police and security services as "it would be ludicrous for them to disregard information about a ticking bomb if it had been procured by torture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4510866.stm Torture ruling's international impact] by Jon Silverman [[BBC]] 8 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray's accusations did not lead to any investigation by his employer, the FCO, and he resigned after disciplinary action was taken against him in 2004. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office itself is being investigated by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] because of accusations that it has victimized, bullied and intimidated its own staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1533100,00.html Foreign Office faces probe into 'manipulation'], Robert Winnett,''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 20 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray later stated that he felt that he had unwittingly stumbled upon what has been called "torture by proxy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 Q &amp; A: Torture by Proxy] Jane Mayer answers question asked by Amy Davidson [[The New Yorker]] on 14 February 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709140152/http://www.newyorker.com/online/content/?050214on_onlineonly01 |date=9 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that Western countries moved people to regimes and nations where it was known that information would be extracted by torture, and made available to them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Murray states that he was aware from August 2002 "that the CIA were bringing in detainees to [[Tashkent]] from [[Bagram Air Base|Bagram airport Afghanistan]], who were handed over to the [[Uzbek security services]] (SNB). I presumed at the time that these were all Uzbek nationals—that may have been a false presumption. I knew that the CIA were obtaining intelligence from their subsequent interrogation by the SNB." He goes on to say that he did not know at the time that any non-Uzbek nationals were flown to Uzbekistan and although he has studied the reports by several journalists and finds their reports credible he is not a firsthand authority on this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html Extraordinary Rendition] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728095612/http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/archives/2005/07/extraordinary_r_1.html |date=28 July 2012 }} on [http://www.craigmurray.co.uk/ Craig Murray's website], 11 July 2005 {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on 7 July 2009, MP [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] accused the UK government of outsourcing torture, by allowing [[Rangzieb Ahmed]] to leave the country (even though they had evidence against him upon which he was later convicted for terrorism) to Pakistan, where it is said the [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] was given the go ahead by the British intelligence agencies to torture Ahmed. Davis further accused the government of trying to gag Ahmed, stopping him coming forward with his accusations, after he had been imprisoned back in the UK. He said, there was "an alleged request to drop his allegations of torture: if he did that, they could get his sentence cut and possibly give him some money. If this request to drop the torture case is true, it is frankly monstrous. It would at the very least be a criminal misuse of the powers and funds under the Government's Contest strategy, and at worst a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Business&gt;Publications and Records &gt; Commons Publications &gt; Commons Hansard &gt; Daily Hansard -Debate|publisher=Parliament.uk|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090707/debtext/90707-0020.htm|accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====United States=====
In May 2008, [[Susan J. Crawford]], the [[Convening authority (court-martial)|official overseeing prosecutions]] before the [[Guantanamo military commissions]], declined to refer for trial the case of [[Mohammed al-Qahtani]] because she said, "we tortured [him]."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5134328.stm Q&amp;A: Guantanamo detentions] BBC News, 22 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qhatani remains imprisoned at Guantanamo. Woodward, Bob [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/13/AR2009011303372.html Detainee Tortured, Says U.S. Official] Washington Post, 14 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Crawford said that a combination of techniques with clear medical consequences amounted to the legal definition of torture, and that torture "tainted everything going forward."&lt;ref name = "Qahtani Tortured"/&gt;

On 28 October 2008, Guantanamo military judge [[Stephen R. Henley]] ruled that the government cannot use statements made as a result of torture in the military commission case against Afghan national [[Mohammed Jawad]]. The judge held that Jawad's alleged confession to throwing a grenade at two U.S. service members and an Afghan interpreter was obtained after armed Afghan officials on 17 December 2002,&lt;ref name=usatoday13Jan2009&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-01-13-torture-hearings_N.htm| title=Court hears arguments over detainee's confession| newspaper=USA Today | agency=Associated Press| date=13 January 2009 | accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; threatened to kill Jawad and his family. The government had previously told the judge that Jawad's alleged confession while in Afghan custody was central to the case against him. Hina Shamsi, staff attorney with the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] National Security Project stated: "We welcome the judge's decision that death threats constitute torture and that evidence obtained as a result must be excluded from trial. Unfortunately, evidence obtained through torture and coercion is pervasive in military commission cases that, by design, disregard the most fundamental due process rights, and no single decision can cure that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|title=Guantanamo Judge Rejects Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=yubanet.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160011/http://yubanet.com/usa/Guantanamo-Judge-Rejects-Evidence-Obtained-Through-Torture-In-Jawad-Case.php#.VRJHGI56LLs|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, on 19 November, the judge again rejected evidence gathered through coercive interrogations in the military commission case against Afghan national Mohammed Jawad, holding that the evidence collected while Jawad was in U.S. custody on 17–18 December 2002, cannot be admitted in his trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/guantanamo-judge-throws-out-more-evidence-obtained-through-torture-jawad-case|title=Guantánamo Judge Throws Out More Evidence Obtained Through Torture In Jawad Case|website=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly because the U.S. interrogator had blindfolded and hooded Jawad in order to frighten him.&lt;ref&gt;usatoday13Jan2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010 New York trial of [[Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani]] who was accused of complicity in the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya]], Judge [[Lewis A.

Torture has been criticized on humanitarian and moral grounds, on the grounds that evidence extracted by torture is unreliable, and because torture corrupts institutions that tolerate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213004811/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/ethics/torture/ethics/wrong_2.shtml|archivedate=13 December 2007|title=Consequentialist reasons why torture is wrong|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides degrading the victim, torture debases the torturer: American advisors alarmed at torture by their South Vietnamese allies early in the [[Vietnam War]] concluded that "if a commander allowed his officers and men to fall in to these vices [they] would pursue them for their own sake, for the perverse pleasure they drew from them."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"&gt;{{cite book| last =Sheehan| first = Neil| title =A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam| publisher =Random House | edition =first| year =1988| pages= 104, 105| isbn =978-0-394-48447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequent degeneracy destroyed discipline and morale: "[a] soldier had to learn that he existed to uphold law and order, not to undermine it."&lt;ref name = "Bright Shining Lie"/&gt;

The [[ticking time bomb scenario]], a [[thought experiment]], asks what to do to a captured terrorist who has placed a [[nuclear bomb]] in a populated area. If the terrorist is tortured, he may explain how to defuse the bomb. The scenario asks if it is ethical to torture the terrorist. A 2006 [[BBC]] poll held in 25 nations gauged support for each of the following positions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm|title=One third support some torture|publisher=BBC News|date=19 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Terrorists pose such an extreme threat that governments should be allowed to use some degree of torture if it may gain information that saves innocent lives.
*Clear rules against torture should be maintained because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights.
An average of 59% of people worldwide rejected torture. However, there was a clear divide between those countries with strong rejection of torture (such as Italy, where only 14% supported torture) and nations where rejection was less strong. Often this lessened rejection is found in countries severely and frequently threatened by terrorist attacks. E.g., Israel, despite its Supreme Court outlawing torture in 1999, showed 43% supporting torture, but 48% opposing, India showed 37% supporting torture and only 23% opposing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm ''Ibid'']: "''Israel has the largest percentage of those polled endorsing the use of a degree of torture on prisoners, with 43% saying they agreed that some degree of torture should be allowed.''" On the Israeli Supreme Court decision outlawing torture, see Judgment Concerning the Legality of the General Security Service’s Interrogation Methods, Supreme Court of Israel, 38 I.L.M. 1471 (1999), and other references at [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/hrj/iss14/nagan.shtml#Heading300 law.harvard.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430213030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6063386.stm |date=30 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within nations there is a clear divide between the positions of members of different ethnic groups, religions, and political affiliations, sometimes reflecting distinctions between groups considering themselves threatened or victimized by terror acts and those from the alleged perpetrator groups. For example, the study found that among Jews in Israel 53% favored some degree of torture and only 39% wanted strong rules against torture while Muslims in Israel were overwhelmingly against any use of torture, unlike Muslims polled elsewhere. Differences in general political views also can matter. In one 2006 survey by the Scripps Center at Ohio University, 66% of Americans who identified themselves as strongly Republican supported torture, compared to 24% of those who identified themselves as strongly Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|title=New XHTML 1.0 Transitional Compliant Page|website=newspolls.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514083035/http://www.newspolls.org/articles/19606|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 U.S. survey 72% of American Catholics supported the use of torture in some circumstances compared to 51% of American secularists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612093225/http://ncronline.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/032406/032406h.htm|title=Nation: Americans, especially Catholics, approve of torture|archivedate=12 June 2008|website=ncronline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Pew survey in 2009 similarly found that the religiously unaffiliated are the least likely (40 percent) to support torture, and that the more a person claims to attend church, the more likely he or she is to condone torture; among racial/religious groups, white evangelical Protestants were far and away the most likely (62 percent) to support inflicting pain as a tool of interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Pitts, Leonard (7 May 2009).

There are also different attitudes as to what constitutes torture, as revealed in an ABC News/Washington Post poll, where more than half of the Americans polled thought that techniques such as [[sleep deprivation]] were not torture.&lt;ref&gt;David Morris and Gary Langer ''[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=90051 Poll: Torture Methods Opposed]'' ABCNEWS.com 27 May 2004 "Americans by nearly 2-to-1 oppose torturing terrorism suspects — but half believe the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is doing it anyway. And even more think the government is employing physical abuse that falls short of torture in some cases."&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, so-called "enhanced interrogation" techniques were employed by the CIA in situations that did not involve the "ticking time bomb" scenario that has been the subject of opinion polls and public debate. In April 2009 a former senior U.S. intelligence official and a former Army psychiatrist stated that the Bush administration applied pressure on interrogators to use the "enhanced interrogation" techniques on detainees to find evidence of cooperation between al Qaida and the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's regime.&lt;ref&gt;Landay, Jonathan (21 April 2009).

On 14 February 2010, in an appearance on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]], Vice-President [[Dick Cheney]] reiterated his support of [[waterboarding]] and "[[enhanced interrogation]]" techniques for captured terrorist suspects, saying, "I was and remain a strong proponent of our enhanced interrogation program."&lt;ref name=ABCTW20100214&gt;

Pressed by the BBC in 2010 on his personal view of waterboarding, Presidential Advisor [[Karl Rove]] said: "I'm proud that we kept the world safer than it was, by the use of these techniques. They’re appropriate, they're in conformity with our international requirements and with US law."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk, 13 March 2010, "Karl Rove says water torture is justified - and a source of pride" by Giles Whittell&lt;/ref&gt;

A 15-month investigation by the Guardian and BBC Arabic, published on March 2013, disclosed that "the US sent a veteran of the ''[[dirty war]]s'' in [[Central America]] to oversee Iraqi [[commando]] units involved in acts of torture during the [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|American-led occupation]]. These American citizens could theoretically be tried by the [[International Criminal Court]] even though the US is not a signatory. But it would have to be referred by the [[UN security council]] and, given that the US has a [[veto]] on the council, this hypothesis is very improbable." [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] Legal Director Kat Craig said: "This latest exposé of [[human rights abuses]] shows that torture is [[endemic]] to [[US foreign policy]]; these are considered and deliberate acts, not only sanctioned but developed by the highest echelons of [[United States Department of Defense|US security service]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/07/pentagon-investigating-link-military-torture Pentagon investigating link between US military and torture centres in Iraq.

===Effectiveness===
{{main|Effectiveness of torture for interrogation}}
There is a strong [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] argument against torture; namely, that it is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/|title=On Witches and Terrorists|first=Michael|last=Shermer|journal=Scientific American|volume=316|issue=5|pages=77|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0517-77|pmid=28437416|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information supporting the ineffectiveness of torture goes back centuries. For example, during [[witch trial]]s torture was routinely used to try to force subjects to admit their guilt and to identify other witches. It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

There is no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h4q565424126068h/|title=A utilitarian argument against torture interrogation of terrorists|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |year=2004 |volume=10 |number=3 |page=543 |author=Jean Maria Arrigo |doi=10.1007/s11948-004-0011-y|citeseerx=10.1.1.470.9264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of scientific basis for the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation techniques is summarized in a 2006 Intelligence Science Board report titled "EDUCING INFORMATION, Interrogation: Science and Art, Foundations for the Future".&lt;ref name="Educing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/dni/educing.pdf|title=Educing Information: Interrogation: Science and Art—Foundations for the Future|date=December 2006|publisher=National Defense Intelligence College|accessdate=15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some have pointed to some specific cases where torture has elicited true information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/torturecardozo.pdf|title=J. Franklin, Evidence gained from torture: wishful thinking, checkability and extreme circumstances|year=2009|journal=Cardozo Journal of International and Comparative Law |volume= 17 |issue=2|accessdate=28 December 2009 |pages= 281–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection===
A famous example of rejection of the use of torture was cited by the Argentine [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] in whose report, Italian general [[Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa]] was reputed to have said in connection with the investigation of the disappearance of prime minister [[Aldo Moro]], "Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071012004601/http://nuncamas.org/english/library/nevagain/nevagain_002.htm Report of Conadep (National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons): Prologue] - 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secrecy===
Before the emergence of modern policing, torture was an important aspect of policing and the use of it was openly sanctioned and acknowledged by the authority. The Economist magazine proposed that one of the reasons torture endures is that torture does indeed work in some instances to extract information/confession, if those who are being tortured are indeed guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9832909 | work=The Economist | title=Is torture ever justified? | date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Depending on the culture, torture has at times been carried on in silence (official silence &lt;ref&gt;Bakir, V. Torture, Intelligence and Sousveillance in the War on Terror: Agenda–Building Struggles. Farnham: Ashgate (2013). Available at: http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781472402554&lt;/ref&gt;), semi-silence (known but not spoken about), or openly acknowledged in public (to instill fear and obedience).

In the 21st century, even when states sanction their interrogation methods, torturers often work outside the law. For this reason, some prefer methods that, while unpleasant, leave victims alive and unmarked. A victim with no visible damage may lack credibility when telling tales of torture, whereas a person missing fingernails or eyes can easily prove claims of torture. Mental torture, however can leave scars just as deep and long-lasting as physical torture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html Abu Ghraib and the ISA: What's the difference?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520150425/http://aliran.com/oldsite/monthly/2004a/5e.html |date=20 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional torturers in some countries have used techniques such as electrical shock, asphyxiation, heat, cold, noise, and sleep deprivation, which leave little evidence, although in other contexts torture frequently results in horrific mutilation or death. However the most common and prevalent form of torture worldwide in both developed and under-developed countries is beating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act40/016/2000/en/ Amnesty.org] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|List of methods of torture}}

[[List of torture methods and devices#Psychological torture methods|Psychological torture]] uses non-physical methods that cause psychological [[suffering]]. Its effects are not immediately apparent unless they alter the [[behavior]] of the tortured person. Since there is no international political consensus on what constitutes psychological torture, it is often overlooked, denied, and referred to by different names.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Psychological torture is less well known than physical torture and tends to be subtle and much easier to conceal. In practice the distinctions between physical and psychological torture are often blurred.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Physical torture is the inflicting of severe pain or suffering on a person. In contrast, psychological torture is directed at the psyche with calculated violations of psychological needs, along with deep damage to psychological structures and the breakage of beliefs underpinning normal [[sanity]]. Torturers often inflict both types of torture in combination to compound the associated effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Psychological torture also includes deliberate use of extreme [[psychological stress|stressors]] and situations such as [[mock execution]], [[shunning]], violation of deep-seated social or [[sexual norm]]s and [[taboo]]s, or extended [[solitary confinement]]. Because psychological torture needs no physical violence to be effective, it is possible to induce severe psychological pain, suffering, and [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] with no externally visible effects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

[[Rape]] and other forms of [[sexual abuse]] are often used as methods of torture for interrogative or punitive purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Nooria | last=Mehraby | url=http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 | title=Refugee Women: The Authentic Heroines | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830113952/http://www.startts.org.au/default.aspx?id=201 |archivedate=30 August 2007 }} &lt;!-- Must be a more reliable source than this! --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medical torture]], medical practitioners use torture to judge what victims can endure, to apply treatments that enhance torture, or act as torturers in their own right. [[Josef Mengele]] and [[Shirō Ishii]] were infamous during and after [[World War II]] for their involvement in medical torture and murder. In recent years, however, there has been a push to end medical complicity in torture through both international and state-based legal strategies, as well as litigations against individual physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hoffman | first = S. J. | year = 2011 | title = Ending medical complicity in state-sponsored torture | url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/hoffman/files/25_-_lancet_-_ending_medical_complicity_in_state-sponsored_torture_2011_hoffman.pdf | journal = The Lancet | volume = 378 | issue = 9802 | pages = 1535–1537 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60816-7 | pmid=21944647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pharmacological torture]] is the use of drugs to produce psychological or physical pain or discomfort. [[Tickle torture]] is an unusual form of torture which nevertheless has been documented, and can be both physically and psychologically painful.&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz.

== Murder ==

{{original research|section|date=February 2017}}
{{Main|Torture murder}}

Torture murder involves torture to the point of murder. [[Murderer]]s might also torture their victims to death for sadistic reasons. [[Al-Qaida|Some terrorist groups]] torture—typically commencing with the forcible extraction of all ten fingernails, all ten toenails, and all thirty-two teeth—before executing the victim by such barbaric techniques as slow decapitation via butcher knife.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Ancient conceptual forerunners of torture murder include [[drawing and quartering]] and [[flaying]].

==Effects==
The consequences of torture reach far beyond immediate pain. Many victims suffer from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), which includes symptoms such as flashbacks (or intrusive thoughts), severe anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, depression and memory lapses. Torture victims often feel guilt and shame, triggered by the humiliation they have endured. Many feel that they have betrayed themselves or their friends and family. All such symptoms are normal human responses to abnormal and inhuman treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/defining-torture.aspx |title= What is torture? |publisher=IRCT |accessdate=7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations like [[Freedom from Torture]] and the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] try to help survivors of torture obtain medical treatment and to gain [[forensic]] medical [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to obtain [[refugee|political asylum]] in a safe country or to prosecute the perpetrators.

Torture is often difficult to prove, particularly when some time has passed between the event and a medical examination, or when the torturers are immune from prosecution. Many torturers around the world use methods designed to have a maximum psychological impact while leaving only minimal physical traces. Medical and Human Rights Organizations worldwide have collaborated to produce the [[Istanbul Protocol]], a document designed to outline common torture methods, consequences of torture, and medico-legal examination techniques. Typically deaths due to torture are shown in an autopsy as being due to "natural causes" like heart attack, inflammation, or [[embolism]] due to extreme [[stress (medicine)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For survivors, torture often leads to lasting [[mental health|mental]] and physical health problems.

Physical problems can be wide-ranging, e.g. [[sexually transmitted diseases]], musculo-skeletal problems, [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]], post-traumatic [[epilepsy]] and [[dementia]] or chronic pain syndromes.

On 19 August 2007, the [[American Psychology Association]] (APA) voted to bar participation, to intervene to stop, and to report involvement in a wide variety of interrogation techniques as torture, including "using [[mock execution]]s, simulated drowning, sexual and religious humiliation, stress positions or sleep deprivation", as well as "the exploitation of prisoners' phobias, the use of mind-altering drugs, [[hooding]], forced nakedness, the use of dogs to frighten detainees, exposing prisoners to extreme heat and cold, physical assault and threatening the use of such techniques against a prisoner or a prisoner's family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901513.html|title=APA Rules on Interrogation Abuse|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the APA rejected a stronger resolution that sought to prohibit "all psychologist involvement, either direct or indirect, in any interrogations at U.S. detention centers for foreign detainees or citizens detained outside normal legal channels." That resolution would have placed the APA alongside the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association in limiting professional involvement in such settings to direct patient care. The APA echoed the Bush administration by condemning isolation, sleep deprivation, and sensory deprivation or over-stimulation only when they are likely to cause lasting harm.

Psychiatric treatment of torture-related medical problems might require a wide range of expertise and often specialized experience. Common treatments are [[psychotropic]] [[medication]], e.g. [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] [[antidepressants]], [[counseling]], [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]], [[family systems therapy]] and [[physiotherapy]].

:''See [[Psychology of torture]] for psychological impact, and aftermath, of torture.''

==Rehabilitation==

The aim of rehabilitation is to empower the torture victim to resume as full a life as possible. Rebuilding the life of someone whose dignity has been destroyed takes time and as a result long-term material, medical, psychological and social support is needed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rehabilitation|url=http://www.irct.org/what-is-torture/rehabilitation.aspx|website=What is torture?|publisher=International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT)|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment must be a coordinated effort that covers both physical and psychological aspects. It is important to take into consideration the patients' needs, problems, expectations, views and cultural references.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

The consequences of torture are likely to be influenced by many internal and external factors. Therefore, rehabilitation needs to employ different treatment approaches, taking into account the victims' individual needs, as well as the cultural, social and political environment.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Rehabilitation centres around the world, notably the members of the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]], commonly offer multi-disciplinary support and counselling, including:
*medical attention / psychotherapeutic treatment
*psychosocial support / trauma treatment
*legal services and redress
*social reintegration.
In the case of asylum seekers and refugees, the services may also include assisting in documentation of torture for the asylum decision, language classes and help in finding somewhere to live and work.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Rehabilitation of secondary survivors===
In the worst case, torture can affect several generations. The physical and mental after-effects of torture often place great strain on the entire family and society. Children are particularly vulnerable. They often suffer from feelings of guilt or personal responsibility for what has happened. Therefore, other members of the survivor’s family – in particular the spouse and children – are also offered treatment and counselling.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

===Broken societies===
In some instances, whole societies can be more or less traumatized where torture has been used in a systematic and widespread manner. In general, after years of [[Social repression|repression]], [[wikt:conflict|conflict]] and [[war]], regular support networks and structures have often been broken or destroyed.&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

Providing [[peer support|psychosocial support]] and [[redress]] to survivors of torture and trauma can help reconstruct broken societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rct.dk/media/1195332/fieldmanual_ver1.pdf|title=Rehabilitation and Research Centre for Torture Victims: Field Manual on Rehabilitation (2007)|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rehabilitation centres therefore play a key role in promoting democracy, co-existence and respect for human rights. They provide support and hope, and act as a symbol of triumph over the manmade terror of torture which can hold back the development of democracy of entire societies."&lt;ref name="Rehabilitation"/&gt;

{{Main|Cutthroat trout}}
The '''Yellowstone cutthroat trout''' (''Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri'')
is a subspecies of the [[cutthroat trout]] (''Oncorhynchus clarkii''). It is a [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the [[salmon]] [[family (biology)|family]] (family [[Salmonidae]]).  Native only to a few [[U.S. state]]s, their original range was upstream of [[Shoshone Falls]] on the [[Snake River]] and tributaries in [[Wyoming]], also across the [[Continental Divide]] in [[Yellowstone Lake]] and in the [[Yellowstone River]] as well as its tributaries downstream to the [[Tongue River (Montana)|Tongue River]] in [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fieldguide.mt.gov/detail_AFCHA02087.aspx |title=Montana Field Guide-Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout |publisher=[[Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks]] |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species is also found in [[Idaho]], [[Utah]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=gresswell&gt;{{cite web|last=Gresswell|first=Robert E.|title=Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri): A Technical Conservation Assessment|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/yellowstonecutthroattrout.pdf|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=2011-11-04|format=pdf|date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yellowstone cutthroat trout is a prized game fish. [[Fly fishing]] is the most popular angling method because the subspecies feeds primarily on insects as adults, unlike introduced [[brown trout]] which are more [[piscivore|piscivorous]]. Most varieties of cutthroat trout are less wary and selective than other trout species, thus angler success rates are higher.

== Description ==
Yellowstone cutthroat can be distinguished from other subspecies by their larger black spots that are clustered towards the tail, and by their gray, gold, or copper hues. Spawning males, especially, typically wear golden brown colors.  All cutthroats can be differentiated from rainbow trout by red, pink, or orange marking beneath the jaw that give the species its name.

Depending on habitat, Yellowstone cutthroat can range from six to twenty-six inches as adults, with six to ten inches common in high-elevation, high-gradient tributary streams and the largest fish found only in lakes or in spawning tributaries that feed lakes or emerge from them, such as the Yellowstone River in [[Hayden Valley]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  As a general rule, cutthroat in streams and small ponds run from ten to eighteen inches as adults, with a weight of one half to two pounds.  Before [[habitat destruction]], the threats presented by [[introduced species]], and [[overfishing]], they could run much larger, with fish over thirty inches reported, especially in the strain present in [[Heart Lake (Wyoming)|Heart Lake]] in the southeastern portion of Yellowstone National Park.

== Reproduction ==

All Yellowstone cutthroat trout require flowing water to spawn successfully. Therefore, ponds and lakes must have an inlet or outlet stream for cutthroats to spawn and sustain populations. Some fish are stocked in otherwise suitable lakes in the [[Beartooth Mountains]] and elsewhere to provide angling opportunities that otherwise would not be available.

== Population threats ==

Their range has been reduced by overfishing and habitat destruction due to mining, grazing, and logging, and population densities have been reduced by competition with nonnative [[brook trout|brook]], [[brown trout|brown]] and [[rainbow trout]] since these were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  However the most serious current threats to the subspecies are interbreeding with introduced rainbow trout (resulting in [[cutbow]]s) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the presence of [[lake trout]] in Yellowstone and Heart lakes in Yellowstone National Park which prey upon cutthroat trout to fifteen inches in length, and several outbreaks of [[whirling disease]] in major spawning tributaries.&lt;ref name="lake trout"&gt;{{cite web| title =The Yellowstone Lake Crisis: Confronting a Lake Trout Invasion| website =| publisher =National Park Service| url =http://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/upload/laketrout2.pdf| format = PDF |year=1995| accessdate = 2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri 1904.jpg|thumb|right|From ''Birds and nature'', 1904]]
Although lake trout were established in [[Shoshone Lake|Shoshone]] and [[Lewis Lake (Wyoming)|Lewis]] lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. Government stocking operations in 1890, they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence there is probably the result of accidental or illegal introductions.&lt;ref name="lake trout"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=W. C. |title=The Fishes of the Yellowstone National Park |publisher=Department of Commerce, Bureau of Fisheries |location=Washington D.C. |pages=22–23 |year=1921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasional drought in the Yellowstone area makes several spawning tributaries run dry in late summer, preventing cutthroat fry from migrating to Yellowstone Lake and making them easy prey for predators such as gulls, pelicans, and others.  These threats have significantly reduced cutthroat populations in Yellowstone Lake and adjacent parts of the Yellowstone River. Currently, the strongest populations of cutthroat are to be found in the Grand and Black Canyons of the Yellowstone River and in the Yellowstone's major tributary in Yellowstone Park, the [[Lamar River]] and its tributaries. Attempts as recently as 2004 by environmentalists to have the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] place the subspecies on the list of [[Endangered Species]] was not approved by the agency, citing evidence that major efforts are already underway to ensure the continued existence of this subspecies. All Yellowstone cutthroat trout caught within Yellowstone National Park must be released. Populations outside the national park are subject varying regulations depending on the location of the stream or waterway.
