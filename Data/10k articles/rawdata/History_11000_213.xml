'''Albanians in Italy''' are [[Italy|Italian]] citizens of [[Albanians|Albanian]] origin.

The [[Albani family|Albani]] were an [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[Rome|Roman]] family, members of which attained the highest dignities in the [[Roman Catholic Church]], one, [[Clement XI]], having been [[Pope]]. They were ethnic [[Albanians]] who originally moved to [[Urbino]] from the region of [[Malësi e Madhe]] in [[Albania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |last=Herbermann |first=Charles George |authorlink= |author2=Knights of Columbus, Catholic Truth Committee |year=1913 |publisher= Robert Appleton Company|location=The New York Public Library |isbn= |page=255 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FmgQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=illyricum+sacrum+albanian&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=illyricum%20sacrum%20albanian&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been soldiers of [[Scanderbeg]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Though eventually assimilated in their Italian environment, Clement XI's Albanian antecedents were evident in his having commissioned, during his reign as a Pope, the famous ''[[Illyricum Sacrum]]''. Today it is one of the main sources of the field of [[Albanology]], with over 5000 pages divided in several volumes written by [[Daniele Farlati]] and Dom. Coletti.

There is an Albanian community in southern Italy, known as [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]], who had settled in the country starting with the 15th and the 16th century and later, displaced by the changes brought about by the  [[expansion of the Ottoman Empire]]. Some managed to escape and were offered refuge from the repression by the Kingdom of [[Naples]] and Kingdom of [[Sicily]] (both under Aragonese rule), where the Arbëreshë were given their own villages and protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | title = LE MIGRAZIONI DEGLI ARBERESHE
  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Arbëreshë were estimated as numbering at a quarter million in the 1976.&lt;ref name="ethnologue1976"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/aae/***EDITION*** Albanian, Arbëreshë - A language of Italy - Ethnic population: 260,000 (Stephens 1976).]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albanian Immigration to Italy in the Early 1990’s ==

After the breakdown of the communist regime in Albania in 1990, Italy had been the main immigration target for Albanians leaving their country. This exodus was fueled mainly by socio-economic instability, a looming fear of civil war, and lack of confidence in the democratization process in Albania. Around 3 weeks after the overturning of the regime, in March 1991, around 25,700 Albanians crossed the S[[Strait of Otranto|trait of Otrant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;o into Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799289730|title=The politics of recognizing difference : multiculturalism Italian-style|last=R.D.|first=Grillo,|last2=Jeff.|first2=Pratt,|publisher=Ashgate, Ashgate|isbn=9780754618911|oclc=799289730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in August 1991, another 20,000 migrants arrived in Bari Harbour aboard the [[Vlora (ship)|Vlora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://refuge.journals.yorku.ca/index.php/refuge/article/viewFile/21669/20342|title=Albanian Refugees in Italy|last=Campani|first=Giovanna|date=|website=Refuge: Canada’s Journal on Refugees|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian government classified such Albanians as “illegal economic migrants” and started repatriated them after a period of detention in special camps in Southern Italy. Albanian attempts to immigrate by sea caused the Italian government to deploy a considerable number of Italian soldiers along the coast of Puglia - directly facing Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799289730|title=The politics of recognizing difference : multiculturalism Italian-style|last=R.D.|first=Grillo,|last2=Jeff.|first2=Pratt,|publisher=Ashgate, Ashgate|isbn=9780754618911|oclc=799289730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy had been a symbol of the West for many Albanians during the communist period, because of its geographic proximity. Additionally, Albania past status as an Italian colony might have fueled immigration efforts into Italy specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799289730|title=The politics of recognizing difference : multiculturalism Italian-style|last=R.D.|first=Grillo,|last2=Jeff.|first2=Pratt,|publisher=Ashgate, Ashgate|isbn=9780754618911|oclc=799289730}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a linguistic connection similar to what attracts Romanians to Italy, as the [[Albanian language]], although not itself Romance, has a huge amount of vocabulary of Romance origin like English or Maltese. Italy reacted to this migration pressure by introducing the "[[Claudio Martelli|Martelli]]" law, stipulating that any immigrant who could prove that he or she had come into the country before the end of 1989 be granted a two-year residency permit.

The perception of Albanian immigrants by Italian citizens in the period was overwhelmingly negative. Italian media in the 1990s played a large part in devaluing and inferiorizing the Albanian immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799289730|title=The politics of recognizing difference : multiculturalism Italian-style|last=R.D.|first=Grillo,|last2=Jeff.|first2=Pratt,|publisher=Ashgate, Ashgate|isbn=9780754618911|oclc=799289730}}&lt;/ref&gt; A quantitative analysis of the frequency of words occurring in news articles within the early 90’s revealed that articles mentioning Albanians were positively correlated with the occurrence of words conveying negative sentiment. Therefore, articles mentioning Albanians were more likely to have news about organized crime and other activities with an illicit connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Stoppiello, S. (1999), “Nomi e immagini dell' ‘altro’. Un’analisi multidimensionale della stampa”, Studie emigrazione, 36 (135), pp. 417-442.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also instances where newspapers propagated misinformation: such as linking the cholera outbursts in Bari with the inflow of refugees from Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799289730|title=The politics of recognizing difference : multiculturalism Italian-style|last=R.D.|first=Grillo,|last2=Jeff.|first2=Pratt,|publisher=Ashgate, Ashgate|isbn=9780754618911|oclc=799289730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From March 1997, Italy instituted a strict patrol of the Adriatic in an attempt to curb Albanian immigration. As a result, many Albanian immigrants in Italy do not have a legal status. Out of an estimated 150,000 Albanian immigrants in Italy in 1998, only some 82,000 were registered with authorities. In total there are 800,000 Albanians in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/albania-looking-beyond-borders/|title=Albania: Looking Beyond Borders|date=2004-08-01|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-04-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy also took efforts to alleviate the plight of Albanians in Albania. As a response to the Albanian political and refugee crisis in April 1997, in association with the United Nations, Italy led Operation Alba. This was a military-humanitarian mission involving 6000 Italian personnel. It was undertaken in order to deliver aid to the Albanian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/799289730|title=The politics of recognizing difference : multiculturalism Italian-style|last=R.D.|first=Grillo,|last2=Jeff.|first2=Pratt,|publisher=Ashgate, Ashgate|isbn=9780754618911|oclc=799289730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Government has housed significant numbers of Albanians from Kosovo in the Arbëresh settlements, most notably in [[Piana degli Albanesi]] in Sicily.

== Religion ==
In the years 2011 and 2012 the [[International Society of Transport Aircraft Trading|ISTAT]] made a survey regarding the religious affiliation among the immigrants in Italy, the religion of the Albanian people in Italy were as follows:&lt;ref name=ISTATreligion&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.istat.it/it/archivio/169710|title=Appartenenza e pratica religiosa tra i cittadini stranieri|date=2014-10-30|website=www.istat.it|language=it|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="967">'''Antejuramentum''', and '''præjuramentum''', historically called '''''juramentum calumniæ''''' (literally, "oath to accuse falsely"), is an [[oath]] which both the accuser and accused were obliged to make before any [[Trial (law)|trial]] or [[purgation (law)|purgation]]. The accuser was to swear that he would prosecute the criminal, and the accused was to make oath on the very day that he was to undergo the [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]], that he was innocent of the claims of which he was charged. If the accuser failed, the criminal was discharged. If the accused failed, he was intended to be guilty, and was not to be admitted to purge himself by the ordeal (see: [[combat]], [[duel]], etc.).

Author:  (Rennes, 1892) [http://en.calameo.com/read/000107044db714fb368c9  p312].&lt;/ref&gt;Numerous inscriptions in situ confirm the name and status of the Roman city.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph-Anatole Toulotte, Géographie de l'Afrique chrétienne(Rennes, 1892) [http://en.calameo.com/read/000107044db714fb368c9   p299].&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Reconquista]] of [[Spain]], a group of [[Andalusia]]n [[Moors]] settled in its [[ruins]] at the end of the [[15th century]]. 

Ancient Tubernuca was also the [[cathedra|seat]] of an ancient [[Catholic]] [[Bishopric]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1867.htmTitular Episcopal See of  Tubernuca] at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a suffragan of [[Archdiocese of Carthage|Carthage]], which survives today as a [[titular Bishop]]ric of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. On one [[bishop]] from [[Ancient history|antiquity]] is known to us, Repositus, a correspondent with [[Cyprian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph-Anatole Toulotte]], Géographie de l'Afrique chrétienne(Rennes, 1892) [http://en.calameo.com/read/000107044db714fb368c9   p299].&lt;/ref&gt; The current bishop of the [[Bishopric]] is [[Rubén Gonzalez Tierrablanca]] of [[Turkey]] who replaced [[Alberto Jiménez Iniesta]] of [[Spain]] in 2016.

[[File:Bogomil Vošnjak.jpg|thumb|Bogumil Vošnjak in the 1920s]]
'''Bogumil Vošnjak''', also known as '''Bogomil Vošnjak''' (9 September 1882 – 18 June 1955), was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[jurist]], [[politician]], [[diplomat]], [[author]], and [[Legal history|legal historian]]. He often wrote under the [[pseudonym]] '''Illyricus'''.

== Biography ==

He was born as Bogomil Vošnjak in [[Celje]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] [[Duchy of Styria]], in the Slovene branch of the notable Styrian industrialist Vošnjak/Woschnagg family. His father [[Miha Vošnjak]], native from [[Šoštanj]], was one of the founders of liberal-progressive peasant [[cooperatives]] in [[Lower Styria]]. His uncle [[Josip Vošnjak]], was the leader of the [[National Progressive Party (Slovenia)|Slovene National Progressive Party]] in [[Lower Styria]]. He attended the elementary school in Celje and later in [[Graz]], where he moved with his father. He later returned to Celje, where he enrolled to the [[First Grammar School, Celje|First Celje Grammar School]]. In 1896 he moved to [[Gorizia]], where he attended the [[Gorizia Grammar School]], graduating in 1901. He then went to [[Vienna]], where he studied [[law]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. After graduating in 1906, he continued his studies at the [[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]] in [[Paris]] and at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. In 1912, he got employed as a lecturer at the [[University of Zagreb]]. It was at this time that he started using the [[Croatian language|Croatian]] version of his name, Bogumil.

During his student years, Vošnjak travelled extensively. He visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Egypt]], [[Russia]] and travelled throughout the [[Balkans]]. In 1902, he published his [[Travel literature|travelogue]] in Slovene under the title ''Zapiski mladega popotnika'' ("Notes of a Young Traveller").

In 1909, on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the [[Illyrian Provinces]], Vošnjak wrote his first scientific [[monography]], "The Constitution and Administration of the [[Illyrian Provinces]]", which was published the following year by the Slovene publishing house ''[[Slovenska matica]]''. During this time, he also campaigned for the establishment of a Slovene university in [[Trieste]], together with his friend and professor from the Gorizia years, [[Henrik Tuma]].

Upon the outbreak of [[World War I]], Vošnjak was mobilized in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] and sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. He took advantage of a discharge in April 1915 to visit Gorizia, from where he crossed the border with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] and fled to [[Venice]] and from there to [[Switzerland]]. Already in May of the same year, he published a book in French, entitled "The Question of Trieste", in which he advocated the unification of the city with a future [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav state]].

In Switzerland, Vošnjak established contacts with [[Ante Trumbić]], a Croatian emigrant from [[Dalmatia]], and joined the [[Yugoslav Committee]], a political interest group formed by [[South Slavs]] from Austria-Hungary aimed at the unification of the [[South Slavic peoples]] in an independent state. In 1917, he was among the signers of the [[Corfu Declaration]], a joined political statement of the Yugoslav Committee and the representatives of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], which was the first step in the creation of Yugoslavia.

After the end of War, Vošnjak moved to [[Paris]], where he worked for the Yugoslav delegation at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]]. In 1920, he returned to his homeland, and was elected to the constitutional assembly of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] on the list of the [[Liberalism|liberal]] Slovene [[Independent Agrarian Party]]. In the Assembly, Vošnjak strongly advocated a [[centralist]] and [[monarchist]] framework of the new country, against most deputies from [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]], who favoured [[federalism]]. In February 1921, Vošnjak attacked the [[Autonomist Declaration]], signed by some of the most prominent Slovene liberal and progressive intellectuals, who demanded cultural and political autonomy for Slovenia within Yugoslavia.

Between 1923 and 1924, he served as ambassador of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to [[Czechoslovakia]]. In 1924, he settled in [[Belgrade]]. During the [[Nazi German]] occupation of Serbia between 1941 and 1944, Vošnjak supported the [[Chetnik]] underground network of general [[Draža Mihajlović]].

After the [[Communists]] took power in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in 1945, Vošnjak emigrated to the [[United States]]. He worked at the [[Columbia University]] Libraries and later as an expert for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. Between 1952 and 1953, he lectured at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] on "Government and Politics in the Balkan Countries".

He died in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1955.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3966">The '''Canadian Archeological Association''' is the primary archaeological organization in Canada. The CAA was founded in 1968 by a group of archaeologists that included William E. Taylor, the head of the Archaeology Division at the [[National museums of Canada|National Museum of Canada]]. The organization's first publication was named the ''Bulletin''. In 1977 it was renamed the ''Canadian Journal of Archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Interdisciplinary approaches to Canadian society: a guide to the literature |last= Artibise |first= Alan F.

''Clive Michael Law''' (1954–2017) was a Canadian publisher and author, and founder and President of [[Service Publications]].  He wrote and edited several books dealing with the Canadian military, including ground-breaking works on Canadian distinguishing patches worn since 1916, as well as the uniforms of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and was the Canadian subject matter expert on the Canadian Inglis High-Power Pistol ([[Browning High-Power]]). As a senior public servant for the Government of Canada, he worked with [[Global Affairs Canada]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and [[Transport Canada]].

== Early life ==

Clive Law was born in London England, on May 14, 1954. He emigrated to Canada at the age of four and became a Canadian citizen on March 5, 1971. He attended [[Bishop's College School]] where he participated in the Cadet movement, attaining the rank of Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major.

== Military Service ==
Law began his military service as a "Corporal All-out" Staff Cadet on the establishment of the [[Regiment de maisonneuve|Regiment de Maisonneuve]] in June 1971. From September 1972 to April 1974, he was a Cadet Instructor List Officer with 2675 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps affiliated to 3rd Field Regiment (Royal Canadian Engineers). He officially enrolled in the Canadian Forces Primary Reserve on 23 May 1974, as an officer of the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]]. In 1976 he completed the Unit NBC Officer and Basic Parachutist courses before transferring to the Supplementary List in June 1976.

== Service Publications ==
Service Publications (SP) was established in 1991 by Clive M. Law, an author and historian as well as former officer of the Governor General's Foot Guards. The company is devoted to the publication of books and periodicals regarding Canadian military subjects. SP sells books from other publishers as well as producing its own series of books. In addition to one-off titles by various authors, SP also releases titles as part of their own series of books, such as "Weapons of War" and "UpClose".

In addition, MilArt, an acronym for Military Artifact, was originally published as a paper newsletter from 1996 to 1999, at which time it went dormant due to Law's other commitments with Service Publications. Even though collectors of Canadian militaria are well served by two large, national, collectors' organizations (and countless local groups) Clive Law felt that ready access, via the web, to quality articles would benefit the Collector Historian community. Some articles featured have been written exclusively for MilArt while others have previously appeared in other media. MilArt allows for colour images, and more of them than is normally found in print journals. A number of categories have been established and more will be added as needed.

==Honours and awards==

&lt;/center&gt;

Law was awarded the [[Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal]] for his contributions to society.  The medal was awarded in early 2003, in recognition of his publishing accomplishments. The medal was presented by Dr. Serge Bernier, Director, History and Heritage at the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]].

In May 2005 Mr. Law was elected a Fellow of the Company of Military Historians. This US-based organisation boasts over 1500 members and produces one of the best collector-oriented magazines. The Company concentrates on the uniforms of the armies of the Americas as well as those worn by other countries while in the Americas. He was also the recipient of the Loren Miller Medal for a display of concentrating on the uniforms of the Canadian Guards that he exhibited at the annual meeting in Providence, Rhode Island.

In 2009, as a Senior Public Servant, Mr. Law was deployed to Haiti in support of OP [[MINUSTAH]]. He was presented with the UN medal for MINUSTAH with numeral 2. During his time on deployment, he was instrumental in being part of the establishment of  the [[St John Ambulance]] First Aid, as the standard of the [[Haitian National Police]].

Due to his help in creating a self-sustaining first aid program for the Haitian National Police, in 2010 Mr. Law was inducted as a Serving Member into the Order of St John, and was also presented with the Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal by the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. In 2012 he was presented the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal following nomination by the Organization of Military Museums of Canada. This was presented by Richard Pound, Honorary Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards.

In 2015 he was presented with the Minister of Veterans Affairs Commendation. His citation reads:

''Mr. Law is a United Nations (UN) Peacekeeping Veteran who served with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Haiti. He is currently President of the Ottawa branch of the Canadian Association of Veterans of UN Peacekeeping (CAVUNP) and a former member of the Royal Canadian Legion. A federal public servant, Mr. Law also operates an Ottawa publishing firm. This company has published over 100 reference books on the Canadian Army related to the 19th and 20th centuries.

{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}
'''Coinage of [[history of India|India]]''', issued by [[List of Indian monarchs|imperial dynasties]] and [[middle kingdoms of India|middle kingdoms]], began anywhere between the 1st millennium BCE to the 6th century BCE, and consisted mainly of [[copper]] and [[silver]] coins in its initial stage.&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern"&gt;Allan &amp; Stern (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars remain divided over the origins of Indian coinage.&lt;ref name=Dhavalikar&gt;Dhavalikar (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cowry shell]]s was first used in India as commodity money.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] dates back between 2500 BCE and 1750 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ancient India Coinage |url=https://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-ancient.html |publisher=www.rbi.org.in |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219124646/https://www.rbi.org.in/currency/museum/c-ancient.html |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is known, however, is that [[metal]] [[currency]] was minted in India well before the [[Mauryan Empire]] (322–185 BCE),&lt;ref name=sellwood2008&gt;Sellwood (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; and as [[radio carbon dating]] indicates, before the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dhavalikar, M. K. (1975), "The beginning of coinage in India", World Archaeology, 6 (3): 330-338, Taylor &amp; Francis, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of minted coins spread to the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] from [[West Asia]]. The coins of this period were called ''Puranas'', ''[[Karshapana]]s'' or ''Pana''.&lt;ref&gt;See P.L. Gupta: ''Coins'', New Delhi, National Book Trust, 1996, Chapter II.&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest Indian coins, however, are unlike those circulated in West Asia, were not disk-shaped but rather stamped bars of metal, suggesting that the innovation of stamped currency was added to a pre-existing form of token currency which had already been present in the [[Mahajanapadas|Mahajanapada]] kingdoms of the [[Iron Age in India|Indian Iron Age]]. Mahajanapadas that minted their own coins included [[Gandhara]], [[Kuntala country|Kuntala]], [[Kuru (kingdom)|Kuru]], [[Panchala]], [[Shakya]], [[Surasena]] and [[Surashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-gandhara.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Gandhara Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }} {{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-kuntala.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Kuntala Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }} {{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-kuru.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Kuru Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }} {{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-panchala.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Panchala Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }} {{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-shakya.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Shakya Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }} {{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-shurasena.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Shurasena Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605090747/http://coinindia.com/galleries-shurasena.html |archivedate=2012-06-05 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-surashtra.html |title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Surashtra Janapada |publisher=Coinindia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of Indian coinage was further influenced by the coming of [[Turkic people|Turkic]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] invaders in India.&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern"&gt;Allan &amp; Stern (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East India Company]] introduced uniform coinage in the 19th century CE, and these coins were later imitated by the modern nation states of [[Republic of India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=Sutherland2008&gt;Sutherland (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Numismatics]] plays a valuable role in determining certain period of Indian history.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2008/&gt;

== Money before coins ==
There is evidence of countable units of precious metal being used for exchange from the Vedic period onwards. A term ''Nishka'' appears in this sense in the [[Rigveda]]. Later texts speak of cows given as gifts being adorned with ''pādas'' of gold. A ''pāda'', literally a quarter, would have been a quarter of some standard weight.  A unit called ''Śatamāna'', literally a 'hundred standard', representing 100 ''krishnalas'' is mentioned in [[Satapatha Brahmana]]. A later commentary on ''Katyayana Srautasutra'' explains that a ''Śatamāna'' could also be 100 [[ratti]]s.  All these units referred to gold currency in some form but they were later adopted to silver currency.{{sfn|Mookerji, Chandragupta Maurya and His Times|1966|p=212}}{{sfn|Mukherjee, Money and Social Changes in India|2012|p=412}}

[[Panini (grammarian)|Panini]]'s grammar text indicates that these terms continued to be used into the historical period. He mentions that something worth a ''nishka'' is called ''naishka'' and something worth a ''Śatamāna'' is called a ''Śatamānam'' etc. The units were also used to represent the assets of individuals, ''naishka‐śatika'' or ''naishka‐sahasrika'' (some one worth a hundred ''nishkas'' or a thousand ''nishkas'').{{sfn|Mookerji, Chandragupta Maurya and His Times|1966|p=212}}

Panini uses the term ''rūpa'' to mean a piece of precious metal (typically silver) used as a coin, and a ''rūpya'' to mean a stamped piece of metal, a coin in the modern sense.{{sfn|Mookerji, Chandragupta Maurya and His Times|1966|p=214}} The term ''rūpya'' continues into the modern usage as the [[rupee]].

Some scholars state that ancient India had an abundance of gold but little silver. The gold to silver ratio in India was 10 to 1 or 8 to 1. In contrast, in the neighbouring Persia, it was 13 to 1. This value differential would have incentivised the exchange of gold for silver, resulting in an increasing supply of silver in India.{{sfn|Cunningham, Coins of Ancient India|1891|pp=22–23}}

{{see also|Punch-marked coins}}
India developed some of the world's first coins, but scholars debate exactly which coin was first and when. Sometime around 600BC in the lower Ganges valley in eastern India a coin called a punchmarked [[Karshapana]] was created&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joelscoins.com/india.htm|title=Coins of India from ancient times to the present|last=Anderson|first=Joel|website=www.joelscoins.com|access-date=2018-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QOM2-rdspM8C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=karshapana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KQ7bVJjfJY2TuASR24HoDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=karshapana&amp;f=false|title=Coins of Ancient India: From the Earliest Times Down to the Seventh Century A.

According to Hardaker, T.R. the origin of Indian coins can be placed at 575 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HARDAKER|first=TERRY R.|date=1975|title=The origins of coinage in northern India|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42666515|journal=The Numismatic Chronicle (1966-)|volume=15|pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Gupta in the seventh century BCE.  

Punch-marked coins were a type of early Coinage of India, dating to between about the 6th and 2nd centuries BCE. There are actually vast uncertainties regarding the actual time punch-marked coinage started in India, with proposal ranging from 1000 BCE to 500 BCE.&lt;ref name="JC1983-95"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/33456187/Investigating_the_introduction_of_coinage_in_India-_a_review_of_recent_research_Journal_of_the_Numismatic_Society_of_India_xlv_Varanasi_1983_pp.80-101|title=Investigating the introduction of coinage in India- a review of recent research, Journal of the Numismatic Society of India xlv (Varanasi 1983), pp.95-101|last1=Cribb|first1=Joe|pages=85-86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the study of the relative chronology of these coins has successfully established that the first punch-marked coins initially only had one or two punches, with the number of punches increasing over time.&lt;ref name="JC1983-95" /&gt;

The first coins in India may have been [[Mint (coin)|minted]] around the 6th century BCE by the [[Mahajanapadas]] of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], The coins of this period were punch-marked coins called ''Puranas'', ''Karshapanas'' or ''Pana''. Several of these coins had a single symbol, for example, [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] had a humped bull, and Dakshin [[Panchala]] had a [[Swastika]], others, like [[Magadha]], had several symbols. These coins were made of [[silver]] of a standard weight but with an irregular shape. This was gained by cutting up silver bars and then making the correct weight by cutting the edges of the coin.&lt;ref name="Goyala1994"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5caAAAAYAAJ|title=The Coinage of Ancient India|author=Śrīrāma Goyala|publisher=Kusumanjali Prakashan|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are mentioned in the [[Manu Smriti|Manu]], [[Pāṇini|Panini]], and [[Buddhist]] [[Jataka]] stories and lasted three centuries longer in the south than the north (600 BCE – 300 CE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaimuseum.org/draft/gallery/04/01/coin1.htm|title=Puranas or Punch-Marked Coins (circa 600 BC – circa 300 AD)|publisher=Government Museum Chhennai|accessdate=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early coins of India (400 BCE – 100 CE) were made of [[silver]] and [[copper]], and bore animal and plant symbols on them.&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern" /&gt;[[File:Magadha kingdom Circa 430-320s BC AR Karshapana.jpg|thumb|[[Magadha]] kingdom, circa 430–320 BCE, Karshapana.]]

==== Saurashtra die struck Quarter Karshapana coins ====
[[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra Janapada]] coins are probably the earliest die-struck figurative coins from ancient India from 450-300 BCE which are also perhaps the earliest source of Hindu representational forms. Most coins from Surashtra are approximately 1g in weight. Rajgor believes they are therefore quarter karshapanas of 8 rattis, or 0.93 gm. Mashakas of 2 rattis and double mashakas of 4 rattis are also known.

The coins appear to be uniface, in that there is a single die-struck symbol on one side. However, most of the coins appear to be overstruck over other Surashtra coins and thus there is often the remnant of a previous symbol on the reverse, as well as sometimes under the obverse symbol as well&lt;ref name="surashtra"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://coinindia.com/galleries-surashtra.html|title=The COININDIA Coin Galleries: Surashtra Janapada|website=coinindia.com|access-date=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to [[Joe Cribb]], these early Greek coins were at the origin of Indian [[punch-marked coins]], the earliest coins developed in India, which used minting technology derived from Greek coinage.&lt;ref name="JC" /&gt; [[Daniel Schlumberger]] also considers that punch-marked bars, similar to the many punch-marked bars found in northwestern India, initially originated in the Achaemenid Empire, rather than in the Indian heartland:

{{quote|“The punch-marked bars were up to now considered to be Indian (...) However the weight standard is considered by some expert to be Persian, and now that we see them also being uncovered in the soil of Afghanistan, we must take into account the possibility that their country of origin should not be sought beyond the Indus, but rather in the oriental provinces of the Achaemenid Empire"|[[Daniel Schlumberger]], quoted from Trésors Monétaires, p.42.&lt;ref name=OB308/&gt;}}

=== Coins of the Mauryas ===
The [[Mauryan Empire]] coins were punch marked with the royal standard to ascertain their authenticity.&lt;ref name=prasad168&gt;Prasad, 168&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Arthashastra]]'', written by [[Kautilya]], mentions minting of coins but also indicates that the violation of the Imperial Maurya standards by private enterprises may have been an offence.&lt;ref name=prasad168/&gt; Kautilya also seemed to advocate a theory of ''bimetallism'' for coinage, which involved the use of two metals, copper and silver, under one government.&lt;ref name=prasad166&gt;Prasad, 166&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Punch marked coins]] were replaced at the fall of the Maurya Empire by cast, die-struck coins.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Perspectives of Early Indian History Book Review Trust, New Delhi, Popular Prakashan, 1995, p.151 [https://books.google.com/books?id=J4-kubt-SsoC&amp;pg=PA151]&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual coins was first cast by pouring a molten metal, usually copper or silver, into a cavity formed by two molds. These were then usually die-struck while still hot, first on just one side, and then later on the two sides. The coin devices are Indian, but it is thought that this coin technology was introduced from the West, either from the [[Achaemenid Empire]] or from the neighboring [[Greco-Bactrian]] kingdom.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;The Coins Of India, by Brown, C.J. p.13-20 [https://archive.org/details/TheCoinsOfIndia_201512]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coins of the Indo-Greeks ===

{{Further|Post-Mauryan coinage of Gandhara}}
The [[Indo-Greek]] kings introduced Greek types, and among them the portrait head, into the Indian coinage, and their example was followed for eight centuries.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"&gt;Brown C.J (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Every coin has some mark of authority in it, this is what known as "types". It appears on every Greek and Roman coin.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;
Demetrios was the first Bactrian king to strike square copper coins of the Indian type, with a legend in Greek on the obverse, and in Kharoshthi on the reverse.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; Copper coins, square for the most part, are very numerous. The devices are almost entirely Greek, and must have been engraved by Greeks, or Indians trained in the Greek traditions. The rare gold staters and the splendid tetradrachms of Bactria disappear.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; The silver coins of the Indo-Greeks, as these later princes may conveniently be called, are the didrachm and the hemidrachm. With the exception of certain square hemidrachms of Apollodotos and Philoxenos, they are all round, are struck to the Persian (or Indian) standard, and all have inscriptions in both Greek and Kharoshthi characters.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;

Coinage of [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] began to increasingly influence coins from other regions of India by the 1st century BCE.&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern"/&gt; By this time a large number of tribes, dynasties and kingdoms began issuing their coins; [[Prakrit|Prākrit]] legends began to appear.&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern"/&gt; 
The extensive coinage of the [[Kushan empire]] (1st–3rd centuries CE) continued to influence the coinage of the [[Gupta empire|Guptas]] (320 to 550 CE) and the later rulers of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern"/&gt;

During the early rise of [[Roman trade with India]] up to 120 ships were setting sail every year from [[Myos Hormos]] to India.&lt;ref name=Strabo1&gt;{{cite web| title = The Geography of Strabo published in Vol. I of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1917|url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2E1*.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aureus|Gold coins]], used for this trade, was apparently being recycled by the Kushan empire for their own coinage. In the 1st century CE, the Roman writer [[Pliny the Elder]] complained about the vast sums of money leaving the Roman empire for India:

{{Cquote|India, China and the Arabian peninsula take one hundred million [[Sestertius|sesterces]] from our empire per annum at a conservative estimate: that is what our luxuries and women cost us. For what percentage of these imports is intended for sacrifices to the gods or the spirits of the dead? - &lt;small&gt;Pliny, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'' 12.41.84.&lt;/small&gt;}}

The trade was particularly focused around the regions of [[Gujarat]], ruled by the [[Western Satraps]], and the tip of the Indian peninsular in Southern India. Large hoards of Roman coins have been found and especially in the busy maritime trading centers of South India.&lt;ref name=Curtin1&gt;Curtin, 100&lt;/ref&gt; The South Indian kings reissued Roman-like coinage in their own name, either producing their own copies or defacing real ones in order to signify their sovereignty.&lt;ref name=Kulke&gt;Kulke &amp; Rothermund, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coins of the Sakas and the Pahlavas (200 BCE – 400 CE) ===
[[File:Rajuvula coin Northern Satrap with Greek legend and Athena Alkidemos.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;Coin of [[Indo-Scythian]] [[Northern Satrap]] [[Rajuvula]]. '''Obv.''' Bust of king and Greek legend. '''Rev.''' [[Athena]] Alkidemos and [[Kharoshthi]] legend ''chatrapasa apratihatachakrasa rajuvulasa'' "the Satrap Rajuvula whose discus [cakra] is irresistible".The coins are derived from the [[Indo-Greek]] types of [[Strato II]].&lt;ref name="Rosenfield"&gt;The Dynastic Arts of the Kushans, by John M. Rosenfield, University of California Press, 1967 p.135 [https://books.google.com/books?id=udnBkQhzHH4C&amp;pg=PA135]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]
During the [[Indo-Scythians]] period whose era begins from 200 BCE to 400 CE, a new kind of the coins of two dynasties were very popular in circulation in various parts of the then India and parts of central and northern South Asia (Sogdiana, Bactria, Arachosia, Gandhara, Sindh, Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar).&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; These dynasties were [[Saka]] and The [[Pahlavas]].After the conquest of [[Bactria]] by the Sakas in 135 BCE there must have been considerable intercourse sometimes of a friendly, sometimes of a hostile character, between them and the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], who occupied the neighboring territory.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;

Maues, whose coins are found only in the Punjab, was the first king of what may be called the Azes group of princes. His silver is not plentiful; the finest type is that with a "biga" (two-horsed chariot) on the obverse, and this type belongs to a square Hemi drachm, the only square aka silver coin known. His most common copper coins, with an elephant's head on the obverse and a "[[Caduceus]]" (staff of the god Hermes) on the reverse are imitated from a round copper coin of Demetrius. On another copper square coin of Maues the king is represented on horseback. This striking device is characteristic both of the [[Saka]] and [[Pahlava]] coinage; it first appears in a slightly different form on coins of the Indo-Greek Hippostratos; the Gupta kings adopted it for their "horseman" type, and it reappears in Medieval India on the coins of numerous Hindu kingdoms until the 14th century CE.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;

===Coins of Kanishka and Huvishka (100 CE – 200 CE)===
[[File:Coin of Kanishka I.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Kanishka]] in Greek script, with illustration of the [[Buddha]] on the reverse.]]
[[Kanishka]]'s copper coinage which came into the scene during 100–200 CE was of two types: one had the usual "standing king" obverse, and on the rarer second type the king is sitting on a throne. At about the same time there was [[Huvishka]]'s copper coinage which was more varied; on the reverse, as on Kanishka's copper, there was always one of the numerous deities; on the obverse the king was portrayed (1) riding on an elephant, or (2) reclining on a couch, or (3) seated cross-legged, or (4) seated with arms raised.

===Coinage of the Guptas Empire (320 CE – 480 CE)===
[[File:Silver Coin of Chandragupta II.jpg|thumb|Silver coin of [[Chandragupta II]] of [[Gupta Empire]], in the style of the [[Western Satrap]], with pseudo-Greek script on the obverse, 400 CE.]]
[[File:Two Gold coins of Chandragupta II.jpg|thumb|Gold coins of [[Chandragupta II]] of [[Gupta Empire]], 400 CE.]]
The [[Gupta Empire]] produced large numbers of gold coins depicting the Gupta kings performing various rituals, as well as silver coins clearly influenced by those of the earlier Western Satraps by Chandragupta II.&lt;ref name="EBAllan&amp;Stern"/&gt;

The splendid gold coinage of Guptas, with its many types and infinite varieties and its inscriptions in Sanskrit, are the finest examples of the purely Indian art that we possess.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; Their era starts from around 320 with Chandragupta I's accession to the throne.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;Son of [[Chandragupta I]]-[[Samudragupta]], the real founder of the Gupta Empire had coinage made of gold only.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; There were seven different varieties of coins that appeared during his reign.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; Out of them the archer type is the most common and characteristic type of the Gupta dynasty coins, which were struck by at least eight succeeding kings and was a standard type in the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;

The silver coinage of Guptas starts with the overthrow of the Western Satraps by Chandragupta II. Kumaragupta and Skandagupta continued with the old type of coins (the Garuda and the Peacock types) and also introduced some other new types.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; The copper coinage was mostly confined to the era of Chandragupta II and was more original in design. Eight out of the nine types known to have been struck by him have a figure of Garuda and the name of the King on it. The gradual deterioration in design and execution of the gold coins and the disappearance of silver money, bear ample evidence to their curtailed territory.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt; The percentage of gold in Indian coins under the reign of Gupta rulers showed a steady financial decline over the centuries as it decreases from 90% pure gold under [[Chandragupta I]] (319-335) to a mere 75-80% under [[Skandagupta]] (467).

===Coinage of the Rajputs (900 CE – 1400 CE)===

The coins of various [[Rajput]] princes's ruling in Hindustan and Central India were usually of gold, copper or billon, very rarely silver. These coins had the familiar goddess of wealth, Lakshmi on the obverse. In these coins, the Goddess was shown with four arms than the usual two arms of the Gupta coins; the reverse carried the Nagari legend. The seated bull and horseman were almost invariable devices on Rajput copper and bullion coins.&lt;ref name="Brown 1992"/&gt;

== Late Middle Ages – contemporary history (1300 CE – 2000 CE) ==

=== The Alf Coins of King [[Akbar]] (1582 CE – 1610 CE) ===
[[File:Silver Rupee Akbar.jpg|thumb|Silver coin of Akbar with inscriptions of the [[shahada|Islamic declaration of faith]], the declaration reads: "There is no god but Allah, and [[Muhammad]] is the messenger of Allah."]]
Political orders in [[Medieval India]] were based on a relationship and association of power by which the supreme ruler, especially a monarch was able to influence the actions of the subjects.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Himanshu, P. R. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the relationship to work, it had to be expressed and communicated in the best possible way.
In other words, power was by nature declarative from the point of view of its intelligibility and comprehensibility to the audience and required modes of communication to take effect by means of which sovereign power was articulated in the 16th century India.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Himanshu, P. R. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

An examination was done of a series of coins officially issued and circulated by the Mughal emperor Akbar (r 1556-1605) to illustrate and project a particular view of time, religion, and political supremacy being fundamental and co-existing in nature.

Coins constitute part of the evidence that project the transmission of religious and political ideas in the last quarter of the 16th century.

The word 'Alf' refers to the millennium.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Himanshu, P. R. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
The following are the extraordinary decisions, though bizarre, were taken by King Akbar.
* The date in coins were written in words and not in figures.
* If the intention was to refer to the year 1000 (yak hazar) of the Islamic calendar ([[hijri]] era) as is traditionally believed, the expression adopted for it (Alf) was unorthodox and eccentric.
* Akbar, ultimately and more importantly, commanded Alf to be imprinted on the coins in 990 hijri (1582 CE ), or ten years before the date (1000 hijri) was due.
The order was a major departure and extremely unconventional and eccentric from the norm of striking coins in medieval India. Till the advent of Alf, all gold and silver coins had been stuck with figure of the current hijri year.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Himanshu, P. R. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Akbar's courtier and critic, Abdul Badani, presents and explains in brevity the motive for these unconventional decisions while describing the events that took place in 990 hijri (1582 CE):

{{Quotation|align=center|And having thus convinced himself that the thousand years from the prophethood of the apostle (B'isat I Paighambar) the duration for which [[Islam]] [lit. religion] would last was now over, and nothing prevented him from articulating the desires he so secretly held in his heart, and the space became empty of the theologians (ulema) and mystics (mashaikh) who had carried awe and dignity and no need was felt for them: he [Akbar] felt himself at liberty to refute the principles of Islam and to institute new regulations, obsolete and corrupt but considered precious by his pernicious beliefs. The first order, which was given to write the date Alf on coins (Dar Sikka tank half Navisand) and to write the Tarikh-i-Alfi [history of the millennium] from the demise (Rihlat) of the prophet (Badauni II: 301).&lt;ref name=h&gt;Himanshu, P. R. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The evidence, both textual and [[numismatics|numismatic]], actually makes it clear that Akbar's decisions to mint the Alf coins and commission the Tarikh-i-Alfi were based on a new communication and interpretation of the terminal dates of the Islamic millennium.

What the evidence doesn't explain is the source of the idea as well as the reason for persisting with the same date on the imperial coinage even after the critical year had passed.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Himanshu, P. R. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old woman draught at Ratcliffe Highway.png|thumb|250px|right|Punishing a common scold in the [[ducking stool]]]]

In the [[common law]] of [[criminal law|crime]] in [[England and Wales]], a '''common [[wiktionary:scold|scold]]''' was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing and quarrelling with their neighbours. The majority of individuals punished for scolding were women, though men could also be labelled scolds. 

The offence, which was exported to North America with the colonists, was punished by monetary fines, but also by methods intended to publicly humiliate such as [[cucking stool|ducking]]: being placed in a chair and submerged in a river or pond. Although rarely prosecuted it remained on the [[statute book]]s in England and Wales until 1967.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late middle ages in England. It has been suggested that attempts to control and punish 'bad speech' increased after the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]], when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardsley|first=Sandy|date=2006|title=Sin, Speech and Scolding in Late Medieval England|url=|journal=Fama: The Politics of Talk and Reputation in Medieval Europe, ed. Thelma Fenster and Daniel Lord Smail|volume=|pages=146-8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using a number of Latin terms, including ''objurgator, garulator, rixator'' and ''litigator'', found in both masculine and feminine forms in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. Scolding offences were commonly presented and punished in [[Manorial court|manorial]] and borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England. Scolds were also presented in church courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=Jones|first=Karen|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=104-106|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common punishment was a monetary fine.

Various historians have argued that scolding and bad speech were coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding, though married women featured most frequently, while widows were rarely labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=123-125|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places, such as Exeter, scolds were typically poorer women, whereas elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=135-136|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who were also charged with other offences, such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping or sexual impropriety were also likely to be labelled scolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=137|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals were frequently labelled 'common scolds', indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on the whole community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent's secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65767599|title=Gender and petty crime in late medieval England : the local courts in Kent, 1460-1560|last=1939-|first=Jones, Karen,|date=2006|publisher=Boydell Press|year=|isbn=184383216X|location=Woodbridge|pages=108|oclc=65767599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men accused of scolding were often charged alongside their wives. Helen, wife of Peter Bradwall scolded Hugh Welesson and Isabel, his wife, in Middlewich in 1434, calling Isabel a "child murderer" and Hugh a "skallet [wretched] knave". Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a "lesyng blebberer" (lying bletherer). All parties were fined for the offences, though Hugh and Isabel were fined jointly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=102|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/891396093|title=Venomous tongues : speech and gender in late medieval England|last=Sandy,|first=Bardsley,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780812239362|location=Philadelphia|pages=103|oclc=891396093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflected the dominance of scolding as a female offence. In the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]] says of this offence:

{{quote|text=Lastly, a common scold, {{lang|la|communis rixatrix}}, (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgment is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.|sign=[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Bl.

[[Image:The Branks from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896) - 02.jpg|thumb|right|Scold's bridles or branks were probably used as a punishment but no official records of their use have been found.]]
The prescribed penalty for this offence involved dunking the convicted offender in water in an instrument called the "[[cucking stool]]".  The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, eventually became known as a ''ducking stool'' by [[folk etymology]].

Other writers disagree with Blackstone's assertion equating the two sorts of punishment seat.  The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' notes the use of a cucking stool at [[Chester]], a seat also known as {{lang|la|cathedra stercoris}}, a "dung chair", whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter's buttocks to onlookers.  This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water. [[Francois Maximilian Misson]], a French traveller and writer, recorded the method used in England in the early 18th century:&lt;ref name="AME"&gt;{{cite book |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |chapter=The Ducking Stool |author=Alice Morse Earle |year=1896 |url=http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |accessdate=18 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004233/http://www.getchwood.com/punishments/curious/chapter-2.html |archivedate=17 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.}}

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed in position by the river or pond, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convicted woman to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel, which consisted of a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to the axles. This would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.&lt;ref name="ne"&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Ducking and Cucking Stools |volume=8 |page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[scold's bridle]], known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or [[head cage]] that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context of the punishment of common scolds, but there are anecdotal reports of their historical use as a public punishment.&lt;ref name="Dugdale"&gt;{{cite book|title=England and Wales Delineated: Historical, Entertaining &amp; Commercial|author=Thomas Dugdale, William Burnett|year=1860|pages=1238}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LandC"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire|author=Frederick W.

==Historical prosecutions==
[[Image:The Ducking-Stool from Curious Punishments of Bygone Days (1896).jpg|right|thumb|This [[woodcut]] shows the wheels on the ducking stool which allowed the occupant to be wheeled through the streets before being ducked.]]

A plaque on the Fye Bridge in [[Norwich]], England claims to mark the site of a "cucking" stool, and that from 1562–1597 "[[strumpet]]s" and common scolds suffered the punishment of dunking there.  In the ''Percy Anecdotes'', published pseudonymously by [[Thomas Byerley (journalist)|Thomas Byerley]] and [[Joseph Clinton Robertson]] in 1821{{ndash}}23, the authors state that "How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear."&lt;ref name="percy"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Percy Anecdotes|author=[[Reuben Percy]] and [[Sholto Percy]]|year=1823|publisher=Printed for T. Boys|location=London|url=http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910073842/http://www.mspong.org/percy/crime.htm#TheDuckingStool|archivedate=10 September 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anecdotes'' also suggest [[penology|penological]] ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool's disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who according to this account had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold.  On her fourth conviction, the [[King's Bench]] declined to dunk her again, and instead ordered her to pay a fine of three [[mark (money)|marks]], and ordered her imprisoned until payment took place.

The ''Percy Anecdotes'' also quote a pastoral poem by [[John Gay]] (1685{{ndash}}1732), who wrote that:

{{poemquote|I'll speed me to the pond, where the high stool
On the long plank, hangs o'er the muddy pool,
That stool the dread of ev'ry scolding quean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=33871 |title=The Shepherd's Week : Wednesday; or, The Dumps |author=John Gay |date=1714 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and a 1780 poem by [[Benjamin West]], who wrote that:

{{poemquote|There stands, my friend, in yonder pool,
An engine call'd a ducking-stool;
By legal pow'r commanded down,
The joy and terror of the town.
If jarring females kindle strife...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34005/34005-h/34005-h.htm#Page_11 |title=Curious Punishments of Bygone Days |author=Alice Morse Earle |website=Project Gutenberg |date=1896 |accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In ''The Queen v. Foxby'', 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds.  Lord Chief Justice [[John Holt (judge)|John Holt]] of the Queen's Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was "better ducking in a [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]], than a [[Michaelmas]] [[quarter Sessions|term]]", i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter.  The tenor of Holt's remarks however suggests that he found the punishment an antiquarian curiosity and something of a joke.&lt;ref name="fc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/amendVIIIs19.html|title=The Founders Constitution:Volume 5, Amendment VIII, Document 19|year=1987|publisher=University of Chicago|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last recorded uses of the stool for ducking involve a Mrs. Ganble at [[Plymouth]] (1808) and Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold from  [[Leominster]] (1809). In 1817 Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.&lt;ref name="ne" /&gt;

The English common law as received by the law of the United States included the offence of being a common scold.  In 1829, a Washington, D.C. court found the American [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] writer [[Anne Royall]] guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched against her by local clergymen.  Despite the construction of the traditional engine of punishment by sailors at the Navy Yard, the court ruled the punishment of the cucking-stool obsolete, and instead improvised a fine of ten dollars.&lt;ref name="LC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0001/royall.html|title=An Uncommon Scold|publisher=Library of Congress|author=Cynthia Earman|date=January 2001|accessdate=18 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the law==
In England and Wales, the only part of the United Kingdom where the law had any effect, no prosecutions of common scolds occurred for a considerable period.{{vague|date=November 2017}} Counsel in ''Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions'' [1962] AC 528 described the offence as "obsolete", and section 13(1)(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] eventually abolished it.

The common law offence of being a common scold was extant in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 by Circuit Judge McCann who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the [[14th Amendment to the US Constitution]] for sex discrimination. Long before this decision, the punishment of ducking, together with all other forms of corporeal punishment, had become unlawful under the provisions of the [[New Jersey Constitution of 1844]] or even as early as 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=State of New Jersey v. Marion Palendrano |vol= 120 N.J. Super. 336 (1972)|reporter= |opinion= McCann JCC|court= Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division (Criminal)|date= 13 July 1972|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-published/1972/120-n-j-super-336-0.html |accessdate=28 May 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, many states have laws restricting public [[profanity]], excessive [[noise (environmental)|noise]], and [[disorderly conduct]]. None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-specific as the common scold offense was.

'''Donat Marc LeBourdais''' (1887 - November 8, 1964) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] non-fiction writer and political activist. He wrote eight books during his lifetime, including six on Canada's [[economic history]], a financial investment guide and a biography of explorer [[Vilhjalmur Stefansson]].&lt;ref name=globeobit&gt;{{cite news |title=D.

'''David Held''' (born 1951) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political scientist]] specialising in [[political theory]] and [[international relations]]. He currently holds a joint appointment as Professor of Politics and International Relations, and Master of [[University College, Durham|University College]], at [[Durham University]]. He is also a visiting Professor of Political Science at [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]]. Previously he was the [[Graham Wallas]] chair of Political Science and the co-director of the Centre for the Study of Global Governance at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Vasagar"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/oct/31/saif-gaddafi-lse-academic | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jeevan | last=Vasagar | title=Academic linked to Gaddafi's fugitive son leaves LSE | date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Daniele Archibugi]], Held has been prominent in the development of [[cosmopolitanism]], and of [[cosmopolitan democracy]] in particular. He has been an active scholar on issues of [[globalisation]], [[global governance]] and is joint editor-in-chief of the academic journal ''[[Global Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Editorial Board | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291758-5899/homepage/EditorialBoard.html | website = onlinelibrary.wiley.com | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | access-date = 20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
David Held was born in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] where he spent most of his childhood. He was educated in Britain, [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Upon completing his doctoral studies at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] he conducted post-doctoral research at [[Cambridge University]]. He has held numerous Visiting Appointments in the United States, [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], among other places.

David Held co-founded [[Polity (publisher)|Polity press]] in 1984, which has become a leading publisher in the social sciences and humanities across the world. He is also the General Editor for ''[[Global Policy]]'', an academic journal started in 2008 that focuses on bridging the gap between academics and practitioners on issues of global significance.

In January 2012, he succeeded Professor [[Maurice Tucker]] as Master of [[University College, Durham]], alongside his chair in the School of Government and International Affairs at [[Durham University]].&lt;ref name="palatinate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=16306|work=Palatinate|last=Jonhson|first=Daniel|date=2 November 2011|title=Former LSE academic linked to Gaddafi’s son made new Castle Master}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research== 
Since his first book was published in 1980 (''Introduction to Critical Theory''), David Held has been pursuing a multilevel inquiry into the nature and changing form of national and international politics. This approach has involved three kinds of work. First, it has involved extensive empirical enquiry into the dynamic character, structural elements and governance failures of contemporary society. The empirical dimensions of his work have included books such as ''Global Transformations'' (1999), ''Globalization/Anti-globalization'' (2007), ''Global Inequality'' (2007) and ''Gridlock: Why Global Cooperation is Failing When We Need it Most'' (2013). These books map the changing global context of politics, how the world has become increasingly interconnected, and how failures of leadership and negotiation at the global level are creating a breakdown of multilateralism and global governance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Second, he has been investigating the changing nature and form of the modern state and the locus of the political good. Held examines the question of whether the nation state alone, as typically assumed by political theory, can be the sole home of democracy, accountability and the rule of law. This has entailed a critical evaluation of the concepts of democracy, sovereignty, governance and cosmopolitanism, among other concepts. Books that have explored these themes include: ''Democracy in the Global Order'' (1999), ''Models of Democracy'' (2006), ''Cosmopolitanism: ideals and realities'' (2010). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The third element of Prof. Held’s current work is to explore how and in what ways one can move beyond the crises and dilemmas of politics and governance in the contemporary world. Books such as ''Global Covenant'' (2004), ''Debating Globalization'' (2005) and a wide range of academic articles set out the contours of a multiactor, multilevel democratic politics framed by the fundamental principles of democracy, justice and sustainability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Accordingly, Held’s work explores, on the one hand, the shift in politics from nation states to what he calls a world of ‘overlapping communities of fate' (where the fortunes of countries are increasingly enmeshed) and, on the other hand, how democratic standards and cosmopolitan values can be entrenched in the global order. In pursuing this multilevel approach Prof. Held sees himself working within the classic tradition of political theory which has always been concerned with how to characterize the world in which we live, how to develop and reach normative goals such as liberty, democracy and social justice, and how to move from where we are to where we might like to be. Prof. Held’s response to this challenge is to explore the way globalization has altered the landscape of politics{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, how cosmopolitanism provides ideals that enable one to rethink politics and the political good, and to pursue political stepping stones that could help embed this agenda. He offers a contribution to a pressing dialogue of our times: how to resolve collective action problems, nationally and globally, through institutions and governance arrangements that enhance democracy, social justice and the participation of all citizens in a democratic public life.

'''Dušan Třeštík''' (1 August 1933 – 23 August 2007) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[historian]]. He specialized in [[medieval]] history ([[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (500–1000)) of the [[Czech lands]] and [[philosophy of history|theory of history]].
[[Image:Dušan Třeštík.JPG|thumb|Dušan Třeštík giving a lecture on the Přemyslid dynasty (2006)]]

Třeštík was born in 1933 in [[Sobědruhy u Teplic|Sobědruhy]], now a part of the city of [[Teplice]]. He studied history at the [[Charles University]] from 1951 to 1956 where his tutor was [[František Graus]]. After two years at the Charles University, since 1958 he worked in the Historic Institute of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Science and Arts]]. In his later years he was prominent in its Centre of Medievial Studies. In 1959 he married historian Barbara Krzemieńska and in 1968 he studied in [[West Germany]] and [[France]]. Třeštík was a stark defender of veracity Kristián's legend. As a theorist of history he criticised the neopositivist approach of the mainstream Czech history scholarship and its icon [[Josef Pekař]]. He labeled it as ''faktopis''.

Since 1989 he also published a lot of political texts (collected as ''Češi. Jejich národ, stát, dějiny a pravdy v transformaci'', 1999), especially in [[Lidové Noviny]] (from 1993 to 1996 he was a member of its editorial board) and [[Mladá Fronta Dnes]]. He criticised [[Sudeten Germans]], but he joined [[Impuls 99]] despite being close to [[Václav Klaus]]. After 9/11 Třeštík was sceptical towards [[neoconservative]] politics and the invasion of [[Iraq]].

He died in [[Prague]] in 2007.

{{History of Japan|Shoso-in.jpg| Image explanation = [[Shōsōin]]}}

{{nihongo|'''Eitoku'''|永徳}} was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', lit. year name) of the [[Northern Court (Japan)|Northern Court]] during the [[Nanboku-cho|Era of Northern and Southern Courts]] after [[Kōryaku]] and before [[Shitoku]]. This period spanned the years from February 1381&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Eitoku''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 173;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; to February 1384.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Shitoku''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA875&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 875;] n.b., Nussbaum identifies Eitoku's end in March 13&lt;u&gt;83&lt;/u&gt; and Shitoku's beginning a year later in March 13&lt;u&gt;84&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperors in Kyoto were {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-En'yū]]|後円融天皇|''Go-En'yū-tennō''}} and {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Komatsu]]|後小松天皇|''Go-Komatsu-tennō''}}&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac.

==Nanboku-chō overview==
[[Image:Nanbokucho-capitals.svg|thumb|140px|The Imperial seats during the ''Nanboku-chō'' period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: {{unordered list|Northern capital : [[Kyoto]] |Southern capital : [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]].}}]]   
During the [[Meiji period]], an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] through [[Emperor Go-Murakami]], whose {{nihongo|Southern Court|南朝|''nanchō''}} had been established in exile in [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]], near Nara.&lt;ref name="concise"&gt;Thomas, Julia Adeney. (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Re4djF3oaTMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA199&amp;dq=1911+texbook+controversy#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false  ''Reconfiguring modernity: concepts of nature in Japanese political ideology'', p. 199 n57], citing Mehl, Margaret. (1997). ''History and the State in Nineteenth-Century Japan.'' p. 140-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of the [[Edo period]], the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite widespread recognition that the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|Imperial Regalia]] were not in their possession.&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

This illegitimate {{nihongo|[[Northern Court]]|北朝|''hokuchō''}} had been established in [[Kyoto]] by [[Ashikaga Takauji]].&lt;ref name="concise"/&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1381''', also called {{nihongo|''Eitoku gannen''|永徳元年}}: The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Kōryaku'' 3.

In this time frame, [[Kōwa (Muromachi period)]] (1381–1384) was the Southern Court equivalent ''nengō.''&lt;ref name="titsingh316"&gt;Titsingh, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events of the Eitoku era==
* '''1381''' (''Eitoku 1, 3rd month''): The emperor travels in procession to see [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] at his palacial home in Muromachi.&lt;ref name="titsingh316"/&gt;
* '''1381''' (''Eitoku 1, 7th month''): the ''[[kampaku]]'' [[Nijō Yoshimoto]] is elevated to the position of ''[[daijō daijin]].'' Yoshimitsu is raised to the Imperial court position of ''[[nadaijin]]'' at the young age of 24. Yoshimoto and Yoshimitsu work well in harmony together.&lt;ref name="titsingh316"/&gt;
* '''1382''' (''Eitoku 2, 1st month''): Yoshimitsu is raised to the court position of ''[[sadaijin]]'', and several days later, he was named General of the Left (''sadaisho''). In this same period, [[Tokudaiji Sanetoki|Fujiwara no Sanetoki]] is elevated from the position of ''[[dainagon]]'' to ''nadaijin.''&lt;ref name="titsingh316"/&gt;
* '''1383''' (''Eitoku 3''): Emperor Go-Kameyama ascends southern throne.&lt;ref name="a329"&gt;Ackroyd, Joyce. (1982) ''Lessons from History: The "Tokushi Yoron"'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LocationAfrica.png|450px|thumb|Map showing location of [[Africa]].]]
During the period of 2000–2005, an estimated 440,000 people per year emigrated from Africa; a total number of 17 million migrants within Africa was estimated for 2005.&lt;ref&gt;World migration 2008: Managing labour mobility in the evolving global economy Volume 4 of IOM world migration report series, International Organization for Migration, Hammersmith Press, 2008 {{ISBN|978-92-9068-405-3}}, pp. 38, 407 .&lt;/ref&gt;
The figure of 0.44 million African emigrants per year (corresponding to about 0.05% of the continent's total population) pales in comparison to the annual [[population growth]] of about 2.6%, indicating that only about 2% of Africa's population growth is compensated for by emigration.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;2006 OECD data, cited in World migration 2008, Hammersmith Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-92-9068-405-3}}, pp. 409–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, [[North Africa]] had been receiving large numbers of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n migrants "in transit", predominantly from [[West Africa]], who plan to enter Europe. An annual 22,000 illegal migrants took the route from either Tunisia or Libya to [[Lampedusa]] in the 2000–2005 period. This figure has decreased in 2006, but it has increased greatly as a result of the  2011 [[Tunisian revolution]] and the [[2011 Libyan civil war]]. In 2005, 10,000 West African migrants heading for Europe were stranded in the Mauritanian port of [[Nouadhibou]], and 20,000 sub-Saharan African migrants were waiting for an opportunity to cross to Europe in the Spanish enclaves in North Africa.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Statistics==
Since 2010, most years have seen a rising tide of migrants from sub-Saharan African countries into European Union countries, Norway and Switzerland and the US.

Between February and April 2017, [[Pew Research Center]] surveyed in six of the ten countries that have supplied many of the sub-Saharan immigrants now living in the U.S. Four of these countries are also among the top ten origin countries for sub-Saharan migrants to Europe. The survey asked respondents whether they would go to live in another country, if they had the means and opportunity. At least four-in-ten in each sub-Saharan country surveyed answered yes, including roughly three-quarters of those surveyed in Ghana and Nigeria.

The World Bank ''Migration and Remittances Factbook'' of 2011 gives separate regional summaries for Sub-Saharan Africa on one hand and the Middle East and North Africa on the other. For both regions, there is a surplus of emigrants, even though a substantial part of migration takes place within each region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf|format=PDF|title=MIGRATION AND REMITTANCES FACTBOOK |date=2011|edition=SECOND|website=Siteresources.worldbank.org|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Middle East and North Africa, there was an estimated stock of 18.1 million (5.3% of population) emigrants vs. 12.0 million (3.5% of population) immigrants.
31.5% of migration took place intra-regional, 40.2% was to high-income OECD countries.
The main migration corridors for North Africa were identified as [[Egyptians in Saudi Arabia|Egypt–Saudi Arabia]], [[Algerians in France|Algeria–France]]
[[Demographics of Jordan|Egypt–Jordan]],  [[Moroccans in France|Morocco–France]], [[Moroccans in Spain|Morocco–Spain]], [[Moroccans in Italy|Morocco–Italy]],  and [[Demographics of Libya#Foreign population|Egypt–Libya]]. The portion of refugees was estimated at 65.3% of migrants.
 
For Sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank report estimated a stock of 21.8 million (2.5% of population) emigrants vs. 17.7 million (2.1% of total population) immigrants.
63.0% of migration was estimated as taking place intra-regionally, while 24.8% of migration was to high-income OECD countries.
The top ten migration corridors were
1. Burkina Faso–Côte d'Ivoire, 
2. Zimbabwe–South Africa, 
3. Côte d'Ivoire–Burkina Faso, 
4. Uganda–Kenya, 
5. Eritrea–Sudan,
6. Mozambique–South Africa, 
7. Mali–Côte d'Ivoire, 
8. Democratic Republic of Congo–Rwanda, 
9. Lesotho–South Africa, 
10. Eritrea–Ethiopia.

In terms of destinations, as of 2017, nearly three-quarters (72%) of Europe’s sub-Saharan immigrant population was concentrated in just four countries: the [[United Kingdom|UK]] (1.27 million), [[France]] (980,000), [[Italy]] (370,000) and [[Portugal]] (360,000). In the [[United States|U.S.]], migrants from sub-Saharan Africa can be found across the country, with 42% in the American South, 24% in the Northeast, 18% in the Midwest and 17% in the West, according to the Pew Research Center.&lt;ref name="pewglobal.org"/&gt;

==Europe==
{{Further|African immigration to Europe}}
There is significant migration from [[Africa]] [[immigration to Europe|to Europe]]. 

As of 2007, there were an estimated seven million African migrants living in [[OECD]] countries. Of these, about half are of [[North African]] origin, mostly residing in [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], while the other half are of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n origin, present throughout Western Europe, with significant concentrations in Belgium, France, [[Italy]], the Netherlands, [[Portugal]], Spain and the [[United Kingdom]].

[[African immigration to the United States]] has been comparatively slight, totalling around 3,183,104 individuals as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Total ancestry categories tallied for people with one or more ancestry categories reported 2010 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of this migration is [[illegal immigration|illegal]]. The [[European Union]] [[Frontex]] agency's "Operation Hermes" is also monitoring the [[Mediterranean]] between North Africa and Italy. Due to increased border controls along the Mediterranean, there has been a shift of preferred migration routes towards [[immigration to Greece|Greece]].

===African populations in Europe===
Approximate populations of African origin in Europe:
*[[Arab diaspora|Arabs]] and [[Berbers]] (including North African and Middle Eastern Arabs): approx. 5 million, mostly in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain,  Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Greece and Russia. (see [[Arabs in Europe]])
*[[Sub-Equatorial Africa]]ns: approx. 5 million; mostly in Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070205.wxfrance05/BNStory/International/home|title=France's blacks stand up to be counted|website=Theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Horn of Africa|Horn Africans]]: approx. 1 million, mostly Somalis and Eritreans, mostly in United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Finland
*[[White Africans of European ancestry|Ethnic Europeans with colonial roots]]: approx. 8 million; mostly in France, United Kingdom, Greece and Belgium.
*[[North African Jews]]: approx. 500 thousands; mostly in France.

==Oceania==
In [[Australia]], the number of immigrants from Africa has grown substantially since the 1990s, with most concentrated in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Perth]]. The largest of these [[African Australian]] populations is the South African community, and the Census in 2011 recorded 145,683 [[South Africa]]-born people in Australia. News anchor [[Anton Enus]], the author [[J. M. Coetzee]], and the singer [[Selwyn (singer)|Selwyn Pretorius]] are examples of local celebrities from this community. Also substantial is the 40,000-strong [[Egyptian Australian]] community, mostly concentrated in Sydney,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/comm-summ/_pdf/egypt.pdf|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|website=Immi.gov.au|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 30,000-strong [[Zimbabwean Australian]] community,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/comm-summ/_pdf/zimbabwe.pdf|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|website=Immi.gov.au|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 28,000-strong Mauritian Australian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.immi.gov.au/media/publications/statistics/comm-summ/_pdf/mauritius.pdf|title=Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection|website=Immi.gov.au|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Falklands War''' ({{lang-es |link=no|Guerra de las Malvinas}}), also known as the '''Falklands Conflict''', '''Falklands Crisis''', '''Malvinas War''', '''South Atlantic Conflict''', and the '''''Guerra del Atlántico Sur''''' (Spanish for "South Atlantic War"), was a ten-week [[Undeclared war|war]] between [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]] over two [[British Overseas Territories|British dependent territories]] in the South Atlantic: the [[Falkland Islands]], and [[Falkland Islands Dependencies|its territorial dependency]], the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]. It began on Friday, 2 April 1982, when [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Argentina invaded]] and [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|occupied the Falkland Islands]] (and, [[Invasion of South Georgia|the following day, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]) in an attempt to establish [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|the sovereignty it had claimed over them]]. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval [[task force]] to engage the [[Argentine Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]] before making an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders&lt;!-- Please don't change these figures without discussing in talk. Thanks. --&gt; died during the hostilities.

The conflict was a major episode in the [[History of the Falkland Islands|protracted confrontation]] over the territories' [[sovereignty]]. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalturk.com/en/argentina-to-reaffirm-sovereignty-rights-over-the-falkland-islands-15712 |title= Argentine to reaffirm Sovereignty Rights over The Falkland Islands |publisher= National Turk |accessdate=7 January 2012|date= 2012-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a [[Crown colony]] since 1841. [[Falkland Islanders]], who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly [[Falkland Islands status referendum, 1986|favour British sovereignty]]. Neither state officially [[Declaration of war|declared war]], although both governments declared the Islands a war zone.  Hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the area of the South Atlantic where they lie.

The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various [[Cultural impact of the Falklands War|books, articles, films, and songs]]. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the [[Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional|ruling military government]], hastening its downfall. In the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, bolstered by the successful outcome, [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|was re-elected with an increased majority the following year]]. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it remains a common topic for discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2007/04/01/z-03415.htm |title=Cómo evitar que Londres convierta a las Malvinas en un Estado independiente |publisher= Clarin |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in [[Madrid]], at which the two governments issued a joint statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Joint statement of 19 October 1989: Re-establishing Consular Relations Between Britain and Argentina, and Agreeing a Framework on Sovereignty Which Would Allow Further Talks |url= http://www.falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |website= Falklands info |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120517012555/http://falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |archive-date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina's claim to the territories was added to [[Constitution of Argentina|its constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/cuerpo1.php |title= Constitución Nacional |website= Argentine Senate |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040617152239/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/interes/constitucion/cuerpo1.php |archive-date=17 June 2004 |language= es |quote=La Nación Argentina ratifica su legítima e imprescriptible soberanía sobre las Islas Malvinas, Georgias del Sur y Sandwich del Sur y los espacios marítimos e insulares correspondientes, por ser parte integrante del territorio nacional. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lead-up to the conflict==
{{main|Events leading to the Falklands War}}

{{double image|left|Galtieri.jpg|180|Jorge Anaya.JPG|194|Lieutenant General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], leader of the [[National Reorganization Process|Argentine Junta]]|Admiral [[Jorge Anaya]] was the driving force in the Junta's decision to invade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = White | first = Rowland | title = Vulcan 607 | publisher=Bantam Press | year = 2006 | location = London | pages = 13–14 | isbn = 978-0-593-05392-8 |quote=The price for Anaya's blessing was approval for the navy's plan to seize Las Malvinas, the Falkland Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bicheno|2006|p=25}}: "A basic assumption underlying the conflict was that the British were, in the opinion of the war's main architect, Admiral Jorge Anaya, unworthy heirs to a glorious heritage, the men mainly ''maricones''...&amp;nbsp;to call a man a ''maricón'' does not question his heterosexuality; but it definitely impugns his physical and moral courage. Anaya was Naval Attaché in London from January 1975 to January 1976&amp;nbsp;... He returned to Argentina, making no attempt to conceal his contempt for all things British."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middlebrook|1989|p=1}}: "He was an ardent 'Malvinist'&amp;nbsp;... Anaya was enthusiastic, and his orders in the last days of 1981 were to set in train that tragic series of events."&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the period leading up to the war—and, in particular, following the transfer of power between the military dictators General [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] and General [[Roberto Eduardo Viola]] late in March 1981—Argentina had been in the midst of a devastating [[Economic history of Argentina#Stagnation|economic stagnation]] and large-scale [[Civil disorder|civil unrest]] against the [[Military dictatorship|military ''junta'']] that had been governing the country since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/arg060330mc |title=Argentina – the horrors of a dictatorial past live on – Radio Netherlands Worldwide – English |publisher=Radionetherlands.nl |date=30 March 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060910051640/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/arg060330mc |archivedate=10 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1981 there was a further change in the Argentine military regime, bringing to office a new ''junta'' headed by General [[Leopoldo Galtieri]] (acting president), Air Brigadier [[Basilio Lami Dozo]] and Admiral [[Jorge Anaya]]. Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the islands,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Oscar|last1= Kirschbaum | first2 = Roger | last2 =Van Der Kooy |first3=Eduardo |last3=Cardoso| title = Malvinas, La Trama Secreta | publisher=Sudamericana/Planeta | location = Buenos Aires | language=Spanish |year = 1983 | isbn = 978-950-37-0006-8 }} {{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; calculating that the United Kingdom would never respond militarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haig: "Malvinas fue mi Waterloo" |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/74556-haig-malvinas-fue-mi-waterloo |date=10 August 1997 |website=La Nación |accessdate=25 October 2010 |language=Spanish |quote={{lang|es|''¿Qué creía?''

I could never convince him that the British would not only fight back but also win [the war].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By opting for military action, the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long-standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands, and thus [[Diversionary foreign policy|divert public attention]] from the country's chronic economic problems and the regime's ongoing human rights violations of the [[Dirty War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |title=Ministerio de Educación, Ciencia y Tecnología de la Nación |format=PDF |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318112134/http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such action would also bolster its dwindling legitimacy. The newspaper ''[[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|La Prensa]]'' speculated in a step-by-step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands, ending in direct actions late in 1982, if the UN talks were fruitless.&lt;ref name="Jimmy Burns,1987"&gt;Jimmy Burns: ''The land that lost its heroes'', 1987, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7475-0002-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants (actually infiltrated by [[Argentine Marines|Argentine marines]]) raised the [[Flag of Argentina|Argentine flag]] at [[South Georgia Island]], an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portierramaryaire.com/arts/malvinas_1.php |title=''En Buenos Aires, la Junta comenzó a estudiar la posibilidad de ocupar las Islas Malvinas y Georgias antes de que los británicos pudieran reforzarlas'' |publisher=Portierramaryaire.com |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the Falkland Islands]] to be brought forward to 2 April.

The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands, despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain Nicholas Barker and others. Barker believed that Defence Secretary [[John Nott]]'s 1981 review (in which Nott described plans to withdraw the ''Endurance'', the UK's only naval presence in the South Atlantic) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling, and would soon be unable, to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harold|last=Briley|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-captain-nicholas-barker-1266075.html|title=Obituary: Captain Nicholas Barker|work=The Independent |location=UK|page=16|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-11982515.html |title=The high cost of cuts |work=The Spectator |accessdate=7 February 2010 |first=Correlli |last=Barnett |year=1997 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501154644/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-11982515.html |archivedate=1 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of the invasion included the landing of [[Lieutenant Commander]] Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' [[Amphibious Commandos Group]], the attack on Moody Brook barracks, the engagement between the troops of Hugo Santillan and Bill Trollope at [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and the final engagement and surrender at [[Government House (Falkland Islands)|Government House]].

Word of the invasion first reached the UK from Argentine sources.&lt;ref name=Margolis&gt;{{Cite news|last=Margolis |first=Laurie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6514011.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; How BBC man scooped invasion news |publisher=BBC News |date=2 April 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] operative in London had a short [[telex]] conversation with Governor Hunt's telex operator, who confirmed that Argentines were on the island and in control.&lt;ref name=Margolis/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Duncan"&gt;Duncan, Andrew, ''The Falklands War'', Marshall Cavendish Books Limited, {{ISBN|1-84415-429-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, [[BBC]] journalist [[Laurie Margolis]] spoke with an islander at [[Goose Green]] via [[amateur radio]], who confirmed the presence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken control of the island.&lt;ref name=Margolis/&gt; ''Operation Corporate'' was the codename given to the British military operations in the Falklands War. The commander of task force operations was Admiral Sir [[John Fieldhouse, Baron Fieldhouse|John Fieldhouse]].

The British undertook a series of military operations as a means of recapturing the Falklands from Argentine occupation. The British government had taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, the submarines {{HMS|Splendid|S106|6}} and {{HMS|Spartan|S105|6}} were ordered to sail south on 29 March, whereas the stores ship [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] (RFA) ''[[RFA Fort Austin (A386)|Fort Austin]]'' was dispatched from the Western Mediterranean to support HMS ''Endurance''.&lt;ref name="Freedman2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|2005a|pp=202–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Carrington had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments.&lt;ref name="Freedman2007"/&gt; Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine {{HMS|Superb|S109|6}} left [[Gibraltar]] and it was assumed in the press it was heading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before nuclear-powered submarines could be deployed.&lt;ref name="Freedman2007"/&gt;

The following day, during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sir [[Henry Leach]], advised them that "Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded". On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a [[Royal Navy]] force carrying out [[Military exercise|exercises]] in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the invasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an emergency session of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] the next day.&lt;ref name=falkislands&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=24 December 2011|publisher=Falkland Islands Information|title=A Chronology of events during the Falklands Conflict of 1982|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/82timeline.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327150403/http://www.falklands.info/history/82timeline.html|archivedate=27 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April, the British Government set up a [[War Cabinet#Falklands War, 1982|War Cabinet]] to provide day-to-day political oversight of the campaign.&lt;ref name="Freedman2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|pp=21–22}}: "day-to-day oversight was to be provided by&amp;nbsp;... which came to be known as the War Cabinet. This became the critical instrument of crisis management"&lt;/ref&gt; This was the critical instrument of crisis management for the British with its remit being to "keep under review political and military developments relating to the South Atlantic, and to report as necessary to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee". Until it was dissolved on 12 August, the War Cabinet met at least daily. Although Margaret Thatcher is described as dominating the War Cabinet, [[Lawrence Freedman]] notes in the ''Official History of the Falklands Campaign'' that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others. However, once a decision was reached she "did not look back".&lt;ref name="Freedman2005"/&gt;

===Position of third party countries===
On the evening of 3 April, the United Kingdom's United Nations ambassador Sir [[Anthony Parsons]] put a draft resolution to the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The resolution, which condemned the hostilities and demanded the immediate Argentine withdrawal from the Islands, was adopted by the council the following day as [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]], which passed with ten votes in support, one against (Panama) and four abstentions (China, the Soviet Union, Poland and Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Gold | title=Gibraltar, British or Spanish? | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;vq=Falklands&amp;pg=PA39 | page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Gold | title=Gibraltar, British or Spanish? | publisher=Routledge | year=2005 | isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC&amp;pg=PA37 | page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK received further political support from member countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[European Economic Community]]. The EEC also provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on Argentina.

The war was an unexpected event in a world strained by the [[Cold War]] and the [[North–South divide]]. The response of some countries was the effort to mediate the crisis and later as the war began, the support (or criticism) based in terms of anti-colonialism, political solidarity, historical relationships or [[realpolitik]].

The United States was concerned that a protracted conflict could draw the [[Soviet Union]] on Argentina's side,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/01/us-feared-falklands-war-documents | work=The Guardian | first=Julian | last=Borger | title=U.S. feared Falklands war would be 'close-run thing', documents reveal | date=1 April 2012 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through "[[Shuttle diplomacy]]". However, when Argentina refused the U.S. peace overtures, U.S. Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]] announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations. Both Houses of the [[U.S. Congress]] passed resolutions supporting the U.S. action siding with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard F. |last=Grimmett |url=https://fpc.state.gov/6172.htm#President_as_Initiator |title=Foreign Policy Roles of the President and Congress |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=1 June 1999 |accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands, and the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were available.&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=25 December 2011|publisher=Global Security|title=The Falkland Islands Conflict, 1982|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/HJA.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nuclear-powered submarine {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|2}} set sail from France on 4 April, whilst the two aircraft carriers {{HMS|Invincible|R05|2}} and {{HMS|Hermes|R12|2}}, in the company of escort vessels, left [[Portsmouth]] only a day later.&lt;ref name=falkislands/&gt; On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner {{SS|Canberra}} was requisitioned and set sail two days later with [[3 Commando Brigade]] aboard.&lt;ref name=falkislands/&gt; The ocean liner ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' was also requisitioned and left [[Southampton]] on 12 May with [[5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|5th Infantry Brigade]] on board.&lt;ref name=falkislands/&gt; The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 [[Royal Navy]] vessels, 22 [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary]] ships and 62 [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|merchant ships]].&lt;ref name=GS/&gt;

The retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult. The U.S. Navy considered a successful counter-invasion by the British "a military impossibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=72}} Cited in ''To Rule The Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World'' Herman, A (2004) [[Harper Collins]], New York, p. 560.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the British were significantly constrained by the disparity in deployable air cover.&lt;ref name="Freedman2005_air_threat"&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|loc=pp. 431–444 "During the course of May confidence that the naval threat was under control grew.

By mid-April, the [[Royal Air Force]] had set up the airbase of [[RAF Ascension Island]], co-located with Wideawake Airfield on the mid-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] British overseas territory of [[Ascension Island]], including a sizeable force of [[Avro Vulcan|Avro Vulcan B Mk 2]] bombers, [[Handley Page Victor|Handley Page Victor K Mk 2]] [[aerial refuelling|refuelling aircraft]], and [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2]] [[fighter aircraft|fighters]] to protect them. Meanwhile, the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active service. A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia.

Encounters began in April; the British Task Force was shadowed by [[Boeing 707]] aircraft of the [[Argentine Air Force]] during their travel to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/538-550/548/site/fotos/b707.gif |title=FAA map |accessdate=2007-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024064142/http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/538-550/548/site/fotos/b707.gif |archivedate=24 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British-imposed exclusion zone; the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force. On 23 April, a Brazilian commercial [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|Douglas DC-10]] from [[VARIG]] Airlines en route to South Africa was intercepted by British Harriers who visually identified the civilian plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1987|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on ''Santa Fe''===
The South Georgia force, ''[[Operation Paraquet]]'', under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from [[42 Commando]], a troop of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) and [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS) troops who were intended to land as [[reconnaissance]] forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines. All were embarked on {{ship|RFA|Tidespring|A75|6}}. First to arrive was the {{sclass-|Churchill|submarine}} HMS ''Conqueror'' on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping [[Handley Page Victor]] on 20 April.

The first landings of SAS troops took place on 21 April, but—with the southern hemisphere autumn setting in—the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog on [[Fortuna Glacier]]. On 23 April, a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted, with ''Tidespring'' being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception. On 24 April, the British forces regrouped and headed in to attack.

The Lynx launched a [[torpedo]], and [[strafing|strafed]] the submarine with its [[pintle]]-mounted [[L7 (machine gun)|general purpose machine gun]]; the Wessex also fired on ''Santa Fe'' with its [[General-purpose machine gun|GPMG]]. The Wasp from {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} as well as two other Wasps launched from {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} fired [[Aerospatiale SS.12/AS.12|AS-12]] [[Air-to-surface missile|ASM]] [[anti-ship missile|antiship missiles]] at the submarine, scoring hits. ''Santa Fe'' was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at [[King Edward Point]] on South Georgia.

With ''Tidespring'' now far out to sea, and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine's crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day. After a short forced march by the British troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels (''Antrim'' and ''Plymouth''), the Argentine forces surrendered without resistance. The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London was, "Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the [[White Ensign]] flies alongside the [[Union Jack]] in South Georgia. God Save the Queen." The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, broke the news to the media, telling them to "Just rejoice at that news, and congratulate our forces and the Marines!"&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;{{Cite news| title = 1982: Marines land in South Georgia |publisher=BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/25/newsid_2503000/2503977.stm | accessdate =20 June 2005 | date=25 April 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Buck raids===

On 1 May, British operations on the Falklands opened with the "Black Buck 1" attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley. A [[Avro Vulcan|Vulcan bomber]] from [[Ascension Island|Ascension]] flew on an {{convert|8000|nmi|adj=on}} round trip dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley and back to Ascension. The mission required repeated [[aerial refuelling|refuelling]], and required several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker to tanker refuelling. The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine, and the raids consumed precious tanker resources from Ascension,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2000|p=186}}: "...&amp;nbsp;to get twenty-one bombs to Port Stanley is going to take about one million, one hundred thousand pounds of fuel – equalled about {{formatnum:137000}} gallons. That was enough fuel to fly 260 Sea Harrier bombing missions over Port Stanley. Which in turn meant just over 1300 bombs. Interesting stuff!"&lt;/ref&gt; but also prevented Argentina from stationing fast jets on the islands.

The raids did minimal damage to the runway, and damage to radars was quickly repaired.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} {{As of|2014}} the Royal Air Force Web site stated that all the three bombing missions had been successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/OperationBlackBuck.cfm |title=Operation Black Buck |website=[[Royal Air Force]] |access-date=12 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214215009/http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/OperationBlackBuck.cfm |archive-date=14 February 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but historian [[Lawrence Freedman]], who had access to classified documents, said in a 2005 book that the subsequent bombing missions were failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|pp=296, 301, 631}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine sources said that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to withdraw some of its Mirage IIIs from Southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offensive Air Operations of the Falklands War |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/DWF.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |quote=As a result of these heavy losses&amp;nbsp;... it was decided to pull the Mirage III's back to the mainland to stand alert for a possible Vulcan attack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Falkland Islands Conflict, 1982: Air Defense of the Fleet |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/HJA.htm |work=Globalsecurity.org |quote= Finally, the bombing raids caused the Argentines to fear an air attack on the mainland, causing them to retain some Mirage aircraft and Roland missiles for defense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/520-528/520/mirage.htm |title=La familia Mirage |journal=Aeroespacio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531161152/http://www.aeroespacio.com.ar/site/anteriores/520-528/520/mirage.htm |archive-date=31 May 2011 | issn=0001-9127 |language=Spanish |quote="Los M III debían defender el territorio continental argentino de posibles ataques de los bombarderos Vulcan de la RAF, brindar escolta a los cazabombarderos de la FAA, e impedir los ataques de aviones de la Royal Navy y de la RAF sobre las Malvinas."&lt;br /&gt; ("The M III would defend the Argentine mainland against possible attacks by Vulcan bombers from the RAF, providing escort of fighter bombers to the FAA, and to prevent attacks by aircraft of the Royal Navy and RAF on the Falklands.") |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later described as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|2000|pp=247–48}}: "Propaganda was, of course, used later to try to justify these missions: 'The Mirage IIIs were redrawn from Southern Argentina to Buenos Aires to add to the defences there following the Vulcan raids on the islands.'

Of the five Black Buck raids, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the other two anti-radar missions using [[AGM-45 Shrike|Shrike]] [[anti-radiation missile]]s.

===Escalation of the air war===
[[File:Super Etendard ARA 204.jpg|thumb|French-built [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Super Étendard]] of the [[Argentine Naval Aviation]]]]
The Falklands had only three airfields. The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and even that was too short to support fast jets (although an [[Arresting gear|arrestor gear]] was fitted in April to support Skyhawks). Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, [[combat air patrol]]s, and [[close air support]] over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.

The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ([[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]], [[IAI Nesher|IAI Daggers]], [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the Islands and by using a late [[Toss bombing|pop up]] profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by [[BAE Sea Harrier]]s operating from {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}. A Dagger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2002/05/01/argentine-air-force-remembers-its-baptism-of-fire-twenty-years-on |title=Argentine Air Force remembers its "baptism of fire" twenty years on |publisher=En.mercopress.com |date=1 May 2002 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Canberra were shot down.

Combat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air Squadron and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down by an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland air base. The plane made for Stanley, where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rodríguez Mottino |first=Horacio |date=1984 |title=La artillería argentina en Malvinas |language=Spanish |publisher=Editorial Clio |isbn=978-9509377028 |page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this experience, Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ A-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units, the Canberras only during the night, and Mirage IIIs (without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM) as decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers. The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the [[Escuadrón Fénix]], a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours-a-day simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet. On one of these flights on 7 June, an Air Force [[Learjet 35|Learjet 35A]] was shot down, killing the squadron commander, Vice Commodore Rodolfo De La Colina, the highest-ranking Argentine officer to die in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/caidos/baja01.html |title=Rodolfo Manuel de la Colina |website=[[Fuerza Aérea Argentina]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=12 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007131156/http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/caidos/baja01.html |archivedate=7 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madryn.gov.ar/noticias.php?newsid=3213 |title=Noticias Municipales &amp;#124; Puerto Madryn |publisher=Madryn.gov.ar |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415012750/http://www.madryn.gov.ar/noticias.php?newsid=3213 |archivedate=15 April 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stanley was used as an Argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict. Despite the Black Buck and Harrier raids on Stanley airfield (no fast jets were stationed there for air defence) and overnight shelling by detached ships, it was never out of action entirely. Stanley was defended by a mixture of [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) systems (Franco-German [[Roland (missile)|Roland]] and British [[Sea Cat|Tigercat]]) and Swiss-built [[Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon|Oerlikon 35 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons]]. [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed Hercules]] transport night flights brought supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict.

The only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when TC-63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/dias/jun01.html |title=Fuerza Aérea Argentina |publisher=Fuerzaaerea.mil.ar |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430100836/http://www.fuerzaaerea.mil.ar/conflicto/dias/jun01.html |archivedate=30 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19820601-0&amp;lang=en |title=ASN Aircraft accident description Lockheed C-130H Hercules TC-63 – Pebble Island |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was searching for the British fleet north-east of the islands after the Argentine Navy retired its last [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|SP-2H Neptune]] due to airframe attrition.

Various options to attack the home base of the five Argentine [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Etendards]] at [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego|Río Grande]] were examined and discounted ([[Operation Mikado]]), subsequently five Royal Navy submarines lined up, submerged, on the edge of Argentina's {{convert|12|nmi|adj=on}} territorial limit to provide early warning of bombing raids on the British task force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=Evans |title=Underwater and undercover: how nuclear subs were first line of Falklands defence |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2950936.ece |work=The Times |location=London |date=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sinking of ARA ''General Belgrano''===
[[File:ARA Belgrano 1982.PNG|thumb|right|ARA ''General Belgrano'', sinking]]
[[File:ARA Alférez Sobral (A-9).jpg|thumb|right|''Alferez Sobral'']]
Two British naval task forces (one of surface vessels and one of submarines) and the Argentine fleet were operating in the neighbourhood of the Falklands and soon came into conflict. The first naval loss was the [[World War II|Second World War]]-vintage Argentine [[light cruiser]] {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano}}. The [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank ''General Belgrano'' on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-three members of ''General Belgrano''{{'}}s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The losses from ''General Belgrano'' totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government.

Regardless of [[ARA General Belgrano#Controversy over the sinking|controversies over the sinking]]—including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether ''General Belgrano'' had been returning to port at the time of the sinking—it had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the conventional submarine {{ship|ARA|San Luis|S-32|6}},&lt;ref name="handle.dtic.mil"/&gt; returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. The two escorting [[destroyer]]s and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} both withdrew from the area, ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their [[pincer movement]] had represented.

However, settling the controversy in 2003, the ship's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that ''General Belgrano'' had actually been manoeuvering, not "sailing away" from the exclusion zone, and had  orders to sink "any British ship he could find". Further, Captain Bonzo stated that any suggestion that HMS ''Conqueror''{{'s}} actions were a "betrayal" was utterly wrong; rather, the submarine carried out its duties according to the accepted rules of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/may/25/uk.world|website=[[The Guardian]]|title=Belgrano crew 'trigger happy'|author=Peter Beaumont|date=25 May 2003|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the {{ship|ARA|Alferez Sobral|A-9|6}}, that was searching for the crew of the Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters fired four [[Sea Skua]] missiles at her. Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, ''Alferez Sobral'' managed to return to [[Puerto Deseado]] two days later. The Canberra's crew were never found.

===Sinking of HMS ''Sheffield''===
[[File:HMS Sheffield (D80).jpg|thumb|right|HMS ''Sheffield'']]
On 4 May, two days after the sinking of ''General Belgrano'', the British lost the [[Type 42 destroyer]] {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|6}} to fire following an [[Exocet]] missile strike from the Argentine [[2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque|2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron]].
''Sheffield'' had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile [[picket (military)|picket]] far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She finally sank outside the [[Total Exclusion Zone|Maritime Exclusion Zone]] on 10 May.

The incident is described in detail by Admiral [[Sandy Woodward]] in his book ''One Hundred Days'', in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of ''Sheffield''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of ''Sheffield'' (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War) had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the "Falklands Crisis", as the [[BBC News]] put it, was now an actual "shooting war".

The tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentinians. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General [[Pérez de Cuéllar]] on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous "red-line" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentinian forces, as supported by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]]. Instead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentinian and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to "[[self-determination]]" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography'' (2013) Volume 1, pp. 726–728&lt;/ref&gt;

===British special forces operations===
Given the threat to the British fleet posed by the Etendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some [[Special Air Service|SAS]] troops to attack the home base of the five Etendards at [[Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego]]. The operation was codenamed "[[Operation Mikado|Mikado]]". The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine {{HMS|Onyx|S21|6}} to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/articles/sas-versus-exocets.php#prof |title=The SAS vs the Exocet |publisher=eliteukforces.info |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration. A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from HMS ''Invincible'' on the night of 17 May, but bad weather forced it to land {{convert|50|mi|km}} from its target and the mission was aborted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1= Michael |last1=Evans |first2=Alan |last2=Hamilton |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article537842.ece |title=Thatcher in the dark on sinking of Belgrano |journal=The Times |date=27 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot flew to [[Chile]], landed south of [[Punta Arenas]], and dropped off the SAS team. The helicopter's crew of three then destroyed the aircraft, surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May, and were repatriated to the UK after interrogation. The discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted considerable international attention. Meanwhile, the SAS team crossed the border and penetrated into Argentina, but cancelled their mission after the Argentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some {{formatnum:2000}} troops to search for them. The SAS men were able to return to Chile, and took a civilian flight back to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sasspecialairservice.com/sas-falklands-war-argentina.html|title=British Special Air Service SAS - The Falklands - Operation Corporate|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May the SAS carried out a [[raid on Pebble Island]] on the Falklands, where the Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip &lt;sup&gt;[https://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&amp;q=-51.308889,-59.610278&amp;ll=-51.308887,-59.610271&amp;spn=0.022964,0.055189&amp;z=14 map]&lt;/sup&gt; for [[FMA IA 58 Pucará]] light ground-attack aircraft and [[Beechcraft T-34 Mentor]]s, which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft.{{refn|6 Pucaras, 4 T-34 Mentor and 1 Short Skyvan|group=nb}}

===Landing at San Carlos – Bomb Alley===

[[File:Action stations Falklands 1982.JPG|thumb|right|upright|British sailors in [[anti-flash gear]] at action stations on {{HMS|Cardiff|D108|6}} near San Carlos, June 1982.]]
During the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore Michael Clapp (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted ''[[Operation Sutton]]'', the amphibious landing on beaches around [[San Carlos Water]],{{refn|{{map-loc|showname=Bomb Alley|locality1=San Carlos Water|locality2=Falkland Islands|section=#Landing at San Carlos—Bomb Alley}}|group=nb}} on the northwestern coast of [[East Falkland]] facing onto [[Falkland Sound]]. The bay, known as ''Bomb Alley'' by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Yates | first = David | title = Bomb Alley – Falkland Islands 1982 | publisher=Pen and Sword | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-84415-417-3 }}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/297414.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Charles ends Falklands tour on sombre note |publisher=BBC News |date=15 March 1999 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{formatnum:4000}} men of [[3 Commando Brigade]] were put ashore as follows: [[2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (2 Para) from the [[RORO]] ferry ''[[Norland (ferry)|Norland]]'' and [[40 Commando]] [[Royal Marines]] from the amphibious ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} were landed at San Carlos (Blue Beach), [[3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment]] (3 Para) from the amphibious ship {{HMS|Intrepid|L11|6}} was landed at [[Port San Carlos]] (Green Beach) and [[45 Commando]] from [[RFA Stromness (A344)|RFA ''Stromness'']] was landed at [[Ajax Bay]] (Red Beach). Notably, the waves of eight [[Landing Craft Utility|LCUs]] and eight [[Landing craft of the Royal Marines#LCVP Mk2|LCVPs]] were led by Major [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]], who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979. [[42 Commando]] on the ocean liner {{SS|Canberra}} was a tactical reserve. Units from the [[Royal Artillery]], [[Royal Engineers]], etc. and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft, the [[Round Table class landing ship logistics|Round Table class]] [[Landing Ship Logistics|LSL]] and [[mexeflote]] barges. [[Rapier missile]] launchers were carried as underslung loads of [[Westland Sea King|Sea Kings]] for rapid deployment.

By dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations. From there, [[Brigadier]] [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]]'s plan was to capture [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Goose Green]] before turning towards Port Stanley. Now, with the British troops on the ground, the [[Argentine Air Force]] began the night bombing campaign against them using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).

[[File:HMS Antelope 1982.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} smoking after being hit, 23 May]]
[[File:HMS Coventry D118.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}}]]
At sea, the paucity of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of {{HMS|Ardent|F184|6}} on 21 May, {{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} on 24 May, and {{ship|MV|Atlantic Conveyor}} (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May along with a vital cargo of [[helicopter]]s, runway-building equipment and tents. The loss of all but one of the [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook]] helicopters being carried by the Atlantic Conveyor was a severe blow from a logistical perspective.

Also lost on this day was {{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}}, a sister to {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|2}}, whilst in company with {{HMS|Broadsword|F88|6}} after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Rumley |first=Leesa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6705387.stm |title=Captain Hart Dyke, Commanding Officer of HMS ''Coventry'' |publisher=BBC News |date=1 June 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{HMS|Argonaut|F56|6}} and {{HMS|Brilliant|F90|6}} were badly damaged. However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of weaknesses of the Argentine pilots' bombing tactics described below.

To avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released ordnance from very low altitude, and hence their bomb [[fuze]]s&lt;!--For anyone tempted to correct the "mis-spelling", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance --&gt; did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the [[retarded bomb]]s (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves.

A simple free-fall bomb in a low altitude release, impacts almost directly below the aircraft, which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion. A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft. The &lt;!--For anyone tempted to correct the "mis-spelling", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance --&gt;fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation. The pilots would have been aware of this—but due to the high concentration required to avoid [[Surface-to-air missiles|SAMs]], [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] (AAA), and British [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]], many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised [[Gravity bomb|retarding devices]], allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.

In his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the [[BBC World Service]] for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being "fearless seekers after truth" than with the lives of British servicemen.&lt;ref name="Woodward"&gt;{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel [['H'. Jones]] levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they disclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para.

Thirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-history.net/F62brshipslost.htm |title=British Ships Sunk and Damaged – Falklands War 1982 |publisher=Naval-history.net |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Craig, Baron Craig of Radley|Lord Craig]], the retired [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]], is said to have remarked: "Six better {{sic|fuses|hide=y|nolink=y}} and we would have lost"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=291&amp;id=365372002|title=Would British forces be able to retake the Falklands today?|date=5 April 2002|work=The Scotsman |location=UK|archiveurl=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_dat=xri:pqil:res_ver=0.2&amp;res_id=xri:newsuk&amp;rft_id=xri:newsuk:newsart:112991016|archivedate=5 April 2002|subscription=yes|page=12|author=Gethin Chamberlain}}&lt;/ref&gt; although ''Ardent'' and ''Antelope'' were both lost despite the failure of bombs to explode.

From early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para, (approximately 500 men) with naval gunfire support from {{HMS|Arrow|F173|6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/apr/09/guardianobituaries.falklands|newspaper=Guardian |title=Captain Paul Bootherstone obituary|date=9 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery, Royal Artillery, approached and attacked [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Goose Green]], which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment.
After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 17 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed. In total 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the ''Condor'' airfield) were taken prisoner.

The BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the [[BBC World Service]] before it had actually happened. It was during this attack that [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[H. Jones]], the commanding officer of 2 Para, was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well-prepared Argentine positions. He was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].

With the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a [[loaded march]] across [[East Falkland]] towards the coastal settlement of [[Teal Inlet]].

===Special forces on Mount Kent===
Meanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent.{{refn|{{map-loc|name=Mount Kent|locality1=Mount Kent|locality2=Falkland Islands|section=#Special forces on Mount Kent}}|group=nb}} Unknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] surface-to-air missiles and [[commando]]s (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. This operation was known as Operation ''Autoimpuesta'' ("Self-determination initiative").

For the next week, the SAS and the [[Mountain Leader Training Cadre|Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre]] (M&amp;AWC) of [[3 Commando Brigade]] waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers' 602nd Commando Company under Major [[Aldo Rico]], normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier ''XZ963'', flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook—in responding to a call for help from D Squadron, attacked Mount Kent's eastern lower slopes, and that led to its loss through small-arms fire. Pook was subsequently awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=49134 |supp=y |page=12854 |date=8 October 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine Navy used their last AM39 Exocet missile attempting to attack {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} on 30 May. There are Argentine claims that the missile struck;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/Exocet.html |title=Argentine Aircraft in the Falklands |publisher=Britains-smallwars.com |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223051413/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/Exocet.html |archivedate=23 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skyhawk.org/2e/argentina/argentina-af4th5th.htm |title=Argentine Air Force – Group 5 |publisher=Skyhawk.org |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509160423/http://www.skyhawk.org/2e/argentina/argentina-af4th5th.htm |archivedate=9 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the British have denied this, some citing that {{HMS|Avenger|F185|6}} shot it down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.operationcorporate.com/p1_equipment_super_etendard.php |title=Super Etendard |publisher=Operationcorporate.com |date=29 May 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HMS Yarmouth, Captains Diary|url=http://www.hms-yarmouth.com/falklands/captains%20diary.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321152518/http://www.hms-yarmouth.com/falklands/captains%20diary.htm |archivedate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When ''Invincible'' returned to the UK after the war, she showed no signs of missile damage.

On 31 May, the M&amp;AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the [[skirmish at Top Malo House]]. A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain José Vercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed {{convert|200|m|ft|-2}} from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&amp;AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.

Three Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two dead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were posthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left unscathed. As the British mopped up Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow's M&amp;AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large [[Union Flag]]. One wounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow's position.

601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain. Spotted by 42 Commando, they were engaged with [[L16 81mm mortar]]s and forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain. The leader of 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/David/kent2.html |title=The Argentine Commandos on Mount Kent |publisher=Britains-smallwars.com |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328175325/http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Falklands/David/kent2.html |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols; the [[601 Assault Helicopter Battalion|601st Combat Aviation Battalion]] also suffered casualties. At about 11:00&amp;nbsp;am on 30 May, an [[Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma]] helicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched [[FIM-92 Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six [[Argentine National Gendarmerie]] Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2002/04/12/argentine-puma-shot-down-by-american-stinger-missile#prof |title=Argentine Puma Shot Down By American "Stinger" Missile |publisher=En.mercopress.com |date=12 April 2002 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Brigadier Thompson commented, "It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by [[Northwood HQ]] that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before de-planing and, in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters."&lt;ref name="NoPicnic"&gt;Julian Thompson, ''No Picnic'', p. 93, Cassell &amp; Co, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluff Cove and Fitzroy===
{{Main|Bluff Cove Air Attacks}}

By 1 June, with the arrival of a further {{formatnum:5000}} British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade,&lt;!-- landed at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] from {{SS|Canberra|2}}, ''[[Norland]]'' and ''Stromness'' having transferred from the liner [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''Q.E.II'']] at [[South Georgia Island]] --&gt; the new British divisional commander, Major General [[Jeremy Moore]] RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the [[Welsh Guards]] on [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] and [[RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including, famously, [[Simon Weston]].&lt;ref&gt;Rick Jolly, ''The Red &amp; Green Life Machine'', p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army [[Westland Scout]] helicopters. Telephoning ahead to [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]], they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|RAF Chinook]] helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and [[Bluff Cove]] (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).

This uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with a {{convert|30|mi|km}} string of indefensible positions on their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.

Plans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the [[Landing Ship Logistics]] (LSL) ''Sir Tristram'' and the [[amphibious transport dock|landing platform dock]] (LPD) ''Intrepid'' on the night of 5 June. ''Intrepid'' was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of ''Sir Tristram'' as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which ''Sir Tristram'' would be left to unload using a [[Mexeflote]] (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.

Political pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Clapp to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, ''Intrepid''{{'}}s [[landing craft]] would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with ''Intrepid'' and her sister ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.

The attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when ''Fearless'' dispatched her landing craft. ''Sir Tristram'' sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by ''Sir Galahad'' at dawn on 7 June. Anchored {{convert|1200|ft|m}} apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.

The landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine [[combat engineering|combat engineers]]) to their destination, a journey of around {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}}.

On ''Sir Galahad''{{'}}s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board ''Sir Galahad'' of the [[Royal Engineer]] Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] and may have been overconfident in the air defences. [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]] gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach, the order was ignored.&lt;ref name="SouthbyTailyour1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewen Southby-Tailyour|title=Reasons in Writing: A Commando's View of the Falklands War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NWkAwAAQBAJ|date=31 December 1990|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-014-4|page=297}} ''"It was clear that I was achieving nothing and so, in desperation, I gave a direct order for the infantry to get ashore with or without their kit in order that we could get on with unloading Sir Tristram.&lt;br /&gt;  The officers ignored my order. In doing so they explained to me quite clearly that no orders would be accepted from an officer of equivalent rank."''&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]].

The disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed [[Royal Navy|Navy]] helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.

He expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the British assault to stall.

===Fall of Stanley===

[[File:Stanley.falklands.war.svg|thumb|upright=2.2|The road to Stanley]]
[[File:Argentine prisoners of war - Port Stanley.JPG|thumb|right|Argentine prisoners of war – Port Stanley]]
On the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the [[Battle of Mount Harriet]], [[Battle of Two Sisters]], and [[Battle of Mount Longdon]]. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and [[friendly fire]], but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by assault rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery fire, sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.

During this battle, 13 were killed when {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}}, straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based [[Exocet]] MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer {{ship|ARA|Seguí|D-25|6}} by Argentine Navy technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzasnavales.com/itb.html |title=An interview with CL (R) Ing.

After a night of fierce fighting, all objectives were secured. Both sides suffered heavy losses.

The night of 13 June saw the start of the second phase of attacks, in which the momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para, with light armour support from the [[Blues and Royals]], [[Battle of Wireless Ridge|captured Wireless Ridge]], with the loss of 3 British and 25 Argentine lives, and the 2nd battalion, [[Scots Guards]] captured Mount Tumbledown at the [[Battle of Mount Tumbledown]], which cost 10 British and 30 Argentine lives.
[[File:Discarded weapons, Stanley 1982.JPG|thumb|A pile of discarded Argentine weapons in Port Stanley]]
With the last natural defence line at [[Mount Tumbledown]] breached, the Argentine town defences of [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and "if a [[kelpers|Kelper]] resists, shoot him", but the entire company did nothing of the kind.&lt;ref name="fn_4"&gt;{{harvnb|Hastings|Jenkins|1984|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ceasefire was declared on 14 June and the commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, Brigade General Mario Menéndez, surrendered to Major General Jeremy Moore the same day.

==Recapture of South Sandwich Islands==
{{Main|Operation Keyhole}}
[[File:Thule1981.jpg|thumb|The Argentine Thule Garrison at the Corbeta Uruguay base]]
On 20 June, the British retook the [[South Sandwich Islands]], which involved accepting the surrender of the [[Southern Thule]] Garrison at the [[Corbeta Uruguay]] base, and declared hostilities over. Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://issuu.com/navynews/docs/198208|title=The race to regain Thule|newspaper=Navy News p.21|date=July 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1st battalion/[[7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles]] lost one man.

Two more British deaths may be attributed to Operation Corporate, bringing the total to 260:

On the Argentine side beside the Military Hospital at Port Stanley, the [[Argentine Air Force Mobile Field Hospital]] was deployed at [[Comodoro Rivadavia]].

===Red Cross Box===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}

Before British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box ({{coord|48|30|S|53|45|W|scale:10000000}}), about {{convert|45|mi|km}} north of [[Falkland Sound]]. Ultimately, the British stationed four ships ({{HMS|Hydra|A144|6}}, {{HMS|Hecla|A133|6}} and {{HMS|Herald|H138|6}} and the primary hospital ship [[SS Uganda (1952)|SS ''Uganda'']]) within the box, while the Argentines stationed three ({{ship|ARA|Almirante Irízar|Q-5|6}}, ''Bahia Paraiso'' and {{ship|ARA|Puerto Deseado|Q-20|2}}).

[[File:HMS Hecla 1982 Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|''Hecla'' at HM Naval Base Gibraltar, during conversion to a hospital ship for service during the Falklands War]]
The hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships. The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and ''Uganda'' was a passenger liner. ''Almirante Irizar'' was an icebreaker, ''Bahia Paraiso'' was an Antarctic supply transport and ''Puerto Deseado'' was a survey ship. The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the ''Uganda'' on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship. The British naval hospital ships operated as casualty ferries, carrying casualties from both sides from the Falklands to ''Uganda'' and operating a shuttle service between the Red Cross Box and Montevideo.

Throughout the conflict officials of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions. On 12 June, some personnel were transferred from the Argentine hospital ship to the British ships by helicopter. Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]].

===British casualty evacuation===
''Hydra'' worked with ''Hecla'' and ''Herald'', to take casualties from ''Uganda'' to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them. [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[VC10]] aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the [[RAF Princess Alexandra Hospital|Princess Alexandra Hospital]] at [[RAF Wroughton]], near [[Swindon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natowatch.org/node/1558|title=NATO's Ebola 'capability gap': where are the hospital ships?|last=Davis|first=Ian|date=17 October 2014|website=NATO Watch|publisher=NATO|access-date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

This brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large [[materiel]] loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.

In the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher's popularity increased. The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, who had been trailing behind the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following year's [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|general election]] by a landslide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |title= 1983: Thatcher triumphs again |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 June 2010 | date=5 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.

The islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.

In Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a [[Beagle conflict|possible war with Chile]] was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the "moral reserve of the nation" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.

Various figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed [[suicide]] since the war. Some studies have estimated that 264 British veterans and 350–500 Argentine veterans have committed suicide since 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-94492/Suicide-Falklands-veterans.html | work=Daily Mail | first1=Alun | last1=Rees | title=Suicide of Falklands veterans | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Suicide after leaving the UK armed forces—a cohort study|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000026 |year=2009|editor1-last=Hotopf|editor1-first=Matthew|last1=Kapur|first1=Navneet|last2=While|first2=David|last3=Blatchley|first3=Nick|last4=Bray|first4=Isabelle|last5=Harrison|first5=Kate|journal=PLoS Medicine|volume=6|issue=3|pages=e26|pmid=19260757|pmc=2650723}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/4/edicion_664/contenidos/noticia_0017.html |title=Edición Impresa &amp;#124; Una fecha trágica de nuestra historia |publisher=Perfil.com |date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=3 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501233745/http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/4/edicion_664/contenidos/noticia_0017.html |archive-date=1 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a detailed study&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/causes-of-deaths-among-the-uk-armed-forces-veterans-of-the-1982-falklands-campaign A study of deaths among UK Armed Forces personnel deployed to the 1982 Falklands Campaign: 1982 to 2012] published: 14 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; of {{formatnum:21432}} British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that only 95 had died from "intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides and open verdict deaths)", a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/defence-and-security-blog/2013/may/14/falklands-veterans-suicide-army |title=Falklands war: new study debunks claims of high suicide rates |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=12 July 2013 | date=14 May 2013 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military analysis===
Militarily, the Falklands conflict remains the largest air-naval combat operation between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant "lessons learned" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.

In 1986, the [[BBC]] broadcast the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme, ''In the Wake of HMS Sheffield'', which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as [[stealth ship]]s and [[close-in weapon system]]s.

===Memorials===
There are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the [[1982 Liberation Memorial]], unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war. It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking [[Stanley Harbour]]. The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words "In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us".&lt;ref name="FITB"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.falklandislands.com/things-to-do/1982-liberation-memorial-p673571|title=1982 Liberation Memorial - Things to Do in the Falkland Islands|website=www.falklandislands.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to memorials on the islands, there is a memorial in the crypt of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London to the British war dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stpauls.co.uk/page.aspx?theLang=001lngdef&amp;pointerid=33482Ddydm53CFIDyVPL1jOMfZOSZUUk |title=Lady Thatcher marks Falklands anniversary at St Paul's |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303174702/http://www.stpauls.co.uk/page.aspx?theLang=001lngdef&amp;pointerid=33482Ddydm53CFIDyVPL1jOMfZOSZUUk |archivedate=3 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel]] at [[Pangbourne College]] was opened in March 2000 as a commemoration of the lives and sacrifice of all those who served and died in the South Atlantic in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands-chapel.org.uk/about-the-chapel/|title=About the Chapel|website=The Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel website  |access-date=12 June 2016|quote=The Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel at Pangbourne College has been built to commemorate the lives and sacrifice of all those who died in the South Atlantic in 1982 – to stand as a permanent and ‘living’ memorial to remember them – and the courage of the thousands of Servicemen and women who served with them to protect the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands|date=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Argentina, there is a memorial at [[Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martín]] in Buenos Aires,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregoryferdinandsen.com/EZE2001/Falklands_Memorial.htm |title=Falklands (Las Malvinas) War Memorial Wall |accessdate=16 July 2007|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716141025/http://www.gregoryferdinandsen.com/EZE2001/Falklands_Memorial.htm |archivedate=16 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:File:Malvinas, por siempre argentinas 1.jpg|another one]] in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], and [[:File:UshuaiaFalklandsWarVictimsMonument.jpg|a third one]] in [[Ushuaia]].

During the war, British dead were put into plastic [[body bag]]s and buried in mass graves. After the war, the bodies were recovered; 14 were reburied at [[Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos|Blue Beach Military Cemetery]] and 64 were returned to the UK.

Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the [[Argentine Military Cemetery]] west of the Darwin Settlement. The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=1982 Falklands |episodelink= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007t0w9 |accessdate=20 October 2011 |series=20th Century Battlefields |serieslink=|credits=Peter Snow, Dan Snow |network=BBC |station= BBC Two|city= |airdate=16 July 2008 |quote="After the war the British government offered to return the bodies of the Argentinian dead to Argentina for burial, but their government refused.

===Minefields===
[[File:Falklands-Minefield.JPG|thumb|Although some [[minefield]]s have been cleared, a substantial number of them still exist in the islands, such as this one at [[Port William, Falkland Islands|Port William]] on [[East Falkland]].]]
{{as of|2011}}, there were 113 uncleared minefields on the Falkland Islands and [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXOs) covering an area of {{convert|13|sqkm|abbr=on}}. Of this area, {{convert|5.5|sqkm|abbr=on}} on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being "suspected minefields"—the area had been heavily pastured for the previous 25 years without incident. It was estimated that these minefields had {{formatnum:20000}} anti-personnel mines and {{formatnum:5000}} anti-tank mines. No human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported in the Falkland Islands since 1984, and no civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands. The UK reported six military personnel were injured in 1982 and a further two injured in 1983. Most military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the immediate aftermath of the 1982 conflict or in the process of trying to establish the extent of the minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed.

On 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands "present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands," and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However, the British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] has a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/2282

==Press and publicity==

===Argentina===
[[File:Gentemayo1982.jpg|thumb|''Gente''{{'}}s "Estamos ganando" headline ("We're winning")]]
Selected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war. Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines faithfully reported on "the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes".&lt;ref name="Jimmy Burns,1987"/&gt;

Officers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and 'leaked' information confirming the official communiqués from the government. The glossy magazines ''Gente'' and ''[[Siete Días]]'' swelled to 60 pages with colour photographs of British warships in flames—many of them faked—and bogus eyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos' guerrilla war on South Georgia (6 May) and an already dead Pucará pilot's attack on HMS ''Hermes''&lt;ref name="Jimmy Burns,1987"/&gt; (Lt. Daniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air strike on 1 May). Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press. One of the best remembered headlines was "Estamos ganando" ("We're winning") from the magazine ''Gente'', that would later use variations of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/20414/ El periodismo argentino y su papel en la Guerra de Malvinas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706082632/http://www.minutouno.com.ar/minutouno/nota/20414/ |date=6 July 2011 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read ''Gaceta Argentina''—a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen. Some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Middlebrook|1989|p=94}}: "First of May. Menéndez ordered the publication of a newspaper for the troops on the Falkland Islands called ''Gaceta Argentina''. It stated that one of the Mirages lost on 1 May had collided with a Sea Harrier and the Argentine pilot survived. In fact Argentine AAA at Stanley shot down the Mirage when it tried an emergency landing there. It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane. Similarly, the junta's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic, who actually was killed in his Pucará on the ground at Goose Green, had perished in a gallant, single-handed Pucará attack on HMS ''Hermes'', setting it on fire. This statement was illustrated with dramatic sketches. The men at Goose Green knew that Lieutenant Jukic had died on the ground there.&lt;br /&gt;
''Gaceta Argentina'' summed up the British losses up to 25 May as: 5 warship sunk (correct number 3), 3 transport ships including SS ''Canberra'' (1; ''Atlantic Conveyor''), 14 Sea Harriers (2 shot down &amp; 3 accidents) and many ships damaged, including HMS ''Hermes''. ''Gaceta Argentina'' even wrote: 'All of these details refer only to proven claims and not to estimated or unproven claims&amp;nbsp;...'."&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Malvinas cause'' united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics, and even opponents of the military government supported Galtieri; [[Ernesto Sabato]] said: "Don't be mistaken, Europe; it is not a dictatorship who is fighting for the Malvinas, it is the whole Nation. Opponents of the military dictatorship, like me, are fighting to extirpate the last trace of colonialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title={{Title missing}} |language=Spanish |quote={{lang|es|No se engañen en Europa.

HMS ''Invincible'' was repeatedly sunk in the Argentine press,&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1983}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 30 April 1982 the Argentine magazine ''Tal Cual'' showed Prime Minister Thatcher with an eyepatch and the text: ''Pirate, witch and assassin. Guilty!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Thatcher portrayed as a pirate, 30&amp;nbsp;April 1982. |work=Science and Society Picture Library |url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10438336&amp;wwwflag=2&amp;imagepos=12 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three British reporters sent to Argentina to cover the war from the Argentine perspective were jailed until the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ian |last=Mather |url=https://www.theguardian.com/falklands/story/0,,2047324,00.html |title=I went as a reporter but ended up a prisoner of war |work=The Observer | location=London |date=1 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:The Sun (Gotcha).png|thumb|''The Sun''{{'}}s infamous [[Gotcha (headline)|"Gotcha" headline]]]]
Seventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war. The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media.
The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]], who was serving in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, "two journalists on ''Invincible'' were interested in no issue other than what Prince Andrew, a helicopter pilot as well as the Queen's son, was up to".&lt;/ref&gt; The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including [[Anti-Surface Warfare|anti-surface warfare]], [[Exocet missile]] decoy and casualty evacuation.

Merchant vessels had the civilian [[Inmarsat]] uplink, which enabled written [[Teletypewriter message|telex]] and voice report transmissions via satellite. {{SS|Canberra}} had a [[fax|facsimile machine]] that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the course of the war. The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the U.S. [[Defense Satellite Communications System]] for worldwide communications. Television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone, but the Ministry of Defence was unsuccessful in convincing the U.S. to allocate more bandwidth.&lt;ref name="Freedman"&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|2005b|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TV producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted; since the [[Vietnam War]] television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value. However, the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per 20 minutes—and only if the military satellites were allocated 100% to television transmissions. Videotapes were shipped to Ascension Island, where a broadband satellite uplink was available, resulting in TV coverage being delayed by three weeks.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;

The press was very dependent on the Royal Navy, and was [[censorship|censored]] on site. Many reporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task Force.&lt;ref name="Freedman"/&gt;

The Royal Navy expected [[Fleet Street]] to conduct a Second World War-style positive news campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1983}}: "You must have been told you couldn't report bad news&amp;nbsp;... You were expected to do a 1940 propaganda job."{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the majority of the British media, especially the BBC, reported the war in a neutral fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hastings|Jenkins|1984}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reporters referred to "the British troops" and "the Argentinian troops" instead of "our lads" and the "Argies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/F/falklands/imagesofwar.html |title=When Britain Went to War |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints: ''[[Daily Mirror|The Daily Mirror]]'' was decidedly anti-war, whilst ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' became well known for headlines such as "Stick It Up Your Junta!," which, along with the reporting in other tabloids,&lt;ref name="Dawn"/&gt; led to accusations of xenophobia&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/280_630.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/669kzwqPd?url=http://www.psa.ac.uk/journals/pdf/5/2010/280_630.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=9 February 2011 |author=Dawn Fowler |title=Margaret Thatcher And Falklands War Drama |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McKenzie"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/feb/25/pressandpublishing.falklands |accessdate=9 February 2011 |work=The Guardian |title=A new Britain, a new kind of newspaper |date=25 February 2002 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[jingoism]].&lt;ref name=Harris /&gt;

==Cultural impact==
{{main|Cultural impact of the Falklands War}}

There were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present. The Argentine writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] described the war as "a fight between two bald men over a comb".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/19/falkland-islands-editorial|title=Falkland Islands: Imperial pride|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=2 October 2014|date=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''[[yomp]]'' and ''[[Exocet]]'' entered the British vernacular as a result of the war. The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians. In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockenespanol.about.com/od/rockypolitica/a/Malvinas-El-Curioso-Renacer-Del-Rock-Argentino.htm|title=Malvinas, el curioso renacer del rock argentino|author=Por MATIAS QUEROL|work=About|accessdate=2 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608015717/http://rockenespanol.about.com/od/rockypolitica/a/Malvinas-El-Curioso-Renacer-Del-Rock-Argentino.htm|archivedate=8 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fran Zwitter .jpg|thumb|Fran Zwitter]]
'''Fran Zwitter''' (24 October 1905 – 14 April 1988) was a [[Slovenia]]n historian. Together with [[Milko Kos]], [[Bogo Grafenauer]], and [[Vasilij Melik]], he is considered the co-founder of the [[Ljubljana school of historiography]].

== Life and work ==

He was born in the village of Bela Cerkev near [[Novo Mesto]] in what was then the [[Duchy of Carniola]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. He was the son of Davorin Zwitter, a [[Carinthian Slovene]] judge. The family decided to stay in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] assigned their native region to the [[Republic of Austria]]. After finishing grammar school in Novo Mesto, he enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]], where he studied [[history]] and [[geography]]. Between 1926 and 1928, he studied also at the [[University of Vienna]]. Between 1930 and 1932, he studied in [[Paris]] under the supervision of [[Albert Mathiez]]. Between 1932 and 1938, he taught at the [[Poljane Grammar School|Ljubljana Classical Lyceum]]. In 1938, he became professor at the University of Ljubljana.

In the 1930s, he was active in public life, publishing critical articles in [[left liberal]] journals, such as ''[[Sodobnost]]'' and ''[[Ljubljanski zvon]]''. Soon after the [[Axis powers|Axis]] [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, he joined the [[Liberation Front of the Slovenian People]]. In May of the same year, he was arrested by the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italian]] occupation authorities of the [[Province of Ljubljana]], but released soon afterwards. In March 1942, he was arrested again and sent to the [[internment camp]] in [[Aprica]], on the [[Italy|Italian]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] border. After the [[Italian armistice]], he found his way back to [[Slovenia]], where he joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|partisan resistance]]. Between January 1944 and March 1945, he organized and led the ''Scientific Institute of the Executive Council of the Liberation Front'', a unique institution in the [[Nazi-occupied Europe]]. The institute mainly prepared documentation on border issues and prepared expertises for the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] territorial claims against Italy in the [[Julian March]] and against [[Austria]] in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]]. In 1945, he moved to the Yugoslav capital [[Belgrade]], where he worked as an expert on north-western border issues at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

After 1948, he moved back to [[Ljubljana]], where he taught at the Department of History of the University of Ljubljana. Between 1952 and 1954, he served as rector of the University. In 1953, he became a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Slovenian]] and later also of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts|Yugoslav]] (1961) and the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (1970). Between 1975 and 1978, he served as president of the publishing house ''[[Slovenska matica]]''.

Zwitter's initial expertise was the social history of medieval towns, but under the influence of his supervisor [[Albert Mathiez]], he switched to modern history. Under the influence of the French [[Annales school]], he introduced several methodological innovation in the study of the demographic history of the [[Slovene Lands]]. After [[World War II]], he turned to the study of nationality issues in the [[Habsburg Empire]].

He died in Ljubljana in 1988, and was buried in the cemetery in Bela Cerkev.

His son [[Matjaž Zwitter]] is a physician, his other son, [[Tomaž Zwitter]] is an astronomer, and his daughter, [[Anja Dular]] is a historian, librarian and social anthropologist.

[[image:fredrik macody lund.jpg|thumb|Frederik Macody Lund (1863–1943)]]
'''Julius Frederik Macody Lund''' (born 18 November 1863 in [[Stavanger]], died 16 December 1943 in [[Farsund]]) was a controversial [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[historian]], most known and remembered for his engagement in the restoration of [[Nidaros Cathedral]].

When architect [[Christian Christie]] presented his ideas for a restoration of the west section and the west front,{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} an alternative idea was published by Macody Lund, introducing the [[screenfront]] and the rose window. Both of these ideas were included in [[Olaf Nordhagen]]'s 1907 plan for the restoration of the cathedral.

In 1915 Macody Lund published his theory that [[Nidaros Cathedral]] was constructed on the basis of the ideas of the [[golden ratio]]. He gained support for this idea in the [[Stortinget|Parliament of Norway]], and received financial aid from the parliament to develop an alternative proposal for the restoration of the west section and the west front, in competition with Nordhagen's work. These "system controversies" led to great delays in the work at the cathedral, as no work could be done before this dispute was settled. Macody Lund published his views in ''Ad Quadratum'' (1919). The dispute was settled in 1922, when an international experts commission rejected Macody Lund's theories. In 1923, Stortinget decided to continue the cathedral's restoration based on Nordhagen's plan. The commission's verdict was, however, without a full argumentation. Macody Lund thus saw an opportunity to continue his argument, which he published in ''Ad Quadratum II: Dom med præmisser over den internasjonale domskommissions dom uten præmisser'' (1928) ("A verdict with premises on the international experts commission's verdict without premises").

He was given a ''Lifetime government grant'' in 1929.

'''Gender archaeology''' is a method of studying past societies through their [[material culture]] by closely examining the social construction of [[gender]] identities and relations. Gender archaeology itself is based on the ideas that even though nearly all individuals are naturally born to a [[biological sex]] (usually either male or female, although also [[intersex]. 

Gender archaeologists examine the relative positions in [[society]] of men, women, and children through identifying and studying the differences in power and authority they held, as they are manifested in material (and skeletal) remains. These differences can survive in the physical record although they are not always immediately apparent and are often open to interpretation. The relationship between the genders can also inform relationships between other social groups such as families, different classes, ages and religions.

Archaeologist [[Bruce Trigger]] noted that gender archaeology differed from other variants of the discipline that developed around the same time, such as working-class archaeology, [[indigenous archaeology]] and [[community archaeology]], in that "instead of simply representing an alternate focus of research, it has established itself as a necessary and integral part of all other archaeologies."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tri07|Trigger 2007]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}
Gender archaeology studies began in the last three decades within the English-speaking archaeological community. [[Margaret Conkey]] and [[Janet D. Spector]] (1984) are considered the first in the Anglo-American field to examine the application of [[feminism|feminist]] approaches and insights to archaeological practice and theory.&lt;ref name="AoM"&gt;[http://www.antiquityofman.com/gender-based_archaeology.pdf Is the archaeology of gender necessarily a feminist archaeology?] ''Antiquity of Man''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hays-Gilpin, 2000:92. Feminist Scholarship in Archaeology. ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' 571:89-106.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Scandinavian, and specifically Norwegian, archaeologists had already in the early seventies started to follow a processual recipe for studying gender relations both within (pre)history and the profession itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sørensen|first1=Marie Louise Stig|title=Gender Archaeology|date=2000|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a workshop titled "Were they all men?"
arranged by the Norwegian Archaeological Association in 1979, and a dedicated journal for feminist and gender studies in Archaeology; ''K.A.N. Kvinner i Arkeologi i Norge'' [transl. ''Women in Archaeology in Norway''] that published from 1985 until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geller|first1=Pamela L.|title=Identity and Difference:Complicating Gender in Archaeology|journal=Annu. Rev. Anthropol.|date=2009|volume=38|pages=65–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelstad|first1=Ericka|title=Gender, feminism, and sexuality in archaeological studies|journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|date=2001|pages=6002–6006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Some archaeologists have openly criticised gender archaeology. One of those responsible was [[Paul Bahn]], who in 1992 published a statement declaring that:

:The latest outbreak - which bears a great resemblance to the good old days of the [[Processual archaeology|new archaeology]] (primarily a racket for the boys) - is gender archaeology, which is actually feminist archaeology (a new racket for the girls). Yes, folks, sisters are doing it for themselves... Hardly a month goes by without another conference on 'gender archaeology' being held somewhere by a host of female archaeologists (plus a few brave or trendy males who aspire to [[political correctness]]). Some of its aims are laudable, but the bandwagon shouldn't be allowed to roll too far, as the new archaeology did, before the empresses' lack of clothes is pointed out by gleeful cynics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bah92|Bahn 1992]]. p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender archaeology in cross cultural studies==

It has been argued that gender is not genetically inherited but a process of structuring subjectivities, whereas sex is biologically determinate and static (Claassen 1992, Gilchrist 1991, Nelson 1997). To some professionals in the field, however, sex is not “the ground upon which culture elaborates gender” (Morris 1995, 568-569) and “sexing biases have been identified among the methods used in sexing skeletons… When sex is assigned to a skeleton of unknown sex, it is a cultural act” (Claassen 1992, 4), pointing out the bigger cultural biases in the field of archaeology. These philosophies make Western biological anthropological methods of determining sex of fossils, not appropriate for cross-cultural studies given that not the same physical characteristics are used by all cultures to determine an individual’s sex. This approach of sexual fluidity, meaning that sex is not a cross-cultural concept and it is mostly culturally assigned, has been undermined by the wide application of DNA analysis to skeletal remains in Western Archaeology. The conclusions drawn from such studies performed by Western archaeologists, will be biased by their cultural influences and concepts of sex, biology and DNA.

Hoping that analysis of both the material culture and ethnographic studies of the ancient society will provide a clearer picture of the role gender plays/played in that society, archaeologists are using more diverse types of data and incorporating other aspects of the collected data that they did not include before. Gender studies have often analyzed both males and females (Gilchrist 1991, Leick 2003), however, recent fieldwork has challenged the notion of this particular male-female dichotomy by expanding the categories to include a [[third gender|third or fourth gender]] in some non-Western societies that are explored (Herdt 1994, Hollimon 1997). Another way in which the fieldwork has challenged the usual study of gender archaeology is by analyzing more material culture like objects, activities and spatial arrangements in the landscape (Nelson 1997).&lt;ref name="AoM"/&gt;

'''Gotthard Friedrich Stender''' ({{lang-lv|Gothards Frīdrihs Stenders}}; 1714-1796) was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] Lutheran pastor who played an outstanding role in [[Latvia]]'s history of culture. He was the first [[Latvian language|Latvian]] grammarian and lexicographer, founder of the Latvian secular literature in the 18th century. In the spirit of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] He wrote the first Latvian-German and German-Latvian dictionaries, wrote the first encyclopedia “The book of high wisdom of the world and nature” (1774), wrote the first illustrated Latvian [[alphabet book]] (1787). 

Stender produced didactic tales and idyllic poems meant to educate and uplift the Latvian peasants who were oppressed by serfdom. He wrote secular poetry ranging from philosophical odes to the grandeur of nature to unpretentious, folksy songs, which widely influenced the literary taste of the nation, and won extreme popularity. His works, although written in a simple language and style, meant for the barely educated 18th century Latvians, promoted the education in Latvian schools throughout the whole 19th century.
His Latvian grammar book and a dictionary was used not only by Latvians and Baltic Germans, but also by foreign linguists from all over the Europe. Stender along with [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] was the first author who analysed Latvian folk-songs (see:[[Daina (Latvia)|dainas]]), riddles, proverbs and sayings.

'''Henry Gyles Turner''' (12 December 1831 – 30 November 1920), commonly referred to as "Gyles Turner" was a notable [[Australia]]n banker and historian.

Turner was born at [[Kensington]], [[London]]. He was educated at the Poland-street academy and at 15 years of age was apprenticed to William Pickering, the publisher. In 1850, he joined the London joint stock bank and in September 1854, sailed for Australia, arrived in [[Melbourne]] on 4 December, and joined the staff of the [[Bank of Australasia]]. In 1865, he became accountant of this bank, and in 1870, general manager of the [[Commercial Bank of Australia]], then a comparatively small institution. Under his management it became one of the leading banks of Australia. In the [[1893 banking crisis|bank crisis of 1893]], it suffered very heavy losses and did not recover its position for many years. There can be no doubt that there was much over-trading, and Turner was blamed for the bad state of affairs. He was, however, away in Europe on leave from February 1888 to March 1889, and it was during this period that the "boom" was at its height. He had hoped to retire at a comparatively early age, but now had to set himself to recover the lost fortunes of the bank. By 1901, the worst of its troubles were past and he was able to retire in his seventieth year.&lt;ref name=dab&gt;{{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Henry Gyles|Last=Turner|shortlink=0-dict-biogT-V.html#turner2|accessdate=2008-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner had always been interested in literature and during his banking life did a good deal of writing. In November 1875, he called a meeting of his friends at his house and, with the slender capital of £100, a literary magazine ''[[The Melbourne Review]]'' was started. It lasted just 10 years and was not only the longest lived but the best purely Australian review that appeared in the nineteenth century. Initially edited by [[Arthur Patchett Martin]], Turner was joint editor with [[Alexander Sutherland (educator)|Alexander Sutherland]] during its later years, and supplied much of the driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

''The First Decade of the Australian Commonwealth'' appeared in 1911, which was followed in 1913 by ''Our Own Little Rebellion, the Story of the [[Eureka Stockade]]''.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;

In 1917, when in his eighty-sixth year Turner gave a public lecture on "The War and Literature" and succeeded in completely holding the attention of his audience. He died at his house, ''Bundalohn'', in the Melbourne suburb of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. He married in September 1855, Helen Ramsay who died in 1914, without issue. His portrait by [[E. Phillips Fox]], is in the national gallery at Melbourne. Apart from his historical writings Turner was a busy worker. He was at different times chairman of the associated banks, president of the chamber of commerce, president of the Shakespeare Society, president of the trustees of the public library, museums and national gallery of Victoria, and held numerous other offices in a large variety of institutions. The bulk of his estate was left to charitable institutions, his manuscripts and a large selection from his fine library went to the public library at Melbourne.&lt;ref name=dab/&gt;&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography

==The 1977 treaties and associated agreements==
On September 7, 1977, Carter and Torrijos met in Washington to sign the treaties in a ceremony that also was attended by representatives of twenty-six other nations of the Western Hemisphere. The [[Panama Canal Treaty]], the major document signed on September 7, abrogated the 1903 treaty and all other previous bilateral agreements concerning the canal. The treaty was to enter into force six months after the exchange of instruments of ratification and to expire at noon on December 31, 1999. The Panama Canal Company and the Canal Zone government would cease to operate and Panama would assume complete legal jurisdiction over the former Canal Zone immediately, although the United States would retain jurisdiction over its citizens during a thirty-month transition period. Panama would grant the United States rights to operate, maintain, and manage the canal through a new United States government agency, the [[Panama Canal Commission]]. The commission would be supervised by a board of five members from the United States and four from Panama; the ratio was fixed for the duration of the treaty. The commission would have a United States administrator and Panamanian deputy administrator until January 1, 1990, when the nationalities of these two positions would be reversed. Panamanian nationals would constitute a growing number of commission employees in preparation for their assumption of full responsibility in 2000. Another binational body, the [[Panama Canal Consultative Committee]], was created to advise the respective governments on policy matters affecting the canal's operation.

Article IV of the treaty related to the protection and defense of the canal and mandated both nations to participate in that effort, though the United States was to hold the primary responsibility during the life of the treaty. The [[Combined Board]], composed of an equal number of senior military representatives from each country, was established and its members charged with consulting their respective governments on matters relating to protection and defense of the canal. Guidelines for employment within the Panama Canal Commission were set forth in Article X, which stipulated that the United States would establish a training program to ensure that an increasing number of Panamanian nationals acquired the skills needed to operate and maintain the canal. By 1982 the number of United States employees of the commission was to be at least 20 percent lower than the number working for the Panama Canal Company in 1977. Both nations pledged to assist their own nationals who lost jobs because of the new arrangements in finding employment. The right to collective bargaining and affiliation with international labor organizations by commission employees was guaranteed.

Under the provisions of Article XII, the United States and Panama agreed to study jointly the feasibility of a sea-level canal and, if deemed necessary, to negotiate terms for its construction. Payments to Panama from the commission ("a just and equitable return on the national resources which it has dedicated to the . . . canal") were set forth in Article XIII. These included a fixed annuity of US$10 million, an annual contingency payment of up to US$10 million to be paid out of any commission profits, and US$0.30 per [[Panama Canal net ton]] of cargo that passed through the canal, paid out of canal tolls. The latter figure was to be periodically adjusted for inflation and was expected to net Panama between US$40 and US$70 million annually during the life of the treaty. In addition, Article III stipulated that Panama would receive a further US$10 million annually for services (police, fire protection, street cleaning, traffic management, and garbage collection) it would provide in the canal operating areas.

The second treaty, the [[Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal]], or simply the Neutrality Treaty, was a much shorter document. Because it had no fixed termination date, this treaty was the major source of controversy. Under its provisions, the United States and Panama agreed to guarantee the canal's neutrality "in order that both in time of peace and in time of war it shall remain secure and open to peaceful transit by the vessels of all nations on terms of entire equality". In times of war, however, United States and Panamanian warships were entitled to "expeditious" transit of the canal under the provisions of Article VI. A [[Protocol (politics)|Protocol]] was attached to the Neutrality Treaty, and all nations of the world were invited to subscribe to its provisions.

At the same ceremony in Washington, representatives of the United States and Panama signed a series of [[fourteen executive agreements]] associated with the treaties. These included two Agreements in Implementation of Articles III and IV of the Panama Canal Treaty that detailed provisions concerning operation, management, protection, and defense, outlined in the main treaty. Most importantly, these two agreements defined the areas to be held by the United States until 2000 to operate and defend the canal. These areas were distinguished from military areas to be used jointly by the United States and Panama until that time, military areas to be held initially by the United States but turned over to Panama before 2000, and areas that were turned over to Panama on October 1, 1979.

One foreign observer calculated that 64 percent of the former Canal Zone, or 106,700 hectares, came under Panamanian control in 1979; another 18 percent, or 29,460 hectares, would constitute the "canal operating area" and remain under control of the Panama Canal Commission until 2000; and the remaining 18 percent would constitute the various military installations controlled by the United States until 2000. The agreements also established the Coordinating Committee, consisting of one representative of each country, to coordinate the implementation of the agreement with respect to Article III of the Panama Canal Treaty, and an analogous Joint Committee to perform the defense-related functions called for in the agreement with respect to Article IV of the treaty.

Ancillary agreements signed on September 7 allowed the United States to conduct certain activities in Panama until 2000, including the training of Latin American military personnel at four schools located within the former Canal Zone; provided for cooperation to protect wildlife within the area; and outlined future United States economic and military assistance. This latter agreement, subject to the availability of congressionally approved funds, provided for United States [[loan guarantees]], up to US$75 million over a 5-year period, for housing; a US$20-million loan guarantee by the [[United States Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] for financing projects in the Panamanian private sector; loans, loan guarantees, and insurance, up to a limit of US$200 million between 1977 and 1982, provided by the [[United States Export-Import Bank]] for financing Panamanian purchases of United States exports; and up to US$50 million in foreign military sales credits over a 10-year period.

The speeches of Carter and Torrijos at the signing ceremony revealed the differing attitudes toward the new accords by the two leaders. Carter declared his unqualified support of the new treaties. The statement by Torrijos was more ambiguous, however. While he stated that the signing of the new treaties "attests to the end of many struggles by several generations of Panamanian patriots", he noted Panamanian criticism of several aspects of the new accords, particularly of the Neutrality Treaty: "Mr. President, I want you to know that this treaty, which I shall sign and which repeals a treaty not signed by any Panamanian, does not enjoy the approval of all our people, because the twenty-three years agreed upon as a transition period are 8,395 days, because during this time there will still be military bases which make my country a strategic reprisal target, and because we are agreeing to a treaty of neutrality which places us under the protective umbrella of the Pentagon. This pact could, if it is not administered judiciously by future generations, become an instrument of permanent intervention."

Torrijos was so concerned with the ambiguity of the Neutrality Treaty, because of Panamanian sensitivity to the question of United States military intervention, that, at his urging, he and President Carter signed the [[Statement of Understanding]] on October 14, 1977, to clarify the meaning of the permanent United States rights. This statement, most of which was subsequently included as an amendment to the Neutrality Treaty and incorporated into its [[instrument of ratification]], included a declaration that the United States "right to act against any aggression or threat directed against the Canal . . . does not mean, nor shall it be interpreted as the right of intervention of the United States in the internal affairs of Panama." Despite this clarification, the [[plebiscite]] that took place the next week and served as the legal means of ratification in Panama, saw only two-thirds of Panamanians registering their approval of the new treaties, a number considerably smaller than that hoped for by the government.

Ratification in the United States necessitated the approval of two-thirds of the Senate. The debates, the longest in Senate history, began on February 7, 1978. The Neutrality Treaty was approved on March 16, and the main treaty on April 18, when the debate finally ended. To win the necessary sixty-seven Senate votes, Carter agreed to the inclusion of a number of amendments, conditions, reservations, and understandings that were passed during the Senate debates and subsequently included in the instruments of ratification signed by Carter and Torrijos in June.

Notable among the Senate modifications of the Neutrality Treaty were two amendments incorporating the October 1977 Statement of Understanding, and interpreting the "expeditious" transit of United States and Panamanian warships in times of war as being preferential. Another modification, commonly known as the [[DeConcini Condition]], stated that "if the Canal is closed, or its operations are interfered with [the United States and Panama shall each] have the right to take such steps as each deems necessary, ... including the use of military force in the Republic of Panama, to reopen the Canal or restore the operations of the Canal". Modifications of the Panama Canal Treaty included a reservation requiring statutory authorization for payments to Panama set forth in Article XIII and another stating that any action taken by the United States to secure accessibility to the Canal "shall not have as its purpose or be interpreted as a right of intervention in the internal affairs of the Republic of Panama or interference with its political independence or sovereign integrity". Reservations attached to both treaties made the United States provision of economic and military assistance, as detailed in the ancillary agreements attached to the treaties, nonobligatory.

The inclusion of these modifications, which were never ratified in Panama, was received there by a storm of protest. Torrijos expressed his concern in 2 letters, the first to Carter and another sent to 115 heads of state through their representatives at the UN. A series of student protests took place in front of the United States embassy. The DeConcini Condition was the major object of protest. Although the reservation to the Panama Canal Treaty was designed to mollify Panamanian fears that the DeConcini Condition marked a return to the United States gunboat diplomacy of the early twentieth century, this provision would expire in 2000, whereas the DeConcini Condition, because it was attached to the Neutrality Treaty, would remain in force permanently.

Despite his continuing concern with the ambiguity of the treaties with respect to the United States role in defense of the canal after 2000, the close Senate vote made Torrijos aware that he could not secure any further modification at that time. On June 16, 1978, he and Carter signed the instruments of ratification of each treaty in a ceremony in Panama City. Nevertheless, Torrijos added the following statement to both Panamanian instruments: "The Republic of Panama will reject, in unity and with decisiveness and firmness, any attempt by any country to intervene in its internal or external affairs." The instruments of ratification became effective on June 1, 1979, and the treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979.

==Torrijos government undertakes "democratization"==
Ironically, the successful conclusion of negotiations with the United States and the signing of the Panama Canal treaties in August 1977 added to the growing political difficulties in Panama. Virtually all observers of Panamanian politics in the late 1970s agreed that the situation in the late 1970s could only be understood in terms of the central role traditionally played by nationalism in forming Panamanian political consensus. Before August 1977, opponents of Torrijos were reluctant to challenge his leadership because of his progress in gaining control over the Canal Zone. The signing of the treaties eliminated that restraint; in short, after August 1977, Panamanian resentment could no longer be focused exclusively on the United States.

The widespread feeling among Panamanians that the 1977 treaties were unacceptable, despite their being approved by a two-thirds majority in the October 1977 plebiscite, contributed to growing opposition to the government. Critics pointed especially to the amendments imposed by the United States Senate after the October 1977 plebiscite, which they felt substantially altered the spirit of the treaties. Furthermore, political opponents of Torrijos argued that the government purposely limited the information available on the treaties and then asked the people to vote "yes" or "no," in a plebiscite that the opposition maintained was conducted fraudulently.

Another factor contributing to the erosion of the populist alliance built by Torrijos during the early 1970s was the graduated and controlled process of "democratization" undertaken by the Torrijos government after signing the new canal treaties. In October 1978, a decade after the government declared political parties illegal in the aftermath of the 1968 military ''coup d'état'', the 1972 Constitution was reformed to implement a new electoral law and legalize political parties. In the spirit of opening the political system that accompanied the ratification of the Panama Canal treaties, exiled political leaders, including former President Arnulfo Arias, were allowed to return to the country, and a flurry of political activity was evident during the subsequent eighteen months. Foremost among the activities were efforts to obtain the 30,000 signatures legally required to register a party for the October 1980 elections.

The 1978 amendments to the 1972 Constitution markedly decreased the powers of the executive branch of government and increased those of the legislature, but the executive remained the dominant branch. From October 1972 until October 1978, Torrijos had acted as the chief executive under the titles of head of government and "Maximum Leader of the Panamanian Revolution." After the 1978 amendments took effect, Torrijos gave up his position as head of government but retained control of the National Guard and continued to play an important role in the government's decision-making process. Before stepping down, Torrijos had agreed to democratize Panama's political system, in order to gain United States support for the canal treaties. In October 1978, the National Assembly elected a thirty-eight-year-old lawyer and former education minister, [[Aristides Royo]], to the presidency and [[Ricardo de la Espriella]] to the vice presidency, each for a six-year term.

The PRD—a potpourri of middle-class elements, peasant and labor groups, and marginal segments of Panamanian society—was the first party to be officially recognized under the registration process that began in 1979. Wide speculation held that the PRD would nominate Torrijos as its candidate for the presidential race planned for 1984. Moreover, many assumed that with government backing, the PRD would have a substantial advantage in the electoral process.

In March 1979, a coalition of eight parties called the [[National Opposition Front]] (''Frente Nacional de Oposición'', FRENO) was formed to battle the PRD in the 1980 legislative elections, the first free elections to be held in a decade. FRENO was composed of parties on both the right and the left of center in the political spectrum, including the strongly nationalistic, anti-[[Yankee]] [[Authentic Panameñista Party]] (''Partido Panameñista Auténtico'', PPA), which was led by the aged but still popular former president, Arnulfo Arias; the PLN; the reform-oriented PDC; and the [[Social Democratic Party (Panama)|Social Democratic Party]] (''Partido Social Democrático'', PSD), which was left of center and reform-oriented. Three right-of-center parties—the Republican Party (''Partido Republicano'', PR), the [[Third Nationalist Party]], and PALA—had also joined the FRENO coalition. The [[Independent Democratic Movement]], a small, moderately left-of-center party, completed the coalition. Such diverse ideologies in the opposition party suggested a marriage of convenience. FRENO opposed the Panama Canal treaties and called for their revision on terms more favorable to Panama.

All qualified parties competed in the 1980 legislative elections, but these elections posed no threat to Torrijos's power base because political parties vied for only nineteen of the fifty-seven seats in the legislature. The other two-thirds of the representatives were appointed, in essence by Torrijos's supporters. The PRD won twelve of the available nineteen seats; the PLN won five seats, and the PDC, one. The remaining seat was won by an independent candidate running with the support of a [[communist]] party, the [[Panamanian People's Party]] (''Partido Panameño del Pueblo'', PPP). The PPP had failed to acquire the signatures required for a place on the ballot. Despite the lopsided victory of the progovernment party and the weakness of the [[National Legislative Council]] (budgeting and appropriations were controlled by President Royo, who had been handpicked by Torrijos), this election represented a small step toward restoring democratic political processes. The election also demonstrated that Panama's political party system was too fragmented to form a viable united front against the government.

==General Manuel Noriega and the U.S. invasion==

[[Image:Panama clashes 1989.JPEG|thumb|right|Aftermath of urban warfare during the [[United States invasion of Panama]]]]

Torrijos died in a mysterious plane crash on August 1, 1981. The circumstances of his death generated charges and speculation that he was the victim of an assassination plot.  Torrijos' death altered the tone but not the direction of Panama's political evolution. Despite 1983 constitutional amendments, which appeared to proscribe a political role for the military, the [[Panama Defense Forces]] (PDF), as they were then known, continued to dominate Panamanian political life behind a facade of civilian government. By this time, Gen. [[Manuel Noriega]] was firmly in control of both the PDF and the civilian government, and had created the [[Dignity Battalions]] to help suppress opposition.

Despite undercover collaboration with [[Ronald Reagan]] on his [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contra]] war in [[Nicaragua]] (including the infamous [[Iran-Contra affair]]), which had planes flying arms as well as drugs, relations between the United States and the Panama regime worsened in the 1980s.

The United States froze economic and military assistance to Panama in the middle of 1987 in response to the domestic political crisis and an attack on the U.S. embassy. General Noriega's February 1988 indictment in U.S. courts on drug-trafficking charges sharpened tensions. In April 1988, President Reagan invoked the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]], freezing Panamanian Government assets in U.S. banks, withholding fees for using the canal, and prohibiting payments by American agencies, firms, and individuals to the Noriega regime. The country went into turmoil. When national elections were held in May 1989, the elections were marred by accusations of fraud from both sides. An American, Kurt Muse, was apprehended by the Panamanian authorities, after he had set up a sophisticated radio and computer installation, designed to jam Panamanian radio and broadcast phony election returns. However, the elections proceeded as planned, and Panamanians voted for the anti-Noriega candidates by a margin of over three-to-one. The Noriega regime promptly annulled the election and embarked on a new round of repression. By the second half of 1989, the regime was barely clinging to power. Failed coups occurred in March 1988 and [[1989 Panamanian coup d'état attempt|October 1989]].

When [[Guillermo Endara]] won the Presidential elections held in May 1989, the Noriega regime annulled the election, citing massive US interference.  Foreign election observers, including the Catholic Church and [[Jimmy Carter]] certified the electoral victory of Endara despite widespread attempts at fraud by the regime. At the behest of the United States, the [[Organization of American States]] convened a meeting of foreign ministers but was unable to obtain Noriega's departure. The U.S. began sending thousands of troops to bases in the canal zone.  Panamanian authorities alleged that U.S. troops left their bases and illegally stopped and searched vehicles in Panama. During this time, an American Marine got lost in the former French quarter of Panama City, ran a roadblock, and was killed by Panamanian Police (who were then a part of the Panamanian Military).  On December 20, 1989 the United States troops commenced an [[United States invasion of Panama|invasion of Panama]].  Their primary objectives were achieved quickly, and the combatants withdrawal began on December 27. The US was obligated to hand control of the Panama Canal her to Panama on January 1 due to a treaty signed decades before. Endara was sworn in as President at a U.S. military base on the day of the invasion.  General [[Manuel Noriega]] is now serving a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking. Estimates as to the loss of life on the Panamanian side vary between 500 and 7000. There are also claims that U.S. troops buried many corpses in mass graves or simply threw them into the sea.  For different perspectives, see references below. Much of the Chorillo neighborhood was destroyed by fire shortly after the start of the invasion.

Following the invasion, President George H. W. Bush announced a billion dollars in aid to Panama. Critics argue that about half the aid was a gift from the American taxpayer to American businesses, as $400 million consisted of incentives for U.S. business to export products to Panama, $150 million was to pay off bank loans and $65 million went to private sector loans and guarantees to U.S. investors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberspacei.com/jesusi/authors/chomsky/sam/sam.htm ''What Uncle Sam Really Wants,'' The invasion of Panama, 1993, Noam Chomsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining US military bases were turned over to Panama on December 31, 1999.

==Politics and institutions after Noriega==
In the morning of December 20, 1989, a few hours after the beginning of the invasion, the presumptive winner of the May 1989 election, Guillermo Endara,  was sworn in as president of Panama at a U.S. military installation in the [[Panama Canal Zone|Canal Zone]]. Subsequently, on December 27, 1989, Panama's [[Electoral Tribunal]] invalidated the Noriega regime's annulment of the May 1989 election and confirmed the victory of opposition candidates under the leadership of President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents [[Guillermo Ford]] and [[Ricardo Arias Calderón]].

President Endara took office as the head of a four-party minority government, pledging to foster Panama's economic recovery, transform the Panamanian military into a police force under [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]], and strengthen democratic institutions. During its 5-year term, the Endara government struggled to meet the public's high expectations. Its new police force proved to be a major improvement in outlook and behavior over its thuggish predecessor but was not fully able to deter crime. In 1992 he would have received 2.4 percent of the vote if there had been an election. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} [[Ernesto Pérez Balladares]] was sworn in as President on September 1, 1994, after an internationally monitored election campaign.

Pérez Balladares ran as the candidate for a three-party coalition dominated by the [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (PRD), the erstwhile political arm of the military dictatorship during the Torrijos and Norieiga years. A long-time member of the PRD, Pérez Balladares worked skillfully during the campaign to rehabilitate the PRD's image, emphasizing the party's populist Torrijos roots rather than its association with Noriega. He won the election with only 33% of the vote when the major non-PRD forces, unable to agree on a joint candidate, splintered into competing factions. His administration carried out economic reforms and often worked closely with the U.S. on implementation of the Canal treaties.

On May 2, 1999, [[Mireya Moscoso]], the widow of former President [[Arnulfo Arias Madrid]], defeated PRD candidate [[Martín Torrijos]], son of the late dictator. The elections were considered free and fair. Moscoso took office on September 1, 1999.

During her administration, Moscoso attempted to strengthen social programs, especially for child and youth development, protection, and general welfare. Education programs have also been highlighted. More recently, Moscoso focused on bilateral and multilateral free trade initiatives with the hemisphere. Moscoso's administration successfully handled the Panama Canal transfer and has been effective in the administration of the Canal.

Panama's counternarcotics cooperation has historically been excellent (in fact, officials of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] praised the role played by [[Manuel Noriega]] prior to his falling-out with the U.S.) The Panamanian Government has expanded money-laundering legislation and concluded with the U.S. a [[Counternarcotics Maritime Agreement]] and a [[Stolen Vehicles Agreement]]. In the economic investment arena, the Panamanian Government has been very successful in the enforcement of intellectual property rights and has concluded with the U.S. a very important [[Bilateral Investment Treaty Amendment]] and an agreement with the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] (OPIC). The Moscoso administration was very supportive of the United States in combating international terrorism.

In 2004, Martín Torrijos again ran for president but this time won handily.

In 2016, the [[Panama Papers]], which is not to be confused with the 2017 public release of the [[Paradise Papers]], were released. The Panamanian law firm of [[Mossack Fonseca]] (MossFon) was cited numerous times in these documents and later dissolved on March 14, 2018.&lt;ref name="Shutdown"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mossack Fonseca law firm to shut down after Panama Papers tax scandal |date=14 March 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/mossack-fonseca-shut-down-panama-papers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314222823/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/14/mossack-fonseca-shut-down-panama-papers |archive-date=14 March 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Humanism}}

'''Humanistic historiography''' is a method in [[historiography]]. This method is based on the principles of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanistic_historiography Articles for Humanistic historiography].&lt;/ref&gt; The new style of (humanistic) historiography was established by the Florentine History of Bruni (published from 1416 to 1449), and certain characteristics of the model still determined the treatment of political history in [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Florentine Histories|Istorie Firoentine]]'', as well as his delimitation of political subject matter at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fritzwagner.com/ev/humanistic_historiography.html Humanistic Historiography as War and Personalities].&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us briefly enumerate these characteristics. The humanists used Livy as their model. This choice had certain consequences insofar as the treatment of history had to concentrate on such exciting events as wars and revolutions to the exclusion of the permanent factors and the long-range developments that determine the texture of history.

Moreover, in the interest of rhetorical and dramatic effectiveness, the individual had to become the center of action to such a degree that again the permanent determinants that in fact leave not so much room for heroic freedom were obscured.

The Roman model had, furthermore, the effect of a radical secularization of political problems. The humanistic concentration on the history of the republic in the Roman manner entailed the break with the Christian view of history. The rigidly closed stream of secular state history did not admit a divine Providence governing a universal history. Such problems as the translatio imperii and the speculation of the four world monarchies disappeared without a word of discussion.

In the eighteenth century, when [[Voltaire]] started his secularization of history, the polemic against the Christian position of Bossuet was of absorbing interest. The humanists of the fifteenth century ignored the Christian problem as if it did not exist.

'''Jack Wesley Burnham Jr.''' (born [[New York, New York]], 1931) is an American [[writer]] on [[art]] and [[technology]], who taught art history at [[Northwestern University]] and the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. He is one of the main forces behind the emergence of [[systems art]] in the 1960s.

== Biography ==
Burnham received a BFA from the [[Yale School of Art]] in 1959 and a MFA in 1961. 

From 1955 until 1965 he worked as a [[sculptor]], often created sculptures that included light. In the 1960s he started teaching art history at Northwestern University, and became chairman of their art department. He was a Fellow at MIT's [[Center for Advanced Visual Studies]] from 1968 to 1969. In the 1980s he moved to the University of Maryland and again chaired the art and art history departments. 

Since the 1990s he is retired, and lives in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]], immersed in [[Kabbalah]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Horvitz (2000-09) [http://www.volweb.cz/horvitz/burnham/homepage.html "A node for jack burnham"]. Online website about Jack Burnham. Accessed March 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Jack Burnham worked as a writer, and in the 1960s and 1970s made important contributions as an art theorist, critic and curator in the field of [[systems art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie Gere]], ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (2005) Berg, pp. 124-138&lt;/ref&gt; In systems art the [[concept]] and [[idea]]s of [[wikt:process|process]] related [[system]]s and [[systems theory]] are involved in the work to take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] object related and material concerns. Burnham named Systems art in the 1968 [[Artforum]] article "System Esthetics": "He had investigated the effects of science and technology on the sculpture of this century, and saw a dramatic contrast between the handling of the place-oriented ''object sculpture'' and the extreme mobility of Systems sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;Jack Burnham (1968), ''Beyond Modern Sculpture: The Effects of Science and Technology on the Sculpture of This Century'', G. Braziller, p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kevin Danaher''' ([[Irish language|Irish]], '''''Caoimhín Ó Danachair''''') (30 January 1913 – 14 March 2002) was a prominent Irish [[Irish folklore|folklorist]] with a special interest in [[ethnography]] and [[military history]].

Danaher is the author of 10 books about Irish traditional customs and beliefs, the best known of which are ''The Year in Ireland'', ''In Ireland Long Ago'', and ''Folktales from the Irish Countryside''.
A respected scholar, Danaher published more than 200 articles in [[academic journals]].

==Early life==
Kevin Danaher was born in Athea (''Ath an tSleibhe''), [[County Limerick]], Ireland, on 30 January 1913. Danaher's father, William, was the local schoolmaster.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"&gt;Lysaght, Patricia. "[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_113/ai_95107640 Kevin Danaher, 1913–2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514134950/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_113/ai_95107640 |date=14 May 2006 }} – Caoimhin O Danachair – In Memoriam – Obituary" in ''Folklore'', Volume: 113, Issue: 2, Oct. 2002. Accessed 8 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His early education was at Athea National School and Mungret College, County Limerick. In 1934, Danaher became a part-time collector for the [[Irish Folklore Commission]].&lt;ref name="Gailey"&gt;Gailey, Alan, and Lynch, Chris. "Obituary", ''Folk Life'', Summer 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Danaher attended [[University College Dublin]], graduating with a BA in 1937. He was awarded a fellowship by the [http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/ Alexander von Humboldt Foundation] to carry out postgraduate studies in Germany, and studied comparative folklore and ethnology for two years at the Universities of Berlin and Leipzig.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;

When World War II broke out, Danaher returned to Ireland and joined the [[Irish Army]]. He rose to the rank of Captain, and served as an instructor for the Artillery Corps,&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;Hogan, Patrick, "Obituary", ''The Irish Sword'', Summer 2002&lt;/ref&gt; training soldiers in [[Kildare]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;

After his discharge from the army, Danaher resumed his studies, being awarded his MA from the [[National University of Ireland]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;

In early 1940 he once again worked for the Irish Folklore Commission, first as a field worker and then as the Commission's official ethnographer, collecting, cataloguing and illustrating large amounts of traditional tales and folklore, primarily from his home county of [[Limerick]].  Some of his sources were family members, such as his father, Liam.  His groundbreaking work in the area of seasonal customs and folk practices would later appear in his many articles and books.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;

==Academic career==

In 1952–53 Danaher was visiting lecturer at the [[University of Uppsala]], Sweden.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt;

After further education abroad, in 1971 Danaher was appointed a statutory lecturer in Irish Folklore at University College Dublin.  In 1974 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Literature by the National University of Ireland in recognition of his original contribution to scholarship.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt;

From 1973 through his retirement in 1983 Danaher was lecturer for the Department of Irish Folklore, [[University College Dublin]].  As an expert in military history, he was a member of the Irish Military History Society, serving on their council in a variety of capacities.  He was the group's president from 1971 through 1980, and editor of their journal, ''[[The Irish Sword]]'', from 1960 through 1970. He was also a member of The Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland and contributed to the Society's journal. From 1988 through 2002 he served as co-Patron of the Folklore of Ireland Society, and continued to publish article in their journal, ''Bealoideas'' as he had done regularly since 1935.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt;

When Danaher retired from his position at University College Dublin, his students organised a celebratory volume in his honour: ''Sinsear'': The Folklore Journal 4 (1982–83). Many of his students, colleagues and prominent scholars made up the international roster of writers paying  tribute to Danaher, his work, and his influence.&lt;ref name="Lysaght"/&gt; At the same time, his academic colleagues organised the publication of a festschtift, ''Gold Under the Furze''

In 1986 Danaher suffered a stroke, the effects of which put an end to his professional career.&lt;ref name="Hogan"/&gt;  He died on 14 March 2002, after a long illness.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;"Obituary", ''The Irish Times'', 23 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;"Obituary", ''The Guardian'', 27 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kingoodie artefact''' is an object with the characteristics of a corroded iron [[nail (fastener)|nail]] found in a block of [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]] in 1844 in the [[Kingoodie Quarry]] in [[Kingoodie]], [[Scotland]].

[[David Brewster]] reported to the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] that the nail was found when a rough block of stone was being prepared for [[ore dressing|dressing]]. The nail was discovered when the overlying clay was cleared from the stone, with half an inch (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) of the nail projecting into the clay and the remainder of the nail lying along the surface of the stone to within an inch of the head which went down into the stone. It is not known from what part of the quarry the stone came from, and it was handled at least four or five times between being found in the quarry and moved to where it was dressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Brewster | first = Sir David | authorlink = Sir David Brewster | coauthors = | title = Queries and Statements concerning a Nail found imbedded in a Block of Sandstone obtained from Kingoodie (Mylnfield) Quarry, North Britain | journal = Report of the Fourteenth Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science| volume = | issue = | pages = 51 | publisher = [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] | location = London | year = 1845 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=R9k4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | doi = | id = | accessdate = 2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, however, few references to this object, and the mysteries surrounding its discovery were typical for the nineteenth century.

'''Ladadika''' ({{lang-el|Λαδάδικα}}) is the name of a historic district and a landmark area of the city of [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]].

[[File:Thessalonikki, Greece Street Scene 45.jpg|thumb|Street in Ladadika]]
[[File:Ladadikafountain.jpg|thumb|A fountain]]

It locates near the [[Port of Thessaloniki]] and for centuries was one of the most important market places of the city. Its name came about from the many [[olive oil]] shops of the area. Many [[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Jews of the city]] were living there, while the so-called "Frankish district", with the French/Italian merchants and residents, was located beside.

In the years before [[World War I]] it came to form the [[Red-light district|red light district]], with the area starting to host many [[brothels]]. In 1985, Ladakika was listed as a heritage site by the [[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture]]. Its notable architectural style with 19th century buildings is preserved and protected.

Nowadays, having undergone [[gentrification]] in the 1980s, Ladadika forms the entertainment district of the city, hosting bars, nightclubs, restaurants, and pubs in what used to be old oil stores and merchant warehouses, which spill out into a network of pedestrianized streets and small squares, like Morichovou Square, popular place for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saloniki.org/gallery/?id=12362 Λαδάδικα]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martin Victor Melosi''' (born April 27, 1947) is Hugh Roy and Lillie Cranz Cullen University Professor and the director of the Center for Public History at the [[University of Houston]] in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Texas]]. His research specialty is [[environmental history|environmental]] and [[urban history]]. Prior to his tenure at the University of Houston, Melosi was a member of the history faculty of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in [[College Station, Texas|College Station]].

==Background==

A native of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[California]], Melosi holds [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Master of Arts]] degrees from the [[University of Montana]] at [[Missoula, Montana|Missoula]], [[Montana]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]].
&lt;ref name=melosi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vi.uh.edu/People/Melosi/melosi.html |title=Martin Melosi |publisher=vi.uh.edu |accessdate=December 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619113213/http://vi.uh.edu/People/Melosi/melosi.html |archivedate=June 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to environmental and urban history, Melosi also specializes in recent United States and diplomatic history. He teaches courses entitled "Environmental Politics in the United States," "The History of the American City," "The City, Technology, and the Environment," "Energy and Environment in Industrial America," "Atomic Age America," [[Historiography]], "Readings in Public History," and "Research in Public History".&lt;ref name=melosi/&gt;

From 2000-2001, Melosi held the [[Fulbright Scholarship]] Chair in American Studies at the [[University of Southern Denmark]] in [[Odense, Denmark|Odense]], [[Denmark]]. He has been a visiting faculty professor at the [[University of Paris]], [[University of Helsinki]], [[Peking University]], and [[Shanghai University]]. In 2005, Melosi received the  Ester Farfel Award at the University of Houston in recognition of career achievement. He has been president of the American Society for Environmental History, the Public Works Historical Society, and the National Council on Public History. He also recently has served as president of the Urban History Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalenvironment.it/melosi.html|title=Biography: Martin Melosi|publisher=globalenvironment.it|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Melosi has researched pollution problems and energy sources and how they have impacted urban growth and development. He is a lecturer for the [[Organization of American Historians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lectures.oah.org/lecturers/lecturer.html?id=330|title=Martin V. Melosi|publisher=oah.org|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
His book ''The Sanitary City'' (2000, re-released in 2008 in abridged form) examines the development of water supply, [[wastewater]], and solid waste systems in the United States since colonial times. He is working on a companion volume, ''The Networked City,'' which will examine energy, transportation, and communication systems in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXnX4KkV00YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=martin+v.+melosi&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=K-kDTYeqNsSt8Aap4bjnAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Sanitary City|publisher=[[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]: [[University of Pittsburgh]] Press|year=2008|ISBN=0-8229-5983-6|accessdate=December 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Melosi has devoted greater attention to global environmental issues in [[Europe]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=melosi/&gt;

==Other publications==

In 1977, Melosi completed ''The Shadow of Pearl Harbor: Political Controversy of the Surprise Attack, 1941-1946,'' through [[Texas A&amp;M University Press]]. The central focus of this book is partisanship during the war years which delayed disclosure of the details of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on the military base in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin V. Melosi, ''The Shadow of Pearl Harbor: Political Controversy of the Surprise Attack, 1941-1946,'' [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]], and [[London, England|London]], [[England]]: [[Texas A&amp;M University Press]], 1977; second printing, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Melosi authored the article "The Automobile and the Environment in American History," listed on the [[Internet]] under "The Automobile in American Life and Society". Melosi examines the vehicle process from the factory to the junkyard, noting that while essential to the economy, cars also "consume resources; pollute the air, land, and water; and transform space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autolife.umd.umich.edu/Environment/E_Overview/E_Overview.htm|title=The Automobile and the Environment in American History|publisher=autolife.umd.umich.edu|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Martina Sofia Helena Bergman-Österberg''' (née '''Bergman'''; 7 October 1849 – 29 July 1915)&lt;ref name=Westrin194&gt;Westrin, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Sweden|Swedish]]-born [[physical education]] instructor and [[women's suffrage]] advocate who spent most of her working life in Britain. After studying [[gymnastics]] in Stockholm she moved to London, where she founded the first physical education instructor's college in England, to which she [[single-sex education|admitted women only]]. Bergman-Österberg pioneered teaching physical education as a full subject within the English school curriculum, with Swedish-style gymnastics (as opposed to the German model) at its core. She also advocated the wearing of [[gymslip]]s by women playing sports, and played a pivotal role in the early development of [[netball]]. Bergman-Österberg was an advocate of women's emancipation, directly encouraging women to be active in sport and education, and also donating money to women's emancipation organisations in her native Sweden. Several of her students founded the Ling Association, which later became the [[Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom]].

== Early life and career ==
Martina Bergman-Österberg was born on 7 October 1849 in [[Eslöv Municipality|Hammarlunda]], a farming community in [[Malmöhus County]] (now part of [[Skåne County]]), Sweden. Her parents were Karl Bergman, a farmer, and Betty Lundgren; she also had two brothers who both died at a young age, and three sisters who eventually settled abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Fehn, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a private education at home, she was employed as a governess from 1870–73, and from 1874–77 she worked as a ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' librarian, where she met her future husband.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich and Gordon, p. 24; Fehn, p. 128; Westrin, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, she started a two-year course at the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute in Stockholm, studying pedagogical and medical gymnastics. She was trained in the Swedish system of gymnastics devised by [[Pehr Henrik Ling]].&lt;ref name=AG24&gt;Aldrich and Gordon, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Her gymnastics studies also took her to England, France, Germany and Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Westrin194 /&gt; She graduated in 1881, and later that year moved to London.

== London School Board ==
Bergman-Österberg was appointed in 1881 to the [[London School Board]] as Lady Superintendent of Physical Exercises in Girls' and Infants' schools. Eleven years earlier, the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]] had provided universal elementary education in England, and allowed schools to receive government grants for providing physical training.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1991), p. 161; Donovan ''et al''., p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; But at the time, physical education (or "physical training" at the time) as a subject was not taught in the curricula of most schools. Military drill was taught to boys in public schools, while private institutions taught either German-style gymnastics, which emphasised apparatus-based and rhythmic exercises, or Swedish-style gymnastics, which used anatomy-based regimented drills and therapeutic exercises.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), pp 101–104. For a comparison of the two styles, see [[Battle of the Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt; Physical training was permitted for girls in 1873 by the [[Liberal Government 1868–1874|Gladstone government]], and within three years it was made compulsory for girls in elementary schools within the London School Board.&lt;ref name=McCrone91p161&gt;McCrone (1991), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

The superintendent position at the London School Board was first established in 1878. Since no English teachers possessed sufficient qualifications at the time, its first appointee was a Swede named Concordia Löfving, who like Bergman-Österberg was trained at the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated Swedish gymnastics and introduced it to girls' schools; after one year in the position she had received 600 applications.&lt;ref name=Hargreaves97p69&gt;Hargreaves (1997), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; When Löfving resigned from the post in 1881,&lt;ref name=McCrone91p161 /&gt; Bergman-Österberg was appointed as her successor.

Bergman-Österberg was responsible for the instruction of female physical training teachers and with certifying their competence. During her appointment she trained 1312 teachers in Swedish gymnastics, anatomy and physiology, and pioneered a national system of physical training instruction, incorporating Swedish gymnastics as taught by Ling.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 105; Hargreaves (1997), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work focused on training educators for elementary school students, and during her time at the London School Board she introduced Swedish gymnastics to nearly 300 schools; by 1888, Swedish gymnastics was being taught by qualified teachers in girls' schools in every department of the London School Board.&lt;ref name=Hargreaves97p69 /&gt; Bergman-Österberg also organised public demonstrations of her students performing Swedish gymnastics and promoting women's physical education: one such public demonstration in 1883 was attended by the Prince and Princess of Wales, and received approbation in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves (1997), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Her interest eventually shifted towards teaching middle-class women to become physical training instructors in [[Independent school (UK)|English public schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Costa and Guthrie, p. 77; Hargreaves (1997), p. 78; McCrone (1988), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; She grew dissatisfied with the bureaucracy at the London School Board, and felt stifled in fully achieving her aims. She also remarked on the unsuitability of teaching working-class girls in London, observing that they lived in an environment of malnutrition, neglect and dreadful living conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Smart, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hampstead College ==
In 1885, Bergman-Österberg established the Hampstead Physical Training College and Gymnasium for women, against financial advice, at Broadhurst Gardens in South Hampstead, London.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 105; Webb, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BOU&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to the Bergman Österberg Union |url=http://www.greenwichalumni.co.uk/bou.pdf |accessdate=2009-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her college was the first physical training college in England, one in which she admitted women only,&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; as she felt that female instructors would better understand their female students.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon and Doughan, pp 83–84&lt;/ref&gt; While male instructors did teach physical training in schools, at that time there were no institutions offering pedagogical physical training courses for men in England, who generally had to travel to Germany, Denmark or Sweden to gain formal qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;Galligan ''et al''., p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman-Österberg developed a two-year course modelled on that at the Royal Central Gymnastics Institute in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Costa and Guthrie, p. 77; McCrone (1988), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; She taught anatomy, animal physiology, chemistry, physics, hygiene, theory of movement, dancing, deportment and Swedish gymnastics. English team sports were also taught at the college: although Bergman-Österberg never fully understood them, she did appreciate their significance to the English people, and their potential to teach an "appreciation of space and time, discipline, reason, quickness and unselfishness".&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 106; Hargreaves (1997), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing that the liberators of the female sex were to be found in the ranks of the middle class, she deliberately kept enrolment fees high and student numbers low. She only admitted students with above-average intelligence and education, an aptitude for natural science, a sound constitution and character, a pleasing appearance, and considerable zeal and devotion.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 107; Hargreaves (1997), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; Bergman-Österberg's ideas on women's emancipation were centred on contemporary [[social Darwinism]], gearing her young students for motherhood, or establishing them to train other young women for such a role: "I try to train my girls to help raise their own sex, and so to accelerate the progress of the race; for unless the women are strong, healthy, pure, and true, how can the race progress?".&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves (1997), p. 77; Hargreaves (2002), p. 60; Giulianotti, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Once students entered the college, Bergman-Österberg maintained an autocratic rule over their daily lives. She forbade students from visiting each other's rooms, enforced an early "lights out" rule, permitted only cold baths, refused weekend leave except in special circumstances and censored their mail.&lt;ref&gt;Hargreaves (1997), p. 75; Hargreaves (2002), p. 60; McCrone (1988), pp 107–8&lt;/ref&gt; But after completing the course, graduates of the college were virtually guaranteed employment in girls schools throughout the country, with an ample yearly salary of £100.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, p. 530; McCrone (1988), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886, she married Dr Edvin Per Wilhelm Österberg, a professor at the [[University of Uppsala]], and was often referred to as Madame Österberg after her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Aldrich and Gordon, p. 84; Webb, p. 2; McCrone (1988), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Dr Österberg remained in Sweden, Madame Österberg continued her work in England, although they visited each other as often as their work allowed.&lt;ref name=BOU /&gt;
&lt;!--Following section to be included once reliable sources can be found to support it.
== Travels in the United States ==
In 1893 she travelled to the United States to attend the World Education Conference in Chicago. --&gt;&lt;!--Surely this had to be part of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] – again, RS needed! --&gt;&lt;!--During this time she visited Nils Posse's gymnastics school and the Scandinavian Gymnastics Club, and met Dio Lewis and Dudley Allen Sargent. With the help of Dr. Edward Massey Hartwell, Swedish gymnastics was introduced to all public schools in Boston, with 60,000 students receiving training; in practice, there was a greater emphasis on pedagogical gymnastics, with a comparative lack of focus on medical or therapeutic aspects.
--&gt;

== Early development of netball ==

Martina Bergman-Österberg is noted as having played a pivotal role in the early development of netball. Netball was derived from [[basketball]], which was invented in the United States in 1891. In 1893, Bergman-Österberg returned from a visit to the United States, and informally introduced one version of basketball to her students at Hampstead.&lt;ref name=livlions&gt;{{cite web |author=Liverpool University Women's Basketball Club |chapter=Basketball to Netball |title=Liverpool Lions – Origins and Development of Basketball |url=http://www.liverpoollions.co.uk/basketball/basketball.php?valid=%5Bss9%5D&amp;page=7 |accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, an American lecturer by the name of Dr Toles (alternatively spelled "Toll") more formally introduced basketball to her students.&lt;ref name=AENA-History&gt;{{cite web |author=All England Netball Association |title=History of Netball (1891–2001) |url=http://www.sportfocus.com/pdf/History%20of%20Netball.pdf |accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jobling and Barham, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The rules of this game were modified by Madame Österberg's students over several years.&lt;ref name=Aldrich233&gt;Aldrich, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial revisions were made during a visit in 1897 from another American teacher, Miss Porter,&lt;!--[[Sarah Porter]]?--&gt; who introduced rules from [[women's basketball]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Treagus, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the new sport had also acquired a new name: "net&amp;nbsp;ball".&lt;ref name=EnglandNetball-History&gt;{{cite web |author=England Netball |title=History of England Netball (1891–2008) |url=http://www.englandnetball.co.uk/About_Us/History_of_England_Netball.php |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929102347/http://englandnetball.co.uk/About_Us/History_of_England_Netball.php |archivedate=29 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dartford College ==
With less space to accommodate increased enrolments, and with the imminent demolition of the Hampstead campus to make way for a railway, later in 1895 Bergman-Österberg purchased a large country house named Kingsfield on a {{convert|14|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate on Oakfield Lane in Dartford.&lt;ref name=BOU /&gt; She converted the ballroom to a gymnasium, and the lookout tower to servants' quarters, before opening the new college in September that year.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;Wallace (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; At its new campus, the school became known as the Bergman Österberg Physical Training College.

Bergman-Österberg's students were themselves to have their own influences on women's physical education. In 1897 one of her students, Mary Tait, invented the [[gymslip]],&lt;ref name=Aldrich233 /&gt; a dress that facilitated practical movement for women playing sport, replacing the ground-length skirts and mutton-arm blouses that were normally worn by contemporary sportswomen. Bergman-Österberg eagerly adopted the new apparel for her students,&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt; which became a standard uniform among British schoolgirls during the 20th century.

A group of her graduate students formed the Ling Physical Education Association in 1899, the first association representing the workers of the emerging profession in the United Kingdom. They invited Bergman-Österberg to be president of the new association, but she angrily refused, disavowing any rival institutions to her own;&lt;ref&gt;Galligan ''et al''., p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; however, Kathleen McCrone attributes Bergman-Österberg's opposition to the fact that she did not come up with the idea herself.&lt;ref&gt;McCrone (1988), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Instead she formed her own, insular association, the Bergman Österberg Union, in 1900. Conflicts between the two associations would not be resolved until after Bergman-Österberg's death, with both organisations merging to form the Ling Association and Affiliated Gymnastic Societies.&lt;ref name=Hargreaves97p82&gt;Hargreaves (1997), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; This organisation would eventually become the [[Physical Education Association of the United Kingdom]].

Dartford college produced a documentary about Madame Österberg and her legacy on physical education and emancipation of women. The documentary can be found [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwICAwLpmCc&amp;index=1&amp;list=UU13xrybRKoWjy8CJRJT1Vhg here]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwICAwLpmCc&amp;index=1&amp;list=UU13xrybRKoWjy8CJRJT1Vhg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later years and legacy ==
Madame Österberg remained at the college for the rest of her life, although she retired from her teaching duties starting in 1913. Her health was reported to be declining in the spring of 1915: on 29 July that year, Martina Bergman-Österberg died of cancer at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;Fehn, p. 132; Wallace (2002); Westrin, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Before her death, she bequeathed her college to the English nation.&lt;ref name=AG24 /&gt; She also left 50,000 [[Swedish krona|kr]] to the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]], a women's suffrage organisation in Sweden, and donated a property near [[Båstad]] to the [[Fredrika Bremer Association]] for the establishment of an orchard garden school.&lt;ref&gt;Westrin, p. 194; Wicksell, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; She was in fact, alongside [[Lotten von Kræmer]], been one of the two most significant single financial supporters of the National Association for Women's Suffrage, in which her niece [[Signe Bergman]] was a leading figure and once chairman &lt;ref&gt;Barbro Hedwall (2011).

About women's struggle for suffrage) Förlag Bonnier. {{ISBN|978-91-7424-119-8}} (Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergman-Österberg received a [[Litteris et Artibus]] medal in 1906 for her life's work.&lt;ref&gt;Fehn, p. 133; Wicksell, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; An [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]]  also commemorates Bergman-Österberg's original physical training college campus at 1 Broadhurst Gardens (NW6) in [[South Hampstead]], London.&lt;ref name='EngHet'&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/osterberg-martina-bergman-1849-1915|title=ÖSTERBERG, MARTINA BERGMAN|publisher=English Heritage| accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A physical education instructor's college for men would not exist in England until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Hargreaves97p82 /&gt; During World War II, her college at Dartford was evacuated to [[Newquay]] in Cornwall, at which time it was renamed the Dartford College of Physical Education.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Dartford College was amalgamated with Thames Polytechnic: gymnastics instruction ceased in 1982, and by 1986 teacher training had stopped as well; the college was eventually incorporated into the [[University of Greenwich]]. The university maintains The Bergman Österberg Archive, a collection of material regarding her physical education college in Dartford.&lt;ref name=BOUA&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bergman Österberg Union Archive |url=http://alumni.gre.ac.uk/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=792 |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003005545/http://alumni.gre.ac.uk/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=792 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dartford College site is now operated by [[North West Kent College]] after this branch of the University of Greenwich moved to [[Eltham|Avery Hill]] in 2002.

The '''Pella curse tablet''' is a text written in a distinct [[Doric Greek]] idiom, found in [[Pella]], the ancient capital of [[Macedon]], in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fantuzzi|Hunter|2004|p=376}}; {{harvnb|Voutiras|1998|p=25}}; {{harvnb|Fortson|2010|p=464}}; {{harvnb|Bloomer|2005|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ιt contains a [[curse]] or magic spell ([[Ancient Greek language|Greek]]: κατάδεσμος, ''[[katadesmos]]'') inscribed on a [[lead]] scroll, dated to the first half of the 4th century BC (circa 375–350 BC). It was published in the ''Hellenic Dialectology'' Journal in 1993. It is one of four known texts that may represent a local dialectal form of ancient Greek in Macedonia, all of them identifiable as Doric.&lt;ref&gt;O’Neil, James. ''26th Conference of the Australasian Society for Classical Studies'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These suggest that a Doric Greek dialect was spoken in Macedonia, as was previously proposed based on the West Greek forms of names found in Macedonia. As a result, the Pella curse tablet has been forwarded as an argument that the [[Ancient Macedonian language]] was a dialect of [[North-Western Greek]], and one of the Doric dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Masson|2003|loc="Macedonian Language", pp. 905–906}}; {{harvnb|Masson|Dubois|2000|loc=p. 292: "...&lt;&lt;Macedonian Language&gt;&gt; de l'''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 1996, p. 906: &lt;&lt;Macedonian may be seen as a Greek dialect, characterized by its marginal position and by local pronunciation (like Βερενίκα for Φερενίκα etc.)&gt;&gt;."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meier-Brügger|2003|p=28}}; {{harvnb|Hammond|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Companion&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 5: Johannes Engels, "Macedonians and Greeks", p. 95}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:pellatab.jpg|thumb|400px|right|The [[Pella]] ''katadesmos''.]]
The tablet is also described as a "mixed curse" due to the supplicative nature of the appeal. For example, the word ΕΡΗΜΑ or "abandoned" is quite common in appeals to divine powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Damon|Miller|Myers|Courtney|2002|p=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a magic spell or love charm written by a woman, possibly named ''Dagina'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Δαγίνα), whose lover ''Dionysophōn'' (Διονυσοφῶν, gen.: Διονυσοφῶντος) is apparently about to marry ''Thetima'' (Θετίμα, "she who honors the gods"; the [[Attic Greek]] form is ''Theotimē'' - Θεοτίμη). She invokes "Makron and the demons" (''parkattithemai makrōni kai [tois] daimosi'' - παρκαττίθεμαι μάκρωνι καὶ [τοῖς] δαίμοσι; in Attic, παρκαττίθεμαι is ''parakatatithemai'' - παρακατατίθεμαι) to cause Dionysophon to marry her instead of Thetima, and never to marry another woman unless she herself recovers and unrolls the scroll and for her to grow old by the side of Dionysophon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gager|1999|p=85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Katadesmoi'' or ''[[defixio]]nes'' were spells written on non-perishable material, such as lead, stone or baked clay, and were secretly buried to ensure their physical integrity, which would then guarantee the permanence of their intended effects. The language is a distinct form of [[NW Greek|North-West Greek]], and the low social status of its writer, as (arguably) evidenced by her vocabulary and belief in magic, strongly suggests that a unique form of West Greek was spoken by lower-class people in [[Pella]] at the time the tablet was written. This should not, however, be taken to indicate that only those of middling or low social status practiced magic in the Ancient Greek world; quite wealthy individuals might also use lead katadesmoi (curse tablets) for love, revenge, and to bind their opponents in athletic contests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|2000|pp=5–46}}; {{harvnb|Curbera|Jordan|2002–2003|pp=109–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===English===

:2. wo[men], both widows and maidens, but of Thetima in particular, and I entrust to Makron* and
:3. [the] daimones, and (only) when I should dig up again and unroll and read this,

:7. But guard [this] for my sake so that these things do not happen, and wretched Thetima perishes miserably.
:8.  ...  but that I become happy and blessed.

====Points of interpretation====
*"Makron" (line 2) is most probably the name of the dead man in whose grave the tablet was deposited.  This was commonly done in the belief that the deceased would "convey" the message to the chthonic spirits of the underworld (the "daimones" in lines 3 and 6).
*The missing word in line 6 between "I am your supplicant" and "have pity" (here reconstructed as ''[Phil?]a'') is carved at the edge of the tablet and the only things we can read of it are that it is a short word that ends in-''AN''. "''PHILAN''" is a likely reconstruction, but by no means the only one possible.  If true, the word "''PHILAN''" could equally well be either the personal name "Phila" or the feminine adjective "phila", "friend" or "dear one".  In the latter case, an alternative reading of line 6 would be: "Have pity on your dear one, dear demons". In the former case, a personal name would be perfectly placed but, as the name of the person who wrote the curse is not mentioned elsewhere, it is impossible to know with certainty what the missing word is.
*The word "DA''G''INA" (line 6) is inexplicable and previously unattested, even as a personal name.  The alternative has been suggested by Dubois,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dubois|1995|pp=190–197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that it is a misspelling, and that the writer intended to write "da''p''ina" (the difference between Γ and Π being a single stroke).  If true, this may mean that ''dapina'' is an (also unattested) Macedonian rendering of what would be written "ταπεινή", ''tapeinē'' (humble, lowly, brought low), in standard Attic.  In this case the inscription reads: "for I am lowly from all my dear ones and abandoned" etc.  Another possibility is that Dagina is perhaps related to δαγύς, a doll or puppet, especially as used in magic (cf. LSJ p.&amp;nbsp;364). Similarly, ΙΜΕ is also unexplained, but seems to be taken as a misspelling of ΕΜΙ (εμι) (i.e., Attic εἰμι), "I am."

==Dating==
According to D. R. Jordan ([[Duke University]]), the tablet has been dated to the "Mid-IV [century] or slightly earlier".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jordan|2000|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The discovery of the Pella curse tablet, according to Olivier Masson, substantiates the view that the ancient Macedonian language was a form of North-West Greek:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Masson|2003|pp=905–906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Yet in contrast with earlier views which made of it {i.e. Macedonian} an Aeolic dialect (O. Hoffmann compared Thessalian) we must by now think of a link with North-West Greek (Locrian, Aetolian, Phocidian, Epirote). This view is supported by the recent discovery at Pella of a curse tablet (4th cent. BC), which may well be the first 'Macedonian' text attested (provisional publication by E. Voutyras; cf. the Bulletin Epigraphique in Rev. Et. Grec. 1994, no. 413); the text includes an adverb "opoka" which is not Thessalian."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of the [http://history-of-macedonia.com/wordpress/2009/03/20/scientific-analysis-of-the-pella-curse-tablet-james-oneil-university-sydney/ same opinion] is James L. O'Neil's ([[University of Sydney]]) presentation at the 2005 Conference of the Australasian Society for Classical Studies, entitled "Doric Forms in Macedonian Inscriptions" (abstract):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A fourth‐century BC curse tablet from Pella shows word forms which are clearly Doric, but a different form of Doric from any of the west Greek dialects of areas adjoining Macedon. Three other, very brief, fourth century inscriptions are also indubitably Doric. These show that a Doric dialect was spoken in Macedon, as we would expect from the West Greek forms of Greek names found in Macedon. And yet later Macedonian inscriptions are in Koine avoiding both Doric forms and the Macedonian voicing of consonants. The native Macedonian dialect had become unsuitable for written documents."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Johannes Engels of the University of Cologne argues that the Pella curse tablet provides evidence to support that Macedonian was a North-West Greek dialect:&lt;ref name=Companion/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Another very important testimony comes from the so-called Pella curse tablet. This is a text written in Doric Greek and found in 1986 [...] This has been judged to be the most important ancient testimony to substantiate that Macedonian was a north-western Greek and mainly a Doric dialect."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63551">{{short description|The Americans prior to European influences}}The '''Pre-Columbian era''' incorporates all [[archaeology of the Americas|period subdivisions]] in the [[history of the Americas|history and prehistory of the Americas]] before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continent, spanning the time of the [[migration to the New World|original settlement]] in the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period to [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] during the [[Early Modern period]].

While the phrase "pre-Columbian era" literally refers only to the time preceding [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages of 1492, in practice the phrase is usually used to denote the entire history of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americas cultures]] until those cultures were exterminated, diminished, or extensively altered by Europeans, even if this happened decades or centuries after Columbus's first landing. For this reason the alternative terms of '''Precontact Americas''', '''Pre-Colonial Americas''' or '''Prehistoric Americas''' are also in use. In areas of [[Latin America]] the term usually used is '''Pre-Hispanic'''.

Many pre-Columbian [[civilization]]s established hallmarks which included permanent settlements, cities, [[agriculture]], civic and [[monument]]al [[architecture]], major [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], and [[Complex society|complex societal hierarchies]]. Some of these civilizations had long faded by the time of the first permanent European colonies and the arrival of enslaved Africans (c. late 16th–early 17th centuries),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tripline.net/trip/Early_European_Settlements_in_North_America-066434737501100388EFEC49781BFFB4|title=Early European Settlements in North America|work=Tripline|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are known only through [[archaeology of the Americas|archaeological investigations]] and [[oral history]]. Other civilizations were contemporary with the colonial period and were described in European historical accounts of the time. A few, such as the [[Maya civilization]], had their own written records. Because many Christian Europeans of the time viewed such texts as [[heresy|heretical]], men like [[Diego de Landa]] destroyed many texts in pyres, even while seeking to preserve native histories. Only a few hidden documents have survived in their original languages, while others were transcribed or dictated into Spanish, giving modern historians glimpses of ancient culture and knowledge.

Indigenous American cultures continue to evolve after the pre-Columbian era. Many of these peoples and their descendants continue traditional practices while evolving and adapting new cultural practices and technologies into their lives.

==History==
{{Human history}}Before the development of archaeology in the 19th century, historians of the pre-Columbian period mainly interpreted the records of the European conquerors and the accounts of early European travelers and antiquaries. It was not until the nineteenth century that the work of men such as [[John Lloyd Stephens]], [[Eduard Seler]] and [[Alfred P. Maudslay]], and of institutions such as the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] of [[Harvard University]], led to the reconsideration and criticism of the European sources. Now, the scholarly study of pre-Columbian cultures is most often based on scientific and multidisciplinary methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ignition |last=Bernal |title=A History of Mexican Archaeology: The Vanished Civilizations of Middle America |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |date=1980 |isbn=978-0-5007-8008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement of the Americas===
{{main article|Settlement of the Americas|Paleo-Indians}}
{{further|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}

Asian nomads are thought to have entered the [[Americas]] via the [[Bering Land Bridge]] (Beringia), now the [[Bering Strait]] and possibly along the coast. Genetic evidence found in [[Amerindian]]s' maternally inherited [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) supports the theory of multiple genetic populations migrating from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberwest.com/cw09/v9scwst1.html |title=Study confirms Bering land bridge flooded later than previously believed |work=Cyberwest |date=July 31, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/bering.htm |title=Bering Land Bridge National Preserve |publisher=National Park System}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of millennia, [[Paleo-Indians]] spread throughout North and South America. Exactly when the first group of people migrated into the Americas is the subject of much debate. One of the earliest identifiable cultures was the [[Clovis culture]], with sites dating from some 13,000 years ago. However, older sites dating back to 20,000 years ago have been claimed. Some [[Indigenous Amerindian genetics|genetic]] studies estimate the colonization of the Americas dates from between 40,000 and 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="SpencerWells2"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Spencer |last1=Wells |first2=Mark |last2=Read |title=The Journey of Man - A Genetic Odyssey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAsKm-_zu5sC&amp;pg=PA138 |publisher=Random House |isbn=0-8129-7146-9 |year=2002 |pages=138–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chronology of migration models is currently divided into two general approaches. The first is the ''short chronology theory'' with the first movement beyond [[Alaska]] into the [[New World|Americas]] occurring no earlier than 14,000–17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stefan |last=Lovgren |title=Americas Settled 15,000 Years Ago, Study Says |work=National Geographic News |date=March 13, 2008 |url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080313-first-americans.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnaa"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_701509129___0/First_Americans.html |title=First Americans |work= Encarta Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Microsoft |first=David J. |last=Meltzer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx7zKJiO?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_701509129___0/First_Americans.html |archivedate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.013 |last1=Fagundes |first1=Nelson J.R. |first2=Ricardo |last2=Kanitz |first3=Roberta |last3=Eckert |first4=Ana C.S. |last4=Valls |first5=Mauricio R. |last5=Bogo |first6=Francisco M. |last6=Salzano |first7=David Glenn |last7=Smith |first8=Wilson A. |last8=Silva |first9=Marco A. |last9=Zago |first10=Andrea K. |last10=Ribeiro-dos-Santos |first11=Sidney E.B. |last11=Santos |first12=Maria Luiza |last12=Petzl-Erler |first13=Sandro L. |last13=Bonatto |display-authors=3 |title=Mitochondrial Population Genomics Supports a Single Pre-Clovis Origin with a Coastal Route for the Peopling of the Americas |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=82 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=583–592 |pmid=18313026 |pmc=2427228}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Paul Robert |editor-last=Magocsi |title=Beginnings to 1500 C.E. |work=Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples |publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-8020-2938-6 |url=http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/p4/1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206163225/http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/p4/1 |archivedate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second belief is the ''long chronology theory'', which proposes that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 50,000–40,000 years ago or earlier.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlas of the Human Journey |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501094643/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-01 |work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marder|first=William|title=Indians in the Americas: The Untold Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Obgdz8auwkMC&amp;pg=PA11|year=2005|publisher=Book Tree|isbn=978-1-58509-104-1|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/ |title=Journey of mankind |work=BradShaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Vaughn M., Jr. |last=Bryant |title=Pre-Clovis |editor-last=Gibbon |editor-first=Guy E. |work=Archaeology of Prehistoric Native America: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0u2y_SVnmoC&amp;pg=PA682 |year=1998 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8153-0725-9 |pages=682-683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts have been found in both North and South America which have been [[carbon dating|dated]] to 14,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilford |first=John Noble |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/science/04fossil.html |title=Evidence Supports Earlier Date for People in North America |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accordingly humans have been proposed to have reached [[Cape Horn]] at the southern tip of South America by this time. In that case, the [[Inuit|Eskimo peoples]] would have arrived separately and at a much later date, probably no more than 2,000 years ago, moving across the ice from [[Siberia]] into Alaska.

]]The North American climate was unstable as the ice age receded. It finally stabilized by about 10,000 years ago; climatic conditions were then very similar to today's.&lt;ref name="icaage"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Imbrie|first1=John|last2=Imbrie|first2=Katherine Palmer|title=Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GIxRp9fRDGwC&amp;pg=PP1|year=1979|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this time frame, roughly pertaining to the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]], numerous [[archaeological culture]]s have been identified.

The unstable climate led to widespread migration, with early [[Paleo-Indian]]s soon spreading throughout the Americas, diversifying into many hundreds of culturally distinct tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2002).{{full|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paleo-Indians were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, likely characterized by small, mobile bands consisting of approximately 20 to 50 members of an extended family. These groups moved from place to place as preferred resources were depleted and new supplies were sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/281017 |last=Kelly |first=Robert L. |first2=Lawrence C. |last2=Todd |title=Coming into the Country: Early Paleo-Indian Hunting and Mobility |jstor=281017 |journal=[[American Antiquity]] |volume=53 |issue=2 |year=1988 |pages=231–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During much of the Paleo-Indian period, bands are thought to have subsisted primarily through hunting now-extinct [[megafauna|giant land animals]] such as [[mastodon]] and [[bison antiquus|ancient bison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breitburg |first1=Emanual |first2=John B. |last2=Broster |first3=Arthur L. |last3=Reesman |first4=Richard G. |last4=Stearns  |title=Coats-Hines Site: Tennessee's First Paleo-Indian Mastodon Association |journal=Current Research in the Pleistocene |volume=13 |year=1996 |pages=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paleo-Indian groups carried a variety of tools. These included distinctive projectile points and knives, as well as less distinctive implements used for butchering and hide processing.

The vastness of the North American continent, and the variety of its climates, [[ecology]], [[vegetation]], [[fauna]], and landforms, led ancient peoples to coalesce into many distinct [[linguistics|linguistic]] and cultural groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fagan|first1=Dr. Brian|last2=Durrani|first2=Nadia|title=People of the Earth: An Introduction to World Prehistory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8lwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1|edition=fourteenth|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34682-1}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the oral histories of the indigenous peoples, described by a wide range of traditional [[creation stories]] which often say that a given people have been living in a certain territory since the creation of the world.

Over the course of thousands of years, paleo-Indian people domesticated, bred and cultivated a number of plant species. These species were very nutritious, and they now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/agriculture-forestry-fishing-hunting/331083-1.html |title=Native Americans: The First Farmers |work=AgExporter |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=Allbusiness.com |accessdate=2011-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Arctic, Subarctic, and coastal peoples continued to live as hunters and gatherers, while agriculture was adopted in more temperate and sheltered regions. But wherever it was adopted, [[plant cultivation]] permitted a dramatic rise in population.&lt;ref name="icaage"/&gt;

=====Middle Archaic period=====
[[File:PreColumbian American cultures.png|thumb|Major cultural areas of the pre-Columbian Americas: {{legend0|#4747a1|Arctic}} {{legend0|#50828e|Northwest}} {{legend0|#40895d|Aridoamerica}} {{legend0|#b4581b|Mesoamerica}} {{legend0|#548434|Isthmo-Colombian}} {{legend0|#b1c759|Caribbean}} {{legend0|#b94343|Amazon}} {{legend0|#8b782a|Andes}}]]After the migration or migrations, it was several thousand years before the first complex societies arose, the earliest emerging about seven to eight thousand years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} As early as 6500 BCE, people in the Lower Mississippi Valley at the [[Monte Sano (mound complex)|Monte Sano]] site were building complex [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s, probably for religious purposes. This is the earliest dated of numerous mound complexes found in present-day [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]] and [[Florida]]. Since the late twentieth century, archeologists have explored and dated these sites.  They have found that they were built by [[hunter-gatherer]] societies, whose people occupied the sites on a seasonal basis, and who had not yet developed ceramics. [[Watson Brake]], a large complex of eleven platform mounds, was constructed beginning in 3400 BCE and added to over 500 years. This has changed earlier assumptions that complex construction arose only after societies had adopted agriculture, become sedentary, often developed stratified hierarchy, and generally also developed ceramics. These ancient people had organized to build complex mound projects from a different basis.

=====Late Archaic period=====
[[File:Poverty Point Aerial HRoe 2014.jpg|thumb|left|[[Poverty Point]], 1500 BCE]]
Until the accurate dating of [[Watson Brake]] and similar sites, the oldest mound complex was thought to be [[Poverty Point]], also located in the [[Lower Mississippi Valley]]. Built about 1500 BCE, it is the centerpiece of a culture extending over 100 sites on both sides of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. The Poverty Point site has earthworks in the form of six concentric half-circles, divided by radial aisles, together with some mounds. The entire complex is nearly a mile across.

Mound building was continued by succeeding cultures, who built numerous sites in the middle Mississippi and [[Ohio River]] valleys as well, adding [[effigy mounds]], conical and ridge mounds and other shapes.

====Woodland period====
{{Main article|Woodland period}}
[[File:Mound City Chillicothe Ohio HRoe 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Hopewell mounds from the [[Hopewell Culture National Historical Park|Mound City Group]] in Ohio]]
The [[Woodland period]] of North American pre-Columbian cultures refers to the time period from roughly 1000 [[Common Era|BCE]] to 1000 CE in the eastern part of North America. The term "Woodland" was coined in the 1930s and refers to prehistoric sites between the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] and the [[Mississippian culture]]s. The [[Adena culture]] and the ensuing [[Hopewell tradition]] during this period built monumental earthwork architecture and established continent-spanning trade and exchange networks.

This period is considered a developmental stage without any massive changes in a short period, but instead having a continuous development in stone and bone tools, leather working, textile manufacture, tool production, cultivation, and shelter construction. Some Woodland peoples continued to use spears and [[atlatl]]s until the end of the period, when they were replaced by [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]].

====Mississippian culture====
{{Main article|Mississippian Culture}}
[[File:Cahokia Aerial HRoe 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Cahokia]], the largest Mississippian culture site]]
The Mississippian culture was spread across the Southeast and Midwest from the Atlantic coast to the edge of the plains, from the Gulf of Mexico to the Upper Midwest, although most intensively in the area along the [[Mississippi River]] and [[Ohio River]]. One of the distinguishing features of this culture was the construction of complexes of large earthen [[Platform mound|mounds]] and grand plazas, continuing the [[mound builder (people)|moundbuilding]] traditions of earlier cultures. They grew [[maize]] and other crops intensively, participated in an extensive trade network and had a complex stratified society.  The Mississippians first appeared around 1000 CE, following and developing out of the less agriculturally intensive and less centralized Woodland period. The largest urban site of this people, [[Cahokia]]—located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]—may have reached a population of over 20,000.  Other chiefdoms were constructed throughout the Southeast, and its trade networks reached to the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia was the most populous city in North America. (Larger cities did exist in Mesoamerica and South America.) [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric [[New World|Americas]]. The culture reached its peak in about 1200–1400 CE, and in most places, it seems to have been in decline before the arrival of Europeans.

Many [[List of sites and peoples visited by the Hernando de Soto Expedition|Mississippian peoples]] were encountered by the expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] in the 1540s, mostly with disastrous results for both sides. Unlike the Spanish expeditions in Mesoamerica, who conquered vast empires with relatively few men, the de Soto expedition wandered the American Southeast for four years, becoming more bedraggled, losing more men and equipment, and eventually arriving in [[Mexico]] as a fraction of its original size. The local people fared much worse though, as the fatalities of diseases introduced by the expedition devastated the populations and produced much social disruption. By the time Europeans returned a hundred years later, nearly all of the Mississippian groups had vanished, and vast swaths of their territory were virtually uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudson|first=Charles M.|authorlink=Charles M.

====Historic tribes====
[[File:Nordamerikanische Kulturareale en.png|thumb|Cultural areas of pre-Columbian North America|alt=]]When the Europeans arrived, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples of North America]] had a wide range of lifeways from sedentary, agrarian societies to semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. Many formed new [[tribe]]s or confederations in response to European colonization. These are often classified by [[cultural region]]s, loosely based on geography. These can include the following:
* [[Circumpolar peoples|Arctic]], including [[Aleut people|Aleut]], [[Inuit]], and [[Yupik peoples]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Subarctic|Subarctic]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands|Northeastern Woodlands]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands|Southeastern Woodlands]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains|Great Plains]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Great Basin|Great Basin]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Northwest Plateau]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Northwest Coast]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of California|California]]
* [[Indigenous peoples of the Southwest|Southwest]] ([[Oasisamerica]])

Numerous pre-Columbian societies were sedentary, such as the [[Pueblo peoples]], [[Mandan]], [[Hidatsa]] and others, and some established large settlements, even cities, such as [[Cahokia]], in what is now [[Illinois]]. The [[Iroquois]] League of Nations or "People of the Long House" was a politically advanced, democratic society, which is thought by some historians to have influenced the [[United States Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The Effect of the Iroquois Constitution on the United States Constitution |first=Janet L. |last=Daly |url=http://www.ipoaa.com/iroquois_constitution_united_states.htm |work=IPOAA Magazine  |year=1997 |archive-date=July 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702105730/http://www.ipoaa.com/iroquois_constitution_united_states.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woods|first=Thomas E.|title=33 Questions about American History You're Not Supposed to Ask|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMcnBRKR-0C&amp;pg=PA62|year=2007|publisher=Crown Forum|isbn=978-0-307-34668-1|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States Senate|Senate]] passing a resolution to this effect in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/hconres331.pdf |title=H.

===Mesoamerica===
{{further|Mesoamerican chronology}}
[[File:Yaxchilan 1.jpg|thumb|One of the pyramids in the upper level of [[Yaxchilán]]|alt=|left]][[Mesoamerica]] is the region extending from central Mexico south to the northwestern border of [[Costa Rica]] that gave rise to a group of stratified, culturally related agrarian civilizations spanning an approximately 3,000-year period before the visits to the Caribbean by Christopher Columbus. ''Mesoamerican'' is the adjective generally used to refer to that group of pre-Columbian cultures. This refers to an environmental area occupied by an assortment of ancient cultures that shared religious beliefs, art, architecture, and technology in the Americas for more than three thousand years.
Between 2000 and 300 BCE, complex cultures began to form in Mesoamerica. Some matured into advanced pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], [[Teotihuacan]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]], [[Tarascan state|Purepecha]], [[Toltec]], and [[Mexica]]/[[Aztec]]s. The Mexica civilization is also known as the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]], since they were three smaller kingdoms loosely united together.&lt;ref name=1491Book&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Charles C. |authorlink=Charles C. Mann |title=[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]] |orig-year=2005 |year=2006 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=1-4000-3205-9 |pages=199–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Telamones Tula.jpg|thumb|Atlantes at [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]], [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]|alt=|left]]

These indigenous civilizations are credited with many inventions: building [[pyramid]]-temples, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], medicine, writing, highly accurate [[calendar]]s, [[Native American art|fine arts]], intensive agriculture, [[engineering]], an [[abacus]] calculator, and complex [[theology]]. They also invented the wheel, but it was used solely as a toy. In addition, they used native [[copper]], [[silver]] and [[gold]] for metalworking.

Archaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico (especially in the state of [[Nuevo León]]) demonstrate an early propensity for counting. Their number system was [[base 20]] and included [[zero]]. These early count-markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mesoamerican people before the arrival of Europeans. Many of the later Mesoamerican civilizations carefully built their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events.

The biggest Mesoamerican cities, such as [[Teotihuacan]], [[Tenochtitlan]], and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], were among the largest in the world. These cities grew as centers of commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and theology, and they radiated influence outwards onto neighboring cultures in central Mexico.

While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige, Mesoamerica can be said to have had five major civilizations: the Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Mexica and the Maya. These civilizations (with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their reach across Mesoamerica—and beyond—like no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these civilizations over the span of 4,000 years. Many made war with them, but almost all peoples found themselves within one of their spheres of influence.

[[Regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]] have been the subject of considerable research. There is evidence of trade routes starting as far north as the [[Mexican Plateau|Mexico Central Plateau]], and going down to the Pacific coast. These trade routes and cultural contacts then went on as far as [[Central America]]. These networks operated with various interruptions from pre-Olmec times and up to the Late Classical Period (600–900 CE).

====Olmec civilization====
{{Main article|Olmec}}
The earliest known civilization is the Olmec. This civilization established the cultural blueprint by which all succeeding indigenous civilizations would follow in Mexico. Pre-Olmec civilization began with the production of pottery in abundance, around 2300 BCE in the [[Grijalva River]] delta. Between 1600 and 1500 BCE, the Olmec civilization had begun, with the consolidation of power at their capital, a site today known as [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] near the coast in southeast [[Veracruz]].&lt;ref name=OLMECS&gt;{{cite book|title=The Olmecs: America's First Civilization|authorlink= Richard Diehl|last=Diehl|first=Richard A.|publisher=Thames and Hudson|year=2004|location=London|isbn=0-500-28503-9|pages=9–25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXd-QgAACAAJ&amp;pg=PA9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olmec influence extended across Mexico, into [[Central America]], and along the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. They transformed many peoples' thinking toward a new way of government, pyramid-temples, writing, astronomy, art, mathematics, economics, and religion. Their achievements paved the way for the Maya civilization and the civilizations in central Mexico.

====Teotihuacan civilization====
{{Main article|Teotihuacan}}
The decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico. Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan, first settled in 300 BCE. By 150 CE, Teotihuacan had risen to become the first true [[metropolis]] of what is now called North America. Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico. Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America, founding new dynasties in the Maya cities of [[Tikal]], [[Copan]], and [[Kaminaljuyú]].  Teotihuacan's influence over the Maya civilization cannot be overstated: it transformed political power, artistic depictions, and the nature of economics. Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city, such as [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]] from the Oaxaca region. They lived in apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city's economic and cultural prowess.  Teotihuacan's economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well. It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a monumental new era in Mexican civilization, declining in political power about 650 CE—but lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium, to around 950 CE.
[[File:Uxmal-mexico.jpg|thumb|Maya architecture at [[Uxmal]]]]

====Tarascan/Purepecha Civilization====
{{Main article|Tarascan State}} 
Initially, the lands that would someday comprise the lands of the powerful Tarascan Empire was inhabited by several independent communities. Around 1300, however, the first Cazonci, Tariacuri, united these communities and built them into one of the most advanced civilizations in Mesoamerica. Their capital at Tzintzuntzan was just one of the many cities--there were ninety more under its control. The Tarascan Empire was among the largest in Central America, so it is no surprise that they routinely came into conflict with the neighboring [[Aztec Empire]]. 
Out of all the civilizations in its area, the Tarascan Empire was the most prominent in metallurgy, harnessing copper, silver, and gold to create items such as tools, decorations, and even weapons and armor. Bronze was also used. 
The great victories over the Aztecs by the Tarascans cannot be understated. Nearly every war they fought in resulted in a Tarascan victory. 
Because the Tarascan Empire had little links to the former [[Toltec Empire]], they were also quite independent in culture from their neighbors. The Aztecs, [[Confederacy of Tlaxcala| Tlaxcalans]], Olmec, Mixtec, Maya, and others were very similar to each other, however. This is because they were all directly preceded by the Toltecs, and they therefore shared almost identical cultures. The Tarascans, however, possessed a unique religion, as well as other things.  

====Maya civilization====
{{Main article|Maya civilization}}
Contemporary with Teotihuacan's greatness was that of the Maya civilization. The period between 250 CE and 650 CE was a time of intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments. While the many Maya city-states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations, they exerted a tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico and Central America. The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent, and made innovations in mathematics, astronomy, and calendrics. The Mayans also evolved the only true writing system native to the Americas using pictographs and syllabic elements in the form of [[text (literary theory)|texts]] and [[codex|codices]] inscribed on stone, pottery, wood, or highly perishable books made from bark paper.

====Aztec/Mexica/Triple Alliance civilization====
{{Main article|Aztec}}
With the decline of the [[Toltec]] civilization came political fragmentation in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Into this new political game of contenders to the Toltec throne stepped outsiders: the [[Mexica]]. They were also a desert people, one of seven groups who formerly called themselves "Azteca", in memory of [[Aztlán]], but they changed their name after years of migrating. Since they were not from the Valley of Mexico, they were initially seen as crude and unrefined in the ways of [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] civilization. Through political maneuvers and ferocious fighting skills, they managed to become the rulers of Mexico as the head of the 'Triple Alliance' (which included two other "Aztec" cities, Texcoco and Tlacopan).

Latecomers to Mexico's central [[plateau]], the Mexica thought of themselves, nevertheless, as heirs of the civilizations that had preceded them. For them, arts, sculpture, architecture, engraving, feather-mosaic work, and the calendar, were bequest from the former inhabitants of Tula, the Toltecs.

The Mexica-Aztecs were the rulers of much of central Mexico by about 1400 (while Yaquis, Coras and Apaches commanded sizable regions of northern desert), having subjugated most of the other regional states by the 1470s.  At their peak, 300,000 Mexica{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} presided over a wealthy tribute-empire variously estimated at 5–8 million people in total a population of 8–12 millions. The actual population is never more than an estimate. The modern name "Mexico" comes from their name.

Their capital, [[Tenochtitlan]], is the site of modern-day capital of Mexico, [[Mexico City]].  At its peak, it was one of the largest cities in the world with population estimates of 200–300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Conquistador: Hernán Cortés, King Montezuma, and the last stand of the Aztecs |last=Levy |first=Buddy |date=2008 |publisher=Bantam Books Trade Paperbacks |isbn=9780553384710 |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSfO7xFo3BIC&amp;pg=PA106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The market established there was the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s on arrival.

{{see also|Andean civilizations}}
[[File:Fazenda Colorada.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Geoglyphs on deforested land in the Amazon rainforest]]
By the first millennium, South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains, and coasts were the home of millions of people. Estimates vary, but 30–50 million are often given and 100 million by some estimates. Some groups formed permanent settlements. Among those groups were [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]-speaking peoples ("[[Muisca people|Muisca]]" or "Muysca"), Valdivia, [[Quimbaya culture|Quimbaya]], [[Calima culture|Calima]] and the [[Tairona]]. The [[Muisca people|Muisca]] of [[Colombia]], postdating the [[Herrera Period]], [[Valdivia culture|Valdivia]] of [[Ecuador]], the [[Quechuas]] and the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]  of [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] were the four most important sedentary Amerindian groups in South America. From the 1970s, numerous [[geoglyph]]s have been discovered on deforested land in the [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Brazil]], supporting Spanish accounts of a complex, possibly ancient Amazonian civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html |title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon's Lost World |first=Simon |last=Romero |work=The New York Times |date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]] |date=December 2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia  |first1=Martti |last1=Pärssinen |first2=Denise |last2=Schaan  |first3=Alceu |last3=Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of pre-Columbian contact across the South Pacific Ocean between South America and [[Polynesia]] has received support from several lines of evidence, although solid confirmation remains elusive. A diffusion by human agents has been put forward to explain the pre-Columbian presence in [[Oceania]] of several [[plant cultivation|cultivated plant]] species native to South America, such as the [[bottle gourd]] (''Lagenaria siceraria'') or [[sweet potato]] (''Ipomoea batatas''). Direct archaeological evidence for such pre-Columbian contacts and transport have not emerged. Similarities noted in names of edible roots in Maori and Ecuadorian languages ("kumari") and Melanesian and Chilean ("gaddu") have been inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[Polynesian Society#Publications|Journal of the Polynesian Society]] |year=1923 |volume=32 |issue=128 |first=F.

&lt;/ref&gt; The origin and dating remains an open issue.  Whether or not early Polynesian–American exchanges occurred, no compelling human-genetic, archaeological, cultural or linguistic legacy of such contact has turned up.

====Norte Chico or Caral====
{{Main article|Norte Chico civilization}}
[[File:Caral-Supe in Peru.jpg|thumb|The ancient city of [[Caral]]]]
On the north-central coast of present-day [[Peru]], Norte Chico or Caral (as known in Peru) was a civilization that emerged around 3000 BCE (contemporary with urbanism's rise in [[Mesopotamia]].) It is considered one of the six [[cradles of civilization]] in the world.&lt;ref name=1491Book/&gt; It had a cluster of large-scale urban settlements of which the [[Sacred City of Caral]], in the Supe valley, is one of the largest and best studied sites. Norte Chico or Caral is the oldest known [[civilization]] in the [[Americas]] and persisted until around 1800 BCE.{{citation needed|date= January 2016}}

====Valdivia====
{{Main article|Valdivia culture}}
The [[Valdivia culture]] was concentrated on the coast of [[Ecuador]]. Their existence was recently discovered by archeological findings. Their culture is among the oldest found in the Americas, spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE. The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza.  They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing, though occasionally they hunted for deer. From the remains that have been found, scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated [[maize]], [[kidney bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[cassava]], hot peppers, and [[cotton]] plants, the last of which was used to make clothing. Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical, but it became showy, delicate, and big over time. They generally used red and gray colors; and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period. In its ceramics and stone works, the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works.

====Cañaris====
{{Main article|Cañari}}
The Cañari were the indigenous natives of today's Ecuadorian provinces of [[Cañar Province|Cañar]] and [[Azuay Province|Azuay]]. They were an elaborate civilization with advanced architecture and complex religious beliefs.  The Inca destroyed and burned most of their remains.  The Cañari's old city was replaced twice, first by the Incan city of [[Tumebamba]] and later on the same site by the colonial city of [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]. The city was also believed to be the site of [[El Dorado]], the city of gold from the mythology of Colombia. (see Cuenca)

The Cañari were most notable for having repelled the Incan invasion with fierce resistance for many years until they fell to [[Tupac Yupanqui]]. Many of their descendants are still present in Cañar.  The majority did not mix with the colonists or become Mestizos.
[[File:Museolarco.jpg|thumb|[[Larco Museum]] houses the largest private collection of pre-Columbian art. [[Lima]], [[Peru]].]]

====Chavín====
{{Main article|Chavín culture}}
The Chavín, a South American preliterate civilization, established a trade network and developed agriculture by 900 BCE, according to some estimates and archeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chavín in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters. The Chavín civilization spanned from 900 to 300 BCE.

==== Muisca ====
{{Main article|Muisca people}}
The [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]-speaking communities were the most numerous, the most territorially extended and the most socio-economically developed of the pre-Hispanic Colombians. By the 8th century, the indigenous people had established their civilization in the northern [[Andes]]. At one point, the Chibchas occupied part of what is now [[Panama]], and the high plains of the Eastern Sierra of [[Colombia]].

The areas which they occupied in Colombia were the present-day Departments of Santander (North and South), Boyacá and Cundinamarca.  This is where the first farms and industries were developed.  It is also where the independence movement originated. They are currently the richest areas in Colombia. The Chibcha developed the most populous zone between the Mayan and Inca empires. Next to the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] of Peru and the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] in Bolivia, the Chibcha of the eastern and north-eastern Highlands of Colombia developed the most notable culture among the [[sedentism|sedentary]] indigenous peoples in South America.

In the Colombian Andes, the Chibcha comprised several tribes who spoke similar languages ([[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]). They included the following: the [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Guane people|Guane]], [[Lache people|Lache]], [[Cofán]], and [[Chitarero people|Chitareros]].

====Moche====
{{Main article|Moche culture}}
The Moche thrived on the north coast of Peru from about 100 to 800 CE.  The heritage of the Moche is seen in their elaborate burials.  Some were recently excavated by [[UCLA]]'s [[Christopher B. Donnan]] in association with the [[National Geographic Society]].

As skilled artisans, the Moche were a technologically advanced people.  They traded with distant peoples such as the Maya.  What has been learned about the Moche is based on study of their ceramic pottery; the carvings reveal details of their daily lives. The [[Larco Museum]] of [[Lima]], [[Peru]] has an extensive collection of such ceramics.  They show that the people practiced [[human sacrifice]], had blood-drinking rituals, and that their religion incorporated non-procreative sexual practices (such as [[fellatio]]).

====Tiwanaku empire====
{{main|Tiwanaku empire}}
[[File:Zonnepoort tiwanaku.jpg|thumb|right|Gate of the Sun in Tiwanaku]]
The Tiwanaku empire was based in western [[Bolivia]] and extended into present-day [[Peru]] and [[Chile]] from 300 to 1000. Tiwanaku is recognized by Andean scholars as one of the most important South American civilizations prior to the [[Inca Empire]]; it was the ritual and administrative capital of a major state power for approximately five hundred years. The ruins of the ancient city state are near the south-eastern shore of [[Lake Titicaca]] in [[Tiwanaku Municipality]], [[Ingavi Province]], [[La Paz Department, Bolivia|La Paz Department]], about {{convert|72|km|miles}} west of [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]].

====Inca Empire====
{{Main article|Inca Empire}}
Holding their capital at the great [[cougar]]-shaped city of [[Cuzco]], the Inca civilization dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.  Known as  ''Tawantinsuyu'', or "the land of the four regions", in [[Quechuan languages|Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct and developed.  Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 40,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise  stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture. There is evidence of excellent metalwork and even successful [[brain surgery]] in Inca civilization.
{{wide image|95 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009.jpg|600px|The iconic [[Machu Picchu]], symbol of the Inca civilization.|center}}

====Cambeba====
{{Main article|Cambeba people}}
Also known as the Omagua, Umana and Kambeba, the Cambeba are an [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous people]] in Brazil's [[Amazon basin]]. The Cambeba were a populous, organized society in the late Pre-Columbian era whose population suffered steep decline in the early years of the [[Columbian Exchange]]. The Spanish explorer [[Francisco de Orellana]] traversed the [[Amazon River]] during the 16th century and reported densely populated regions running hundreds of kilometers along the river. These populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they used local wood as their construction material as stone was not locally available. While it is possible Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development among the Amazonians, their semi-nomadic descendants have the odd distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, [[aristocracy]]. Archaeological evidence has revealed the continued presence of semi-domesticated orchards, as well as vast areas of land enriched with [[terra preta]]. Both of these discoveries, along with Cambeba ceramics discovered within the same archaeological levels suggest that a large and organized civilization existed in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090302302.html |title=Scientists find evidence discrediting theory Amazon was virtually unlivable |first=Juan |last=Forero |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early inhabitants of the Americas developed agriculture, developing and breeding [[maize]] (corn) from ears 2–5&amp;nbsp;cm in length to the current size are familiar today. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[tomatillo]]s (a husked green tomato), [[pumpkin]]s, [[chili pepper]]s, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[bean]]s, [[pineapple]], [[sweet potato]]es, the [[Cereal|grains]] [[quinoa]] and [[amaranth]], [[cocoa bean]]s, [[vanilla]], [[onion]], [[peanut]]s, [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[Raspberry|raspberries]], [[Blueberry|blueberries]], [[Blackberry|blackberries]], [[papaya]], and [[avocado]]s were among other plants grown by natives. Over two-thirds of all types of food crops grown worldwide are native to the Americas.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

The natives began using fire in a widespread manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was taken up to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories, thereby making travel easier and facilitating the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants that were important for both food and medicines.  This created the [[Pre-Columbian savannas of North America]].&lt;ref name="Owen2002"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/sustain/report/terra2/terra2.htm |title=Chapter 2 (TERRA–2): The History of Native Plant Communities in the South |last=Owen |first=Wayne |work=Southern Forest Resource Assessment Final Report |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]], [[United States Forest Service]], Southern Research Station |date=December 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not as widespread as in other areas of the world (Asia, Africa, Europe), indigenous Americans did have [[livestock]]. [[Domesticated turkey]]s were common in Mesoamerica and in some regions of North America; they were valued for their meat, feathers, and, possibly, eggs. There is documentation of Mesoamericans utilizing hairless dogs, especially the [[Xoloitzcuintle]] breed, for their meat. Andean societies had [[llama]]s and [[alpaca]]s for meat and wool, as well as for [[Working animal|beasts of burden]]. [[Guinea pig]]s were raised for meat in the [[Andes]]. [[Iguana]]s and a range of wild animals, such as deer and [[pecari]], were another source of meat in Mexico, Central, and northern South America.

By the 15th century, maize had been transmitted from [[Mexico]] and was being farmed in the [[Mississippi embayment]], as far as the [[East Coast of the United States]], and as far north as southern Canada. Potatoes were utilized by the Inca, and [[chocolate]] was used by the Aztecs.

The initial peopling of Berinigia (depicted in light yellow) was followed by a standstill after which the ancestors of indigenous Americans spread swiftly all over the New World while some of the Beringian maternal lineages–C1a-spread westwards. More recent (shown in green) genetic exchange is manifested by back-migration of A2a into Siberia and the spread of D2a into north-eastern America that post-dated the initial peopling of the New World.]]

These SNPs mark the branch of a haplogroup, and indicate that all descendents of that haplogroup at one time shared a common ancestor. The Y-DNA SNP mutations were passed from father to son over thousands of years. Over time, additional SNPs occur within a haplogroup, leading to new lineages.  These new lineages are considered subclades of the haplogroup.  Each time a new mutation occurs, there is a new branch in the haplogroup, and therefore a new subclade.

[[Image:Ebbo Gospels St Mark.jpg|thumb|250px|St. Mark from the [[Ebbo Gospels]] (816&amp;ndash;835)]]
The '''School of Reims''' was the [[cathedral school]] of [[Reims Cathedral]] in [[France]] that was in operation during the [[Middle Ages]].  The term is also used of an artistic style in [[Carolingian art]], lasting into [[Ottonian art]] in works such as the gold relief figures on the cover of the [[Codex Aureus of Echternach]], which in fact were probably made in [[Trier]] in the 890s. Archbishop [[Ebbo]] (d. 851) promoted artistic production at the abbey at [[Hautvillers]], near the city. Major works probably made there in the 9th century include: the [[Ebbo Gospels]] (816&amp;ndash;835), the [[Utrecht Psalter]], which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the ''[[Bern Physiologus]]''.

Established by Archbishop [[Fulcon]] (822-900), the actual cathedral school attracted great names such as [[Hincmar]], the [[Archbishop of Reims]] between 845 and 882, the [[chronicler]] [[Flodoard]] (c. 893–966), [[Richerus]], monk of [[Abbey of Saint-Remi|Saint-Remi]] (died after 998), and Gerbert d'Aurillac (c.946–1003), who went on to become Archbishop of Reims and later [[Pope Sylvester II]].

A person may feel alienated by his work by not feeling like he has meaning to his work, therefore losing their sense of self at the work place. Self-estrangement contributes to burnout at work and a lot of psychological stress.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=William|title=The relationship between feelings of alienation and burnout in social work|journal=Families in Society|volume=75|issue=4|issn=1044-3894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociologists on the topic ==

=== Karl Marx ===
In [[Marx's theory of alienation]], he states that self-estrangement is the feeling of being alienated from people and things around you.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Karl Marx's theory focused more on the self-estrangement aspect in man's work. He further explain it by saying that self-estrangement is the alienation of man from himself and his feelings, man's loss of purpose, objectification of himself to think he isn't good enough and realization of that.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If someone denies self-estrangement, then they are confirming it as well; by dismissing it they are acknowledging that it is there.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marx states that self-estrangement is a huge factor in alienation.

=== Melvin Seeman ===
Melvin Seeman defined the meaning of alienation in his work ''On the Meaning of Alienation(1959).'' Seeman states that alienation is identified by five  alternative meanings: [[Social alienation|powerlessness]], meaninglessness, normlessness, isolation, and '''self-estrangement'''.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seeman|first=Melvin|date=1959-01-01|title=On The Meaning of Alienation|jstor=2088565|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=24|issue=6|pages=783–791|doi=10.2307/2088565}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-estrangement in relation to society is essentially being something less than what one might ideally be if the circumstances in society were different, and being insecure and conforming to society's expectations in all aspects of himself.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Furthermore, he mentions that alienation is man's loss of pride and satisfaction from doing their work and therefore feeling alienated.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

=== Robert K. Merton ===
[[Robert K. Merton]] does not directly define self-estrangement in his [[Robert K. Merton|Theory of Deviancy]], but he does touch upon the concept of self-estrangement. In his theory he mentions cultural goals and institutional means. Cultural goals are the ideas and aspirations people reach for and the institutional means are the steps and actions they take to achieve those aspirations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Social Structure and Anomie|jstor=2084686|journal=American Sociology Review|volume=3|issue=5|pages=672–682|last1=Merton|first1=Robert K|year=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;Merton considers&amp;nbsp;''ritualism''&amp;nbsp;the acceptance of the means but the forfeit of the goals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ritualists continue to subscribe to the means, but they have rejected the overall goal; this makes them feel alienated from their work causing '''self-estrangement'''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They work because they know they have to, not because they have a goal or reason they are doing the work.

=== Arlie Russell Hochschild ===
[[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] defined [[emotional labor]] and how it can make you feel estranged from yourself. This type of labor requires you to be in a good state of mind and feeling while in the work environment despite any problems you may be going through.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://caringlabor.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/the-managed-heart-arlie-russell-hochschild.pdf|title=The Managed Heart - Commercialization of Human Feeling|last=Hochschild|first=Arlie Russell|publisher=|year=1983|isbn=9780520272941|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At work you are expected to act a certain way and give the best customer service, even if you don't feel the way you act. This can be shown through always having a smile and acting happy while providing service to customers. For example, your boss may tell you to "leave your problems at home", meaning you must act like nothing is wrong even if you feel terrible. [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Hochschild]] uses an example of Delta flight attendants and how they must maintain an artificial state of elation throughout their workday despite their exhaustion and may even manage to take that artificial elation outside of their job into their real lives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This makes you feel detached and alienated from your own emotions and cause '''self-estrangement'''.

== In a worker ==
Self-estrangement in workers manifests in feelings of working just for a salary, doing one's job just to get it out of the way, or doing work to please others.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt; Although self-estrangement is a small factor, it still contributes to alienation, which contributes strongly to burnout at work. Self-estrangement may provoke different forms of psychic distress that potentially evoke symptoms of [[Occupational burnout|burnout]], or manifestations of stress that ruin work life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Self-estrangement and lack of meaning in one's work provokes a different form of psychic distress that evokes symptoms of burnout.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Marx's theory of alienation, a worker can feel self-estranged from their work, their production, and other workers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the person loses interest in why they are working, which can decrease their production and cause them to alienate themselves from other workers as well. The worker doesn't feel like he is a part of the workplace, therefore isolating himself from his work and others.

== In adolescents ==

Self-estrangement appears in many adolescents with low self-esteem. They may feel bored of life and like there is no purpose.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=School Alienation: Gender, Socio-economic Status and Anger in High School Adolescents|journal=Kuram Ve Uygulamada Egitim Bilimleri|volume=6|issue=3|issn=1303-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a purpose, these adolescents may feel as if no one around them understands them, and they may alienate themselves. This may cause a decline in performance at school because they feel that they have no purpose in doing homework and a decrease in working on developing friendships because they feel that they don't need them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In general, '''spectacle''' refers to an event that is memorable for the appearance it creates. Derived in [[Middle English]] from c. 1340 as "specially prepared or arranged display" it was borrowed from [[Old French]] ''spectacle'', itself a reflection of the [[Latin]] ''spectaculum'' "a show" from ''spectare'' "to view, watch" frequentative form of ''specere'' "to look at."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=spectacle&amp;searchmode=none Online Etymological Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''spectacle'' has also been a [[term of art]] in theater dating from the 17th century in English [[drama]].
==The masque and spectacle==
Court [[masque]]s and masques of the nobility were most popular in the [[James I of England|Jacobean]] and [[Charles I of England|Caroline]] era.  Such masques, as their name implies, relied heavily upon a non-verbal theater.  The character lists for masques would be quite small, in keeping with the ability of a small family of patrons to act, but the [[costume]]s and theatrical effects would be lavish.  Reading the text of masques, such as ''The Masque at Ludlow'' (most often referred to as ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]''), the writing is spare, philosophical, and grandiose, with very few marks of traditional dramatic structure.  This is partially due to the purpose of the masque being family entertainment and spectacle.  Unlike ''The Masque at Ludlow'', most masques were recreations of well-known mythological or religious scenes.  Some masques would derive from tableau.  For example, [[Edmund Spenser]] (''Fairie Queene'' I, iv) describes a masque of ''The [[Seven Deadly Sins]]''.  

Masques were [[multimedia]], for they almost always involved costuming and music as a method of conveying the story or narrative.  [[Ben Jonson]], for example, wrote masques with the architect [[Inigo Jones]].  [[William Davenant]], who would become one of the major [[impresario]]s of the [[English Restoration]], also wrote pre-Revolutionary masques with Inigo Jones.  The role of the architect was that of designer of the staging, which would be elaborate and often culminate in a [[fireworks]] show.

==The Hollywood spectacular==
When the [[zoetrope]] and [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]] technology first appeared, the earliest films were spectacles.  They caught the attention of common people. They showed things people would rarely see, and they showed it to the wide audience.
* [[Thomas Edison]] filmed [[Eiffel Tower]], actual [[American Indians in the United States|American Indians]] in a simulated attack, and even celebrated [[beauty contest|beauty queens]].
* [[Louis Lumière]] filmed a train pulling into a station in 1895 (''[[L'Arrivée d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]''). The camera was in front of the train, and the train "came" directly at the viewer. It astonished people unaccustomed to the illusion created by moving images.

==Spectacle and society==
Within industrial and post-industrial cultural and state formations, '''spectacle''' has been appropriated to describe appearances that are purported to be simultaneously enticing, deceptive, distracting and superficial. ([[Jonathan  Crary]]: 2005)  Current academic theories of spectacle "highlight how the productive forces of marketing, often associated with media and Internet proliferation, create symbolic forms of practice that are emblematic of everyday situations"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Alex|last2=Stringfellow|first2=Lindsay|last3=Maclean|first3=Mairi|last4=MacLaren|first4=Andrew|last5=O’Gorman|first5=Kevin|date=2015-03-24|title=Puppets of necessity? Celebritisation in structured reality television|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|volume=31|issue=5-6|pages=478–501|doi=10.1080/0267257X.2014.988282|issn=0267-257X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Spectacle can also refer to a society that critics describe as dominated by [[electronic media]], [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], and [[surveillance]], reducing citizens to spectators by political neutralization. Recently the word has been associated with the many ways in which a [[capitalist]] structure is purported to create play-like celebrations of its products and leisure time consumption. The work of French Marxist thinker [[Guy Debord]] is perhaps the best-known example of this critical analysis; see his ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967)

The '''Thai–Laotian Border War''' (December 1987 – February 1988) was a short confrontation between Thai and Laotian forces. It involved a dispute over the map made by French surveyors in 1907 to mark the borders between [[Siam]] and [[French Indochina]] in the southern [[Luang Prabang Range]]. Ownership of the village of Ban Romklao on the border of [[Phitsanulok Province]] and three small border villages on the edge of [[Uttaradit Province]] was left unclear. This is the same map underlying the [[Cambodian–Thai border dispute]]. The agreed criterion for determining ownership was the natural watershed, but the French map makers at times ignored this.&lt;ref name=Nation-20110208&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/08/national/national_30028783.php |title=Lao border talks progressing |author=Supalak Ganjanakhundee |date=March 8, 2007 |work=The Nation |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |quote=Officials from both sides will start to conduct aerial photography for mapping this month before beginning the demarcation process and plan to complete the task by 2010. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005000742/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/08/national/national_30028783.php |archivedate=October 5, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of minor shooting incidents had occurred between Thai and Laotian forces in 1984. In December 1987, however, Thai armed forces occupied the disputed village of Ban Romklao, raising the Thai flag over it. The government of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]] protested strongly, insisting the village was part of [[Botene District]] of [[Sainyabuli Province]]. Thailand replied that the village belonged to [[Amphoe Chat Trakan|Chat Trakan]] District (''[[amphoe]]'') of  Phitsanulok Province. [[Lao People's Armed Forces|Laotian Army]] forces staged a night attack on the small Thai garrison, driving the Thai soldiers from the village and replacing the Thai flag with that of the Lao PDR. Serious fighting followed, continuing for weeks until a cease-fire was declared on 19 February 1988.

The brief war claimed a total of about 1,000 casualties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savada|first1=Andrea Matles|last2=Whitaker|first2=Donald P|title=Laos: a country study|date=1995|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington DC|page=285|url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.laoscountrystudy00sava_0/?sp=335|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Thais suffering more heavily since for much of the war they were attacking entrenched Laotian positions. Gen [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] was the commander of the Royal Thai Army at the time of the war and was criticized for engaging in it against the wishes of the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs. [[Vietnam]] had assisted its socialist ally, sending troops from its 2nd Division to Baan Nakok air field in Sainyabuli to support the Laotian military operations, amidst the [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|border clashes with Thailand]] along the Thai&amp;ndash;Cambodian border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Banerjee|first1=Sumantra|title=New Tension Point|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=1988-01-16|volume=23|issue=3|page=62|jstor=4377962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Thai-Lao Joint Boundary Commission (JBC) was established in 1996 to clarify the 1,810-kilometre boundary and settle ownership of the disputed villages. {{Asof|2007}} border demarcation was on-going.&lt;ref name=Nation-20110208/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">'''''The Megaliths of Upper Laos''''' (orig. French: ''Les Megaliths du Haut Laos'') is a 1930 work of [[archaeology]] by [[Madeleine Colani]], examining and cataloging approximately ten thousand [[megalith]]s in [[Laos|Upper Laos]].&lt;ref name="hills-2008"&gt;Ben Hills, [http://www.smh.com.au/travel/activity/great-outdoors/crack-open-the-jars-20081113-63u7.html "Crack open the jars"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Oct. 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to Colani's work, the megaliths were considered among the more mysterious megaliths.&lt;ref name="NYT-2012"&gt;Elisabeth Eaves, [http://travel.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/travel/in-laos-the-lady-and-the-jars.html "In Laos, the Lady and the Jars"], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Colani, after reviewing the [[Plain of Jars]] for decades, cataloged the megaliths and argued "convincingly" in ''The Megaliths of Upper Laos'' that they were [[urn]]s,&lt;ref name="NYT-2012" /&gt; used in [[Bronze Age]] [[funerary rites]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell Ciochon and Jamie James, [http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/laoskeep.html "Laos Keeps Its Urns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715053256/http://www.uiowa.edu/~bioanth/laoskeep.html |date=2009-07-15 }}, Ciochon's Bioanthropology Website, University of Iowa (last visited July 16, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Megaliths of Upper Laos'', a two-volume, 600-page work that both cataloged and described the artifacts, and presented Colani's theories as to their origin and use, has been described as Colani's "great contribution to archaeological literature".&lt;ref name="NYT-2012" /&gt;  The book brought the megaliths to the broader attention of the Western public and scholarly community.&lt;ref name="hills-2008" /&gt;

'''Tomáš Petráček''' (born 1972 in [[Hořice v Podkrkonoší]]) is a Czech [[public intellectual]], [[Roman Catholic]] priest, and scholar. He is considered one of the country's leading [[Church history|church]] and [[Social history|social]] historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transkulturnikomunikace.cz/in/40/phdr_tomas_petracek_ph_d_th_d.url|title=doc.

He is an active member of the editorial board for the Czech journal Salve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salve.op.cz/kontakt|title=KONTAKT A REDAKCE|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with theological, historical, philosophical and cultural themes. As a Roman Catholic priest he serves as chaplain of the academic community in [[Hradec Králové]]. He was appointed Canon of the Chapter of All Saints at [[Prague Castle]], founded in 1339 by Emperor and [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles IV]] for professors of Charles University, in 2010.

== Education ==
He attended grammar school in his hometown of [[Hořice (Jičín District)|Hořice]] in Eastern Bohemia from 1986 to 1990. He studied at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague with a specialization in History and Ethnology from 1990 to 1992 and from 1996 to 1999. He graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Master's degree in 1999.
 
Following his Master's degree, he went on to pursue his doctorate at the same university, at the Institute of Economic and Social History, Faculty of Arts. In March 2002, he successfully defended his doctoral dissertation entitled "The Phenomenon of Donated People in 11th–12th century Przemyslite Territories" and was awarded a PhD in the field of economic and social history. Petráček was greatly influenced by his doctoral supervisor [[Jaroslav Čechura|Prof. Jaroslav Čechura]], and by Czech social historians Prof. [[Eduard Maur]] and Prof. [[Jiří Štaif]].

From 1999 to 2002 he studied at the Catholic Theological Faculty of Charles University in Prague. In 2000, he joined a seminary. From 2002 to 2005 he continued theological studies at the Theological Faculty of the [[University of Fribourg]] in Switzerland, where in 2005 he passed the final examination and received the title Licentia in Sacra Theologia (insigni cum laude). His supervisor was Prof. OP [[Guy Bedouelle]], and Prof. [[Mariano Delgado]] also had a considerable influence on him.

From 2006–2008, he studied a doctoral program at the St. Cyril and Methodius Faculty of Theology in [[Olomouc]], where he specialized in Church History. In February 2008, he successfully defended his dissertation and received the title Doctor of Theology (Th.D.). In June 2012, he achieved habilitation in the field of Czech history at the Faculty of Arts, Charles University, Prague. His habilitation thesis was entitled "The Bible and the Historical-Critical Method: the Czech and World Progressive [[Exegesis]] in the Vortex of the (Anti-)Modernist Crisis.”

Petráček has also completed short study stays at [[University of Bonn|Friedrich Wilhelm University]] in Bonn (1997), [[L'Institute Catholique]] in Paris (2002), the Faculty of Divinity at [[Yale University]] (2013), a five-month internship at [[Collegio Teutonico]] in Rome/Vatican City (2007) in which he studied archives of the [[Vatican Archive|Secret Vatican archives]], and a two-month study residency at the Philosophische und theologische Hochschule St. Georgen Frankfurt am Main (2010, 2011). He spend summer semester as visiting fellow at Yale University in 2015.

== Work ==
The first topic that Petráček chose to investigate in his scholarly work was the social and [[economic history]] of the early [[Middle Ages]] in the [[Czech lands]], focusing on the lower strata of society in particular. This work resulted in the 2003 publication of the [[monograph]] The Phenomenon of Donated People in the Czech Lands in the 11th – 12th Centuries: On the Knowledge of Economic and Social History of the Czech Lands at the Time of Dukes. A second, revised and expanded version of the book was published in 2012 by the prestigious publishing house Argo under the title Serfs and Freemen, Dukes and Manorial Estates: the Phenomenon of Donated People in Premyslid Bohemia in the 10th–12th Centuries. (Nevolníci a svobodní, kníže a velkostatek. Fenomén darovaných lidí přemyslovských zemí 10.–12. století).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argo.cz/knihy/175466/nevolnici-a-svobodni-knize-a-velkostatek/|title=Nevolníci a svobodní, kníže a velkostatek|author=Petráček Tomáš|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petráček has also published numerous other studies and articles concerning social, economic and religious history. In 2017 he published his book Power and Exploitation in the Czech Lands in the 10th - 12th Centuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/33188259/Power_and_Exploitation_in_the_Czech_Lands_in_the_10th_-12th_Centuries._A_Central_European_Perspective._ECEE_40._Leiden_-_Boston_Brill_2017._ISBN_978-90-04-28488-3|title=Power and Exploitation in the Czech Lands in the 10th - 12th Centuries|author=Petráček Tomáš|publisher=Brill|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Central European Perspective as Volume 40 of Brill´s Series „East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450“.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://brill.com/view/serial/ECEE|title=East Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 450-1450|publisher=Brill|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While studying theology, Petráček began to concern himself with issues in the history of Catholic exegesis during the modernist crisis. One of the key figures in Fribourg was the [[Old Testament studies|Old Testament Exegesis]] Professor [[Vincent Zapletal]] (1867–1938) of the [[Dominican Order]], who worked at the Theological Faculty of the University from 1893 to 1928. Zapletal was among the most significant figures in progressive Catholic exegesis, along with the French biblical scholar [[Marie-Joseph Lagrange|Marie Joseph Lagrange]] OP and German [[Jesuit]] Franz von Hummelauer. Zapletal sought a scientific interpretation of the Bible and employed a historical-critical method, and became a victim of the anti-modernist crisis in the Catholic Church between 1904 and 1914. Petráček completed a critical biography entitled Bible Science in the Period of the (Anti-)[[Modernist Crisis]]: The Life and Work of Vincent Zapletal OP (1897–1938). It was published in 2006 in the Czech Republic (Výklad Bible v církvi v době (anti-)modernistické krize. Život a dílo Vincenta Zapletala OP (1897–1938)). There was also an abridged French version, Le Pere Vincent Zapletal O.P. (1867–1938). Portrait d'un exegete catholique. Studia friburgensia – Series historica 6, [[Fribourg]] 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulusedition.ch/academic_press/product.php?id_product=1103|title=102 / Le Père Vincent Zapletal O.P. (1867–1938)|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the life of Zapletal before the appearance of the anti-modernist crisis and its aftermath. Petráček has also published numerous studies and articles appearing in the academic journals such as [[Revue Biblique]] or [[Memoire Dominicaine]] and most of them in the Czech journal Salve. The culmination of his research work is The Bible and Modern Criticism: Progressive Czech and World Exegesis in the Vortex of the (Anti-)Modernist Crisis, which was published by the Vyšehrad publishing house in 2011 (Česká a světová progresivní exegeze ve víru (anti-)modernistické krize).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivysehrad.cz/kniha/bible-a-moderni-kritika-ceska-a-svetova-progresivni-exegeze-ve-viru-anti-modernisticke-krize/|title=Bible a moderní kritika / Česká a světová progresivní exegeze ve víru (anti-)modernistické krize - iVyšehrad.cz|author=Petráček Tomáš|date=30 January 2012|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other scholarly interests of Petráček include historical [[anthropology]] and issues related to cross-cultural communication, adaptation, and the diversity and dynamics of society and culture in European history, particularly in the area of church, social and religious history. Petráček has examined the question of the causes and roots of the dynamic secularization of the Czech lands and in 2013 published Secularization and Catholicism in the Czech lands: Specific Aspects of the Czech Route from National Church to the Most Atheist Country in the World. (Sekularizace a katolicismus v českých zemích. Specifické rysy české cesty od lidové církve k nejateističtější zemi světa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transkulturnikomunikace.cz/in/323/tomas_petracek.url|title=Tomáš Petráček|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In investigating the underlying causes of secularization trends, Petráček has looked into the overall adaptive ability of Christianity, publishing articles and studies concerning this issue as well as a monograph in 2013 entitled Adaptation, Resistance, Resignation: The Church, Society and Changes in Modern History (Adaptace, resistance, rezignace. Církev, společnost a změna v novověkých dějinách).

In the Polish publishing house El Press he published three monographs in English. In his first English book In the Maelstrom of Secularization, Collaboration and Persecution. Roman Catholicism in Modern Czech Society and the State, author explores the various processes which culminated in Roman Catholicism drastically falling in both position and status in the modern Czech culture, society, and state, thus rendering a privileged and self-confident national church a problematic, humiliated, barely tolerated and, for much of the 20th century, brutally persecuted community. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/10471766/In_the_Maelstrom_of_Secularization_Collaboration_and_Persecution._Roman_Catholicism_in_Modern_Czech_Society_and_the_State&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second English book Church, Society and Change. Christianity impaired by conflicting elites, he presents four model situations to proof, that the way in which the Christian elites of the different confessions coped with the primary problem of a divided Christendom is interpreted as a moment of rupture in the history of the Western church, which undermined its adaptive and innovative capacities and so set European society on the path to modern secularisation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/9525118/Church_Society_and_Change._Christianity_impaired_by_conflicting_elites&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third with the title Man, Values and the Dynamics of Medieval Society. Anthropological Concepts of the Middle Ages in a Transcultural Perspective, the author analyses how Medieval culture and civilization in Europe was able to come to terms with cultural, social and religious plurality and diversity without posing a threat to solidarity, openness, dynamism and the actual functioning of society using selected phenomena such as Inquisition, Canon Law, Cult of Relics etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/10877726/Man_Values_and_the_Dynamics_of_Medieval_Society._Anthropological_Concepts_of_the_Middle_Ages_in_a_Transcultural_Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Petraček continued his research in the field modern social and church history with the book The Council, Tradition, Reform. The Legacy of the Second Vatican Council.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/28736161/C%C3%8DRKEV_TRADICE_REFORMA._Odkaz_Druh%C3%A9ho_vatik%C3%A1nsk%C3%A9ho_koncilu_Vy%C5%A1ehrad_Praha_2016_240_s._in_Czech_with_english_Summary_The_Church_Tradition_Reform._The_Legacy_of_the_Second_Vatican_Council_&lt;/ref&gt; This highly appreciated  monograph is primarily focused on the question of continuity and discontinuity in the area of the modern history of the Catholic Church in relation to the most significant events of Church history of the 20th century, that is the Second Vatican Council. 

In 2017 he published small book with the title The West and its Faith: 9.5 Theses on the Impact of Luther‘s Reformation. The 500th anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation gave him, in particular within the context of the contemporary development of the position and role of the church in western society, an opportunity for more general thoughts concerning the influence of the events of the sixteenth century on the history of Christianity, the church and society.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/35628859/Z%C3%81PAD_A_JEHO_V%C3%8DRA._9_5_teze_k_dopad%C5%AFm_Lutherovy_reformace._Praha_Vy%C5%A1ehrad_2017._ISBN_978-80-7429-911-7_The_West_and_its_Faith_9.5_Theses_on_the_Impact_of_Luther_s_Reformation_&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently he published also some studies in Modern czech social and church history, such as  The First and Second Life of Father Josef Toufar (1902–1950) and Shifts in Interpretations of Modern Czech History. On One Unexpected Phenomenon in Comtemporary Czech Society in journal Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte/Contemporary Church History&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/36420936/The_First_and_Second_Life_of_Father_Josef_Toufar_1902-1950_and_Shifts_in_Interpretations_of_Modern_Czech_History._On_One_Unexpected_Phenomenon_in_Comtemporary_Czech_Society_in_Kirchliche_Zeitgeschichte_Contemporary_Church_History_2016_29_Heft_2_s._355-369._ISSN_0932-9951&lt;/ref&gt; or study about the collaboration of Catholic clergy with Communist régime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/35278439/Quelques_r%C3%A9flexions_concernant_les_pr%C3%AAtres_face_%C3%A0_l_%C3%89tat_totalitaire_communiste_dans_son_contexte_historique_in_Revue_Th%C3%A9ologique_des_Bernardins._Novembre_2016_Hors_S%C3%A9rie._La_th%C3%A9ologie_tch%C3%A8que_aujourd_hui._S._73-89._ISBN_978-88918-934-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Petráček has worked at the Institute of Christian Art History at the Catholic Theological Faculty of Charles University since 2005, where he gives lectures on church, culture and social history in undergraduate and graduate programs of theology and the history of [[Christian art]]. He also leads a group of PhD students in the doctoral program Church and General History at the same Faculty. Already four of his doctoral students finished their studies and achieved Ph.D. title.

In 2007, he was appointed head of the Department of Cultural and Religious Studies at the Faculty of Education at the University of Hradec Králové. Under Petráček's guidance, the department has come to distinguish itself as one this university's most prolific departments for publications, and offers a very engaging study program in Transcultural Communication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transkulturnikomunikace.cz/17/english.url|title=Transkulturní komunikace - bakalářský studijní program na Pedagogické fakultě Univerzity Hradec Králové - Stranka|publisher=|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies, which also includes an English language study option. Conferences and other activities organized by the department have included such guests as Templeton prize winner Prof. [[Tomáš Halík]], [[Hinduism]] specialist Prof. [[Julius Lipner]] of Cambridge and Italian professor and philosopher [[Umberto Gallimberti]].

==Early life and education==
Yehuda Liebes was born in [[Jerusalem]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; His father, [[:he:יוסף גרהרד ליבס|Joseph Gerhard Liebes]] (1910–1988), a noted Hebrew translator of classic literature, left his native Germany at the age of 18 to study at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He returned to his homeland to continue his education, but was expelled from his university due to the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. He then undertook agricultural training in [[Latvia]] with a Zionist movement. There he married his first wife, with whom he settled in [[Pardes Hanna-Karkur|Pardes Hanna]] in [[Mandatory Palestine]] and had two daughters before they divorced.

Liebes was acquainted with [[Gershom Scholem]], the father of modern Kabbalah scholarship, from an early age, as his parents were friends of Scholem. Scholem attended Yehuda's [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]] and gave him as a gift [[:he:ישעיה תשבי|Yeshayahu Tishby]]'s book ''Mishnat HaZohar'' ("The Wisdom of the [[Zohar]]").&lt;ref name=musaf/&gt;

 |quote=I do not really like the term 'Jewish mysticism'. The order of the words is not correct. You have to say 'mystical Judaism', because Kabbalah is first and foremost an interpretation of an aspect of the Jewish religion. … The inclusion of all mystical phenomena under the heading 'mysticism' is a mistake, because it causes people to think everything is the same—Christian mysticism, Jewish mysticism, Muslim mysticism. The Kabbalah is an interpretation of the Jewish religion, of [[Torah]] and [[Mitzva|mitzvot]], of the people and the land of Israel".

Liebes has also translated Greek, Latin, and Arabic religious poetry into Hebrew.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Controversial views==
Challenging the traditional ascription of the Zohar to the 2nd-century disciples of [[Shimon bar Yochai]] in [[Israel]], Liebes asserts that a group of 13th-century Spanish Kabbalists, which included [[Moses de León]], composed the work, each reflecting his own approach to Kabbalah.&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; Liebes claims that the ''Ketem Paz'' on the Zohar and the Kabbalistic hymn ''[[Bar Yochai (song)|Bar Yochai]]'' were written by two different authors with similar names, not the one [[Shimon Lavi]] who is traditionally credited with authoring both works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.nli.org.il/sites/nlis/he/Song/pages/Articles/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8_%D7%A8'_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90.aspx |title= ר' שמעון לביא |language=Hebrew|trans-title=Rabbi Shimon Lavi|publisher=[[National Library of Israel]]|accessdate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebes also finds Christian and Sabbatean inspiration in the ideas of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]]&lt;ref name=alan/&gt; and, at the same time, Sabbatean influences on the disciples of the Vilna Gaon [[Misnagdim|who opposed Hasidism]].&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes angered [[Religious Zionism|National Religious]] Jews in Israel when he claimed to find a Christian allusion in the [[Amidah]], the central prayer of the [[Jewish prayer|Jewish liturgy]]. Liebes asserted that the conclusion of the 14th blessing, "''keren yeshua''" ("horn of salvation") refers not to [[David]], but to [[Jesus]] (''Yeshua'' in Hebrew).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

Liebes publishes in Hebrew and has expressed opposition to the study of Jewish thought in English. He has allowed only a few of his works to be translated into English, in conjunction with his academic degree and tenure.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Liebes received the 1997 [[Bialik Prize]] for his book ''The Secret of the Sabbatean Faith'' (1995).&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt; In 1999 he received the Peace Prize for the study of Kabbalah&lt;ref name=huji/&gt; and the Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academy.ac.il/RichText/GeneralPage.aspx?nodeId=1079|title=Gershom Scholem Prize for Kabbalah Research|publisher=[[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the 2006 [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture| EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], in the category of Humanities, for his work on Sabbateanism.&lt;ref name=haaretz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.emetprize.org/laureates/humanities/jewish-philosophy/prof-yehuda-liebes/|title=Emet Prize Laureates|publisher=Emet Prize for Science, Art and Culture|accessdate=4 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he received the [[Israel Prize]] for his work on Kabbalah and Jewish mysticism.&lt;ref name=huji/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/Flash.aspx/380233|title=Israel Prize for Kaballah to Professor Yehuda Liebes|date=5 February 2017|accessdate=21 January 2018|work=[[Arutz Sheva|Israel National News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
