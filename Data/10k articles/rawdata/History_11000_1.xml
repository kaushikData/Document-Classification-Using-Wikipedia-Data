[[Image:2004-10-29 Bin Laden still.jpg|frame|A still of the 2004 [[Osama bin Laden]] video]]

On October 29, 2004, at 21:00 [[UTC]], [[al Jazeera]] broadcast excerpts allegedly from a '''videotape of [[Osama bin Laden]]''' addressing the people of the [[United States]]; in this video, he accepts responsibility for the [[September 11 attacks]], condemns the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] government's response to those attacks, and presents those attacks as part of a campaign of revenge and deterrence motivated by his witnessing of the destruction in the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982. News analysts speculated that the release of the video was timed to influence the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential election]], which would take place four days later.

==Content==
The video is reported to be 18 minutes in length; Osama only speaks for 14 minutes 39 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2004-10-30|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/29/binladen.tape/index.html|title=Bin Laden: Al Qaeda motivated to strike U.S. again|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210052450/http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/29/binladen.tape/index.html |archivedate=10 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Jazeera]] released a transcript of the complete tape on November 1, 2004.&lt;ref name="alj2004"&gt;{{cite news |date=2004-11-01|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html |title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech |publisher=[[Al-Jazeera]]|accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116092323/http://english.aljazeera.net/archive/2004/11/200849163336457223.html |archivedate=16 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden appears wearing a [[turban]] and a white robe partially covered by a golden [[Mantle (clothing)|mantle]], standing in front of an almost featureless brown background and reading his comments from papers resting on a podium. He moves both of his arms (dispelling rumors that one of them is limp after having been wounded) and looks healthy as far as can be told, but a bit older and greyer than in his former tapes. His remarks, in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] but addressed to citizens of the [[United States]], instruct them that "the best way to avoid another [[Manhattan]]" (a reference to the September 11, 2001 attacks), is to not threaten the security of Muslim nations, such as Palestine and Lebanon.

He speaks of his desire to bankrupt the U.S., saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[It is] easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two mujahidin to the furthest point east to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qaeda, in order to make the generals race there and cause America to suffer human, economic, and political losses. ... This is in addition to our having experience in using [[guerrilla warfare]] and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers, as we, alongside the mujahidin, [[Soviet–Afghan War|bled]] [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] for 10 years, until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He dismisses as rhetoric claims by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] that the attacks occurred because Islamic extremists "hate freedom", saying: "If Bush says we hate freedom, let him tell us why we didn't attack [[Sweden]], for example. It is known that freedom-haters don't have defiant spirits like those of [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|the 19]]—may God have mercy on them".&lt;ref name="alj2004"/&gt;

Bin Laden further accuses U.S. President George W. Bush of misleading the American people during the previous three years—"Despite entering the fourth year after September 11, Bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened"—as well as criticizing Bush's actions on the day of the attacks: "It never occurred to us that the [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the country would leave 50,000 citizens in the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|two towers]] to face those horrors alone because he thought listening to a child [[The Pet Goat|discussing her goats]] was more important."

==Immediate reactions==
[[Image:20041029-18 bush statement.jpg|thumb|250px|George W. Bush delivered a short statement to the media in front of [[Air Force One]] at Toledo, Ohio Express Airport, hours after the tape was broadcast]]

George W. Bush said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me make this very clear: Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country. I'm sure Senator Kerry agrees with this. I also want to say to the American people that we're at war with these terrorists and I am confident that we will prevail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Presidential candidate Senator [[John Kerry]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me make it clear, crystal clear: as Americans, we are absolutely united in our determination to hunt down and destroy Osama bin Laden and the terrorists. They are barbarians, and I will stop at absolutely nothing to hunt down, capture or kill the terrorists wherever they are, whatever it takes. Period.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Intelligence response==
Even though [[al Jazeera]] (when broadcasting the footage on its evening newscast) did not disclose the source of the video, sources within the United States intelligence community have confirmed{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} that the speaker, who appears behind a lectern, is indeed bin Laden. By mentioning 2004 U.S. presidential candidate [[John Kerry]] by name, the tape would seemed to prove that bin Laden was still alive at least midway through 2004, which was not known by certainty at the time.

According to the [[Agence France-Presse]], U.S. diplomats in [[Qatar]] were given a copy of a videotape of Osama before it aired on al Jazeera television; the diplomats unsuccessfully sought to prevent the [[Arabic language]] network from broadcasting it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/30/1099028265955.html "US tried to stop Al-Jazeera broadcast"], ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', October 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States State Department]] requested that the government of [[Qatar]] (where Al Jazeera is located) discourage the station from airing the videotape, according to a senior State Department official.

Even though the tape was analyzed by American intelligence to determine if it contains any coded messages to operatives, White House spokesman [[Scott McClellan]] commented that there were no plans to raise the [[Homeland Security Advisory System|U.S. terrorism alert level]], as no specific threats were made in the tape.

[[Ron Suskind]] noted that the CIA analysis of the video led them to the consensus view that the tape was designed strategically to help President Bush win reelection in 2004. Deputy CIA director [[John E. McLaughlin]] noted at one meeting, "Bin Laden certainly did a nice favor today for the President." Suskind quoted [[Jami Miscik]], CIA deputy associate director for intelligence, as saying "Certainly, he would want Bush to keep doing what he's doing for a few more years."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Parry (journalist)|Robert Parry]], [http://www.consortiumnews.com/2006/070306.html ''CIA: Osama Helped Bush in '04''], [[Robert Parry (journalist)|Consortiumnews.com]], July 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The same speculation has been made by [[Bahukutumbi Raman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Raman |first=Bahukutumbi |title=OBL's tape: One more spin in US presidential campaign? |date=2004-11-01 |url=http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/papers12/paper1155.html |accessdate=2008-11-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029023122/http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/papers12/paper1155.html |archivedate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public response==
The 2004 tape boosted the popularity of George W. Bush. President Bush opened up a six-point lead over his opponent Senator John Kerry in the first opinion poll to include sampling taken after the videotape was broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Sherwell |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1475515/Bush-takes-a-six-point-lead-after-new-bin-Laden-tape.html |title=Bush takes a six-point lead after new bin Laden tape |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2004-11-01 |accessdate=2008-11-16| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206183353/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1475515/Bush-takes-a-six-point-lead-after-new-bin-Laden-tape.html| archivedate=6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themonkeycage.org/2012/11/03/the-2004-october-surprise-and-what-it-means-for-2012/|title=The 2004 October Surprise, and What It Means for 2012|last=Sides|first=John|date=3 November 2012|publisher=The Monkey Cage|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kerry won the category of people who considered the tape "very important" 53% to 47% according to CNN's exit poll.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angus Lindsay Wright''' is professor [[emeritus]] and one of the founders of the Environmental Studies program at [[California State University, Sacramento]], where he taught from 1972–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Studies Department |work=Environmental Studies Department |url=http://www.csus.edu/envs/About_us.html#history |publisher=California State University, Sacramento |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929184249/http://www.csus.edu/envs/About_us.html |archivedate=September 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angus Wright, Ph.D. |work=Environmental Studies Department |url=http://www.csus.edu/envs/Faculty-staff/Wright.html |publisher=California State University, Sacramento |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613162322/http://www.csus.edu/envs/Faculty-staff/Wright.html |archivedate=June 13, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Wes Jackson]] was another of the founders.)

Wright earned his Ph.D. in Latin American History from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1976 with a dissertation on "Market, Land and Class: Southern Bahia, Brazil, 1890–1942." He has done research in [[Mexico]] and [[Brazil]] with the support of [[Fulbright]] and Doherty Research grants.

Wright's first book was ''The Death of Ramon Gonzalez: The Modern Agricultural Dilemma'' (University of Texas Press, 1990). This book is now available in an updated, second edition, published in 2005 by the [[University of Texas Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wright, The Death of Ramón González |url=http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/books/wrid2p.html|publisher=University of Texas Press |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |work=Catalog }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright is the co-author of ''To Inherit the Earth: The Landless Movement and the Struggle for a New Brazil'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To Inherit the Earthy |work=Catalog |url=http://www.foodfirst.org/en/store/book/To_Inherit_the_Earth |publisher=Food First! |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608021344/http://www.foodfirst.org/en/store/book/To_Inherit_the_Earth |archivedate=June 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2003 by [[Food First|Food First!]]. He joined ecologists [[Ivette Perfecto]] and [[John Vandermeer]] of the University of Michigan to write ''Nature's Matrix: Linking Conservation, Agriculture, and Food Sovereignty'', published in 2009 by [[Earthscan]] Press of London. He has also written numerous articles on environmental history and the social and environmental consequences of agriculture and of property ownership in the Americas.

Wright has served as President and board member of the ''Pesticide Action Network North America'' and the ''Institute for Food and Development Policy ''([[Food First]]) and is Chairman of the Board of [[The Land Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.landinstitute.org/vnews/display.v/ART/2010/02/12/378256fb3{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for documentation of his change in status from “member of Board” to “Chair of Board”&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the ''Investigative Mechanism'' (an independent citizen review board) of the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], he coordinated a study of Latin America's largest hydroelectric plant, [[Yacyreta]]. He continues to lecture frequently at universities around the United States. From 2005 through 2007 he served as a lead author on the [[International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development]], sponsored by the [[United Nations]], the [[World Bank]], and a variety of other institutions and organizations and now available in various forms from [[Island Press]].

His wife [[Mary Mackey]] is a fellow CSU Sacramento academic, poet and novelist.

The expedition was undertaken in 1787 for [[Charles III of Spain]], following reports of the ruins from native inhabitants.  It took the team two weeks to dig, and it then spent three weeks studying the site.  He was accompanied by [[Ricardo Almendáriz]] who created drawings of the ruins still considered scientifically useful.

'''Augusto Del Noce''' (11 August 1910&amp;nbsp;– 30 December 1989) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] and [[Political Science|political thinker]].

==Life and works==

Del Noce was born in [[Tuscany]] but he grew up and studied in [[Turin]], which between the two World Wars was one of the main centers of secular and anti-[[Fascism|Fascist]] culture in Italy. He completed his degree in Philosophy in 1932 at the University of Turin, with a dissertation on [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] under the direction of [[Adolfo Faggi]]. Between 1934 and 1943 he published a series of essays on early modern philosophy &lt;ref&gt;'La gnoseologia cartesiana nell’interpretazione di Arnauld' - in ''Cartesio nel 111° centenario del Discorso sul Metodo'', Vita e Pensiero 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'La veracità divina e i rapporti di ragione e fede nella filosofia di Malebranche' - in ''Malebranche nel terzo centenario della nascita'', Vita e Pensiero 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Note sulla critica malebranchiana' ''ibid.'' 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Bibliografia Malebranchiana' ''ibid.'' 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'La personalità di Descartes' - preface to ''R. Descartes, Meditazioni metafisiche'', Cedam, Padova, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'L’attualità di Malebranche' - in ''L’attualità dei filosofi classici'' 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; that established his reputation as a specialist in the field, not only in Italy but also in France where his work was praised by well-known scholars such as [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Henri Gouhier]]. His studies of modern [[rationalism]] reflected a broader interest in the relationship between [[Catholicism|Catholic]] thought and secular culture that he had developed during years in Turin. After having been one of the first Italian readers of French Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]], and a thoughtful anti-Fascist, Del Noce turned after the war to the question of the relationship between [[Christianity]] and [[Communism]]. In 1946 he published two essays on [[Marx]]&lt;ref&gt;'Intorno alla filosofia di Marx' - in Rivista di filosofia 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'La “non-filosofia” di Marx e il comunismo come realtà politica' -  in ''Il materialismo storico, Atti I congresso internazionale di Filosofia'', Castellani, Roma 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; which included an extended discussion of the place of atheism in Marx’s philosophy.  His works on Marx were part of a lifelong interest in the role of [[atheism]] in the history of modern philosophy, which culminated in 1964 in his magnum opus ''The Problem of Atheism.'' In 1965 he also published a large monographic work ''Catholic Reformation and Modern Philosophy, Vol. 1: [[Descartes]].''  In 1966 Del Noce was appointed Professor of History of Modern and Contemporary Philosophy at the University of [[Trieste]], but in 1970 he transferred to the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome "La Sapienza,"]] where he was appointed Professor of History of Political Doctrines and later Professor of Political Philosophy. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Del Noce's focus shifted to the theme of [[secularization]] and contemporary history. Some of his essays from this period were published in the 1971 volume ''The Age of Secularization.'' Later in that decade Del Noce returned to the question of the relationship between Catholics and Marxists and wrote two new books, ''The Catholic Communist'' and one of his most famous and controversial works, ''The Suicide of the Revolution,'' in which he argued that the process of dissolution of Marxism into neo-bourgeois nihilism is already at work in the thought of [[Antonio Gramsci]]. In his final years Del Noce became very much a “public intellectual,” writing numerous articles in newspapers and weekly magazines, and becoming involved in the Italian political debate to the point of serving a term as a senator. His final philosophical work was an extensive monograph&lt;ref&gt;''Giovanni Gentile. Per una interpretazione filosofica della storia contemporanea'', Il Mulino, Bologna 1990&lt;/ref&gt; on the philosophy of [[Giovanni Gentile]] and on his relationship with Fascism.  Del Noce died suddenly on December 30, 1989, a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin wall had marked symbolically the final disintegration of the Marxist revolution, which he had predicted many years earlier on philosophical grounds. In his native Italy Del Noce is widely regarded&lt;ref&gt;For a recent appraisal of the significance of Del Noce's work see the program of events for the [http://www.centenariodelnoce.it/ 100th anniversary of his birth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504183035/http://www.centenariodelnoce.it/ |date=May 4, 2013 }} (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; as one of the pre-eminent philosophers and political thinkers of the second half of the 20th century. Although he was a distinguished scholar of early modern philosophy, he is especially remembered for his penetrating exegesis of the philosophy of Marx, for his innovative interpretation of Fascism and for his critique of the progressive-technocratic culture that became gradually dominant in Europe after [[World War II]].

==Philosophical themes==

A common thread of Del Noce's work is the attempt to understand the connection between philosophical ideas and socio-political history. Against the prevailing Marxist and neo-[[Positivism|positivist]] opinions of his contemporaries, he always maintained that philosophical ideas influence the course of human history, and that modern history in particular can only be understood as the unfolding of certain philosophical options (rationalism, [[immanentism]], [[scientism]]). In fact, one of his core ideas was that modern history, if correctly interpreted, provides the best vindication of classical metaphysics by showing that rationalism leads to contradictory outcomes, as exemplified by the trajectory of Marxism. In some of his best known works &lt;ref&gt;''Il suicidio della rivoluzione', Rusconi, Milano 1978&lt;/ref&gt; he advanced the thesis that Marxism suffers what he called an "heterogenesis of ends," meaning that it is destined to triumph and self-destruct at the same time, due to its internal contradictions.  To triumph, because Marx’s radical atheism and materialism are the most consistent outcomes of European rationalism. To self-destruct because, as soon as the revolutionary dream fades away, Marxian historical materialism must degenerate into absolute relativism and open the way to a “perfectly bourgeois” society, a de-humanized world that does not recognize any permanent order of values and in which alienation becomes complete.

More generally, Del Noce regarded the expansion of [[atheism]] as the central question of modern philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Il problema dell'ateismo'', Il Mulino, Bologna 1964&lt;/ref&gt; Its appearance at the endpoint of all forms of rationalism reveals that rationalism itself is based on a precondition, namely the decision to reject any notion of an original fall. A careful investigation of philosophy after Descartes shows that rejecting the ''status naturae lapsae'' was the first step in rejecting the supernatural, to be followed later on by the rejection of every form of transcendence. However, since these rejections cannot be based on any proof, atheism can only justify itself as the outcome of an irreversible historical process, understood as a process of secularization and, at the same time, as the only practical attitude which is capable of actually producing universal human fulfillment. In other words, for late rationalism the criterion of truth of a philosophy reduces to its ability to surpass and integrate all previous forms of thought. For this reason, Del Noce regarded the periodization of history of philosophy itself as the crucial theoretical question of contemporary philosophy. In his book ''The Problem of Atheism'' he argued that, precisely in order to place atheism in the history of philosophy, it is necessary to call into question and to abandon the view that the process of the history of thought is a unitary process towards immanentism. This shows that atheism is not the necessary outcome of modern philosophy, but rather a problematic outcome, inasmuch it does not lead to the promised fulfillment but rather to forms of [[nihilism]]. Contemporary history provides the best proof that the trajectory of rationalism has a nihilistic endpoint: atheism has achieved complete success not in the historical implementation of Marxism, but rather in the affluent society, which pushes to the extreme the de-humanization of the relationship with the other. In its historical realization Marxism has ended up being a stage in the development of the affluent society, which accepts all its negations of traditional thought but at the same time eliminates the messianic/religious aspect of Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;''Secolarizzazione e crisi della modernità'', Esi, Napoli 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s Del Noce’s focused his attention on the task of constructing a philosophical interpretation of the most recent developments in contemporary history. In particular, he felt the need for a clear philosophical understanding of the new challenges that were being posed by the progressivism of the 1960s (in both its secular and Catholic forms), by the rampant secularization of European society, by the [[sexual revolution]] and in general by the new technocratic and affluent society that had taken shape after the Second World War. His most significant essays from this period were collected in the volume ''The Age of Secularization.'' Del Noce argued that Western history after 1945 was marked by a particular interpretation of the historical period between the two [[World Wars]]. According to this “progressive” interpretation, [[Nazism]] and Fascism were symptoms of a general collapse of European civilization, which must be replaced by a new civilization based on science and on the rejection of all metaphysical doctrines. This has led to a type of new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which however is an Enlightenment after Marx, inasmuch it preserves all of Marx’s metaphysical negations. Del Noce maintained that the outcome of this new scientistic-relativistic-progressivist culture is necessarily nihilistic and totalitarian, since science per se is not capable of formulating new ideals. As a response, he developed a different interpretation of contemporary history,&lt;ref&gt;''L'interpretazione transpolitica della storia contemporanea'', Guida, Napoli 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Fascism and Nazism are just stages in a broader process of secularization that actually centers on Marxism and on the failure of the modern “revolutionary gnosis.” He also argued that the correct way to answer the challenge posed by secularization is not by rejecting modernity altogether but by correcting it in light of the classical [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] tradition, which must be rediscovered, renewed and purified.

Del Noce wrote extensively&lt;ref&gt;See the essays collected in ''Rivoluzione Risorgimento Tradizione'', Giuffre`, Milano 1993&lt;/ref&gt; about Freudo-Marxism and on the relationship between political progressivism and the sexual revolution. He argued that both of them are rooted in the denial a priori that human reason is capable of reaching meta-empirical truths, and so they are tightly linked with scientism, the dogmatic belief that the empirical sciences are the only form of rationality.  The reduction of reason to science goes hand in hand with the reduction of freedom to the satisfaction of instincts, which in turn is expressed politically as fight against “repression” and leads to a radical rejection of all traditional values. He further argued that the scientistic postulate is intrinsically totalitarian, inasmuch it de-legitimates all other forms of knowledge.

Del Noce also studied in depth the relationship between freedom and authority. In a long essay&lt;ref&gt;Autorita`, in ''Rivoluzione Risorgimento Tradizione, Giuffre`, Milano 1993''&lt;/ref&gt;  from 1975 he pointed out that, whereas in the classic and humanistic tradition authority was associated with liberation (e.g. from the power of sub-human instincts and from social manipulation), contemporary culture associates authority with repression. As a result, the modern world confuses authority and power with disastrous effects. In particular, the progressive culture since World War II has associated the defense of freedom with the rejection of metaphysical knowledge and the embrace of relativism. However, any form of [[liberalism]] that does not acknowledge the nature of authority must conclude to an even greater oppression, by making the individual completely dependent on society. According to Del Noce, freedom can only defended by rediscovering the true meaning of authority, which is tightly linked to the idea of evidence. Evidence is the foundation and the paradigm of authority, because it asks of the mind a more radical submission than could be obtained by force, but in this submission the mind finds its ultimate liberation from all arbitrary social powers. Thus, Del Noce said, the theme of authority brings us back to the Socratic origins of classical metaphysics, which have to be rediscovered in order to overcome the present crisis of our civilization.

'''Barbanera''' is a famous Italian [[almanac]], printed for the first time in 1762&lt;ref&gt;Some sources, like the [[Treccani]] dictionary, indicate 1743 as the first year of publication. The oldest edition today, conserved in the historical archive of the Fondazione Barbanera 1762, is a single sheet printed in [[Foligno]] by Pompeo Campana and dated 1762, which reports the calendar of that year and an initial prediction signed by Barbanera, already known as "famous", as highlighted by Ivo Picchiarelli in the essay ''The first steps in an Italian tradition. I primi passi di una tradizione italiana. The oldest Barbanera almanacs folio'', in the Fondazione Barbanera 1762 (by), ''Barbanera 1762'', Editoriale Campi, Spello, 2012, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; and still published yearly today.

==Contents==
Since the first edition, the Barbanera has been issued in the form of a wall [[calendar]] and paperback almanac. In addition to the calendar for that year, it traditionally proposes weather forecasts, information about lunar phases and the stars, curious facts, proverbs, gardening tips and advice for a healthy lifestyle.
All contents are inspired by the figure of a legendary astronomer and philosopher, depicted in different editions with a long black beard.&lt;ref&gt;For a brief history and description of the Barbanera almanac and calendar, see the mentioned ''Barbanera 1762'', published by Editoriale Campi in 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Success over the years==
Because of its popularity, Barbanera is referred to by the most respected Italian dictionaries as a synonym for almanac. An essential, both secular and religious guide for generations of Italians, it has carried out the task of spreading knowledge in the fields of technology and agriculture throughout the centuries.  
[[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] defined it "the flower of all time and the wisdom of nations".&lt;ref&gt;See the letter from Gabriele D'Annunzio to Don G. Fava dated 24 February  1934 quoted in Attilio Mazza, ''D'Annunzio e l'occulto'', Edizioni Mediterranee, Rome, 1995, p. 29. The letter is conserved in the archive of Fondazione [[Vittoriale degli Italiani]] (Personal Archive, c. 31817).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Barbanera in the Unesco Memory of the World==
Through the collection of almanacs conserved in the Fondazione Barbanera 1762,&lt;ref&gt;The Memory of the World Register has included the collection of 356 Barbanera almanacs from 1762 to 1962 among its documents, which are conserved at the Fondazione Barbanera 1762 in [[Spello]], Umbria. See also the bibliographical opac [http://www.bibliotecabarbanera.it/bw5ne5/opac.aspx?WEB=FNBN&amp;LNG=ITA www.bibliotecabarbanera.it] (last visit on 3/12/2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Barbanera has been part of the documentary heritage of humanity since 2015, referred to by [[UNESCO]] in the [[Memory of the World Register]] as "symbol of a literary genre, which helped to create the mass culture and identity-making heritage of entire nations, up until the advent of more modern forms of mass communication".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-2/collection-of-barbanera-almanacs/ See the Unesco, Memory of the World Programme website] (last visit on 3/12/2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daum''' is a crystal studio based in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], [[France]], founded in 1878 by [[:fr:Jean Daum|Jean Daum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heritage: 1878: The origins |publisher=Daum |year=2011 |url=http://www.daum.fr/#/en-eu/history/1878-daum-origin |accessdate=2011-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1825–1885).  His sons, [[Auguste Daum]] (1853–1909) and [[:fr:Antonin Daum|Antonin Daum]] (1864–1931), oversaw its growth during the burgeoning [[Art Nouveau]] period.  Currently Daum is the only commercial [[Lead glass|crystal]] manufacturer employing the [[Glass casting#Pate de verre|pâte de verre]] (glass paste) process for art glass and crystal sculptures, a technique in which crushed glass is packed into a refractory mould and then fused in a kiln.&lt;ref name="Contemporary Glass"&gt;{{cite book |last=Frantz |first=Susanne K. | title=Contemporary glass: a world survey from the Corning Museum of Glass |publisher=H.N. Abrams |year=1989 |location=New York |pages=? |url= |isbn=0-8109-1038-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Daum family worked at the beginning of [[Art Nouveau]] and creators of one of France's greatest glassworks. Established at the end of the 19th century, Daum’s renown was originally linked to the [[:fr:Ecole de Nancy|Ecole de Nancy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecole-de-nancy.com/web/index.php?page=presentation-men-en|title=Ecole de Nancy - overview|website=www.ecole-de-nancy.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the art of ''pâte-de-cristal'', a major contributing factor in terms of its worldwide reputation.

During the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Universal Exhibition]] of 1900 Daum was awarded a ‘Grand Prix’ medal. Daum glass became more elaborate, acid etching (by Jacques Gruber) was often combined with carving, enamelling and engraving on a single piece of glass to produce creative glass master-pieces.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The most complicated creations also feature applied glass elements, such as handles and ornamental motifs in naturalistic forms. The Daum brothers quickly moved on to become one of the major forces in the Art Nouveau movement, seriously rivalling [[Émile Gallé|Gallé]], so much so that when Émile Gallé died in 1904 they became the leaders in the field of decorative glass.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In 1906 Daum revived [[pâte de verre]] (glass paste), an ancient Egyptian method of glass casting, developing the method so that by the 1930s Daum's window panels used pâte de verre for richness instead of leaded or painted glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fyson |first=Nance |title=Decorative Glass of the 19th and Early 20th Century: A Source Book |publisher=[[David &amp; Charles]] |year=2001 |location=Newton Abbot, UK |pages=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ni_JIj0xBr0C&amp;pg=PA140 |isbn=0-7153-1258-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today Daum still used this method to produce their pieces.

== Locations ==
Daum has always been linked with the city of Nancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.nancy-tourisme.fr/discover/history-and-heritage/art-nouveau-and-art-deco/daum/|title=Daum {{!}} Nancy Tourisme|website=en.nancy-tourisme.fr|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its main manufacture locations are in downtown of Nancy and a nearby village called Vannes-le-Châtel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lacompagniedesverriers.com/acces|title=Compagnie des verriers - Vannes le Châtel|website=www.lacompagniedesverriers.com|access-date=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the pieces are still handmade by hundreds of employees in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Lynn Lewis|title=Daum: Luxury French Crystal|date=2011-07-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3Nf5b1hkjk|accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daum has a store at [[Place Stanislas]] in Nancy.

== Museum collection ==
More than 600 glasswork items are in the Daum Collection at the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Nancy]] (Nancy Musée des Beaux-Arts) that document the history of glass manufacturing from the 1880s through the 1990s.

== Notable artists ==
After this world known era of Art Nouveau, DAUM has worked with hundreds of artists and designers to update new collections.

[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Johannes Vermeer]], ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]'' (1658–1660)]]

'''Dutch Golden Age painting''' is the painting of the [[Dutch Golden Age]], a period in Dutch history roughly spanning the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;In general histories 1702 is sometimes taken as the end if the Golden Age, a date which works reasonably well for painting. Slive, who avoids the term (see p. 296), divides his book into two parts: 1600–1675 (294 pages) and 1675–1800 (32 pages).&lt;/ref&gt; during and after the later part of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) for Dutch independence.

The new [[Dutch Republic]] was the most prosperous nation in Europe and led European trade, science, and art. The northern [[Terminology of the Low Countries|Netherlandish]] provinces that made up the new state had traditionally been less important artistic centres than cities in Flanders in the south. The upheavals and large-scale transfers of population of the war, and the sharp break with the old monarchist and Catholic cultural traditions, meant that Dutch art had to reinvent itself.  The painting of religious subjects declined sharply, but a large new market for all kinds of secular subjects grew up.

Although Dutch painting of the Golden Age is included in the general European period of [[Baroque painting]], and often shows many of its characteristics, most lacks the idealization and love of splendour typical of much Baroque work, including [[Flemish Baroque painting|that of neighbouring Flanders]]. Most work, including that for which the period is best known, reflects the traditions of detailed [[realism (arts)|realism]] inherited from [[Early Netherlandish painting]].
[[File:Frans Hals 008.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Hals]]' [[tronie]], with the later title ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]''. 1628–30. Oil on wood, {{convert|58|x|52|cm|0|abbr=on}}. The tronie includes elements of portraiture, genre painting, and sometimes history painting.]]

A distinctive feature of the period is the proliferation of distinct [[genre]]s of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Confusingly, one particular [[genre]] of painting is called [[genre painting]], the painting of some kind of everyday scenes with unidentified people. But, for example, [[still-life]] is also a genre in painting.&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority of artists producing the bulk of their work within one of these. The full development of this specialization is seen from the late 1620s, and the period from then until the [[Rampjaar|French invasion of 1672]] is the core of Golden Age painting.  Artists would spend most of their careers painting only portraits, genre scenes, landscapes, seascapes and ships, or still lifes, and often a particular sub-type within these categories.  Many of these types of subject were new in Western painting, and the way the Dutch painted them in this period was decisive for their future development.

==Types of painting==
[[File:Paulus Potter - Young Bull.JPG|thumb|[[Paulus Potter]], ''[[The Bull (painting)|The Bull]]'' (1647); 3.4 metres wide. An unusually monumental animal painting that challenges the [[hierarchy of genres]].]]

A distinctive feature of the period, compared to earlier European painting, was the limited number of religious paintings. Dutch [[Calvinism]] forbade religious paintings in churches, and though biblical subjects were acceptable in private homes, relatively few were produced. The other traditional classes of history and portrait painting were present, but the period is more notable for a huge variety of other genres, sub-divided into numerous specialized categories, such as scenes of peasant life, landscapes, townscapes, landscapes with animals, maritime paintings, flower paintings and [[still life]]s of various types. The development of many of these types of painting was decisively influenced by 17th-century Dutch artists.

The widely held theory of the "[[hierarchy of genres]]" in painting, whereby some types were regarded as more prestigious than others, led many painters to want to produce history painting. However this was the hardest to sell, as even Rembrandt found. Many were forced to produce portraits or genre scenes, which sold much more easily. In descending order of status, the categories in the hierarchy were:
*[[history painting]], including [[Allegory|allegories]] and popular religious subjects.
*[[Portrait painting]], including the ''[[tronie]]''
*[[Genre works|genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|landscape]], including seascapes, battlescenes, cityscapes, and ruins (landscapists were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 104&lt;/ref&gt;) 
*[[still life]]

The Dutch concentrated heavily on the "lower" categories, but by no means rejected the concept of the hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings were relatively small – the only common type of really large paintings were group portraits. Painting directly onto walls hardly existed; when a wall-space in a public building needed decorating, fitted framed canvas was normally used. For the extra precision possible on a hard surface, many painters continued to use wooden panels, some time after the rest of Western Europe had abandoned them; some used copper plates, usually recycling plates from [[printmaking]]. In turn, the number of surviving Golden Age paintings was reduced by them being overpainted with new works by artists throughout the 18th and 19th century – poor ones were usually cheaper than a new canvas, stretcher and frame. 

There was very little Dutch sculpture during the period; it is mostly found in [[tomb monument]]s and attached to public buildings, and small sculptures for houses are a noticeable gap, their place taken by silverware and [[ceramic art|ceramics]]. Painted [[delftware]] tiles were very cheap and common, if rarely of really high quality, but silver, especially in the [[auricular style]], led Europe. With this exception, the best artistic efforts were concentrated on painting and printmaking.

==The art world==
[[File:Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirck Hals]], genre scene of ''Gentlemen Smoking and Playing Backgammon in an Interior''. Note the paintings on the wall of what appears to be a tavern; also [[commons:File:Quiringh van Brekelenkam - Tailor's Workshop.jpg|here]].]]

Foreigners remarked on the enormous quantities of art produced and the large fairs where many paintings were sold – it has been roughly estimated that over 1.3 million Dutch pictures were painted in the 20 years after 1640 alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, 15, citing [[Jonathan Israel]]. Perhaps only 1% survive today, and "only about 10% of these were of real quality".&lt;/ref&gt;  The volume of production meant that prices were fairly low, except for the best known artists; as in most subsequent periods, there was a steep price gradient for more fashionable artists.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Those without a strong contemporary reputation, or who had fallen out of fashion, including many now considered among the greatest of the period, such as [[Vermeer]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Rembrandt]] in his last years, had considerable problems earning a living, and died poor; many artists had other jobs, or abandoned art entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Steen]] was an innkeeper, [[Aelbert Cuyp]] was one of many whose wealthy wives persuaded them to give up painting, although [[Karel Dujardin]] seems to have run away from his to continue his work. Conversely [[Jan van de Cappelle]] came from a very wealthy family, and [[Joachim Wtewael]] was a self-made [[flax]] tycoon. See their biographies in MacLaren. The fish artist [[Jacob Gillig]] [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qkW3ff-NRZoC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22Jacob+Gillig%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacob%20Gillig%22&amp;f=false also worked as a warder in the Utrecht prison, conveniently close to the fish market.] Bankrupts included: Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Jan de Bray, and many others.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular the French invasion of 1672 (the ''[[Rampjaar]]'', or "year of disaster"), brought a severe depression to the art market, which never quite returned to earlier heights.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 217 and ff. on 1672 and its effects.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of pictures was very wide: "yea many tymes, blacksmithes, cobblers etts., will have some picture or other by their Forge and in their stalle. Such is the generall Notion, enclination and delight that these Countrie Native have to Painting" reported an English traveller in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 43; Franits, 2 calls this "oft-quoted" remark "undoubtedly exaggerated".&lt;/ref&gt;  There were for virtually the first time many professional art dealers, several also significant artists, like [[Vermeer]] and his father, [[Jan van Goyen]] and [[Willem Kalf]]. Rembrandt's dealer [[Hendrick van Uylenburgh]] and his son [[Gerrit van Uylenburgh|Gerrit]] were among the most important.  Landscapes were the easiest uncommissioned works to sell, and their painters were the "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" according to [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|The Haarlem Painter's Guild]]'' in 1675, by  [[Jan de Bray]], whose self-portrait is the second from the left]]

The technical quality of Dutch artists was generally high, still mostly following the old medieval system of training by apprenticeship with a master.  Typically workshops were smaller than in Flanders or Italy, with only one or two apprentices at a time, the number often being restricted by guild regulations.  The turmoil of the early years of the Republic, with displaced artists from the South moving north and the loss of traditional markets in the court and church, led to a resurgence of artists guilds, often still called the [[Guild of Saint Luke]].  In many cases these involved the artists extricating themselves from medieval groupings where they shared a guild with several other trades, such as housepainting.  Several new guilds were established in the period: [[Amsterdam]] in 1579, [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke|Haarlem]] in 1590, and [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and [[Delft]] between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2008), 151-153, or Prak (2003), 241&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leiden]] authorities distrusted guilds and did not allow one until 1648.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2008), 153&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century it began to become clear to all involved that the old idea of a guild controlling both training and sales no long worked well, and gradually the guilds were replaced with [[academies]], often only concerned with the training of artists.  [[The Hague]], with the court, was an early example, where artists split into two groups in 1656 with the founding of the [[Confrerie Pictura]].  With the obvious exception of portraits, many more Dutch paintings were done "speculatively" without a specific commission than was then the case in other countries – one of many ways in which the Dutch art market showed the future.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"&gt;Fuchs, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gelder Selbstbildnis m hässlicher Frau@Städel Museum Frankfurt20170818.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aert de Gelder]], ''Self-portrait as [[Zeuxis]]'' (1685)]]

There were many dynasties of artists, and many married the daughters of their masters or other artists. Many artists came from well-off families, who paid fees for their apprenticeships, and they often married into property. Rembrandt and Jan Steen were both enrolled at the [[University of Leiden]] for a while. Several cities had distinct styles and specialities by subject, but Amsterdam was the largest artistic centre, because of its great wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Franits' book is largely organized by city and by period; Slive by subject categories&lt;/ref&gt;  Cities such as [[Haarlem]] and [[Utrecht]] were more important in the first half of the century, with [[Leiden]] and other cities emerging after 1648, and above all Amsterdam, which increasingly drew to it artists from the rest of the Netherlands, as well as [[Flanders]] and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Franits throughout, summarized on p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch artists were strikingly less concerned about artistic theory than those of many nations, and less given to discussing their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art was a source of national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are [[Karel van Mander]] (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and [[Arnold Houbraken]] (''De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen'' – "The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters", 1718–21). Both followed, and indeed exceeded, [[Vasari]] in including a great number of short lives of artists – over 500 in Houbraken's case – and both are considered generally accurate on factual matters.

The German artist [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (1606–1688) had worked for periods in Holland, and his ''Deutsche Akademie'' in the same format covers many Dutch artists he knew. Houbraken's master, and Rembrandt's pupil, was [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]] (1627–1678), whose ''Zichtbare wereld'' and ''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' (1678) contain more critical than biographical information, and are among the most important treatises on painting of the period. Like other Dutch works on the theory of art, they expound many commonplaces of Renaissance theory and do not entirely reflect contemporary Dutch art, still often concentrating on history painting.&lt;ref&gt;See Slive, 296-7 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

==History painting==
[[File:Danae by Van Loo.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Loo]], ''[[Danaë]]'' (compare [[Danaë (Rembrandt painting)|Rembrandt's treatment]])]]

This category comprises not only paintings that depicted historical events of the past, but also paintings that showed biblical, mythological, literary and [[allegory|allegorical]] scenes. Recent historical events essentially fell out of the category, and were treated in a realist fashion, as the appropriate combination of portraits with marine, townscape or landscape subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  Large dramatic historical or Biblical scenes were produced less frequently than in other countries, as there was no local market for church art, and few large aristocratic Baroque houses to fill. More than that, the Protestant population of major cities had been exposed to some remarkably hypocritical uses of [[Mannerist]] allegory in unsuccessful Habsburg propaganda during the [[Dutch Revolt]], which had produced a strong reaction towards realism and a distrust of grandiose visual rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62, R.H. Wilenski, ''Dutch Painting'', "Prologue" pp.&amp;nbsp;27–43, 1945, Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;  History painting was now a "minority art", although to an extent this was redressed by a relatively keen interest in print versions of history subjects&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62-3&lt;/ref&gt;

More than in other types of painting, Dutch history painters continued to be influenced by Italian painting. Prints and copies of Italian masterpieces circulated and suggested certain compositional schemes. The growing Dutch skill in the depiction of light was brought to bear on styles derived from Italy, notably that of [[Caravaggio]]. Some Dutch painters also travelled to Italy, though this was less common than with their Flemish contemporaries, as can be seen from the membership of the [[Bentvueghels]] club in Rome.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"/&gt;

[[File:Dirk van Baburen - Kroning met de doornenkroon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Utrecht Caravaggism]]: [[Dirck van Baburen]], ''Christ crowned with thorns'', 1623, for a convent in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], not a market available in most of Holland.]]

In the early part of the century many [[Northern Mannerist]] artists with styles formed in the previous century continued to work, until the 1630s in the cases of [[Abraham Bloemaert]] and [[Joachim Wtewael]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;  Many history paintings were small in scale, with the German painter (based in Rome) [[Adam Elsheimer]] as much an influence as Caravaggio (both died in 1610) on Dutch painters like [[Pieter Lastman]], Rembrandt's master, and Jan and [[Jacob Pynas]]. Compared to Baroque history painting from other countries, they shared the Dutch emphasis on realism, and narrative directness, and are sometimes known as the "Pre-Rembrandtists", as Rembrandt's early paintings were in this style.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 62-69&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utrecht Caravaggism]] describes a group of artists who produced both history painting and generally large genre scenes in an Italian-influenced style, often making heavy use of [[chiaroscuro]]. Utrecht, before the revolt the most important city in the new Dutch territory, was an unusual Dutch city, still about 40% Catholic in the mid-century, even more among the elite groups, who included many rural nobility and gentry with town houses there.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 65. Catholic 17th-century Dutch artists included Abraham Bloemaert and Gerard van Honthorst from Utrecht, and Jan Steen, [[Paulus Bor]], [[Jacob van Velsen]], plus Vermeer who probably converted at his marriage.[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/delft/delft_today/catholic_church.html]  [[Jacob Jordaens]] was among Flemish Protestant artists.&lt;/ref&gt;  The leading artists were [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerard van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]], and the school was active about 1630, although van Honthorst continued until the 1650s as a successful court painter to the English, Dutch and Danish courts in a more classical style.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 22-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Rembrandt began as a history painter before finding financial success as a portraitist, and he never relinquished his ambitions in this area. A great number of his [[etching]]s are of narrative religious scenes, and the story of his last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  Several artists, many his pupils, attempted with some success to continue his very personal style; [[Govaert Flinck]] was the most successful.  [[Gerard de Lairesse]] (1640–1711) was another of these, before falling under heavy influence from French classicism, and becoming its leading Dutch proponent as both artist and theoretician.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Nudity was effectively the preserve of the history painter, although many portraitists dressed up their occasional nudes (nearly always female) with a classical title, as Rembrandt did. For all their uninhibited suggestiveness, genre painters rarely revealed more than a generous cleavage or stretch of thigh, usually when painting prostitutes or "Italian" peasants.

==Portraits==
[[File:Portrait sophia trip wife of balthasar coymans.jpg|thumb|[[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], ''Sophia Trip'' (1645), a member of one of the wealthiest families in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beernink.com/articles/triptree.htm?timeline=off Trip family tree]. Her grandparents' various portraits by Rembrandt are famous.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Portrait painting thrived in the Netherlands in the 17th century, as there was a large mercantile class who were far more ready to commission portraits than their equivalents in other countries; a summary of various estimates of total production arrives at between 750,000 and 1,100,000 portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 17 n.1 (on p. 228).&lt;/ref&gt;  Rembrandt enjoyed his greatest period of financial success as a young Amsterdam portraitist, but like other artists, grew rather bored with painting commissioned portraits of burghers: "artists travel along this road without delight", according to van Mander.&lt;ref&gt;Shawe-Taylor, 22-23, 32-33 on portraits, quotation from 33&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dutch portrait painting avoids the swagger and excessive rhetoric of the aristocratic Baroque portraiture current in the rest of 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting ''en masse'', as in the roomful of 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

[[File:Van den Kerckhoven door Jan Mijtens.jpg|thumb|left|[[Johannes Mytens|Jan Mijtens]], family portrait, 1652, with the boys in "picturesque" dress.]]

The other great portraitist of the period is [[Frans Hals]], whose famously lively brushwork and ability to show sitters looking relaxed and cheerful adds excitement to even the most unpromising subjects. The extremely "nonchalant pose" of his portrait of Willem Heythuijsen is exceptional: "no other portrait from this period is so informal".&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 118&lt;/ref&gt;  The sitter was a wealthy textile merchant who had already commissioned Hals' only individual life-sized full-length portrait ten years before. In this much smaller work for a private chamber he wears riding clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart, 130 and 114.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan de Bray]] encouraged his sitters to pose costumed as figures from classical history, but many of his works are of his own family. [[Thomas de Keyser]], [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], [[Ferdinand Bol]] and others, including many mentioned below as history or genre painters, did their best to enliven more conventional works. Portraiture, less affected by fashion than other types of painting, remained the safe fallback for Dutch artists.

From what little we know of the studio procedures of artists, it seems that, as elsewhere in Europe, the face was probably drawn and perhaps painted at an initial sitting or two. The typical number of further sittings is unclear - between zero (for a Rembrandt full-length) and 50 appear documented. The clothes were left at the studio and might well be painted by assistants, or a brought-in specialist master, although, or because, they were regarded as a very important part of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Married and never-married women can be distinguished by their dress, highlighting how few single women were painted, except in family groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;  As elsewhere, the accuracy of the clothes shown is variable - striped and patterned clothes were worn, but artists rarely show them, understandably avoiding the extra work.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 73&lt;/ref&gt; Lace and [[ruff]] collars were unavoidable, and presented a formidable challenge to painters intent on realism. Rembrandt evolved a more effective way of painting patterned lace, laying in broad white stokes, and then painting lightly in black to show the pattern. Another way of doing this was to paint in white over a black layer, and scratch off the white with the end of the brush to show the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the century there was a fashion for showing sitters in a semi-fancy dress, begun in England by van Dyck in the 1630s, known as "picturesque" or "Roman" dress.&lt;ref&gt;Ekkart (Marike de Winkel essay), 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristocratic, and militia, sitters allowed themselves more freedom in bright dress and expansive settings than burghers, and religious affiliations probably affected many depictions. By the end of the century aristocratic, or French, values were spreading among the burghers, and depictions were allowed more freedom and display.

A distinctive type of painting, combining elements of the portrait, history, and genre painting was the [[tronie]]. This was usually a half-length of a single figure which concentrated on capturing an unusual mood or expression. The actual identity of the model was not supposed to be important, but they might represent a historical figure and be in exotic or historic costume. [[Jan Lievens]] and Rembrandt, many of whose self-portraits are also tronies (especially his etched ones), were among those who developed the genre.

Family portraits tended, as in Flanders, to be set outdoors in gardens, but without an extensive view as later in England, and to be relatively informal in dress and mood.  Group portraits, largely a Dutch invention, were popular among the large numbers of civic associations that were a notable part of Dutch life, such as the officers of a city's [[schutterij]] or militia guards, boards of trustees and regents of guilds and charitable foundations and the like. Especially in the first half of the century, portraits were very formal and stiff in composition. Groups were often seated around a table, each person looking at the viewer. Much attention was paid to fine details in clothing, and where applicable, to furniture and other signs of a person's position in society. Later in the century groups became livelier and colours brighter.  Rembrandt's ''[[Syndics of the Drapers' Guild (Rembrandt)|Syndics of the Drapers' Guild]]'' is a subtle treatment of a group round a table.

[[File:Frans Hals, De magere compagnie.jpg|thumb|350px|''The [[Meagre Company]]'', an Amsterdam [[militia group portrait]] or ''schutterstuk'' by [[Frans Hals]] and [[Pieter Codde]] (1633-37)]]

Scientists often posed with instruments and objects of their study around them. Physicians sometimes posed together around a cadaver, a so-called 'Anatomical Lesson', the most famous one being Rembrandt's ''[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]'' (1632, [[Mauritshuis]], [[The Hague]]). Boards of trustees in their ''[[regentenstuk]]'' portraits preferred an image of austerity and humility, posing in dark clothing (which by its refinement testified to their prominent standing in society), often seated around a table, with solemn expressions on their faces.

Most [[militia group portrait]]s were commissioned in [[Haarlem]] and [[Amsterdam]], and were much more flamboyant and relaxed or even boisterous than other types of portraits, as well as much larger.  Early examples showed them dining, but later groups showed most figures standing for a more dynamic composition.  Rembrandt's famous ''The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq'' better known as the ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' (1642), was an ambitious and not entirely successful attempt to show a group in action, setting out for a patrol or parade, also innovative in avoiding the typical very wide format of such works.

The cost of group portraits was usually shared by the subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might determine each person's place in the picture, either head to toe in full regalia in the foreground or face only in the back of the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the [[Amsterdams Historisch Museum]]; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.

==Scenes of everyday life==
[[File:Jan Steen 004b.jpg|thumb|left|A typical [[Jan Steen]] picture (c. 1663); while the housewife sleeps, the household play.&lt;ref&gt;Another version at [[Apsley House]], with a different composition, but using most of the same moralizing objects, is analysed by Franits, 206-9&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Genre paintings]] show scenes that prominently feature figures to whom no specific identity can be attached – they are not portraits or intended as historical figures. Together with landscape painting, the development and enormous popularity of genre painting is the most distinctive feature of Dutch painting in this period, although in this case they were also very popular in Flemish painting. Many are single figures, like the Vermeer's ''[[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|The Milkmaid]]''; others may show large groups at some social occasion, or crowds. There were a large number of sub-types within the genre: single figures, peasant families, tavern scenes, "[[merry company]]" parties, women at work about the house, scenes of village or town festivities (though these were still more common in Flemish painting), market scenes, barracks scenes, scenes with horses or farm animals, in snow, by moonlight, and many more. In fact most of these had specific terms in Dutch, but there was no overall Dutch term equivalent to "genre painting" – until the late 18th century the English often called them "drolleries".&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 42 and Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Some artists worked mostly within one of these sub-types, especially after about 1625.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the course of the century, genre paintings tended to reduce in size.

Though genre paintings provide many insights into the daily life of 17th-century citizens of all classes, their accuracy cannot always be taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 1, mentioning costume in works by the Utrecht Caravagggisti, and architectural settings, as especially prone to abandon accurate depiction.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many which seemed only to depict everyday scenes actually illustrated Dutch proverbs and sayings or conveyed a moralistic message – the meaning of which may now need to be deciphered by art historians, though some are clear enough. Many artists, and no doubt purchasers, certainly tried to have things both ways, enjoying the depiction of disorderly households or brothel scenes, while providing a moral interpretation – the works of [[Jan Steen]], whose other profession was as an innkeeper, are an example. The balance between these elements is still debated by art historians today.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 4-6 summarizes the debate, for which [[Svetlana Alpers]]' ''The Art of Describing'' (1983) is an important work (though see Slive's terse comment on p. 344). See also Franits, 20-21 on paintings being understood differently by contemporary individuals, and his p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerrit van Honthorst - De koppelaarster.jpg|thumb|[[Gerrit van Honthorst]] (1625), punning visually on the [[lute]] in this brothel scene]]

The titles given later to paintings often distinguish between "[[tavern]]s" or "[[inn]]s" and "[[brothel]]s", but in practice these were very often the same establishments, as many taverns had rooms above or behind set aside for sexual purposes: "Inn in front; brothel behind" was a Dutch [[proverb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf On Diderot's Art Criticism. Mira Friedman, p. 36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721134904/http://arts.tau.ac.il/departments/images/stories/journals/arthistory/Assaph2/assaph2-08friedman.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steen above is very clearly an ''exemplum'', and though each of the individual components of it is realistically depicted, the overall scene is not a plausible depiction of a real moment; typically of genre painting, it is a situation that is depicted, and satirized.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 39-42, analyses two comparable scenes by Steen and Dou, and p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] tradition of recondite [[emblem books]] had, in the hands of the 17th-century Dutch – almost universally literate in the vernacular, but mostly without education in the classics – turned into the popularist and highly moralistic works of [[Jacob Cats]], [[Roemer Visscher]], and others, often based in popular [[proverb]]s. The illustrations to these are often quoted directly in paintings, and since the start of the 20th century art historians have attached proverbs, sayings and mottoes to a great number of genre works. Another popular source of meaning is visual puns using the great number of Dutch [[slang]] terms in the sexual area: the [[vagina]] could be represented by a [[lute]] (''luit'') or [[stocking]] (''kous''), and sex by a bird (''vogelen''), among many other options,&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, pp 54, 44, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and purely visual symbols such as shoes, spouts, and jugs and flagons on their side.

[[File:Peasants in an Interior (1661) Adriaen van Ostade.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adriaen van Ostade]], ''Peasants in an Interior'' (1661)]]

The same painters often painted works in a very different spirit of housewives or other women at rest in the home or at work – they massively outnumber similar treatments of men.  In fact working class men going about their jobs are notably absent from Dutch Golden Age art, with landscapes populated by travellers and idlers but rarely tillers of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the Dutch Republic being the most important nation in international trade in Europe, and the abundance of marine paintings, scenes of dock workers and other commercial activities are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 1&lt;/ref&gt;  This group of subjects was a Dutch invention, reflecting the cultural preoccupations of the age,&lt;ref&gt;Explored at length by Schama in his Chapter 6. See also the analysis of [[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)]], claimed by different art historians for each tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; and was to be adopted by artists from other countries, especially France, in the two centuries following.

The tradition developed from the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which [[Hieronymus Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] were among the first to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The [[Haarlem]] painters [[Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech]], [[Frans Hals]] and [[Esaias van de Velde]] were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted "[[Merry company|merry companies]]" of finely dressed young people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail. 
[[File:Gabriël Metsu 006.jpg|thumb|[[Gabriel Metsu]], ''The Hunter's Gift'', c. 1660, a study in marital relations, with a visual pun.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 180-182, though he strangely seems to discount the possibility that the couple are married. Married or not, the hunter clearly hopes for a return from his gift of (punning) birds, though the open shoe and gun on the floor, pointing in different directions, suggest he may be disappointed. Metsu used opposed dogs several times, and may have invented the motif, which was copied by Victorian artists. A statue of [[Cupid]] presides over the scene.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Van de Velde was also important as a landscapist, whose scenes included unglamorous figures very different from those in his genre paintings, which were typically set at garden parties in country houses. Hals was principally a portraitist, but also painted genre figures of a portrait size early in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 24-27&lt;/ref&gt;

A stay in Haarlem by the Flemish master of peasant tavern scenes [[Adriaen Brouwer]], from 1625 or 1626, gave [[Adriaen van Ostade]] his lifelong subject, though he often took a more sentimental approach. Before Brouwer, peasants had normally been depicted outdoors; he usually shows them in a plain and dim interior, though van Ostade's sometimes occupy ostentatiously decrepit farmhouses of enormous size.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 34-43. Presumably these are intended to imply houses abandoned by Catholic gentry who had fled south in the Eighty Years' War. His self-portrait shows him, equally implausibly, working in just such a setting.&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Ostade was as likely to paint a single figure as a group, as were the Utrecht Caravaggisti in their genre works, and the single figure, or small groups of two or three became increasingly common, especially those including women and children. The most notable woman artist of the period, [[Judith Leyster]] (1609–1660), specialized in these, before her husband, [[Jan Miense Molenaer]], prevailed on her to give up painting. The [[Leiden]] school of ''[[fijnschilder]]'' ("fine painters") were renowned for small and highly finished paintings, many of this type. Leading artists included [[Gerard Dou]], [[Gabriel Metsu]], [[Frans van Mieris the Elder]], and later his son [[Willem van Mieris]], [[Godfried Schalcken]], and [[Adriaen van der Werff]].

This later generation, whose work now seems over-refined compared to their predecessors, also painted portraits and histories, and were the most highly regarded and rewarded Dutch painters by the end of the period, whose works were sought after all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  Genre paintings reflected the increasing prosperity of Dutch society, and settings grew steadily more comfortable, opulent and carefully depicted as the century progressed. Artists not part of the Leiden group whose common subjects also were more intimate genre groups included [[Nicolaes Maes]], [[Gerard ter Borch]] and [[Pieter de Hooch]], whose interest in light in interior scenes was shared with [[Jan Vermeer]], long a very obscure figure, but now the most highly regarded genre painter of all.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Landscapes and cityscapes==
[[File:Esaias van de Velde Winter Landscape.jpg|thumb|left|[[Esaias van de Velde]], ''Winter Landscape'' (1623)]]

[[Landscape art|Landscape painting]] was a major genre in the 17th century. Flemish landscapes (particularly from [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp]]) of the 16th century first served as an example. These had been not particularly realistic, having been painted mostly in the studio, partly from imagination, and often still using the semi-aerial view from above typical of earlier [[Netherlandish]] landscape painting in the "[[world landscape]]" tradition of [[Joachim Patinir]], [[Herri met de Bles]] and the early [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. A more realistic Dutch landscape style developed, seen from ground level, often based on drawings made outdoors, with lower horizons which made it possible to emphasize the often impressive cloud formations that were (and are) so typical in the climate of the region, and which cast a particular light. Favourite subjects were the dunes along the western sea coast, rivers with their broad adjoining meadows where cattle grazed, often with the silhouette of a city in the distance. Winter landscapes with frozen canals and creeks also abounded. The sea was a favourite topic as well since the Low Countries depended on it for trade, battled with it for new land, and battled on it with competing nations.

Important early figures in the move to realism were [[Esaias van de Velde]] (1587–1630) and [[Hendrick Avercamp]] (1585–1634), both also mentioned above as genre painters – in Avercamp's case the same paintings deserve mention in each category. From the late 1620s the "tonal phase" of landscape painting started, as artists softened or blurred their outlines, and concentrated on an atmospheric effect, with great prominence given to the sky, and human figures usually either absent or small and distant. Compositions based on a diagonal across the picture space became popular, and water often featured. The leading artists were [[Jan van Goyen]] (1596–1656), [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] (1602–1670), [[Pieter de Molyn]] (1595–1661), and in marine painting [[Simon de Vlieger]] (1601–1653), with a host of minor figures – a recent study lists over 75 artists who worked in van Goyen's manner for at least a period, including Cuyp.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 189 – the study is by H.-U. Beck (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede 1670 Ruisdael.jpg|thumb|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], ''The Windmill at Wijk'' (1670)]]
[[File:Aelbert Cuyp - Rivierlandschap met ruiters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Aelbert Cuyp]], ''River landscape with Riders'' (c. 1655); Cuyp specialized in golden evening light in Dutch settings.]]

From the 1650s the "classical phase" began, retaining the atmospheric quality, but with more expressive compositions and stronger contrasts of light and colour. Compositions are often anchored by a single "heroic tree", windmill or tower, or ship in marine works.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 190 (quote), 195-202&lt;/ref&gt;  The leading artist was [[Jacob van Ruisdael]] (1628–1682), who produced a great quantity and variety of work, using every typical Dutch subject except the Italianate landscape (below); instead he produced "Nordic" landscapes of dark and dramatic mountain pine forests with rushing torrents and waterfalls.&lt;ref&gt;Derived from works by [[Allart van Everdingen]] who, unlike Ruysdael, had visited Norway, in 1644. Slive, 203&lt;/ref&gt;  

His pupil was [[Meindert Hobbema]] (1638–1709), best known for his atypical ''[[Avenue at Middelharnis]]'' (1689, London), a departure from his usual scenes of watermills and roads through woods. Two other artists with more personal styles, whose best work included larger pictures (up to a metre or more across), were [[Aelbert Cuyp]] (1620–1691) and [[Philips Koninck]] (1619–1688). Cuyp took golden Italian light and used it in evening scenes with a group of figures in the foreground and behind them a river and wide landscape. Koninck's best works are panoramic views, as from a hill, over wide flat farmlands, with a huge sky.

A different type of landscape, produced throughout the tonal and classical phases, was the romantic Italianate landscape, typically in more mountainous settings than are found in the Netherlands, with golden light, and sometimes picturesque Mediterranean [[staffage]] and ruins. Not all the artists who specialized in these had visited Italy. [[Jan Both]] (d. 1652), who had been to Rome and worked with [[Claude Lorrain]], was a leading developer of the subgenre, which influenced the work of many painters of landscapes with Dutch settings, such as Aelbert Cuyp. Other artists who consistently worked in the style were [[Nicolaes Berchem]] (1620–1683) and [[Adam Pijnacker]]. Italianate landscapes were popular as prints, and more paintings by Berchem were reproduced in engravings during the period itself than those of any other artist.&lt;ref name="Slive, 225"&gt;Slive, 225&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other artists do not fit in any of these groups, above all Rembrandt, whose relatively few painted landscapes show various influences, including some from [[Hercules Seghers]] (c. 1589–c. 1638); his very rare large mountain valley landscapes were a very personal development of 16th-century styles.&lt;ref&gt;Rembrandt owned seven Seghers; after a recent fire only 11 are now thought to survive – how many of Rembrandt's remain is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Aert van der Neer]] (d. 1677) painted very small scenes of rivers at night or under ice and snow.

Landscapes with animals in the foreground were a distinct sub-type, and were painted by Cuyp, [[Paulus Potter]] (1625–1654), [[Albert Jansz. Klomp]] (1625-1688), [[Adriaen van de Velde]] (1636–1672) and [[Karel Dujardin]] (1626–1678, farm animals), with [[Philips Wouwerman]] painting horses and riders in various settings. The cow was a symbol of prosperity to the Dutch, hitherto overlooked in art, and apart from the horse by far the most commonly shown animal; goats were used to indicate Italy. Potter's ''The Young Bull'' is an enormous and famous portrait which Napoleon took to Paris (it later returned) though livestock analysts have noted from the depiction of the various parts of the anatomy that it appears to be a composite of studies of six different animals of widely different ages.
[[File:Assetimage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], ''[[Assendelft]] Church'', 1649, with the gravestone of [[Jan Saenredam|his father]] in the foreground.]]

Architecture also fascinated the Dutch, churches in particular. At the start of the period the main tradition was of fanciful palaces and city views of invented Northern Mannerist architecture, which Flemish painting continued to develop, and in Holland was represented by [[Dirck van Delen]]. A greater realism began to appear and the exteriors and interiors of actual buildings were reproduced, though not always faithfully. During the century understanding of the proper rendering of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] grew and were enthusiastically applied. Several artists specialized in church interiors.

[[Pieter Jansz Saenredam]], whose father [[Jan Saenredam]] engraved sensuous nude Mannerist goddesses, painted unpeopled views of now whitewashed Gothic city churches. His emphasis on even light and geometry, with little depiction of surface textures, is brought out by comparing his works with those of [[Emanuel de Witte]], who left in the people, uneven floors, contrasts of light and such clutter of church furniture as remained in Calvinist churches, all usually ignored by Saenredam.  [[Gerard Houckgeest]], followed by van Witte and [[Hendrick van Vliet]], had supplemented the traditional view along a main axis of the church with diagonal views that added drama and interest.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 268-273&lt;/ref&gt;  

[[Gerrit Berckheyde]] specialized in lightly populated views of main city streets, squares, and major public buildings; [[Jan van der Heyden]] preferred more intimate scenes of quieter Amsterdam streets, often with trees and canals. These were real views, but he did not hesitate to adjust them for compositional effect.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 273-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dutch Republic]] relied on trade by sea for its exceptional wealth, had naval wars with Britain and other nations during the period, and was criss-crossed by rivers and canals. It is therefore no surprise that the genre of [[marine art|maritime painting]] was enormously popular, and taken to new heights in the period by Dutch artists; as with landscapes, the move from the artificial elevated view typical of earlier marine painting was a crucial step.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-216&lt;/ref&gt;  Pictures of sea battles told the stories of a [[Dutch navy]] at the peak of its glory, though today it is usually the more tranquil scenes that are highly estimated. Ships are normally at sea, and dock scenes surprisingly absent.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

More often than not, even small ships fly the [[Flag of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch tricolour]], and many vessels can be identified as naval or one of the many other government ships. Many pictures included some land, with a beach or harbour viewpoint, or a view across an estuary. Other artists specialized in river scenes, from the small pictures of [[Salomon van Ruysdael]] with little boats and reed-banks to the large Italianate landscapes of [[Aelbert Cuyp]], where the sun is usually setting over a wide river. The genre naturally shares much with landscape painting, and in developing the depiction of the sky the two went together; many landscape artists also painted beach and river scenes. Artists included [[Jan Porcellis]], [[Simon de Vlieger]], [[Jan van de Cappelle]], [[Hendrick Dubbels]] and [[Abraham Storck]].  [[Willem van de Velde the Elder]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|his son]] are the leading masters of the later decades, tending, as at the beginning of the century, to make the ship the subject, whereas in tonal works of earlier decades the emphasis had been on the sea and the weather. They left for London in 1672, leaving the master of heavy seas, the German-born [[Ludolf Bakhuizen]], as the leading artist.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 213-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==Still lifes==
[[File:Pieter Claesz 002b.jpg|thumb|[[Pieter Claesz]], ''Vanitas'' (1630)]]

[[Still lifes]] were a great opportunity to display skill in painting textures and surfaces in great detail and with realistic light effects. Food of all kinds laid out on a table, silver cutlery, intricate patterns and subtle folds in table cloths and flowers all challenged painters.

Several types of subject were recognised: ''banketje'' were "banquet pieces", ''ontbijtjes'' simpler "breakfast pieces".&lt;ref&gt;MacLaren, 79&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtually all still lifes had a moralistic message, usually concerning the brevity of life – this is known as the [[vanitas]] theme – implicit even in the absence of an obvious symbol like a skull, or less obvious one such as a half-peeled lemon (like life, sweet in appearance but bitter to taste).&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 279-281. Fuchs, 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Flowers wilt and food decays, and silver is of no use to the soul. Nevertheless, the force of this message seems less powerful in the more elaborate pieces of the second half of the century.

[[File:Pronkstillleven.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abraham van Beijeren]] (c. 1660); "ostentatious" still life.]]

Initially the objects shown were nearly always mundane. However, from the mid-century ''[[pronkstilleven]]s'' ("ostentatious still lifes"), which depicted expensive and exotic objects and had been developed as a subgenre in the 1640s in Antwerp by Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]], became more popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100349439?rskey=FT16aA&amp;result=0&amp;q=pronkstilleven Pronkstilleven] in: Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms&lt;/ref&gt; The early realist, tonal and classical phases of landscape painting had counterparts in still life painting.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 113-6&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Willem Claeszoon Heda]] (1595–c. 1680) and [[Willem Kalf]] (1619–1693) led the change to the ''pronkstilleven'', while [[Pieter Claesz]] (d. 1660) preferred to paint simpler "ontbijt" ("breakfast pieces"), or explicit ''vanitas'' pieces.

In all these painters, colours are often very muted, with browns dominating, especially in the middle of the century. This is less true of the works of [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]] (1606–1684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in [[Antwerp]]. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem.

[[File:Jakob Gillig - Freshwater Fish.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacob Gillig]], ''Freshwater Fish'' (1684)]]
Flower paintings formed a sub-group with its own specialists, and were occasionally the speciality of the few women artists, such as [[Maria van Oosterwyck]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gQLqRd7hJq0C&amp;pg=PA984&amp;dq=Houbraken+Leyster&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0M61S8yHOuKJ4gbB1oWbCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Houbraken%20Leyster&amp;f=false and only a few others, see Slive, 128, 320-321 and index, and Schama, 414. The outstanding woman artist of the age was Judith Leyster.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch also led the world in botanical and other scientific drawings, prints and book illustrations. Despite the intense realism of individual flowers, paintings were composed from individual studies or even book illustrations, and blooms from very different seasons were routinely included in the same composition, and the same flowers reappear in different works, just as pieces of tableware do. There was also a fundamental unreality in that bouquets of flowers in vases were not in fact at all common in houses at the time – even the very rich displayed flowers one by one in  [[delftware]] [[Tulipiere|tulip-holder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 111-112. Slive, 279-281, also covering unseasonal and recurring blooms.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch tradition was largely begun by [[Ambrosius Bosschaert]] (1573–1621), a Flemish-born flower painter who had settled in the north by the beginning of the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law [[Balthasar van der Ast]] (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a dark background, became more popular, exemplified by the works of [[Willem van Aelst]] (1627–1683). Painters from [[Leiden]], The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre.

Dead game, and birds painted live but studied from the dead, were another subgenre, as were dead fish, a staple of the Dutch diet – [[Abraham van Beijeren]] did many of these.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 287-291&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dutch were less given to the Flemish style of combining large still life elements with other types of painting – they would have been considered prideful in portraits – and the Flemish habit of specialist painters collaborating on the different elements in the same work. But this sometimes did happen – Philips Wouwerman was occasionally used to add men and horses to turn a landscape into a hunting or skirmish scene, Berchem or Adriaen van de Velde to add people or farm animals.

==Foreign lands==
[[File:Gezicht op Olinda, Brazilië Rijksmuseum SK-A-742.jpeg|thumb|[[Frans Post]], scene in [[Dutch Brazil]]; painted in 1662, some years after the colony was lost.]]
For Dutch artists, Karel van Mander's ''Schilderboeck'' was meant not only as a list of biographies, but also a source of advice for young artists. It quickly became a classic standard work for generations of young Dutch and Flemish artists in the 17th century. The book advised artists to travel and see the sights of Florence and Rome, and after 1604 many did so.  However, it is noticeable that the most important Dutch artists in all fields, figures such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hals, Steen, Jacob van Ruisdael, and others, did not make the voyage.&lt;ref name="Fuchs, 43"/&gt;

Many Dutch (and Flemish) painters worked abroad or exported their work; [[printmaking]] was also an important export market, by which Rembrandt became known across Europe. The [[Dutch Gift]] to [[Charles II of England]] was a diplomatic gift which included four contemporary Dutch paintings. English painting was heavily reliant on Dutch painters, with Sir [[Peter Lely]] followed by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]], developing the English portrait style established by the Flemish [[Anthony van Dyck]] before the [[English Civil War]]. The marine painters van der Velde, [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son]], were among several artists who left Holland at the French invasion of 1672, which brought a collapse in the art market. They also moved to London, and the beginnings of English landscape painting were established by several less distinguished Dutch painters, such as [[Hendrick Danckerts]].

The [[Bamboccianti]] were a colony of Dutch artists who introduced the genre scene to Italy.  [[Jan Weenix]] and [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] specialized in game and birds, dead or alive, and were in demand for country house and shooting-lodge [[overdoor]]s across Northern Europe.  

Although the Dutch control of the northeast sugar-producing region of [[Dutch Brazil]] turned out to be brief (1630-54), Governor [[Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen]] invited Dutch artists to paint scenes which are valuable in showing the seventeenth-century landscape and peoples of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Rüdger Joppien. "The Dutch Vision of Brazil: Johan Maurits and His Artists," in ''Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, 1604-1679: A Humanist Prince in Europe and Brazil'', ed. Ernst van den Boogaart, et al. 297-376. The Hague: Johan Maurits van Nassau Stichting, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The two most well known of these artists were [[Frans Post]], a landscapist, and a still life painter, [[Albert Eckhout]], who produced ethnographic paintings of Brazil's population. These were originally displayed in the Great Hall of the Vrijburg Palace in [[Recife]].&lt;!--  Eckhout's drawings influenced [[Jan van Kessel]]'s {{dn}} work in Antwerp.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic'', pp. 171-72. With the Portuguese replacementr of the Dutch, Maurits gave the Vrijburg Palace paintings to [[Frederick III of Denmark]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a market in Amsterdam for such paintings,&lt;ref&gt;Michiel van Groesen, ''Amsterdam's Atlantic: Print Culture and the Making of Dutch Brazil''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press 2017, pp. 150-51.&lt;/ref&gt; and Post continued to produce Brazilian scenes for years after his return to the Netherlands.  The [[Dutch East Indies]] were covered much less well artistically.

==Subsequent reputation==
[[File:Philips Wouwerman - Travelers Awaiting a Ferry.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philips Wouwerman]], ''Travelers Awaiting a Ferry'' (1649); a landscape with Wouwerman's trademark highlight of a white horse.]]

The enormous success of 17th-century Dutch painting overpowered the work of subsequent generations, and no Dutch painter of the 18th century—nor, arguably, a 19th-century one before [[Van Gogh]]—is well known outside the Netherlands. Already by the end of the period artists were complaining that buyers were more interested in dead than living artists.

If only because of the enormous quantities produced, Dutch Golden Age painting has always formed a significant part of collections of [[Old Master]] paintings, itself a term invented in the 18th century to describe Dutch Golden Age artists. Taking only Wouwerman paintings in old royal collections, there are more than 60 in [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister|Dresden]] and over 50 in the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]].&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 212&lt;/ref&gt;  But the reputation of the period has shown many changes and shifts of emphasis. One nearly constant factor has been admiration for [[Rembrandt]], especially since the Romantic period. Other artists have shown drastic shifts in critical fortune and market price; at the end of the period some of the active Leiden [[fijnschilders]] had enormous reputations, but since the mid-19th century realist works in various genres have been far more appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;See Reitlinger, 11-15, 23-4, and ''passim'', and listings for individual artists&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermeer was rescued from near-total obscurity in the 19th century, by which time several of his works had been re-attributed to others. However the fact that so many of his works were already in major collections, often attributed to other artists, demonstrates that the quality of individual paintings was recognised even if his collective oeuvre was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;See Reitlinger, 483-4, and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;  Other artists have continued to be rescued from the mass of little known painters: the late and very simple still lifes of [[Adriaen Coorte]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 319&lt;/ref&gt; and the landscapists [[Jacobus Mancaden]] and [[Frans Post]] earlier in the century.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 191-2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gerard ter Borch (II) 019.jpg|thumb|[[Gerard ter Borch]], ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', or ''Brothel Scene'' (c. 1654; Amsterdam version).]]

Genre paintings were long popular, but little-regarded. In 1780 [[Horace Walpole]] disapproved that they "invite laughter to divert itself with the nastiest indelicacy of boors".&lt;ref&gt;"Advertisement" or Preface to Vol. 4 of the 2nd edition of ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', based on [[George Vertue]]'s notebooks, page ix, 1782, J. Dodwell, London, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AzRo__K1AqYC&amp;printsec=frontcover google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]], the English leader of 18th-century [[academic art]], made several revealing comments on Dutch art. He was impressed by the quality of Vermeer's ''Milkmaid'' (illustrated at the start of this article), and the liveliness of Hals' portraits, regretting he lacked the "patience" to finish them properly, and lamented that Steen had not been born in Italy and formed by the [[High Renaissance]], so that his talent could have been put to better use.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 144 (Vermeer), 41-2 (Hals), 173 (Steen)&lt;/ref&gt;  By Reynold's time the moralist aspect of genre painting was no longer understood, even in the Netherlands; the famous example is the so-called ''[[The Gallant Conversation|Paternal Admonition]]'', as it was then known, by [[Gerard ter Borch]]. This was praised by [[Goethe]] and others for the delicacy of its depiction of a father reprimanding his daughter. In fact to most (but not all) modern scholars it is a proposition scene in a brothel – there are two versions (Berlin &amp; Amsterdam) and it is unclear whether a "tell-tale coin" in the man's hand has been removed or overpainted in either.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 158-160 (coin quote), and Fuchs, 147-8, who uses the title ''Brothel Scene''. Franits, 146-7, citing Alison Kettering, says there is "deliberate vagueness" as to the subject, and still uses the title ''Paternal Admonition''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 18th century, the down to earth realism of Dutch painting was a "[[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] taste" in England, and in France associated with [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[rationalism]] and aspirations for political reform.&lt;ref&gt;Reitlinger, I, 11-15. Quote p.13&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century, with a near-universal respect for realism, and the final decline of the hierarchy of genres, contemporary painters began to borrow from genre painters both their realism and their use of objects for narrative purposes, and paint similar subjects themselves, with all the genres the Dutch had pioneered appearing on far larger canvases (still lifes excepted).

In landscape painting, the Italianate artists were the most influential and highly regarded in the 18th century, but [[John Constable]] was among those Romantics who denounced them for artificiality, preferring the tonal and classical artists.&lt;ref name="Slive, 225"/&gt;  In fact both groups remained influential and popular in the 19th century.

The '''Egypt Exploration Society''' (EES) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] non-profit organization. The society was founded in 1882 by [[Amelia Edwards]] and [[Reginald Stuart Poole]] in order to examine and excavate in the areas of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. The intent was to study and analyze the results of the excavations and publish the information for the scholarly world.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/about-us/history.html|title=Egypt Exploration Society|website=Ees.ac.uk|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EES have worked at many major Egyptian excavation and sites. Their discoveries include the discovery of a shrine for the goddess [[Hathor]], a statue of a cow from [[Deir el-Bahri]], the mortuary temple of [[Queen Hatshepsut]], and the sculpted model of [[Nefertiti]] from [[Amarna]]. The Society has made major contributions to the study of the ancient Egyptian world. &lt;ref name="world-archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-archaeology.com/features/egypt-exploration-society-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311180953/http://www.world-archaeology.com/features/egypt-exploration-society-2/ |archivedate=2014-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is based in London and is a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] under English law.&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|212384|THE EGYPT EXPLORATION SOCIETY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Amelia B Edwards 1890 in Amerika.jpg|thumb|Amelia Edwards in America, 1890]]
In 1873, the English writer [[Amelia Edwards]] was led to the sites of [[Egypt]] while encountering cold, wet climates in [[Europe]]. She and several friends ended up traveling up the [[Nile River]] from [[Cairo]] to [[Abu Simbel]]. She recorded the events and discoveries of this journey and eventually published it as ''A Thousand Miles up the Nile'' in 1876. The book became renowned for its description of 19th century [[Egypt]] and the largely un-excavated antiques that she encountered. Edwards's descriptions changed the world's perspective on both moderns and [[Ancient Egypt]]. This attracted the attention of both scholarly society and the rest of the world. It ended up becoming a bestseller due to this increased interest, which prompted Edwards to think about continuing her studies of [[Ancient Egypt]]. In 1882, [[Amelia Edwards]] and [[Reginald Stuart Poole]], an employee from the Department of Coins and Medals at the [[British Museum]], decided to create the Egypt Exploration Fund as a way to raise funds for more excavations in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]], which had been noted as being rarely visited.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; After announcing their intentions in  ''[[The Times]]'', they started off being funded by individuals such as the [[Edward Benson (bishop)|Archbishop of Canterbury]]. the poet [[Robert Browning]] and Sir [[Erasmus Wilson]]. Wilson, in particular, showed enough interest to pledge £500 to the Egypt Exploration Fund. This marked the start of the Egypt Exploration Society.&lt;ref name="world-archaeology" /&gt; 

===Beginning===
The first excavator of the Egypt Exploration Fund was [[Edouard Naville]], a Swiss Egyptologist and Biblical scholar. In January 1883, Naville set out for [[Tell el-Maskhuta]]. His goal was to find the route of the Biblical exodus as the Fund had decided to broaden its interests in order to appeal to a wider audience. Naville's work attracted much interest from the public and at the first General Meeting of the Fund, which happened on 3 July 1883, the society was seen to have a good amount of funds in its accounts. A copy of Naville's work was distributed to the subscribers of the Fund. Eventually the Fund decided to have the subscribers become members instead.&lt;ref name="world-archaeology" /&gt;

===Second excavation===
During the second excavation, the Fund sent [[Flinders Petrie]], an English Egyptologist, who went to Tanis, a site linked to the Biblical city of [[Zoan]]. Petrie focussed much of his work on the ordinary dwellings of the site. This presented a new array of discoveries for the society. Petrie was among the first to understand that there was more than aesthetically appealing objects. Rather, he understood that many objects could provide information about the society of that time. He developed many techniques in which he could excavate and record the objects he found and his overall findings. At the end of his excavation, Petrie was able to bring back many valuable findings and items that he donated to the [[British Museum]]. The society became one of the first to provide scientifically excavated objects around [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as well as overseas.&lt;ref name="world-archaeology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third excavation===
By the time of the third excavation, and the third year since the Fund was established, the society was able to send [[Edouard Naville]], [[Flinders Petrie]] and [[Francis Llewellyn Griffith]] to Egypt. During this time and for the next few years, the Fund was able to bring back many findings, which resulted in the advancement of knowledge on [[Ancient Egypt]]. Some of the sites included the fortified camp and Tell Dafana and the temple of [[Bastet]].&lt;ref name="world-archaeology" /&gt;

==Today==
In 1919, at the end of the [[First World War]], the Egypt Excavation Fund changed its name to the Egypt Exploration Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury-project/institutions/egypt_exploration.htm|title=UCL Bloomsbury Project|website=Ucl.ac.uk|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the EES continues to publish its annual organ, the ''[[Journal of Egyptian Archaeology]]'', which details the society's findings, for all of its members to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/publications/journal-egyptian-archaeology.html|title=Egypt Exploration Society|website=Ees.ac.uk|access-date=2016-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also publish a newsletter bi-annually called ''Egyptian Archaeology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ees.ac.uk/publications/index.html |title=Egypt Exploration Society |website=Ees.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egypt Exploration Society has been based in Doughty Mews, London WC1N since 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lurotbrand.co.uk/flipbook/mewsnews2010-autumn/ |title=Latest Property News |publisher=Lurot Brand |date= |accessdate=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eutychius of Alexandria''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Sa'id ibn Batriq'' or ''Bitriq''; 10 September 877&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; 12 May 940)&lt;ref name="Iranica article"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/eutychius |title=Eutychius of Alexandria |first=Sidney H. |last=Griffith |date=15 December 1998 |work=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the Melkite Patriarch of Alexandria. He is known for being one of the first Christian Egyptian writers to use the [[Arabic language]]. His writings include the chronicle ''Nazm al-Jauhar'' ("Row of Jewels"), also known by its Latin title ''Eutychii Annales'' ("The Annals of Eutychius").

==Life==
He was born in Fustat (old [[Cairo]]). Eutychius spent much of his life as a medical practitioner or ''Mutatabbib''. His life was roughly contemporary with [[Agapius the historian]], although neither displays knowledge of the other.

He did not know Greek, but was able to access Greek texts in existing [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translations.

In 932 he became the [[Melkite]] Patriarch of Alexandria at the age of 60.&lt;ref name="Iranica article"/&gt;  Because he had never held any clerical office, his appointment met with considerable opposition, which lasted the remainder of his life. His appointment was probably due to the influence of the Moslem rulers.&lt;ref name="Reinhard Pummer p.430"&gt;Reinhard Pummer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dhDlzh--Q2AC&amp;pg=PA430 Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism], p.430&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
The most important work is the ''Nazm al-Jauhar'', a world chronicle, which he began before becoming Patriarch, and dedicated to his brother.  It begins with the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], and runs down to his own times. His ''Nazm al-Jauhar'' is a valuable source for events in [[Persia]] prior to the [[rise of Islam]] and the later [[Sassanid]] rulers. For events after the rise of Islam, Eutychius makes use of Moslem sources. He also drew on legendary and hagiographical material.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The history was adapted and continued to 1028 by [[Yahya of Antioch|Yahya ibn Sa'id]], in which form it became known in Antioch and then Europe; but it continued to be expanded, and to circulate in this modified form.  Numerous copies were made.&lt;ref name="Reinhard Pummer p.430"/&gt; However the autograph was recently located at [[Mount Sinai]] (''Sinaiticus Arabicus'' 582).  The start and end of the manuscript are missing, but can be reconstructed from copies.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Pummer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dhDlzh--Q2AC&amp;pg=PA431 Early Christian Authors on Samaritans and Samaritanism], p.431&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works are a book on medicine and an apologetic work. A manuscript of the former has been located in Aleppo, although not published.  The latter text has not been found as yet.

The process of '''expropriation''' "occurs when a public agency (for example, the provincial government and its agencies, regional districts, municipalities, school boards, post-secondary institutions and utilities) takes private property for a purpose deemed to be in the public interest".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.gov.bc.ca/rights.htm What is expropriation] British Columbia Expropriation Compensation Board. Retrieved: 8 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[eminent domain]], expropriation may also refer to the taking of private property by a ''private'' entity authorized by a government to take property in certain situations.

Due to political risks that are involved when countries engage in international business it is important to understand the expropriation risks and laws within each of the countries that business is conducted in order to understand the risks as an investor in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Chris. ''Avoiding Expropriation and Managing Political Risk in Emerging Market''. Lexology. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One example of expropriation occurred between the [[United States]] and [[Mexico]] in 1938 when the Mexican president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] signed an order that expropriated almost all of the foreign oil companies operating in Mexico.  This initially turned out to have great negative consequences on the Mexican economy when their oil exports were boycotted by major oil companies, decreasing exports dramatically,&lt;ref&gt;''Mexican Expropriation of Foreign Oil''. US Department of State Office of the Historian. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  but later on the economic benefits of this move became apparent, with the new national oil company [[PEMEX]] being an important contributor to the [[Mexican Miracle]],&lt;ref&gt;''Crónica del petróleo en México'' (Spanish), Historical Archive of Mexican Petroleums ([[Pemex]]). http://petroleo.colmex.mx/images/stories/archivos/misc/cronica_petroleo_mexico.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries soon followed with oil nationalisation carried out in much of [[Latin America]] and the developing world.

==Marxist theory==
The term appears as "expropriation of expropriators ([[ruling class]]es)" in [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], and also as the slogan "Loot the looters!" ("грабь награбленное"), which was very popular during the Russian [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Orlando Figes]], ''A People's Tragedy: Russian Revolution'', 1996, {{ISBN|0-7126-7327-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe [[nationalization]] campaigns by [[communist states]], such as [[dekulakization]] and [[collectivization in the USSR]].&lt;ref name="Pipes"&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] ''Property and Freedom'', Vintage Books, A division of Random House, Inc., New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0-375-70447-7}}, page 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term expropriation is found by late Marx writings, specifically in “Karl Marx: A letter to Otechestvenye Zapiski” to describe the process of turning agrarian/rural peasants into wage labourers/proletarians if the Russian country is to become a capitalist nation like that of the Western European nations.

[[File:Fetish_Fashion_2012.jpg|thumb|250px|Fetish Fashion designs of [[latex clothing]] at the 2012 Los Angeles Fetish Film Festival]]
[[File:Milo Moiré.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Swiss artist [[Milo Moiré]] performs wearing [[pasties]] and cut-out [[bra]] top, 2016.]]
'''Fetish fashion''' is any style or [[human physical appearance|appearance]] in the form of a
type of clothing or [[fashion accessory|accessory]], created to be extreme or provocative in a [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] manner.  These styles are not usually worn by the majority of people on any regular basis. They are usually made of materials such as [[Leather fetishism|leather]], [[latex]] or [[synthetic rubber]] or [[plastic]], [[nylon]], [[PVC fetishism|PVC]], [[spandex fetishism|spandex]], [[fishnet (material)|fishnet]], and [[stainless steel]]. Some fetish fashion items include: [[stiletto heel]] shoes and [[boot]]s (most notably the [[ballet boot]]), [[hobble skirt]]s, [[corset]]s, [[Collar (BDSM)|collar]]s, full-body [[latex]] [[catsuit]]s, [[stockings]], [[miniskirt]], crotchless [[underwear]], [[garter (stockings)|garters]], [[Lock (security device)|lock]]s, [[Ring (jewellery)|ring]]s, zippers, [[eyewear]], [[handcuffs]], and stylized costumes based on more traditional outfits, such as wedding dresses that are almost completely see-through lace. 
Fetish fashions are sometimes confused with [[costuming]], because both are usually understood to be clothing that is not worn as the usual wardrobe of people, and are instead worn to create a particular reaction.

Fetish fashions are usually considered to be separate from those clothing items used in [[cosplay]], whereby these exotic fashions are specifically used as costuming to effect a certain situation rather than to be merely worn; such as the creation of a character for picture play.  However, sometimes the two areas do overlap.  For example, in [[Japan]], many themed restaurants have waitresses who wear costumes such as a suit made of latex or a stylized [[French maid]] outfit.

Fetish fashion clothing is often modelled by specialist [[fetish model]]s.

Some type of garments that women wear to routinely improve their appearance are thought of as erotic and qualify as fetish wear: corsets and high heels.  Most fetish wear is not practical enough for routine daily wear. An example of a fetish costume worn by women is the [[dominatrix]] costume. This typically consists of dark or black garments including a corset or bustier, stockings and high-heeled footwear such as [[thigh-high boots]] to enhance the dominating appearance. An accessory such as a whip or a riding crop is often carried.

==History==
Fetish fashion has no specific origin point because certain fashions that were appreciated specifically for themselves or worn as part of a specific subculture have been noted since the earliest days of clothing. Some scholars, like Michael Hayworth, argue that the use of corsetry and hobble skirts back in the late 18th century was the first mainstream note of fetish fashions, because the majority of society did not have access to these articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia|last=Hayworth|first=Michael|publisher=Garland Publishing Inc.|year=1994|isbn=|editor-last=Bullough|editor-first=Vern L.|location=New York and London|pages=203-4|chapter=Fashion, Clothing, and Sex|editor-last2=Bullough|editor-first2=Bonnie}}&lt;/ref&gt; These items were specifically appreciated for themselves (i.e. the person liked the woman wearing the corset rather than just the woman by herself).

A [[leather subculture]] appeared amongst the underground gay community of London, England after World War II with gay men wearing items of leather clothing. This leather subculture later became more mainstream in the British 1960s due to the influence of [[rock music]]ians such as [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Who]], and television performers such as [[Diana Rigg]] and [[Honor Blackman]] in ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'', who wore full body leather [[catsuit]]s and full limb-covering leather and latex gloves and [[boot]]s.

Many fashion designers incorporate elements of the fetish subculture into their creations or directly create products based on elements that are not accepted by the mainstream. [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[Vivienne Westwood]] created several restrictive [[BDSM]]-inspired clothing items of [[punk fashion]] for the 1970s [[punk subculture]]; in particular [[Bondage pants|bondage trousers]], which connect the wearer's legs with straps. The more recent fetish clothing makers House of Harlot and [[Torture Garden (fetish club)|Torture Garden]] Clothing, Breathless of London, Vex Latex Clothing and Madame S of California focus on using latex and leather as the base material for their creations, rather than as an accessory.

==Publications==
Fetish fashions became popularized in the United States during the 1950s through books and magazines such as ''[[Bizarre (fetish magazine)|Bizarre]]'' and many other underground publications. ''[[Skin Two]]'' is a contemporary fetish magazine covering many aspects of the worldwide fetish subculture. The name is a reference to fetish clothing as a second skin.

== Mainstream ==
[[File:Dasha Astafieva at One Sunset, West Hollywood.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Playboy Playmate]] [[Dasha Astafieva]] wearing a [[see-through clothing|see-through]] [[fishnet]] dress without [[undergarments|underwear]], poses for photographers at a [[Playboy]] party in USA, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/hugh-hefner-gal-pal-dasha-astafieva-bares-playboy-red-carpet-article-1.357435|title=Hugh Hefner gal pal Dasha Astafieva bares all on Playboy red carpet|work=NY Daily News|author=Lauren Johnston|date=18 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Fetish fashion has had an influence on mainstream fashion, both on and off the [[Runway (fashion)|runway]]. Many well-known designers have used fetish wear as an inspiration, borrowing details and incorporating materials such as latex, PVC, [[lace]], vinyl and [[patent leather]]. Such designers include [[Jonathan Saunders]], [[Alexander McQueen]], [[Christian Dior]], [[Chanel]] and [[Nicholas Kirkwood]]. The Alexander McQueen Autumn/Winter 2016 [[ready-to-wear]] collection was influenced by fetish fashion, and the inspiration of materials and pieces such as harnesses and corsets can be seen on most of the looks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2016-ready-to-wear/alexander-mcqueen|title=Alexander McQueen Fall 2016 Ready-to-Wear Fashion Show|last=Mower|first=Sarah|work=Vogue|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other brands have been created specifically for the fetish clothing luxury market. Zana Bayne, a post-fetish leather brand based in New York City was founded by Zana Bayne in 2010. Their leather works combine a quality of craftsmanship with a novel use of S&amp;M/punk-inspired harnesses, and their work has been worn by celebrities such as [[Beyoncé]] and [[Lady Gaga]].

[[File:George Lincoln Burr-1902.jpg|thumb|George Lincoln Burr, circa 1902]]

'''George Lincoln Burr''' (January 30, 1857 &amp;ndash; June 27, 1938) was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[historian]], [[diplomat]], [[author]], and [[educator]], best known as a Professor of History and Librarian at [[Cornell University]], and as the closest collaborator of [[Andrew Dickson White]], the first President of Cornell.

Burr was born in [[Albany, New York]] and entered the [http://history.rays-place.com/ny/homer-ny.htm Cortland Academy] in 1869, where he first met [[Andrew Dickson White]], who was guest speaker for its 50th anniversary. The financial [[Panic of 1873]] wreaked havoc on his family's finances, and he was forced to leave school and seek employment at age 16. After a brief stint as a schoolmaster, he apprenticed as a printer of ''The Standard'' at Cortland. After 4 years, he had saved $200, sufficient for him to matriculate at Cornell in 1877. As a sophomore, Burr audited a course for seniors taught by White on the historical development of criminal law, and received permission to sit for the exam. Prof. White was so impressed by Burr's exam answers that he secretly appointed Burr as his examiner (i.e., grader) in history. White writes in his ''Autobiography,' "Of course this was kept entirely secret; for had the Seniors known that I had entrusted their papers to the tender mercies of a Sophomore, they would probably have mobbed me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1340 ''Autobiography of A. D. White, Vol. 1,''] Chapter XXII, at Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation in 1881, Burr accepted White's offer to serve as an instructor and examiner in modern history, and also as White's private secretary. This was the beginning of a literary partnership that lasted until White's death in 1918. Under White's tutelage, Burr developed into a scholar of medieval history. After traveling and studying in Switzerland, France, and Germany, Burr was appointed to the Cornell faculty in 1888. He was made Professor of Medieval History in 1892. In 1919, he was elected John Stambaugh Professor of History.

==Librarian, collector of Rare Books for A. D. White==
As the librarian of Andrew Dickson White's historical rare book collection from 1880 to 1922, Burr built Cornell's manuscript and rare book collections in the areas of witchcraft, the Reformation, and the French Revolution. His single most famous contribution in this area was his discovery in 1885, in the library at the [[University of Trier]], of the [[Cornelius Loos|Loos Manuscript]] (1592), one of the first books written in Germany against the witch trials of the late 16th century, and long believed destroyed by the [[Inquisition]].

This discovery led Burr to abruptly leave his studies in Europe to return to New York with the manuscript. He never earned any higher degree beyond his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from Cornell. (His higher degrees are all honorary ones: [[LL.D.]]s from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1904 and from [[Washington College]] in 1907, and a [[Litt.D.]] from Western Reserve, now [[Case Western]], in 1905).

=="Warfare of Science with Theology" ==
Starting in 1869, and throughout his career, Professor White argued that history showed the negative outcomes resulting from any attempt on the part of [[religion]] to interfere with the progress of [[science]]. Burr was deeply influenced by White's views, and assisted him in editing a series of articles, published in ''[[Popular Science]],'' covering all aspects of the debate. They published the two-volume ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (1896).

In addition to paying Burr for his assistance, White offered Burr credit on the title page, which Burr declined. Burr subsequently worked extensively on a revision of the work, which was never published. This response was typical of Burr. Although he felt a great deal of sympathy for White's project, Burr ultimately came to believe that the book did not accomplish what its title suggested; he re-titled the revised, second volume as the "Warfare of Humanity." In 1904 he wrote to White, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your book has, of course, the defects of its qualities. Its looseness of citation and broadness of statement are but a part of that genial companionableness and largeness which are its charm. Its whole treatment suggests rather the conversation of a scholarly and widely experienced man of action than the closet of the bookworm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = George Lincoln Burr: His Life|page=58|last=Bainton|first=Roland|year=1943|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Scholarly and teaching pursuits==
Burr's most noted contributions came from his teaching and service work. He served as co-editor of the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' from 1905–1915 with [[J. Franklin Jameson]], was a member of the [[American Historical Association]], and served as its President in 1916.  He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as historical consultant for the U. S. Commission appointed by U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]] to settle a boundary dispute between [[Venezuela]] and [[British Guiana]]. The commission included two university presidents, [[Andrew Dickson White]] of Cornell and [[Daniel Coit Gilman]] of Johns Hopkins, and White suggested that Burr be appointed to research the history and geography of the disputed territory. This assignment took Burr to archives in [[The Hague]] and [[London]]. He was also sent thousands of pages from the Venezuelan government, and in the end, this effort occupied much of his time from 1896–1899. His friend and colleague [[J. Franklin Jameson]] pronounced the Venezuela Boundary Commission report "as fine a piece of historical research and criticism as ever was buried in a government report."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = George Lincoln Burr: His Life|page=88|last=Bainton|first=Roland|year=1943|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Cornell, Burr is most remembered as a teacher who took great pains to encourage his students. He dined frequently at the Cornell women's dining hall, to demonstrate his support for women's education and to encourage student interest in history. His biographer, [[Roland Bainton]], credits Cornell in general and Burr in particular with producing historians who populated the history faculties at what were then the women's colleges of [[Vassar College|Vassar]] and [[Wellesley College|Wellesley]]. He also identifies Burr as a key consultant to faculty at Stanford University (due to his friendship with and respect for [[David Starr Jordan]]) and the University of California in the vetting of candidates. Among the students in whom he took an interest were [[Jessie Fauset]], Winifred (Sprague) Humphrey, and [[Charles A. Beard]].

Students and colleagues who have explicitly acknowledged Burr's influence include: 
* Lois Oliphant Gibbons &amp;ndash; Professor, [[Western College for Women]], now [[Miami University]]
* Elizabeth Donnan &amp;ndash; historian of the [[slave trade]] in America, author of the four-volume ''Documents Illustrative of the Slave Trade to America''
* Louise Fargo Brown &amp;ndash; the first woman to win the AHA Baxter Prize, in 1911, for her work, ''The Political Activities of the Baptists and Fifth-Monarchy Men in England during the Interregnum''
* Leo Gershoy &amp;ndash; professor at [[New York University]] (NYU) 1940–1975, and in whose name the AHA awards an annual prize for the best new book on 17th or 18th-century European history, and in whose name an annual lecture is given at NYU
* George Matthew Dutcher &amp;ndash; Professor of History at [[Wesleyan University]]
* George H. Sabine &amp;ndash; Professor of History, [[Ohio State University]]
* Edward M. Hulme &amp;ndash; Professor of History, [[Stanford University]] 1921–1937, and author of two books (see below) which explicitly state they are based on outlines "printed but not published" by George Lincoln Burr

Burr married Cornell graduate Mattie Alexander Martin in August 1907. She died after giving birth in January 1909, as did their child.

He discovered the [[Folsom Site]] in 1908.

Born to [[slave]]s in [[Midway, Texas]], McJunkin was approximately 14 years old when the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] ended. He worked as a [[cowboy]] for [[freight]]ers. He reportedly learned how to read from fellow cow punchers. McJunkin taught himself to read, write, speak Spanish, play the fiddle and guitar, eventually becoming an amateur archaeologist and historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abqjournal.com/2000/nm/who/12who09-19-99.htm "George McJunkin,"] ''Albuquerque Journal''.

He was also reported to be an expert [[bronc]] rider and one of the best ropers in the [[United States]]. He became foreman of the Crowfoot ranch near [[Folsom, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=blm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/cultural_resources/george_mcjunkin_feature/george_mcjunkin_feature.html|title=George McJunkin: A Chapter in New Mexico History|publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]]|last=Wilkinson|first=Brenda|accessdate=22 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224104837/http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/more/cultural_resources/george_mcjunkin_feature/george_mcjunkin_feature.html|archive-date=2013-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery of Folsom site==
After a flood which killed 18 people in Folsom, McJunkin assessed damage to the ranch.&lt;ref name=blm/&gt; While patching fence, McJunkin entered a small canyon, where he discovered remains of a giant prehistoric bison, now contained in the Smithsonian.  Between the ribs of the bison was a distinctive type of stone tool, now called a [[Folsom point]].  Recognizing the significance of the find, McJunkin left the site undisturbed and alerted archaeologists.  Giant Bison of the type McJunkin discovered had gone extinct at the end of the last Ice Age; proof of a human kill established the antiquity of North America's native cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Mann. ''1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus''. Knopf (2005) {{ISBN|1-4000-3205-9}}. pp 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

McJunkin's discovery of the [[Folsom Site]] changed New World archaeology, as it showed that people had inhabited North America since at least 9000 BCE, some 7000 years earlier than previously thought.&lt;ref name=blm/&gt;

Paine participated in the [[Runaway Scrape]]; and during 1836 and 1837, served [[Mexicans|Mexican]] officers captured at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] and housed at William Hardin's plantation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is said that she treated the prisoners kindly.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1839, she moved with Franklin's family to Seven Pines, a house within the town of Liberty.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Paine had children with two other slaves, Henry Rowe and Mr. Green. Her children were named Henry Rowe Jr. and Calvin and Melinda Green.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is unknown what happened to all of her children and no marriages were recorded, although it was noted that she was "not allowed to live with her husband."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She also lived with her children behind the main house.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After [[Juneteenth]], 1865, when slaves were freed, Paine continued to work for the Hardins, most likely having "signed a Freedmen's contract with Franklin Hardin."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She worked at Seven Pines until 1916, when there was a [[fire]] that nearly destroyed the house.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Paine rescued the Hardin family's letters and documents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Paine died in 1917.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The Home-Drummond grave, Kincardine-in-Menteith.jpg|thumb|The Home-Drummond grave, Kincardine-in-Menteith]]
'''Henry Home, Lord Kames''' (1696{{spaced ndash}}27 December 1782) was a Scottish [[advocate]], judge, philosopher, writer and [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural improver]]. A central figure of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], a founder member of the [[Philosophical Society of Edinburgh]], and active in the [[Select Society]], his [[protégé]]s included [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[James Boswell]].

==Biography==
Born at [[Kames House]], between [[Eccles, Berwickshire|Eccles]] and Birgham, [[Berwickshire]], he was [[educated at home]] by a [[private tutor]]. He studied law at [[Edinburgh]], was called to the bar in 1724, and became an [[advocate]]. He soon acquired reputation by a number of publications on the civil and Scottish law, and was one of the leaders of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. In 1752, he was "raised to the bench", thus acquiring the title of '''Lord Kames'''.

Home was on the panel of judges in the [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]] case which ruled that there could be no slavery in [[Scotland]].

His address in 1775 is shown as New Street on the [[Canongate]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1775&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the Home-Drummond plot at Kincardine-in-Menteith just west of [[Blair Drummond]].

==Writings==
Home wrote much about the importance of property to society.  In his ''Essay Upon Several Subjects Concerning British Antiquities'', written just after the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] he described how the [[politics of Scotland]] were not based on loyalty to Kings or Queens as Jacobites had said but on royal land grants given in return for loyalty.

In ''Historical Law Tracts'' and later in ''Sketches on the History of Man'' he described human history as having four distinct stages.  The first was as a [[hunter-gatherer]] where people avoided each other out of competition.  The second stage he described was a [[herder]] of domestic animals which required forming larger societies.  No laws were needed at these stages except those given by the head of the family or society.  [[Agriculture]] was the third stage requiring greater cooperation and new relationships to allow for trade or employment (or slavery).  He argued that 'the intimate union among a multitude of individuals, occasioned by agriculture' required a new set of rights and obligations in society.  This requires laws and law enforcers.  A fourth stage moves from villages and farms to [[civilization|seaports and market towns]] requiring yet more laws and complexity but also much to benefit from. Kames could see these stages within Scotland itself,&lt;ref&gt;''[[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]]'', by Arthur Hermann, {{ISBN|0-609-60635-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the pastoral/agricultural highlands, the agricultural/industrial lowlands and the growing commercial ("polite") towns of Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Home was a [[polygenist]], he believed God had created different races on earth in separate regions. In his book ''Sketches of the History of Man'', in 1774, Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.&lt;ref&gt;John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The above studies created the genre of the story of civilization and defined the fields of [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] and therefore the modern study of history for two hundred years.

In the popular book ''Elements of Criticism'' (1762) Home interrogated the notion of fixed or arbitrary rules of literary composition, and endeavoured to establish a new theory based on the principles of human nature. The late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental writing was associated with his notion that 'the genuine rules of criticism are all of them derived from the human heart.&lt;ref&gt;Vol. 1, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Prof Neil Rhodes has argued that Lord Kames played a significant role in the development of English as an academic discipline in the Scottish Universities.&lt;ref&gt;See 'From Rhetoric to Composition' in ''The Scottish Invention of English Literature'', ed. Robert Crawford, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social milieu==
He enjoyed intelligent conversation and cultivated a large number of intellectual associates, among them [[John Home]], [[David Hume]] and [[James Boswell]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109230637/http://www.jamesboswell.info/People/people.php?person=57]. [[Lord Monboddo]] was also a frequent debater of Kames, although these two usually had a fiercely competitive and adversarial relationship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1365">'''Historical determinism''' is the stance that events are historically predetermined or currently constrained by various forces. Historical determinism can be understood in contrast to its negation, i.e. the rejection of historical determinism.

Some political philosophies (e.g. Early and Stalinist [[Marxism]]) assert a [[historical materialism]] of either predetermination or constraint, or both.

Used as a pejorative, it is normally meant to designate an overdetermination of present possibilities by historical conditions.

[[Chennai]],&lt;!-- The following text is in Standard Unicode. If it renders incorrectly on your computer, you may need to upgrade your browser and/or OS --&gt; formerly known as Madras, is the capital of the [[states and territories of India|state]] of [[Tamil Nadu]] and is India's fourth largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeinchennai.com/chennai_History.htm|title=Chennai|publisher=lifeinchennai.com|accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. With an estimated population of 8.9 million (2014), the 400-year-old city is the 31st largest [[metropolitan area]] in the world.

[[File:Madras City 1909.jpg|thumb|right|The city of Madras in 1909]]
Chennai boasts of a long history from the English East India Company, through the British rule to its evolution in the late 20th century as a services and manufacturing hub for India. Additionally, the pre-city area of Chennai has a long history within the records of South Indian Empires.

==Ancient area in South India==
[[Chennai]], originally known as "Mudhiras", was located in the province of [[Tondaimandalam]], an area lying between Pennar river of [[Nellore]]  and the Pennar river of [[Cuddalore]]. The capital of the province was [[Kancheepuram]]. Tondaimandalam was ruled in the 2nd century by Tondaiman Ilam Tiraiyan, who was a representative of the [[Chola]] family at Kanchipuram. It is believed that Ilam Tiraiyan must have subdued the [[mudhiras]], the original inhabitants of the region and established his rule over Tondaimandalam. The modern city of "Chennai" arose from the British settlement of [[Fort St. George]] and its subsequent expansion through merging numerous native villages and European settlements around Fort St. George into the city of Madras. While most of the original city of Madras was built and settled by Europeans, the surrounding area which was later incorporated included the native temples of Thiruvanmiyur, Thiruvotriyur, Thiruvallikeni (Triplicane), Thirumayilai (Mylapore) which have existed for more than 1000 years. [[Thiruvanmiyur]], [[Thiruvotriyur]] and Thirumayilai are mentioned in the Thevarams of the Moovar (of the [[Nayanmars]]) while [[Thiruvallikeni]] in the [[Divya Prabandha|Nalayira Divya Prabhandhams]] (of the Alwars).

==Chola and Pallava eras==

[[File:Chennai.kapaleeswar2.jpg|thumb|The [[Kapaleeshwarar temple]] in [[Mylapore]] was built by the [[Pallava]] kings in the 7th century]] Subsequent to [[Ilam Tiraiyan]], the region was ruled by the [[Chola]] Prince [[Ilam Killi]]. The Chola occupation of Tondaimandalam was put to an end by the Andhra [[Satavahana]] incursions from the north under their King Pulumayi II. They appointed chieftains to look after the Kanchipuram region. [[Bappaswami]], who is considered as the ruler to rule from [[Kanchipuram]], was himself a chieftain (of the tract around) at Kanchipuram under the Satavahana empire in the beginning of the 3rd century. The Pallavas who had so far been merely viceroys, then became independent rulers of Kanchipuram and its surrounding areas.

The [[Pallavas]] held sway over this region from the beginning of the 3rd century to the closing years of the 9th century, except for the interval of some decades when the region was under the [[Kalabhras]]. The Pallavas were defeated by the Cholas under [[Aditya I]] by about 879 and the region was brought under the Chola rule. The [[Pandyas]] under [[Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan]] rose to power and the region was brought under the [[Pandya]] rule by putting an end to Chola supremacy in 1264.

==Historical establishment of the city==

===Under Vijayanagara Dynasty Nayaks===
The present day city of Chennai started as an English settlement known as [[Fort St. George]]. The region was then a part of [[Vijayanagara Empire]], then headquartered at [[Chandragiri]] in present-day [[Andhra Pradesh]]. The Vijayanagar rulers who controlled the area, appointed chieftains known as [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]] who ruled over the different regions of the province almost independently. The region was under the control of the Damerla Venkatadri Nayakudu, a Padma [[Velama]] Nayak chieftain of [[Srikalahasti]] and [[Vandavasi]]. He was also an influential [[Nayak dynasty|Nayak]] ruler under the Vijayanagara King [[Peda Venkata Raya]] then  based in [[Chandragiri]]-[[Vellore Fort]], was in-charge of the area of present Chennai city when the [[English East India Company]] arrived to establish a [[factory]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennai.tn.nic.in/chndistprof.htm#hist|title=District profile - Chennai district administration- official website.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Chennai.tn.nic.in|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=C S Srinivasachari|title=History of the City of Madras|year=1939|pages=63–69|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthecity035512mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obtaining of Land Grant====

On 20 August 1639 Francis Day of the East India Company along with Damerla Venkatadri Nayak travelled to [[Chandragiri]] palace to meet the Vijayanagara King [[Peda Venkata Raya]] and to obtain a grant for a small strip of land in the Coromandel Coast from  in Chandragiri as a place to build a factory and warehouse for their trading activities. It was from Damarla Venkatadri Nayaks domain, on 22 August 1639, the piece of land lying between the river [[Cooum]] almost at the point it enters the sea and another river known as the Egmore river was granted to East India Company after deed from Vijaynagara emperor.

On this piece of waste land was founded [[Fort St. George]], a fortified settlement of British merchants, factory workers, and other colonial settlers. Upon this settlement the English expanded their colony to include a number of other European communities, new British settlements, and various native villages, one of which was named Mudhirasa pattanam. It in honor of the later village upon which the British named the entire colony and the combined city Madras. Controversially, in an attempt to revise history and justify renaming the city as Chennai, the ruling party has purged the history of the early English Madras settlements. According to the new party history, instead of being named Madras, it was named Chennai, after a village called Chennapattanam, in honour of [[Damerla Chennappa mudirasa Nayakudu|Damerla Chennappa  mudirasa Nayaka]], father of Damerla Venkat mudirasa  Nayaka, who controlled the entire coastal country from Pulicat in the north to the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlement of [[Santhome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennai.tn.nic.in/chndistprof.htm#hist|title=District profile - Chennai district administration- official website.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Chennai.tn.nic.in|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=C S Srinivasachari|title=History of the City of Madras|year=1939|pages=63–69|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofthecity035512mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is widely recorded that while the official centre of the present settlement was designated Fort St. George, the British applied the name Madras to a new large city which had grown up around the Fort including the "White Town" consisting principally of British settlers, and "Black Town" consisting of principally Catholic Europeans and allied Indian minorities.
Thiruvotriyur is historically important  port city, now forms part of north chennai. vayiratharayan of Virukanbakkam alias Chenninallur.

==Early European settlers==
Modern Chennai had its origins as a [[Colonialism|colonial]] city and its initial growth was closely tied to its importance as an artificial harbour and trading centre. When the Portuguese arrived in 1522, they built a port and named it São Tomé, after the [[Christian]] apostle St. Thomas, who is believed to have preached there between the years 52 and 70. The region then passed into the hands of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]], who established themselves near [[Pulicat]] just north of the city in 1612. Both groups strived to grow their colonial populations and although their populations reached into 10,000 persons when the British arrived, they remained substantially outnumbered by the local Indian population.

By 1612, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] established themselves in Pulicat to the north.
In the 17th century the [[East India Company|English East India Company]] decided to build a factory on the east coast and in 1626 selected its site as [[Armagon]] (Dugarazpatnam), a village some 35 miles north of Pulicat. The calico cloth from the local area, which was in high demand, was of poor quality and not suitable for export to Europe. The English soon realized that  port Armagon was unsuitable for trade purposes. Francis Day, one of the officers of the company, who was then a Member of the Masulipatam Council and the Chief of the Armagon Factory, made a voyage of exploration in 1637 down the coast as far as [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] with a view to choosing a site for a new settlement.

===Permission from Vijayanagara Rulers===
At that time the Coromandel Coast was ruled by [[Peda Venkata Raya]], from the [[Aravidu Dynasty]] of [[Vijayanagara Empire]] based out of  [[Chandragiri]]-[[Vellore Fort|Vellore]]. Under the Kings, local chiefs or governors known as Nayaks ruled over each district.

Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka, local governor of the Vijayanagar Empire and Nayaka of [[Wandiwash]] (Vandavasi), ruled the coastal part of the region, from Pulicat to the Portuguese settlement of San Thome. He had his headquarters at Wandiwash, and his brother Ayyappa Nayakudu resided at [[Poonamallee]], a few miles to the west of Madras, where he looked after the affairs of the coast. [[Beri Thimmappa]], Francis Day's ''dubash'' ([[interpreter]]), was a close friend of Damarla Ayyappa Nayakudu. In the early 17th century Beri Thimmappa of the ''Puragiri Kshatriya ([[Perike]])'' caste migrated to the locality from [[Palacole]], near [[Machilipatnam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pwMk4FIcpuUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Madras%20tercentenary%20commemoration%20volume&amp;pg=RA1-PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Madras Tercentenary commemoration volume, Volume 1939]&lt;/ref&gt; Ayyappa Nayakudu persuaded his brother to lease the sandy strip to Francis Day and promised him trade benefits, army protection, and Persian horses in return. Francis Day wrote to his headquarters at [[Masulipatam]] for permission to inspect the proposed site at ''Madraspatnam'' and to examine the possibilities of trade there. ''Madraspatnam'' seemed favourable during the inspection, and the calicoes woven there were much cheaper than those at Armagon (Durgarazpatam).
[[File:Raja Mahal, Chandragiri.jpg|thumb|right|Raja Mahal Palace at [[Chandragiri]] from where Francis Day acquired permission from the King of [[Vijayanagar Empire|Vijaynagara]], [[Peda Venkata Raya]]]]
On 22 August 1639, Francis Day secured the [[land grant|Grant]] by the Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka, Nayaka of Wandiwash, giving over to the East India Company a three-mile long strip of land, a fishing village called ''Madraspatnam'', copies of which were endorsed by Andrew Cogan, the Chief of the Masulipatam Factory, and are even now preserved. The Grant was for a period of two years and empowered the Company to build a fort and castle on about five square kilometres of its strip of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2006/08/21/stories/2006082100560500.htm|title=Founders' Day, Madras |author=[[S. Muthiah]]|work=Hindu Times|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English Factors at Masulipatam were satisfied with Francis Day's work. They requested Day and the Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka to wait until the sanction of the superior English Presidency of [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] in [[Java (island)|Java]] could be obtained for their action. The main difficulty, among the English those days, was lack of money. In February 1640, Day and Cogan, accompanied by a few factors and writers, a garrison of about twenty-five European soldiers and a few other European artificers, besides a Hindu powder-maker named Naga Battan, proceeded to the land which had been granted and started a new English factory there. They reached Madraspatnam on 20 February 1640; and this date is important because it marks the first actual settlement of the English at the place.

==Grant establishing lawful self-rule==
The grant signed between Damarla Venkatadri and the English had to be authenticated or confirmed by the Raja of Chandragiri - Venkatapathy Rayulu. The Raja, Venkatapathy Rayulu, was succeeded by his nephew Sri Rangarayulu in 1642, and Sir Francis Day was succeeded by Thomas Ivy. The grant expired, and Ivy sent Factor Greenhill on a mission to Chandragiri to meet the new Raja and to get the grant renewed. A new grant was issued, copies of which are still available. It is dated October - November 1645. This new grant is important regarding the legal and civic development of the English settlement. Because the Raja operated an arbitrary and capricious legal code which fundamentally discriminated against private property, trade, and merchandising in general, and against non-Indians in particular, the new grant signed in 1645 expanded the rights of the English by empowering them to administer [[English Common Law]] amongst their colonists and [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil Law]] between the colonists and the other European, Muslim, and Hindu nationalities. Furthermore, it expanded the Company property by attaching an additional piece of land known as the Narimedu (or 'Jackal-ground') which lay to the west of the village of Madraspatnam. This new grant laid the foundation for the expansion of Madras into its present form. All three grants are said to have been engraved on gold plates which were later reported to have been plundered, disappearing during one of the genocides of the English colony. However, there are city records of their existence long afterwards, and it has been suggested that the present government may still hold them.
[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|An old 18th-century painting of Fort St George.]]

==Expansion of Fort St. George into Madras==
Francis Day and his superior Andrew Cogan can be considered as the founders of Madras (now Chennai). They began construction of the Fort St George on 23 April 1640 and houses for their residence. Their small fortified settlement quickly attracted other East Indian traders and as the Dutch position collapsed under hostile Indian power they also slowly joined the settlement. By the 1646, the settlement had reached 19,000 persons and with the Portuguese and Dutch populations at their forts substantially more. To further consolidate their position, the Company combined the various settlements around an expanded Fort St. George, which including its citadel also included a larger outside area surrounded by an additional wall. This area became the Fort St. George settlement. As stipulated by the Treaty signed with the Nayak, the British and other Christian Europeans were not allowed to decorate the outside of their buildings in any other color but white. As a result, over time, the area came to be known as 'White Town'.

According to the treaty, only Europeans, principally Protestant British settlers were allowed to live in this area as outside of this confine, non-Indians were not allowed to own property. However, other national groups, chiefly FrenchPortuguese, and other Catholic merchants had separate agreements with the Nayak which allowed them in turn to establish trading posts, factories, and warehouses. As the East India Company controlled the trade in the area, these non-British merchants established agreements with the Company for settling on Company land near "White Town" per agreements with the Nayak. Over time, Indians also arrived in ever greater numbers and soon, the Portuguese and other non-Protestant Christian Europeans were outnumbered. Following several outbreaks of violence by various Hindu and Muslim Indian communities against the Christian Europeans, White Town's defenses and its territorial charter was expanded to incorporate most of the area which had grown up around its walls thereby incorporating most of its Catholic European settlements. In turn they resettled the non-European merchants and their families and workers, almost entirely Muslim or of various Hindu castes outside of the newly expanded "White Town". This was also surrounded by a wall. To differentiate these non-European and non-Christian area from "White Town", the new settlement was termed "Black Town. Collectively, the original Fort St. George settlement, "White Town", and "Black Town" were called Madras.

During the course of the late 17th century, both plague and genocidal warfare reduced the population of the colony dramatically. Each time, the survivors fell back upon the safety of the [[Fort St George]]. As a result, owing to the frequency of outbursts of racial and national violence against the Europeans and especially the English, [[Fort St George]] with its impressive fortifications became the nucleus around which the city grew and rebuilt itself. Several times throughout the life of the colony, the Fort became the last refuge of Europeans and their allied Indian communities due to raids by several Indian rulers and powers, which resulted in the almost total destruction of the town. Each time the town and later city was rebuilt and repopulated with new English and European settlers. The Fort still stands today, and a part of it is used to house the Tamil Nadu [[Legislative Assembly]] and the Office of the [[Chief Minister]]. [[Elihu Yale]], after whom [[Yale University]] is named, was British governor of Madras for five years. Part of the fortune that he amassed in Madras as part of the colonial administration became the financial foundation for Yale University.

The city has changed its boundaries as well as the geographic limits of its quarters several times, principally as a result of raids by surrounding Hindu and Muslim powers. For instance, Golkonda forces under General [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]] conquered Madras in 1646, massacred or sold into slavery many of the Christian European inhabitants and their allied Indian communities, and brought Madras and its immediate surroundings under his control. Nonetheless, the Fort and its surrounding walls remained under British control who slowly rebuilt their colony with additional colonists despite another mass murder of Europeans in Black Town by anti-colonialists agitated by Golkonda and plague in the 1670s. In 1674, the expanded colony had nearly 50,000 mostly British and European colonists and was granted its own corporate charter, thereby officially establishing the modern day city. Eventually, after additional provocations from Golkonda, the British pushed back until they defeated him.

After the fall of Golkonda in 1687, the region came under the rule of the Mughal Emperors of Delhi who in turn granted new Charters and territorial borders for the area. Subsequently, [[Firmans]] were issued by the Mughal Emperor granting the rights of the English East India company in Madras and formally ending the official capacity of local rulers to attack the British. In the latter part of the 17th century, Madras steadily progressed during the period of the East India Company and under many Governors. Although most of the original Portuguese, Dutch, and British population had been killed during genocides during the Golkonda period, under Moghul protection, large numbers of British and Anglo-American settlers arrived to replenish these losses. As a result, during the Governorship of [[Elihu Yale]] (1687–92), the large number of British and European settlers led to the most important political event which was the formation of the institution of a [[Mayor]] and the [[Corporation]] for the city of Madras. Under this Charter, the British and Protestant inhabitants were granted the rights of self-government and independence from company law. In 1693, a ''perwanna'' was received from the local Nawab granting the towns of Tondiarpet, Purasawalkam and Egmore to the company which continued to rule from Fort St. George. The present parts of Chennai like Poonamalee (ancient Tamil name - ''Poo Iruntha valli''), Triplicane (ancient Tamil name - ''Thiru alli keni'') are mentioned in Tamil ''bhakti'' literature of the 6th - 9th centuries.[[Thomas Pitt]] became the Governor of Madras in 1698 and governed for eleven years. This period witnessed remarkable development of trade and increase in wealth resulting in the building of many fine houses, mansions, housing developments, an expanded port and city complete with new city walls, and various churches and schools for the British colonists and missionary schools for the local Indian population.

In 1746, [[Battle of Madras|Fort St George and Madras were captured]] at last. But this time it was by the French under General [[Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais|La Bourdonnais]], who used to be the [[Governor]] of [[Mauritius]]. Because of its importance to the East India Company, the French plundered and destroyed the village of [[Chepauk]] and Blacktown, the locality across from the port where all the dockyard labourers used to live.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chennaicorporation.com/madras_history.htm Chennai Corporation - Madras History&lt;/ref&gt;

The British regained control in 1749 through the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. They then strengthened and expanded Fort St George over the next thirty years to bear subsequent attacks, the [[Siege of Madras|strongest of which]] came from the French (1759, under [[Thomas Arthur, Comte de Lally]]), and later [[Hyder Ali]], the [[Sultan]] of [[Mysore]] in 1767 during the [[First Anglo-Mysore War]]. Following the [[Treaty of Madras]] which brought that war to an end, the external threats to Madras significantly decreased. The 1783 version of Fort St George is what still stands today.

In the latter half of the 18th century, Madras became an important British naval base, and the administrative centre of the growing British dominions in southern India. The British fought with various [[Europe]]an powers, notably the French at [[Vandavasi]] (Wandiwash) in 1760, where de Lally was defeated by [[Eyre Coote (East India Company officer)|Sir Eyre Coote]], and the [[Denmark|Danish]] at [[Tharangambadi]] ([[Tranquebar]]). Following [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|the British victory in the Seven Years' War]] they eventually dominated, driving the French, the Dutch and the Danes away entirely, and reducing the French dominions in India to four tiny coastal enclaves. The British also fought four [[war]]s with the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] under Hyder Ali and later his son [[Tipu Sultan]], which led to their eventual domination of India's south. Madras was the capital of the [[Madras Presidency]], also called Madras Province.

By the end of 1783, the great 18th century wars which saw the British and French battle from Europe to North America and from the Mediterranean to India, resulted in the British being in complete control of the city's regional and most of South India area. Although the British had lost most of their well-populated, industrious, and wealthy North American colonies, after a decade's feud with the French, they were securely in control of Madras and most of the Indian trade. Consequently, they expanded the Chartered control of the company by encompassing the neighbouring villages of [[Triplicane]], [[Egmore]], Purasawalkam and Chetput to form the city of ''Chennapatnam'', as it was called by locals then. This new area saw a proliferation of English merchant and planter families who, allied with their wealthy Indian counterparts, jointly controlled Chennapatnam under the supervision of White Town. Over time and administrative reforms, the area was finally fully incorporated into the new metropolitan charter of Madras.

The development of a harbour in Madras led the city to become an important centre for trade between India and Europe in the 18th century. In 1788, [[Thomas Parry (Chennai merchant)|Thomas Parry]] arrived in Madras as a free merchant and he set up one of the oldest mercantile companies in the city and one of the oldest in the country ([[EID Parry]]). [[John Binny]] came to Madras in 1797 and he established the textile company [[Binny &amp; Co]] in 1814. [[Spencer Plaza|Spencer's]] started as a small business in 1864 and went on to become the biggest department stores in Asia at the time. The original building which housed Spencer &amp; Co. was burnt down in a fire in 1983 and the present structure houses one of the largest shopping malls in India, [[Spencer Plaza]]. Other prominent companies in the city included [[Gordon Woodroffe]], [[Best &amp; Crompton]], [[Higginbotham's]], [[Hoe &amp; Co]] and [[P. Orr &amp; Sons]].

Millions of people starved to death throughout British ruled Tamil Nadu, around 3.9 million people perished in Chennai alone within two years of 1877-78.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=wQfnAsqs5jMC&amp;pg=PT21&amp;dq=chennai+famine&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtwq2UhIfbAhVGqo8KHRIzBVQQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=chennai%20famine&amp;f=false| title=India | author=Michael Allaby | page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madras was the capital of the Madras Presidency and thus became home to important commercial organisations. Breaking with the tradition of the closed and almost wholly British controlled system of the English East India Company, The [[Madras Chamber of Commerce]] was founded in 1836 by Fredrick Adam, Governor of the Madras Presidency (the second oldest Chamber of Commerce in the country). Thereafter in a nod to the declining fortunes of the British textile owners and skilled workers who were still extant in the city, the [[Madras Trades Association]] was established in 1856, by which the old colonial families still involved in the skilled and textile trades were granted entry into the British and Indian financial trade system. In turn, the [[Madras Stock Exchange]] was established in 1920.
In 1906, the city experienced a financial crisis with the failure of its leading merchant bank, [[Arbuthnot &amp; Co]]. The crisis also imperiled [[EID Parry|Parry &amp; Co]] and [[Binny &amp; Co]], but both found rescuers. The lawyer [[V. Krishnaswamy Iyer]] made a name for himself representing claimants, mostly wealthy Hindus and Muslims who had lent money on the failed bank. The next year, flush with funds won from the original British owners who had capitalized the bank, he organized a group of [[Chettiar]] merchants to found [[Indian Bank]], with which he funded new Indian enterprises and broke into the previously closed ranks of the British financial system. The bank still has its corporate headquarters in the city.

During [[World War I]], Madras (Chennai) was [[Bombardment of Madras|shelled]] by the German [[light cruiser]] [[SMS Emden (1908)|SMS ''Emden'']], resulting in 5 civilian deaths and 26 wounded. The crew of a merchant ship also destroyed by the Germans that night.

==Post-British Raj==
After India became independent in 1947, the city became the administrative and legislative capital of [[Madras State]] which was [[List of renamed things in Tamil Nadu|renamed]] as Tamil Nadu in 1968.

During the reorganisation of states in India on linguistic lines, in 1953, Telugu speakers wanted Madras as the capital of Andhra Pradesh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Narayana Rao|first=K. V. |title=The emergence of Andhra Pradesh|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=1973|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=II0BAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coined the slogan "[[Madras Manade]]" (Madras is ours). The demands for the immediate creation of a Telugu-speaking state were met with after [[Tirumala - Tirupati|Tirupati]] was included in [[Andhra State]] and after the leaders who led the movement were convinced to give up their claim on [[Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVRuAAAAMAAJ|title=Chennai not Madras: perspectives on the city|last=A.

In fact, as the greater concentration of capital wrecked what remained of old East Indian middle class, the city principally became a large housing development for huge numbers of workers. Most of these were recruited as cheap labor from the relatively poor Telugu nationality, which in turn enraged the Tamil nationals who were originally the working and middle class settlers of Madras in the late 18th century. Earlier, [[Panagal Raja]], Chief Minister of Madras Presidency in the early 1920s had suggested that the [[Cooum River]] be the boundary between the Tamil and Telugu administrative areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=G. V.|first=Subba Rao|others=Andhra Pradesh. Committee of History of Andhra Movement|title=History of Andhra movement|publisher=Committee of History of Andhra Movement|year=1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOwdAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=2009-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the political and administrative dominance of Tamils, both at the Union and State levels ensured that Madras was not transferred to the new state of [[Andhra State|Andhra]].

Although the original inhabitants of Madras and responsible for its growth into the modern metropolis of today, the British and European nationals are virtually non-existent. Always a tiny minority in comparison with the vast Indian population of the hinterlands, despite slow growth in natural birthrate and continued settlement, the British and European populations were made an ever-decreasing share of their city's populations. As more and more Indians arrived from the countryside to work in the city, the British and other Europeans found it increasingly difficult to establish or maintain independent wealth as they had during the early East Indian regime. This only furthered to mitigate continued British settlement. Nonetheless, as any purview of the city's and other major metropolitan cemeteries of India can attest, hundreds of thousands came to India between the 1600s (decade) and 1770s and later another million more came between 1770 and 1870. These settlers and their families spread throughout India or settled in the cities, with Madras being one of their principal entry points. However, by the early 20th century they had become a small minority in their own city. Although they remained in control of the original corporations and businesses of Madras, and were the official representatives of the Imperial government, their communities size relative to the larger Indian population in Madras ensured their eventual demise should democratic control be given to Indian nationalities in place of the older Colonial charters. When this was accomplished with the [[Independence of India]] in 1947, they were quickly brushed aside by the Indian population.

Despite lacking their original numbers and control, the original British community remnants, along with other minorities as well as the long history of British culture, keeps Madras a slightly cosmopolitan city. Population of Telugu's and Tamils were more or less the same in those days, however dynamics of Madras city was changed post independence rapidly. mixed [[Anglo Indian]] descendants of the original English settlers, a smaller but still extant British and European community, as well as migrant [[Malayalee]] communities in the city. As the city is an important administrative and commercial centre, many others such as [[Bengali people|Bengalis]], [[Punjabi people|Punjabis]], [[Gujarati people|Gujaratis]] and [[Marwaris]], as well as people from [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] migrated to the city and have contributed to its cosmopolitan nature. Today, Chennai also has a growing expatriate population especially from the United States, Europe and [[East Asia]] who work in the industries and [[Information Technology|IT]] centres.

Since its establishment as a city in 1639, English was the official language of the city. However, from 1960s, the Central government started gearing up the use of Hindi in business and government. Therefore, from 1965 to 1967, the city saw agitations against this two language (Hindi and local language) policy, and witnessed sporadic rioting. Madras witnessed further political violence due to the [[Sri Lankan Civil War|civil war in Sri Lanka]], with 33 people killed by a bomb planted by the [[Tamil Eelam Army]] at the airport in 1984, and assassination of thirteen members of the [[EPRLF]] and two Indian civilians by the rival [[Tamil Tigers|LTTE]] in 1991. In the same year, former Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] was assassinated in [[Sriperumbudur]], a small town close to Chennai, whilst campaigning in Tamil Nadu, by [[Thenmuli Rajaratnam]] A.K.A. Dhanu. Dhanu is widely believed to have been an LTTE member. In 1996, keeping with the recent nationwide practice of Indianizing city names, the Government of Tamil Nadu, then represented by [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]], renamed the city to Chennai. The [[2004 tsunami]] lashed the shores of Chennai killing many. 

Today, modern Chennai, formerly known as Madras is a large cultural, commercial and industrial centre, and is known for its [[cultural heritage]] and temple architecture. Chennai is the [[automobile]] capital of India, with around forty percent of the automobile industry having a base there and with a major portion of the nation's vehicles being produced there. Chennai is also referred as the [[Detroit]] of [[South Asia]]. It is a major manufacturing centre. Chennai has also become a major centre for outsourced IT and financial services from the Western world. Owing to the city’s rich musical and cultural traditions, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) has included Chennai in its Creative Cities Network &lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/chennai-gets-unesco-recognition-for-music-117110801271_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Name==
Various etymologies have been posited for the name, 'Chennai'. These are a few of the suggested explanations of the origin of the words ''Chennai'' or ''Chennapattanam'':

# A popular explanation is that the name comes from the name of the Telugu chieftain, [[Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu]], Nayaka of Chandragiri and [[Vandavasi]], father of [[Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka|Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu]], from whom the English acquired the town in 1639. The first official use of the name ''Chennai'' is said to be in a sale deed, dated 8 August 1639, to [[Francis Day of Madras|Francis Day]] of the [[East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chennai.tn.nic.in/chndistprof.htm#hist | title=District Profile&amp;nbsp;– Chennai |publisher=District Administration, Chennai |accessdate=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Another suggestion is that the city was named after the [[Chennakesava Perumal Temple, Chennai|Chenna Kesava Perumal Temple]]; the word ''chenni'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means ''face'', with the temple regarded as the face of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thehindujobs.com/thehindu/mp/2002/02/28/stories/2002022800030400.htm | title=Face behind the name |work=[[The Hindu]]|date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=28 December 2012|last=T. A.|first=Srinivasan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While historian [[J B Prashant More]] also supports the 'Chenna Kesava' theory, he contends that 'Chenna' is a [[Telugu language|Telugu]] word meaning "fair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Chennai's earlier name of Madras is similarly mired in controversy. But there is some consensus that it is an abbreviation of ''Madraspatnam'', the site chosen by the British East India Company for a permanent settlement in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
|url= http://www.chennaicorporation.gov.in/about-chennai-corporation/orginandGrowth.htm |title=Origin of the Name Madras |work=Corporation of Madras }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the nomenclature of the area is in a state of controversy. The region was often called by different names as ''madrapupatnam'', ''madras kuppam'', ''madraspatnam'', and ''madirazpatnam'' as adopted by locals. Another small town, ''Chennapatnam'', lay to the south of it. This place was supposedly named so by [[Damarla Venkatadri Nayaka|Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu]], Nayak of Vandavasi  in remembrance of his father [[Damarla Chennapa Nayakadu|Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu]]. He was the local governor for the last Raja of Chandragiri, Sri Ranga Raya VI of Vijayanagar Empire. The first Grant of Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu makes mention of the village of Madraspatnam as incorporated into East India lands but not of Chennapatnam. This together with the written records makes it clear that the Fort which became the centre of present Chennai, was built upon or nearby the village of Madraspatnam. Although, Madraspatnam is named in later records following the establishment of Fort St. George, this is likely because of the discriminatory nature of the local caste system. Under Hindu caste code, as well as English Common Law, it is unlikely that Fort St. George was built upon the village of Madraspatnam and its inhabitants incorporated into the new town. Instead, it is likely that Fort was built either close to the village or if it was built upon the village, the village was relocated. In fact, in all records of the times, a difference is made between the original village of Madraspatnam and the new town growing around the Fort known as "White Town". Therefore, because of the fort's proximity or origin to the village of Mandraspatnam, and the fort's centrality to the development of the city, the British settlers of the city later named their settlement Madras in honour of it. Further militating against the name "Chennai", Chennapatnam was the name in later years of an area explicitly detailed as having been incorporated of native villages, European plantations, and European merchant houses outside of the combined city of Madras consisting of Fort St. George, and White and Black Town. Lastly, while the Fort St. George, White Town, and Black Town areas were fully incorporated together by the late 18th century, and was known as Madras, Chennapatnam was its own separate entity existing under the authority of Fort St. George well into the 19th century. Consequently, once the area separating Chennapatnam and Old Madras was built over uniting the two settlements, as founders, settlers, and authorities of area, the English named the new united city Madras. Thus it is improbable that the area was ever called Chennai. Instead, being the gateway of trade and the centre of the economy of the region, the English settlement and their fort of 1639-40, which was the basis for the presently named city of Chennai, was likely called Madras as well by the rest of India. The DMK renamed Madras to Chennai as DMK founder Anna renamed Madras State as Tamil Nadu.

He is now recognized as a pivotal figure in the development of post-war [[occult-fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Michael Greer|first1=John|title=The Element Encyclopedia of Secret Societies|date=2006|publisher=Harper element|location=London|isbn=978-0-00-793145-3|pages=312–313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jelgava''' ({{IPA-lv|jælɡava|pron|Lv-Jelgava.ogg}}; {{lang-de|Mitau}}; see also [[#Name|other names]]) is a city in central [[Latvia]] about {{convert|41|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of [[Riga]] with about 63,000 inhabitants. It is the largest town in the region of [[Zemgale]] (Semigalia). Jelgava was the capital of the united [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] (1578-1795) and the administrative center of the [[Courland Governorate]] (1795-1918).

Jelgava is situated on a fertile plain rising only {{convert|3.5|m|1|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level]] on the right bank of the river [[Lielupe]].  At high water the plain and sometimes the town as well can be flooded. It is a [[Jelgava Station|railway center]] and is also host to [[Jelgava Air Base]].  Its importance as a railway centre can be seen by the fact that it lies at the junction of over 6 railway lines connecting Riga to Lithuania, eastern and western Latvia, and Lithuania to the Baltic sea.

== Name ==

Until 1917, the city was officially referred to as '''Mitau'''. The name Jelgava is believed to be derived from the [[Livonian language|Livonian]] word ''jālgab'', meaning "town on the river."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Am-_PBCqIUcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=jelgava+name+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zADJmjHbXf&amp;sig=_HU-KyzeHqocFoLC00ZTCgjraw0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ufnLSfisDZmGsAafm5meCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result|title=Latvia as an Independent State|first=Alfred|last=Bilmanis|date=1 November 2008|publisher=Read Books|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the German name ''Mitau'' is unclear, although it is suggested that it came from the [[Latvian language|Latvian]] words ''mīt'' or ''mainīt'', meaning "to exchange" or "to trade," thus making it "the place where trading takes place."  An alternate explanation is that ''Mitau'' came from ''Mitte in der Aue'', German for "the middle of the Aa", referring to the Lielupe River, formerly known as the Courland Aa (''Kurländische Aa'' in German). {{Citation needed|reason=This whole section does not cite any references or sources.|date=October 2008}}

== Sights ==

Jelgava before the Second World War had regular, broad streets lined with the mansions of the [[Baltic German]] nobility who resided at the former capital of Courland.  The old castle (1266) of the dukes of Courland, situated on an island in the river, was destroyed by [[Ernst Johann von Biron|Duke Biren]], who had [[Jelgava Palace|a spacious palace]] erected (1738–1772) by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] at the bridge across the Lielupe. The palace contains the [[sarcophagi]] of almost all of the Curonian dukes, except the last one. The future [[Louis XVIII]] sojourned in the palace between 1798 and 1800. It now functions as [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]]. Other landmarks include the [[baroque architecture|Baroque]] church of [[St. Anne]], the tower of the destroyed Trinity church, and two handsome structures: the Villa Medem and the [[Academia Petrina]].

== History ==

The [[Livonian people|Livonian]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} settlement Jelgava began developing between the rivers Lielupe and Driksa during the 10th century. Led by the Grand Master [[Konrad von Mander]], the crusading [[Livonian Order]] constructed the [[castle]] in Mitau on a natural island fortification (''Pilssala'') in 1265–1266. Using Mitau as a southern fortress, the German knights subdued the surrounding Livonians and Semigallians by 1290. The town rose in importance as a defensive fixture against the [[Lithuania]]ns to the south, who succeeded in plundering Jelgava in 1345.

As a result of the fall of the Livonian Order in the [[Livonian War]], Mitau became a town of the [[Duchy of Courland]] in 1561. Jelgava received city rights in 1573, and became the capital of the united duchies of Courland and Semigallia in 1578. When the Duchy of Courland split in 1596, Jelgava became the residence of Duke [[Friedrich Kettler]] of Semigallia. The city again became the capital of the united duchies in 1617. Because the duchy became a [[vassal]] of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Jelgava was also referred to by the Polish name ''Mitawa''. The Commonwealth's repeated wars with [[Sweden]] subjected Jelgava to several sieges. Despite the wars, the city grew as a center for trade and industry. As Courland's neighbors increased in strength, however, the duchy and Jelgava began to fall under Russia's [[sphere of influence]]; [[Carl Christian Joseph of Saxony, Duke of Courland]] had to abdicate under Russian siege in 1763. The duchess from 1711 to 1730 was Anna Ivanovna, later Empress [[Anna I of Russia]].

The penultimate duke of Courland, [[Ernst Johann von Biron]], expanded the cultural aspects of Jelgava. He constructed the ducal palace and opened the first public library in the city. In 1775 the last Duke of Courland, [[Peter von Biron]], founded the [[Academia Petrina]], which became a cultural center for the country. The duke also encouraged theatrical performances at his court.
[[File:Academia petrina.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Academia Petrina]]]]

With the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, the citizens of Jelgava clamored for more rights. However, [[Imperial Russia]] [[annexation|annexed]] the city with Courland in 1795 during the [[Partitions of Poland]]. As the seat of the [[Count of Provence]], the palace of Jelgava was the residence (1798–1801 and 1804–1807) of [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] before he became the French king. Although the city was occupied by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] troops during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it was largely spared destruction.

Jelgava further expanded after the [[Riga–Jelgava Railway|construction of its railway in 1868]]. The development of its infrastructure encouraged rural Latvians to migrate to the city, as merchants, craftsmen, teachers, and officials. By 1914 Jelgava had over 45,000 inhabitants. However, Jelgava suffered considerably after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. The spirited defence of Jelgava by two battalions of the Latvian Home Guard in 1915, helped inspire the formation of the [[Latvian Rifles]].  [[German Empire|German]] troops occupied the city during the war, and British prisoners of war, sent there as forced labour, suffered atrocious conditions and treatment.&lt;ref&gt; Meeting the Enemy by Richard Van Emden &lt;/ref&gt; After the war, in 1919, Jelgava became a battleground between [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guards]], German [[Freikorps|paramilitaries]], and Latvian freedom fighters. After the [[Liberation of Jelgava (1919)|latter's victory in November of 1919]], Jelgava became an important city in [[history of Latvia#Independence|independent Latvia]]. In 1925 a [[sugar factory]] was built in Jelgava, the first such factory in Latvia. In 1939 [[Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies]] was opened in [[Jelgava Palace]].

As a result of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]], Jelgava was occupied and annexed with the rest of Latvia by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1940 during [[World War II]]. Much of the city's remaining German population were resettled into the territory of German occupied Poland during the [[Nazi–Soviet population transfers]]. German forces from [[Army Group North]] occupied Jelgava from 1941 to 1944 until the capture of the city by the [[Red Army]]. During the war, German police along with Latvian auxiliary police murdered the Jewish inhabitants of the city during a series of mass shootings (see [[Jelgava massacres]]). The main synagogue was burned to the ground. 

At the late July 1944 Soviet [[Red army]] launched attack from the south in the direction of Jelgava and [[Tukums]] to encircle the German [[Army Group North|Army Group ''North']]'. Jelgava was declared fortress (''Festung'') however there were only scatterd German and Latvian units in the city. From 30 July until August 7 after heavy street fighting and several [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] Red Army managed to occupy the left bank of the Lielupe river. In late August German army launched a counterattack to Jelgava from the north but it failed to drive back Soviets. Jelgava remained in the frontline until October 10 when German army retreated to [[Courland]]. 
The city's historic center, industry, rail network, and public buildings were heavily damaged by the fighting, with almost 90% of the city destroyed.
[[File:19440816 soviet soldiers attack jelgava.jpg|200px|thumb|Soviet soldiers fight in the streets of Jelgava (summer 1944).]]

Jelgava was rebuilt in typical Soviet style after [[World War II]] as part of the [[Latvian SSR]]. Jelgava became home to several big factories. Among them were the sugar factory, which was heavily expanded from 1975 [[assembly line]], and administration buildings for [[Riga Autobus Factory]] (RAF). 
Following Latvian independence, Jelgava is slowly regaining its original Germanic heritage and is now a popular tourist site. Owing to Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies, many of Jelgava's inhabitants are students or people connected with education. For this reason Jelgava is sometimes called the ''Student capital of Latvia''.

== Demographics ==
As of 1 January 2017, the city had a population of 61,308.

The club was founded by members of the [[Victoria League]] to strengthen the league's work in providing hospitality to its British and visiting colonial members and the wives and parties of visiting colonial politicians.&lt;ref name="Bush"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia Bush.|title=Edwardian Ladies and Imperial Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rR9CozeiIs4C&amp;pg=PA136|year=2000|publisher=Leicester University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-7185-0061-0|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was opened in 1902 by the colonial secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] and by 1906 had 700 members from the United Kingdom and 350 from British colonies.&lt;ref name="Dough"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Doughan &amp; Peter Gordon.|title=Dictionary of British Women's Organisations 1825-1960|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T423AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon|isbn=978-1-136-89770-2|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was independent but the Victoria League retained the right to nominate one third of the club's central committee.&lt;ref name="Bush"/&gt;

==Activities and membership==
To be eligible for membership, two references were required, one to propose and apply to the secretary with an introductory note, the other to second the proposal. A joining fee and annual subscription would be required upon receipt of  election&lt;ref name="Bernard2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bernard|first=Lally|editor=Nancy M.

Retrieved 22 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club provided spacious and hospitable facilities for reading and playing cards. It had smoking rooms and the bedrooms were "comfortable and attractive". It was particularly popular with Canadian women who came to support women’s rights.&lt;ref name="Morgan2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Cecilia|title='A Happy Holiday': English Canadians and Transatlantic Tourism, 1870-1930|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZwruAeqZRoC&amp;pg=PT341|year=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-8020-9758-3|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1957, an announcement appeared in ''The Times'' that the club would be accommodated at the [[Ladies Carlton Club]] from 1 January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;"Club Announcements", ''The Times'', 13 December 1957, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In [[law]], the '''legislative intent''' of the [[legislature]] in enacting [[legislation]] may sometimes be considered by the [[judiciary]] when interpreting the law (see [[judicial interpretation]]). The judiciary may attempt to assess legislative intent where legislation is ambiguous, or does not appear to directly or adequately address a particular issue, or when there appears to have been a [[legislative drafting error]].

The courts have repeatedly held that when a statute is clear and unambiguous, the inquiry into legislative intent ends at that point. It is only when a statute could be interpreted in more than one fashion that legislative intent must be inferred from sources other than the actual text of the statute.

==Sources==
Courts frequently look to the following sources in attempting to determine the goals and purposes that the legislative body had in mind when it passed the law:

* the text of the bill as proposed to the legislative body
* amendments to the bill that were proposed and accepted or rejected,
* the record of hearings on the topic
* legislative records or journals
* speeches and floor debate made prior to the vote on the bill
* legislative subcommittee minutes, factual findings and reports
* other relevant statutes that can be used to understand the definitions in the statute on question
* other relevant statutes which indicate the limits of the statute in question
* legislative files of the executive branch, such as the governor or president
* [[case law]] prior to the statute or following it which demonstrates the problems the legislature was attempting to address with the bill
* constitutional determinations (Would Congress still have passed certain sections of a statute had it known about the constitutional invalidity of the other portions of the statute?)
*legislative intent, which is the reason for passing the law

==Application==
Courts in the [[United States]] and elsewhere have developed a number of principles for handling such evidence of legislative intent; as an example, many courts have suggested that the comments of those opposing a bill under consideration should be treated with skepticism, on the principle that opponents of a bill may often exaggerate its practical consequences. 

One early example of an important Supreme Court case which relied on legislative intent was ''[[Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co.]]'' (1904) 196 U.S. 1, where the court decided that a man may sue the railroad for failing to have an automatic coupler since the legislature was attempting to remedy the problem of multiple injuries by railroad coupling.

Others, most notably [[United States Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], have objected generally to the use of such evidence, rather than reliance on the literal language of the statute, arguing that such evidence of "legislative intent" is often created by proponents of a bill to persuade a court to interpret the statute in a way that they were not able to persuade the legislative body to adopt when passing the bill.

These principles of legislative intent often overlap with those principles of [[statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] that courts have developed to interpret ambiguous or incomplete legislation. As an example, the principle that courts should not interpret a statute to produce absurd or unintended results will often be informed by evidence of what the proponents of a bill stated about the objectives to be achieved by the statute.

Administratively, Mekelle is considered a Special Zone, which is divided into seven sub-cities. Mekelle is the economic, cultural, and political hub of northern Ethiopia.

Mekelle has grown rapidly since 1991. In 1984 it had 61,583 inhabitants, in 1994, 96,938 (96.5% being Tigrinya-speakers), and in 2006 169,200 (i.e. 4% of the population of Tigray). Mekelle is 2.6 times larger than [[Adigrat]], the second largest regional center, It is the fifth largest city in Ethiopia, after [[Addis Ababa]], [[Dire Dawa]], [[Adama]], and [[Gondar]]. The largest proportion of the population of Mekelle depends on government employment, commerce and small-scale enterprises. Mekelle now has new engineering, cement and textile factories, producing for the local and foreign market. There is a rising university which developed out of the pre-1991 Arid Agricultural College, and about a dozen other governmental and private colleges.The city sometimes called by writers "the northen star",and recently in social media people have started to call the city "the home of spartas" to show the resistance of tigryan for 3000 years against enemy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
Mekelle is believed to have evolved from a 13th century hamlet called Enda Meseqel (later Enda Medhane Alem), becoming a town by the early 19th century, when ''ras'' Wolde Selassie of [[Enderta Province|Enderta]] made [[Antalo]] his seat of power, and the region of Mekelle ({{Convert|40|km|mi}} to the north) his recreational center).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Salt, Trade and Urbanization: the Story of Mäqälä Town, 1872-1935|last=Taddesse|first=Madhane|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1995|isbn=|location=Addis Ababa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=የመቀሌ ከመሰራረትና እድገት|last=Sakkwar|first=Taddese|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=|trans-title=Foundation and Growth of Mäqälä Town}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tax records of ''atse'' [[Tewodros II]], Mekelle appears as a tributary district within Enderta with a ''negarit'' of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tax Records of and Inventories of Emperor Tewodros of Ethiopia, 1855-1868|last=Asfaw|first=Girmaselassie|last2=Pankhurst|first2=Richard|publisher=University of London|year=1979|isbn=0728600579|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:Mekele_1896.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mekele_1896.jpg|thumb|''Atse'' [[Yohannes IV]]'s grand castle.]]
The credit for Mekelle's growth into a regional capital goes to ''atse'' [[Yohannes IV]] who made Mekelle political capital of his expanding state. He must have chose the place for its strategic proximity both to rich agricultural areas (of [[Raya Azebo]]) and to the [[Afar Region|Afar]] salt country. Mekelle's position on the route to [[Shewa]], the power base of Yohannes's main rival [[Menelik II|Menelik]] could have been another factor. Three institutions still important for modern Mekelle were founded by Yohannes:
* The grand palace built in 1882-84 by his architect [[Giacomo Naretti]], together with the engineer Engedashet Schimper and still forms the nucleus of Mekelle.
* The large market Edaga Senuy ("Monday Market")
* The church, at Debre Gennet Medhane Alem, built after the return from Raya Azebo campaign in 1871.
In the 1880s, Mekelle became the Emperor's capital city. Among the factor that further accelerated Mekele's growth and urbanization were the establishment of residential quarters by the "nobility" and court servants, the prominence of the ''amole'' salt market and the subsequent establishment of local and foreign trading and occupational communities, and Mekelle'a strategic position as a transit center for commodities of the long-distance trade routes of north eastern Ethiopia, attached to the Red Sea ports, and to northern and central Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gebrelibanos|first=Tsegay|date=2009|title=The Ethiopian Salt Trading System in the 20th Century: A View from Mäqäla, Northern Ethiopia|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 16th International Conference of Ethiopian Studies|volume=|pages=185-201|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By establishing a market in Mekelle, Yohannes could draw on the norther trade routes as well as the salt caravan routes to the town, capitalizing on his political leverage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The succession of ''atse'' [[Menelik II]] of Shewa signaled a trading reorientation from northern to southern Ethiopia (centered in Shewa). The new capital Addis Ababa quickly outstripped Mekelle, which, however, retained its political importance as the district and regional administration center of Enderta and [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] respectively through the 20th century, and its economical role in the Ethiopian salt trade.

During the Italian War of 1895-96, Mekelle became an important site in the conflict. After the fall of [[Adwa]] in spring 1895, ''ras'' [[Ras Mengesha Yohannes|Mengasha Yohannes]] retreated from his father's capital Mekelle following the advice of ''atse'' Menelik II. Mekelle was occupied by the Italians without a shot and integrated into the ''Colonia Eritrea''; from here the Italians extended their occupation south, up to Ambalage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gl'Italiani in Africa: l'assedio di Macallè|last=Montegazza|first=Vico|publisher=Successori Le Monnier|year=1896|isbn=|location=Firenze|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian army established their fort near the Enda Eyesus church above Mekelle in October 1895. After the re-occupation of Ambalage in late 1895, the fort was besieged by Ethiopian troops, who cut the Italians' water supply. When the Italians surrendered in January 1896, Menelik allowed them to retreat to their stronghold [[Adigrat]], probably hoping to prevent an escalation of the conflict, and he appointed his own governor over Enderta at Mekelle, ''dejazmach'' Tedla Abaguben, in order to check the rebellious Tigrayan princes.

=== 20th century ===
Three historical epochs sustained Mekelle's urbanization in the 20th century. The first was the advent of ''dejazmach'' Abreha Araya Demsu, governor of Eastern Tigray with Mekelle as his capital. Abreha imitated his cousin Yohannes by establishing his own splendid palace (now the Hotel called Abreha Castle) on a hill facing the grand palace, a new Saturday Market (Edaga Senbet), and a new church, Selassie, all of which were situated to the south of Mekelle proper. Likewise, he attracted various occupational groups including Muslim traders, women service vendors, and army retainers. Consequently, in the 1920s and early 1930s, Mekelle witnessed a remarkable growth in trade. ''Dejazmach'' [[Haile Selassie Gugsa]] renovated the Palace in the center to use it as his seat. There were about 5,000 inhabitants in 1935.

The second phase occurred during the Italian occupation (1936-41). The Italians, who occupied the town in November 1935, contributed considerable to the modernization of Mekelle. They built a military airport and a fort at Enda Eyesus (now the main compound of [[Mekelle University]]); reorganized roads, telephone lines, offices and residences; and installed modern water pipelines, electricity, clinics, postal services, cinema hall and resort/sport centers. They also expanded Edaga Senbet by introducing corrugated iron shops. This also attracted foreign entrepreneurs (Greeks, Arabs and Armenians). Mekelle, then divided into two zones; Italian and Native, grew about twice its former size. In 1938 there were about 12,000 inhabitants. Starting from May 1943, Mekelle was in the hands of the leaders of the [[Woyane rebellion|Woyane uprising]] against the then weak restored Haile Selassie government. the following British air bombardment of the town of September-October heavily damaged the; on October 1943 Mekelle was recaptured by the Ethiopian government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Dying Lion: Feudalism and Modernization in Ethiopia|last=Gilkes|first=Patrick|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1975|isbn=|location=London|pages=180, 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third phase in Mekelle's urban development took place mainly during 1942-74. Modern urban sectors were diversified, and new administrative offices were established. The Mekelle municipality (founded 1942), telecommunications and post office, Commercial Bank and the ''atse'' Yohannes Elementary (in 1952) and Secondary School (in 1960) were established. The master plan was issued in 1962. Small-scale enterprises such as oil refineries, soap mills, leather and caning bags, costumes and flour mills were established until 1974. Most of the industrial establishments, however, have declined, degraded or closed during the 1974-91 wars.

During the [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia]], Mekelle was notorious for the seven "hunger camps" around the city. These housed 75,000 refugees with 20,000 more waiting to enter. During March 1985, 50 to 60 people died in these seven camps every day. In February 1986, the TPLF released 1,800 political prisoners from the Mekelle prison in a daring military action. The operation was named ''Agazi,'' after one of the founding fighters of the TPLF, who had been killed in the second year of the [[Ethiopian Civil War]].

In a series of offensives launched on 25 February 1988, TPLF fighters bypassed Mekelle but took control of [[Maychew]], [[Korem]] and other places along the Dessie-Mekelle road. By June 1988, TPLF controlled all of Tigray except the city of Mekelle and the territory a radius of {{Convert|15|km|mi}} around the city. In response, the Derg had a number of villages around Mekelle burned on June 4 and 5, which included Addi Gera, Bahri, Goba Zena, Grarot, Issala, and Rabea. It was not until 25 February 1989 that Mekelle was also occupied by the TPLF, after the government position in Tigray had collapsed.

On 5 June 1998 the [[Eritrea|Eritrean]] Air Force bombed Ayder School in Mekelle during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] killing twelve. A monument pays respects to this tragedy.

=== 21st century ===
On 29 December 2002, a riot broke out between [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] worshippers, over an Adventist prayer service being conducted in a stadium. Some Ethiopian Orthodox believers, upset by the display of public Adventist preaching, reportedly sparked the clashes by first throwing stones at Adventists gathered in the stadium, then by looting Adventist offices in the city. [[Law enforcement in Ethiopia|Police]] intervened to break up the riots, which resulted in five dead and three seriously injured. The police reported that 10 people were detained, but independent sources reported that the number was much larger.

The [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea]] (UNMEE) headquarters was established in Mekelle in 2000 following the end of the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] and continued until 30 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unmee.unmissions.org/|title=UN Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea is withdrawn|last=|first=|date=30 July 2008|website=UNMEE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV of Ethiopia|Yohannes IV]] in the [[19th century]] became [[Negus]] and built a castle and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches in the city.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The castle was constructed by Ethiopian engineer ''Lij'' Ingidashet and Italian engineer [[Giacomo Naretti]].&lt;ref name=NAI-web&gt;[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/m/ORTMEK.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 6 January 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Treccani|giacomo-naretti|Narétti, James|Carlo Zaghi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle complex now serves as a museum, where the Emperor’s throne, royal bed, ceremonial dress, rifles, and many other valuable historical collections, can be seen.

Other notable landmarks include the churches Enda Gabir, Enda Yesus Mekelle Bete Mengist, Mekelle Iyesus, Mekelle Maryam, Mekelle Selassie, Enda Mariam Bugsa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photographs of the city of Mekelle|url=https://independent-travellers.com/ethiopia/mekelle/|website=Independent Travellers|publisher=independent-travellers.com|accessdate=March 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mekelle Tekle Haymanot.

== Sports ==
[[Mekelle City FC]] and [[Dedebit F.C.|Dedebit F.C ]] are the local [[football]] teams from the city; both have been competing in the Ethiopian Premier League. A local market has been held every Monday since at least 1890.

==Geography==
Mekelle lies at an elevation of {{Convert|2254|m|ft}} above sea level (at the airport), close to the edge of the northern portion of the Ethiopian Rift Valley, on a Jurassic limestone plateau, in a semi-arid area with a mean annual rainfall of {{Convert|714|mm|in}}. Except for a moderately dense eucalyptus cover on the hills in eastern edges of Mekelle and some exotic species of trees and shrubs lining the streets, the surrounding landscape is almost treeless.

=== Sub-cities ===
Mekelle is divided into seven local administrations: Hawelti, Adi-Haki, Kedamay Weyane, Hadnet, Ayder, Semien and Quiha. Within each local administration there are ''kebeles'' or ''ketenas''.  The subcities of Mekelle comprise the area formerly incorporated as Mekelle City.  While falling under the jurisdiction of Mekele Special Zone Government, each subcity is also a borough with its own administrator, like other cities of Ethiopia. These officials oversee socio-economic development and run health, education, and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Popular Participation in Decentralized Governance|last=Habtu|first=Adonay|publisher=Mekelle University|year=2011|isbn=|location=Mekelle|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The subcities differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the regional government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Mekelle Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city. The "three central subcities" of Mekelle – Kedamay Weyane, Ayder and Hawelti – are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population. Semien is unique occupied by many major factories. It is often called the "economic center" of the Tigray.

Mekelle special zone has been represented in the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]] by Addis Alem Balema since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Democracy and Economic Development in Ethiopia|last=Balema|first=Addis|publisher=Red Sea Press|year=2014|isbn=9781569023907|location=Trenton|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor of Mekelle is Daniel Assefa.

The city council is Mekelle's legislative body and the city is administrated by a mayor (Daniel Assega) and seven local administrators.

=== Climate ===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures year-round and distinct [[Wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s. The [[Köppen Climate Classification|Köppen]] type for this climate is [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') as all months average above {{convert|18|°C|1|disp=or}}; however it borders on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''). In the area to the northeast of Mekelle, a more dry climate, the "warm [[semi-arid climate]]" (''Bsh'') is to be found.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12535">In the [[Romance languages]], '''[[metaphony]]''' was an early vowel mutation process that operated in all Romance languages to varying degrees, raising (or sometimes diphthongizing) certain stressed vowels in words with a final {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} or a directly following {{IPA|/j/}}. This is conceptually
similar  to the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] process so characteristic of the [[Germanic languages]]. Metaphony is most extensive in the [[Italo-Romance languages]], and applies to nearly all [[languages of Italy]]. However, it is absent from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]], and hence from standard [[Italian language|Italian]].

Metaphony in the southern Italian languages (those to the south of Tuscany) is triggered by final {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}. High-mid vowels {{IPA|/e o/}} are raised to {{IPA|/i u/}}, and low-mid vowels {{IPA|/ɛ ɔ/}} are either raised to {{IPA|/e o/}} or diphthongized to {{IPA|/je wo/}}.&lt;ref name="kaze1991"/&gt; Metaphony is not triggered by final {{IPA|/o/}}. The main occurrences of final {{IPA|/i/}} are as follows:
* The plural of nouns in ''-o'' (&lt; nominative plural ''-ī'').
* The plural of nouns in ''-e'' (either a regular development of third-declension plural ''-ēs'', or from analogical plural ''-ī'').
* The second-person singular present tense (a regular development of ''-ēs'' in verbs in ''-ere, -ēre, -īre'' and analogical in verbs in ''-āre''; in [[Old Italian]], the regular ending ''-e'' is still found in ''-are'' verbs).
* The first-person singular past indicative (&lt; ''-ī'').

The main occurrences of final {{IPA|/o/}} are as follows:
* The first-person singular present indicative (&lt; ''-ō'').
* Masculine "mass" nouns, and "neuter" (mass-noun) demonstratives (disputed origin).
The main occurrence of final {{IPA|/u/}} is in masculine "count" nouns (&lt; ''-um'').

Metaphony in the northern Italian languages (those to the north of Tuscany) is triggered only by final {{IPA|/i/}}. In these languages, as in Tuscan, final {{IPA|/u/}} was lowered to {{IPA|/o/}}; it evidently happened prior to the action of metaphony. In these languages, metaphony also tends to apply to final {{IPA|/a/}}, raising it to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} or {{IPA|/e/}}.

In most Italian languages, most final vowels have become [[cheshirisation|obscured]] (in the south) or lost (in the north), and the effects of metaphony are often the only markers of masculine vs. feminine and singular vs. plural.

== Western Romance languages ==

In all of the [[Western Romance]] languages, metaphony was triggered by a final {{IPA|/i/}} (especially of the first-person singular of the [[preterite]]), raising mid-high stressed vowels to high vowels. (It does not normally occur in the nominative plural noun forms in [[Old French]] and [[Old Occitan]] that have a reflex of nominative plural {{IPA|/i/}}, suggesting that these developments were removed early by analogy.) Examples:
* ''vīgintī'' "twenty" &gt; *''vigintī'' &gt; PIR {{IPA|/veˈenti/}} &gt; Italian ''venti''; but &gt; pre-PWR {{IPA|/veˈinti/}} &gt; PWR {{IPA|/veˈinte/}} &gt; [[Old Spanish]] ''veínte'' (&gt; modern ''veinte'' {{IPA|/bejnte/}}), [[Old Portuguese]] ''veínte'' (&gt; ''viínte'' &gt; modern ''vinte''), [[Old French]] ''vint'' (&gt; modern ''vingt'' {{IPA|/vɛ̃/}}).
* ''fēcī, fēcit'' "I did, he did" ([[preterite]]) &gt; Italian ''feci, fece''; but &gt; pre-PWR {{IPA|/ˈfedzi, ˈfedzet/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ˈfidzi, ˈfedzet/}} &gt; PWR {{IPA|/ˈfidze, ˈfedzet/}} &gt; [[Old Spanish]] ''fize, fezo''&lt;ref&gt;''fize, fezo'' &lt; *''fize, feze'' by analogy with the preterite of ''-ar'' verbs, e.g. ''amé, amó'' "I loved, he loved". Portuguese was unaffected by analogy because the corresponding ''-ar'' preterite forms are ''amei, amou''.&lt;/ref&gt;(&gt; ''fize, fizo'' &gt; modern ''hice, hizo''), Portuguese ''fiz, fez'', [[Old French]] ''fis, fist'' (&lt; ''*fis, feist'').

=== Astur-Leonese ===

In some of the [[Astur-Leonese]] dialects, in northern Spain, a distinction between mass and count nouns appeared at an early stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ Álvaro Arias. ''El morfema de ‘neutro de materia’ en asturiano.'' Santiago de Compostela, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, 1999, I Premio «Dámaso Alonso» de Investigación Filológica.]&lt;/ref&gt; Count nouns from Latin masculines preserved the -u (&lt;um) from Latin accusative, while mass nouns from Latin masculines were marked by an (-o), this is traditionally referred to as ″mass-neuter″. In addition, this language marked masculine plurals with {{IPA|/os/}} (&lt; -ōs).&lt;ref name="penny1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title=Continuity and Innovation in Romance: Metaphony and Mass-Noun Reference in Spain and Italy |journal=The Modern Language Review |volume=89 |number=2 |year=1994 |pages=273–281 |jstor=3735232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this situation, only masculine singular count nouns developed metaphony as they were the ones marked with a {{IPA|/-u/}}, while mass nouns and plurals, marked with {{IPA|/-o/}}, did not.&lt;ref name=AAC&gt; [http://personales.uniovi.es/web/ariasal/ Álvaro Arias. «La armonización vocálica en fonología funcional (de lo sintagmático en fonología a propósito de dos casos de metafonía hispánica)», ''Moenia'' 11 (2006): 111–139.]&lt;/ref&gt; This ending system has only been preserved in central Asturian dialects, and unlike metaphony, which is considered dialectal, has also been included in the standard version of the Asturian Language.

|}

However, at later stages, Eastern Astur-Leonese dialects (Eastern Asturias and Cantabria) lost the u/o distinction in noun gender markers. Some of these dialects also lost metaphony and the noun count/mass distinction altogether, only keeping it in their pronoun systems, others, such as Pasiegu from Eastern Cantabria closed all their mid-vowels in word ending syllables, and relied on metaphony as a means for distinguishing mass/count nouns.

|}

Some Astur-Leonese dialects also presented i-triggered metaphony. It is also considered dialectal, and it is most prevalent in imperatives (''durmi'' &lt; PIR dormi, sleep!), preterites (''vini'' &lt; PIE veni, I came)  and demonstratives (''isti'' &lt; esti, this; ''isi'' &lt; esi, that). Sometimes it prevents diphthongation (''durmi'' vs duermi, sleep!; ''curri'' vs cuerri, run!) by closing the mid vowel in the verbal stem.

=== Portuguese ===
Raising of {{IPA|/ɔ/}} to {{IPA|/o/}} by a following final {{IPA|/u/}} occurs sporadically in Portuguese.&lt;ref name="penny1994"/&gt; Example: ''porcum, porcōs'' "pig, pigs" &gt; PIR {{IPA|ˈpɔrku, ˈpɔrkos}} &gt; Portuguese ''porco'' {{IPA|ˈporku}} vs. ''porcos'' {{IPA|ˈpɔrkus}}; ''novum, novōs, novam, novās'' "new (masc., masc. pl., fem., fem. pl.)" &gt; PIR {{IPA|ˈnɔvu, ˈnɔvos, ˈnɔva, ˈnɔvas}} &gt; Portuguese ''novo'' {{IPA|ˈnovu}} vs. ''novos, nova, novas'' {{IPA|ˈnɔvus, ˈnɔva, ˈnɔvas}}. In this case, [[Old Portuguese]] apparently had {{IPA|/u/}} in the singular vs. /os/ in the plural, despite the spelling ⟨-o -os⟩; a later development has raised plural {{IPA|/os/}} to {{IPA|/us/}}. Unlike elsewhere, this development is only sporadic and only affects {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, not {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. Furthermore, the mass/count distinction is expressed very differently: Only a few "mass neuter" demonstratives exist, and they have a ''higher'' rather than lower vowel (''tudo'' "everything" vs. ''todo'' "all (masc.)", ''isto'' "this (neut.)" vs. ''este'' "this (masc.)"). In addition, the original pattern has been extended to some nouns originally in {{IPA|/o/}}, e.g. ''todo'' {{IPA|/o/}} "all" vs. plural ''todos'' {{IPA|/ɔ/}} &lt; ''tōtum, tōtōs''.

== Romanian ==
[[Romanian language|Romanian]] shows metaphony of the opposite sort, where final {{IPA|/a/}} (and also {{IPA|/e/}}, especially in the case of {{IPA|/o/}}) caused a diphthongization {{IPA|/e/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ea/}}, {{IPA|/je/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ja/}}, {{IPA|/o/}} &gt; {{IPA|/oa/}}:&lt;ref name="penny1994"/&gt; ''cēram'' "wax" &gt; ''ceară''; ''equam'' "mare" &gt; {{IPA|/*ɛpa/}} &gt; {{IPA|/*jepa/}} &gt; ''iapă''; ''flōrem'' "flower" &gt; ''floare''; ''nostrum, nostrī, nostram, nostrās'' "our (masc. sg., masc. pl., fem. sg., fem. pl.)" &gt; {{IPA|/*nostru, nostri, nostra, nostre/}} &gt; ''nostru, noştri, noastră, noastre''.

== Sardinian ==

The [[Sardinian language]] likewise has a distinction between final {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} (again with plural {{IPA|/os/}}), along with metaphony. In the conservative [[Logudorese]] and [[Sardinian language|Nuorese]] dialects, the result of metaphony is a non-phonemic alternation between {{IPA|[e o]}} (when final {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} occurs) and {{IPA|[ɛ ɔ]}} (with other final vowels). In [[Campidanese]], final {{IPA|/e o/}} have been raised to {{IPA|/i u/}}, with the result that the metaphonic alternations have been phonemicized.

'''Naarath''' is a place named in [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]] 16:7 as one of the landmarks on the southern boundary of the [[Tribe of Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]]. It appears to have been situated between [[Ataroth]] and [[Jericho]]. During the 4th-century, [[Eusebius]] and [[Jerome]] speak of "Naorath", as a "small village of Jews fives miles from Jericho."&lt;ref&gt;William Smith.[https://books.google.com/books?id=PlcJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA453&amp;dq=jews++jericho&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oWN6TNPlFsP58Ab0yLicBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&amp;q=jews%20%20jericho&amp;f=false A dictionary of the Bible, Volume 2], pg. 453.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universal history ==
{{Main|Universal history}}
[[File:Atelier de Nicolas de Largillière, portrait de Voltaire, détail (musée Carnavalet) -002.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]] was the first in the [[modern period]] who attempted to write a history of the world, without use of religious and nationalistic interpretations of the past.]]
[[Universal history]], the result of a universal, cosmopolitan interpretation of historical events and mankind as a whole, coherent unit, preceded the nationalization of history. In the [[Western world]], this motivation to imagine a universal history became influential in the 18th century when numerous philosophers promoted new cosmopolitan ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Colonial experience (many [[Europe]]an countries had colonies) exposed society in Europe to numerous different cultures and civilizations. It is also very important to take in consideration that the 18th century was in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when people's activities, both on individual and social level, were determined with desire to follow rational scientific judgment while changing the society, which released them from restraints of customs and arbitrary authorities based on [[faith]], [[superstition]], or [[revelation]] and backed up by [[religion]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| quote       = Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality rather than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power of human reason to change society and liberate the individual from the restraints of custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world view increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these circumstances provided suitable surroundings for development of universalistic, liberal and rational global perspectives in studies of society and its past and writing historical texts.

In his ''Essay on customs (1756)'' [[Voltaire]] studied development of civilization in the world with universal perspective, rejecting tradition, Christian and national frames. He was significantly influenced by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]] and his work ''Discourse on the Universal history (1682)'' when he was first who seriously attempted to write a history of the world, without limits imposed by nation or religion, emphasizing economical, cultural and political history. [[Imanuel Kant]] developed ideas about universally applicable moral imperatives in his work ''Perpetual Peace (1795)'' and designed a plan for establishing a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] liberal order which would result in perpetual [[peace]]. Universalism of the 18th century created an ideology which today could be identified as [[Civil society|modern civil society]].

The emerging of modern historiography is connected with German universities in the 19th century and the significant influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]] who insisted on objectivity and systematic use of historical documents in the form of authentic primary sources; his credo was to perform reconstruction of the past "as it was".&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 "Leopold von Ranke founded historical research on the systematic use of documentary evidence, on reconstructing the past `as it was', and on the ideal of objectivity."&lt;/ref&gt; Ranke's universal precepts in virtually all his works were, however, applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nations.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 " These were
universal precepts. In practice, however, they were applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nation states in Europe,.... Virtually all of Ranke's own work,... was devoted to these themes."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of nationalization of history ==
Though nationalization of history could probably be traced from the earliest phases of creating historical works, it was in the period after the [[French revolution]] that creating of historical works started to be strongly influenced by national perspectives, and that perspective gradually became globally dominant with its culmination during the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. Nationalism was estimated as the proper perspective to such an extent that nationalization of history remained unnoticed till recently (1980s and 1990s) and was not studied in historiography in a scale that would correspond to its significance.

Many various reasons, depending on the circumstances, caused nationalization of history. Probably the most important is [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]], the important element of which was nationalized history,&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr; p. 7, "In some countries nationalization of history was part of "invention of tradition", while in others it was an element of so called "national renaissance" or "national awakening" .."&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in the emerging of modern [[nations]] and [[Nation state|nation-states]], mostly during the 19th century.

After the [[First World War]] was finished, in some cases during establishment of new frontiers, the principle of national self-determination was taken in consideration during frontier [[Demarcation line|demarcation]]. Therefore, it was necessary to establish the national historical character of certain territories and settlements, like in case between Germany and Poland and the Versailles treaty when numerous historians prepared short studies in an attempt to support territory demands based on Germany or Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After the [[Second World War]] and the process of [[decolonization]], the process of establishing new countries led to additionally stimulated nationalization of history because "new [[flags]] requested new histories".&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 "This approach was adopted enthusiastically by the new states that came into being following the upheavals brought about by two world wars and decolonization. New flags required new histories."&lt;/ref&gt; Even when citizens of newly-established countries already had their national identity built, the nationalization of history was aimed to create of new national identity based on citizenship.

== Renationalization of history ==
If the first phase of nationalization of history was forcibly suppressed by a national ideology ([[communism]]) or traumatic losing of wars ([[Japan]], [[Germany]], ...) there can be a second phase, [[renationalization of history]], on usually changed basis and perspective of nationalism.

=== Renationalization of history in Ukraine ===
The nationalization of history in [[Ukraine]] had two separate phases:&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7, "Ukraine experienced nationalization of history in two stages. The first began in mid-nineteenth century and reached its heights in the creation of grand narrative, Mykhailo Hrushevsky's „History of Ukraine - Rus“. The tradition of historical writings that emerged at this stage persisted in Ukrainian Marxist historiography until the end of Second World War.... In diasporas historiography it turned it into canon, a true credo. The second stage began in 1980s and still continuing. .... It is taking place under state sponsorship and is integral part of nationalization of the state."&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''First phase'' began in the middle of the 19th century and reached its culmination in [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]'s “History of Ukraine - Rus'”. This phase lasted till the end of the [[Second World War]] when it was stopped because of political changes in the Soviet Union, while in [[diasporas]] Hrushevsky's text had [[cult]] status.
* ''Second phase'' started in the 1980s and still lasts as of 2010, as a consequence of direct state sponsorship becoming an integral part of nationalization of the state. At the beginning, it was not so intensive, but after its turning point on August 24, 1991, it achieved special purposes: to legitimize the newly established [[state (polity)|state]] and its governing elites, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of the [[Ukrainian nation]], and to confirm the appropriateness of its existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 11, "Nationalized history began to fulfil important instrumental functions: legitimize newly established state and its attendant elite, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of Ukrainian nation, and to confirm nations appropriateness of that nations existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours alike."&lt;/ref&gt;

The irst phase chronologically coincided with the process of "rediscovery of tradition" and [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] that captured all of Europe, while the second phase takes place in a period of globalization, vanishing cultural frontiers and aggressive international forms of [[mass culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7,"... unlike the previous stage, that coincided with general European phenomenon of "invention of tradition" and the development of the nations, the present stage is unfolding in the era of globalization, fading the cultural boundaries and large-scale aggression of the international forms of mass culture."&lt;/ref&gt;

The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious [[Public speaking|oratory]] than in [[philosophy]], sometimes grew the idea of an ''esprit des peuples'' or ''national spirit'', and, later still, the idea that each nation had a 'mission'.

He was born in 1557 in the town of [[Osuna]] in [[Andalusia]], [[Spain]]. A graduate in both civil and canon laws at Sevilla, he entered the Society of Jesus at age 23. He was soon appointed to the mission in the Philippines, arriving in the country in 1590 along with [[Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas|Gomez Perez Dasmariñas]], the newly-appointed [[Governor-General of the Philippines|governor-general of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kahimyang.info/kauswagan/articles/1619/today-in-philippine-history-september-16-1635-father-pedro-chirino-died-in-manila|title=Today in Philippine history: September 16, 1635, Father Pedro Chirino died in Manila|accessdate=August 30, 2017|website=The Kahimyang Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was first assigned to [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]] before he was appointed to be the parish priest of the town of [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] in 1591. During his tenure as parish priest, he transferred the location of Taytay parish from its original site near [[Laguna de Bay]] to a hilltop area where it has remained to this day. He also began to immerse himself in the study of the Tagalog language and was able to preach his homily in Tagalog for the first time on August 15, 1591 on the occasion of the establishment of a Jesuit mission in Antipolo.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lakbay-Pananampalataya|last=Fernandez|first=Jose|publisher=St John the Baptist Parish, Taytay, Rizal|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chirino also went to missions in [[Tigbauan, Iloilo|Tigbauan]] from February 1593 to April 1595 and [[Leyte]] in June 1595. It was in Tigbauan where Father Chirino established in 1593 what would become the first Jesuit boarding-school in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

In the course of his missionary work, Father Chirino also recorded the transition of Filipino writing from the [[Baybayin]] script to the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/bayeng1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rpLR9aNS?url=http://www.mts.net/~pmorrow/bayeng1.htm |archivedate=2010-08-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/literacy/literacy.htm|title=Bibingka|website=Bibingka.com|accessdate=30 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407094947/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/literacy/literacy.htm|archivedate=7 April 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he began writing down his knowledge of Philippine history as well as his observations on the way of life of Filipinos in that period. Upon his return to Europe in 1602, he worked on the publication of these writings into a book entitled ''Relación de las Islas Filipinas''. The book was eventually published in [[Rome]] in 1604.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

In Europe, he was able to further establish the Jesuit mission in the Philippines at both the royal and pontifical courts. Through his efforts, he was able to obtain a decree from the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]], elevating the Philippine mission to the status of vice-province, independent of the province of Mexico.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Father Chirino returned to the Philippines in 1606 and continued writing about the Philippines; many of  these writings have yet to be published. He died in Manila on September 16, 1635.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

'''Petrus Jacobi Thaborita''' ([[List of Latinised names|Latinised]] name form of '''Peter Jacobusz van Bolsward''') ([[Bolsward]], 1450–1527) was a [[Frisia]]n [[monk]], [[historian]] and [[writer]]. He is best known for his writings on the [[Frisians|Frisian]] [[freedom fighter]] [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]], and for writing down Donia's [[last words]]. In the extended works by Thaborita van Bolsward is found information on the Frisian chieftains warlords [[Jancko Douwama]] and [[Haring Harinxma]] (the [[Donia family|Donia]] ancestor). 

Dutch writer [[Conrad Busken Huet]] used many of Thaborita's descriptions of historical figures in later books. He also translated the description of Donia. Thaborita joined the monastery at an advanced age, as a widower with two sons. Petrus also dedicated a chapter in one of his books{{specify|date=August 2012}} to Donia:&lt;blockquote&gt;'''About the death of Greate Pier, [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]]:&lt;br&gt;'''
"''In dat selue iaer van 20 soe is ghestoruen groet Pyer, op Sinte Lucas nacht. Van deese Pier was grote spraeck in Hollant, in Brabant ende in ander landen, van sin grote stercheit ende gruwelicheit, ende van sin grote oghen; ende sy maectent groter dant was; mer noch tans wasset een groet, swaert, man mit grote oghen, grote schouwer ende een groten baert, ende gruweliken van aensyen, sonderlingh als hy toernich was; ende hy was grof ende plompt van spraeck ende wesen; want hy en conste nyet bequam spreken voert recht ofte voer heeren; mer mit sin groue Fryesche slaghen quaem hy mede vort, ende dat ghyngh hem alsoe plomp of, dat alle menschen, die daer by stonden, worden beweghen tot lachgen; ende hy was froem ende fel op die vianden, mer hy was redelyk van herten als een Kersten man.''"
&lt;br&gt;
'''English translation''':
"''In the very same year of 1520, on Saint Lucas night, [[Grutte Pier]] died. Of this Pier in Holland, in Brabant and other countries tales went around about his strength and his brutality and about his large eyes. And they made it bigger than it was. Yet he was a big, heavy man, with big eyes, broad shoulders and a big beard and terrible of appearance especially when he was angry. And he was rude and unarticulated of speech and manners. Because he wasn't able to speak properly in court or in front of lords. He often made jokes, so that all the people standing around, were made to laugh. He had killed many enemies, but he had a rather good character, as if he were a good Christian.''"{{cn|date=June 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anton Reinhard Falck]] was the owner of the original documents, he lent these to the researchers Visser and Amersfoordt.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

'''Phạm Thận Duật''' ([[Chữ Nôm]]: 范慎遹, 1825–1885) was a high-ranking mandarin serving in the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. He and [[Tôn Thất Phan]], representing emperor [[Tự Đức]]'s court, signed the [[Treaty of Huế (1884)|Treaty of Huế]]. He participated in the anti-colonial [[Cần Vương]] resistance and died while being sent to exile in Tahiti by the French. Knowledge of his role in the resistance was hidden or lost for many decades after his death; he was thought to have been a French collaborator for having signed the treaty.

He was also a celebrated historian who was in charge of the National History Institute (Quốc Sử Quán) and the Imperial College (Quốc Tử Giám). He was the final editor of ''The Imperially Ordered Annotated Text Completely Reflecting the History of Vietnam'', a Chinese-language history of Vietnam commissioned by the emperor Tự Đức, and the mentor of future emperors [[Dục Đức]] and [[Đồng Khánh]].&lt;ref name="VUSTA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pham Than Duat, a Talented Historian |url=http://www.vusta.vn/en/news/Sci-Tech-Information/Pham-Than-Duat-a-talented-historian-55615.html |website=Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is now a prize for doctoral theses in History named after him, the Phạm Thận Duật Award.

==Early life==
Phạm Thận Duật (courtesy names Quan Thành and Vọng Sơn, the latter named after a mountain in his hometown [[Ninh Bình]]) was born in Yên Mô Thượng village, Yên Mạc county, Yên Mô district, [[Ninh Bình]], on November 4, 1825, during emperor [[Minh Mạng]]’s rule. His family were poor farmers who aspired to education for their children. At the age of nine, he began studying [[Confucianism]] with Vũ Phạm Khải in a neighbor village, but it lasted only a few days before Vũ Phạm Khải went to [[Huế]] to assume a government post. Phạm Thận Duật then became a student of his uncle, Nguyễn Hữu Văn, and afterwards studied under Phạm Tư Tề, a teacher from the same village who had opened a school in Nam Định. Four years later, he returned home to study under scholar [[Phạm Đức Diệu]] in Yên Mô district who later became his father-in-law.  Realizing Duật's potential, Phạm Đức Diệu recommended Duật to his close friend [[Phạm Văn Nghị]], a retired mandarin who was staunchly anti-colonialist.&lt;ref name="QuehuongOnline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nhà Văn Hóa Phạm Thận Duật, Một Sĩ Phu Yêu Nước |url=http://quehuongonline.vn/con-nguoi-viet-nam/nha-van-hoa-pham-than-duat-mot-si-phu-yeu-nuoc-19253.htm |website=Tạp Chí Quê Hương Online |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial court career==
In 1850, Phạm Thận Duật passed the provincial exam, and took the court exam in Huế the year after but did not advance further. Still, he was appointed as an official serving the [[Nguyễn dynasty]] during emperor [[Tự Đức]]'s rule. Initially, he was the Prefecture Educational Commissioner of [[Đoan Hùng]] county, then promoted to Prefect of Tuần Giáo. During this period, he composed the Hưng Hóa Gazettes under the name Quan Thành.&lt;ref name="TinTucOnline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nhà Sử Học, Nhà Văn Hóa Lớn Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://baotintuc.vn/giai-mat/nha-su-hoc-nha-van-hoa-lon-pham-than-duat-20141128101447986.htm. |website=Tin Tuc Online |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, he was appointed Prefect of Quế Dương, and then Prefect of Lạng Giang. Afterwards he was promoted as a province official, holding posts such as Plantation Commissioner, Surveillance Commissioner, Administration Commissioner, and ultimately Governor of Bắc Ninh.&lt;ref name="nghiencuulichsu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bàn Thêm Về Việc Tham Gia đánh Dẹp Nội Loạn, Ngoại Phỉ Của Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://nghiencuulichsu.com/2016/06/03/ban-them-ve-viec-tham-gia-danh-dep-noi-loan-ngoai-phi-cua-pham-than-duat/ |website=Nghiên Cứu Lịch Sử |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870-1871, Phạm Thận Duật took part in the campaign to neutralize bandits at the midlands border. In 1873, when the French, led by [[Francis Garnier]], attacked the Hanoi citadel (see [[France-Vietnam relations#Territorial conquest | Conquest of Cochinchina]]), he was designated to govern Tonkin’s provinces and appoint temporary government officials, becoming Patrol of Hà Nội. In 1874, he was appointed Patrol of Bắc Ninh, executing a successful campaign to eliminate bandits in the north. In 1875, he became the assistant to [[Tôn Thất Thuyết]], responsible for the administration of two provinces, [[Bắc Ninh]] and [[Thái Nguyên]].&lt;ref name="nghiencuulichsu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bàn Thêm Về Việc Tham Gia đánh Dẹp Nội Loạn, Ngoại Phỉ Của Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://nghiencuulichsu.com/2016/06/03/ban-them-ve-viec-tham-gia-danh-dep-noi-loan-ngoai-phi-cua-pham-than-duat/ |website=Nghiên Cứu Lịch Sử |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876, Phạm Thận Duật was summoned to Huế to become Advisor of the Ministry of Personnel, as well as Vice Chief Officer of the Censorate. After 4 months, he was sent to the north to be the commissioner overseeing the maintenance of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]]’s floodbank and irrigation.&lt;ref name="TinTucOnline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nhà Sử Học, Nhà Văn Hóa Lớn Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://baotintuc.vn/giai-mat/nha-su-hoc-nha-van-hoa-lon-pham-than-duat-20141128101447986.htm. |website=Tin Tuc Online |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, he was summoned to the Privy Council to become the mentor for emperor Tự Đức's princes [[Dục Đức]] and [[Chánh Mông]]. Subsequently, he was put in charge of the National History Institute and the Imperial College. He was appointed principal editor of ''The Imperially Ordered Annotated Text Completely Reflecting the History of Vietnam'' by emperor Tự Đức in 1884.&lt;ref name="VUSTA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pham Than Duat, a Talented Historian |url=http://www.vusta.vn/en/news/Sci-Tech-Information/Pham-Than-Duat-a-talented-historian-55615.html |website=Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaty of Huế and the Cần Vương movement==
Before the second French attack of Tonkin in 1882 (part of the [[Tonkin Campaign]]), Phạm Thận Duật had issued a secret report to the Huế court, laying out defensive measures against the enemy. He advocated for the construction of forts in critical mountainous areas, and anti-French military bases in Quảng Bình, Hà Tĩnh, with an especially large-scale one in Tân Sở, Quảng Trị. His plan was approved by the leading officials of the pro-confrontation faction of the court, [[Tôn Thất Thuyết]] and [[Nguyễn Văn Tường]].&lt;ref name="nghiencuulichsu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bàn Thêm Về Việc Tham Gia đánh Dẹp Nội Loạn, Ngoại Phỉ Của Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://nghiencuulichsu.com/2016/06/03/ban-them-ve-viec-tham-gia-danh-dep-noi-loan-ngoai-phi-cua-pham-than-duat/ |website=Nghiên Cứu Lịch Sử |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phạm Thận Duật headed the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]’s diplomatic corps to Tientsin, China before the 1883 Tet holiday to discuss a joint resistance campaign against the French, but it proved unsuccessful. In early 1884, he was appointed the Chief General in the signing of the 19-article [[Treaty of Huế (1884)|Treaty of Huế]] on June 6, 1884, which formed the basis for the protectorates of Annam and Tonkin, and for French colonial rule in Vietnam during the next seven decades. After his death, the Vietnamese public, without knowledge of his role in the resistance, vilified him for this role in the signing of the treaty.&lt;ref name="nghiencuulichsu"&gt;{{cite web |title=Bàn Thêm Về Việc Tham Gia đánh Dẹp Nội Loạn, Ngoại Phỉ Của Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://nghiencuulichsu.com/2016/06/03/ban-them-ve-viec-tham-gia-danh-dep-noi-loan-ngoai-phi-cua-pham-than-duat/ |website=Nghiên Cứu Lịch Sử |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Treaty of Huế signed, French forces led by General [[Henri Roussel de Courcy]] arrived in Vietnam to take control of the country in mid-1885. de Courcy made demands that seemed to signal to the Vietnamese that his goal was to completely subjugate them: for example, he demanded to walk through the central doors of the palace, which only the Emperor could do.{{sfn|Lam|1967|p=20}} The Vietnamese, led by Phạm's fellow mandarins [[Tôn Thất Thuyết]] and [[Nguyễn Văn Tường]], decided to launch a surprise attack against the French in a last-ditch effort for independence. Known as the "[[Cần Vương movement#The 'Huế ambush', July 1885|Huế ambush]]", it failed, and France seized the Huế royal palace.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Phạm Thận Duật and other loyal mandarins fled with the young king [[Hàm Nghi]] to [[Tân Sở]] in [[Quảng Trị Province]] (where Phạm had previously advocated for the construction of a military base), and issued an edict calling upon Vietnamese people to rise up and "aid the king" (the English translation of “Cần Vương” is "aid the king").&lt;ref name="TinTucOnline"&gt;{{cite web |title=Nhà Sử Học, Nhà Văn Hóa Lớn Phạm Thận Duật |url=https://baotintuc.vn/giai-mat/nha-su-hoc-nha-van-hoa-lon-pham-than-duat-20141128101447986.htm. |website=Tin Tuc Online |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edict sparked the [[Cần Vương]] resistance, a large-scale insurgency against the French colonialists. The resistance had widespread support and was the strongest resistance the French had encountered since landing on Vietnamese soil in the 17th century.{{sfn|Lam|1967|p=24}} On July 29, 1885, while preparing to cross the sea and organize a resistance campaign in Tonkin, Phạm Thận Duật and his family were captured by the French.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Afterward, Phạm Thận Duật was extradited to Huế. He refused bribery from the French colonialists, instead accepting a jail sentence in Côn Đảo. He was then later sentenced to exile in [[Tahiti]]. After 6 days on the ship on his way to Tahiti, suffering from diabetes, he died on October 23, 1885 in Malaysian waters.&lt;ref name="VUSTA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pham Than Duat, a Talented Historian |url=http://www.vusta.vn/en/news/Sci-Tech-Information/Pham-Than-Duat-a-talented-historian-55615.html |website=Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and tombstone==
Legend has it that his body, dressed in white clothing, was put in a bag, and dropped into the ocean. Only after a few years did his relatives and fellow villagers learn of his death; they erected a token tomb in his village to commemorate his life. The tombstone was inscribed by [[Vũ Kế Xuân]] telling of his deeds and achievements, but it was buried face down in order to be concealed from the French colonial authorities.&lt;ref name="ChimVietCanhNam"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tấm Bia 'giấu Mặt' Của Phạm Vọng Sơn Và Lá Triệu Bị Khai Quật |url=http://chimviet.free.fr/lichsu/tranvietngac/tvns_BiaGiauMat_a.htm |website=Chim Viet Canh Nam |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years afterwards, because he had signed the Treaty of Huế, Phạm Thận Duật was seen as a French collaborator and a traitor to the Vietnamese. However, in 1975, the tombstone was unearthed and his role as a leader of the resistance was rediscovered. His tombstone was re-erected, celebrating his life and work as a patriotic scholar and staunchly anti-colonialist official in emperor Tự Đức's court.&lt;ref name="ChimVietCanhNam" /&gt;

The '''Serer creation myth''' is the traditional [[creation myth]] of the [[Serer people]] of [[Senegal]], the [[Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]].  Many Serers who adhere to the tenets of the [[Serer religion]] believe these narratives to be [[sacred]]. Some aspects of Serer religious and [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut traditions]] are included in the narratives contained herein but are not limited to them.

The Serer people have many [[:Category:Serer deities|gods]], [[goddess]]es&lt;ref name="Kellog"&gt;{{en icon}} Kellog, Day Otis, and Smith, William Robertson, "The Encyclopædia Britannica: latest edition. A dictionary of arts, sciences and general literature", Volume 25, p. 64, Werner (1902)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pangool]]'' (the [[Reincarnation#Serer religion|Serer saints and ancestral spirits]] represented by [[snake]]s),&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", pp. 180, 305–402&lt;/ref&gt; but one supreme deity and [[creator god|creator]] called [[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]] (or Koox in the [[Cangin languages]]&lt;ref name="Noon"&gt;{{fr icon}} Ndiaye, Ousmane Sémou, "Diversité et unicité sérères : l’exemple de la région de Thiès", Éthiopiques, no. 54, vol. 7, 2e semestre 1991 [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?page=imprimer-article&amp;id_article=1253]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Serer creation myth developed from Serer [[oral tradition]]s, [[Serer religion]], [[legend]]s, [[cosmogony|cosmogonies]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 125-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; The specifics of the myth are also found in two main Serer sources: ''A nax'' and ''A leep''. The former is a short narrative for a short [[myth]] or [[proverbial expression]], whilst the later is for a more developed myth.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"/&gt; Broadly, they are equivalent to [[verb]]s and [[logos]] respectively{{clarify|date=October 2013}}, especially when communicating fundamental [[religious education]] such as the supreme being and the [[Creation myth|creation of the Universe]]. In addition to being [[worldview|fixed]]-Serer sources, they set the structure of the myth.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"/&gt;

The creation myth of the Serer people is intricately linked to [[Tree worship|the first trees]] created on [[earth|Planet Earth]] by Roog. Earth's formation began with a [[swamp]]. The Earth was not formed until long after the creation of the first three worlds: the [[cosmic ocean|waters]] of the [[underworld]]; the [[air]] which included the higher world (i.e. the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the [[star]]s) and earth. Roog is the creator and fashioner of the Universe and everything in it. The creation is based on a mythical [[cosmic egg]] and the [[chaos (cosmogony)|principles of chaos]].&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt;

==Common elements==
There are slightly different and competing versions of the myth. However, there are more similarities than differences, and the differences complement each other in the greater understanding of Serer creation mythology.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 125-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; They all posits that, [[the Universe]] and everything in it were created by ''Roog'' (or ''Koox'' among the [[cangin languages|Cangin]]), and the creation of Planet Earth was a result of a [[swamp]] which the first tree grew within. The first three worlds created through a [[cosmic egg|mythical egg]] and under the principles of chaos were: the waters of the [[underworld]], the air including the higher world and earth. These three were the first [[cosmogony|primordial worlds]] created by the supreme being through ''thought'', ''speech'' and ''action''. Planet Earth was not created until long after the creation of these worlds. The contentious points are, which of the main sacred  trees in Serer society (below) grew not just first, but also within the [[Abiogenesis|primordial swamp on Earth]]:
:1. Saas (var: ''Sas'') - [[Faidherbia albida|Acacia albida]]&lt;ref name="Nqaul"/&gt;
:2. Nquƭ (var: ''Ngud''&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; or ''NGuƭ''&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt;) - [[Guiera senegalensis]]&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt;
:3. Somb - [[Prosopis africana]]&lt;ref name="Nqaul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt; a species of [[Prosopis]]
:4. Nqual (var: ''Ngaul''&lt;ref name="Nqaul"/&gt; or ''NGawal''&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt;) - [[Mitragyna inermis]] part of [[Rubiaceae]] family of the genus [[Mitragyna]]&lt;ref name="Nqaul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt;
:5. Mbos - [[Gardenia|Gardenia ternifolia]]&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;
The importance of these trees are crucial to the formation of Earth, at least in the Serer [[worldview]] and their genesis are addressed in their relevant sections. Being the first tree does not necessarily equate to being the first living thing on Earth. In the creation myth, animals such as the [[jackal]], [[hyena]], the [[snake|serpent]] and [[ostrich]] figure prominently in the competing creation narrative. In some narratives, trees and animals merge in order to justify their legitimacy. These mythical animals may be seen as [[sacred]] and [[totems]], in the [[Serer religion#Family totems|Serer totemic]] and [[Sentience|sentient]] worldly-view of [[animal]]s and [[nature]] in general. The significance of trees in the Serer creation myth does not mean the dwelling place of the supreme deity, neither do they mean the dwelling place of the [[devil]].  They are dwelling places for the sanctified ancestral spirits (''Pangool''). The [[Tree worship|cult of the tree]] is [[Religious symbolism|symbolic]] in [[Serer religion]].&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; The [[Femininity|feminine world]] also played a crucial role in the creation process of the [[Universe]] and the first-[[human]]s.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 193−4&lt;/ref&gt; This is linked to the [[Serer philosophy of beauty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Faye, Amade, " La beaute Seereer : Du modele mythique au motif poetique", [in] Ethiopiques, n° 68, revue négro-aricaine de littérature et de philosophie (1er semestre 2002) [http://ethiopiques.refer.sn/spip.php?page=imprimer-article&amp;id_article=288]&lt;/ref&gt; and Serer-[[number]]s found in [[Religious symbolism|Serer religious symbolism]], with ''[[number 3]]'' symbolizing the feminine world,&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"/&gt; ''[[number 4]]'' the [[Masculinity|masculine world]] and ''[[number 7]]'' (3 + 4) representing [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]] and perfection, something the Serers try to achieve in their daily lives and the environment they find themselves in.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 457-8"/&gt;

Before the existence of the Universe, Roog existed by itself.&lt;ref name="Gravrand, Pangool, p 189"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 189&lt;/ref&gt; There was nothing but silence and darkness.&lt;ref name="Gravrand, Pangool, p 189"/&gt; The Serer notion of balance and perfection illustrates the creation of the higher spiritual order and corresponds to the [[motif (literature)|motif]] of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]. Its creation was the union of male and female principles, with Roog, the supreme [[Transcendentals|transcendental]] principle entity, becoming the embodiment of an androgynous Godfather and Godmother. However, it is from the female component of the supreme being: ''"Noo tiig tew"'' (''"out of a female [[womb]]"'' - [[EXIT procedure|ex utero]]), that the divine brought forth the ancestors of modern humans, with a ''[[female]]'', being the first to be created.&lt;ref name="Gravland in"&gt;{{en icon}} ([[Henry Gravrand]], "La civilisation Sereer -''Pangool''") [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, "Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43−44", F. Steiner (1997), pp 144-5, {{ISBN|3515028420}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a [[logos|mythical speech]] − the first [[word]][s] uttered by the supreme being. All the competing versions  attest to that. This myth is the general consensus and represents the [[Universality (philosophy)|absolute truth]] in Serer primordial time.&lt;ref name="Gravland in"/&gt; A major competing myth, also based on chaos, postulates that, there was originally a series of explosions. However, it agrees pretty much with the accepted view that trees and animals were the first to be created.&lt;ref name="Nia"/&gt; Explosion first arose in the vegetable kingdom and the first tree ''Somb'', according to this myth, bursted, which the seeds of all the [[plant species]] in the world sprang out (from its trunk) covering [[Earth|Planet Earth]] with life.&lt;ref name="Nia"&gt;{{fr icon}} + {{en icon}}  Niangoran-Bouah, Georges,  "L'univers Akan des poids à peser l'or : les poids dans la société", Les nouvelles éditions africaines - MLB, (1987), p. 25, {{ISBN|2723614034}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all versions, Roog appears as both the [[creator god|creator]] and [[demiurge]].

==Cosmogony==
Serer [[cosmogony]] is not as rich as the [[Dogon people|Dogon]]'s. [[Religious persecution#Persecution of the Serers|Religious and ethnic persecution of the Serers]] for several centuries had resulted in their migration to and fro.  In spite of [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|this turbulent history]], the Serer people have the richest cosmogony of all the [[:Category:Senegambian languages|Senegambian ethnic groups]].&lt;ref name="Pangool, pp 125-6"&gt;[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990), pp. 125−6, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the Universe===
====A nax and A leep====
The Serers relates the creation myth and the role of [[speech]] in the [[creation myth|formation of the Universe]]. Two Serer terms expresses the mythical creation word: ''"A nax"'' and ''"A leep"''. The former is a short narrative for a shorth myth or [[Proverbial phrase|proverbial expression]] and is equivalent to a [[verb]].  The later (''A leep'') is more advance and details the [[logos|mythical creation word]] and the creation itself, introducing the myth with the phrase: ''"Naaga reetu reet"'' (so it was in the beginning), before narrating the event. From a global perspective, the two roughly corresponds to [[verb]] and [[logos]], especially when communicating fundamental [[religious education]] relating to the supreme deity and the [[Creation myth|creation of the Universe]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"/&gt; They form the structure and sources under which the creation narrative is based.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"/&gt; ''"A leep"'', the logos, is [[World view|fixed]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 193-4"/&gt;

The creation of the Universe is based on several parts (see below):
:1. the structure which sets the basis of the narrative and the significance of the mythical word cited
::by the supreme being (see above);
:2. the creation process based on Serer-numbers;
:3. the [[Abiogenesis|genesis]] of the Universe;
:4. the [[prologue]] of the primordial myth based on three key elements: water, air and earth;
:5. the [[Cosmic ocean|primordial ocean]] and the formation of Planet Earth;
:6. the [[rotation]]al motion around the [[Axis mundi|axis of the world]], the creation of [[tree]]s and [[Vegetation|plant life]];
:7. the creation of [[animals]];
:8. the creation of [[human]]s and the first male and female couple whose children and descendants went on to populate the world;
:9. the crisis that befell Planet Earth and the separation of man and animal, and why the [[dog]] became man's friend;
:10. intervention of [[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]] and the process of [[Divine providence|divine intervention]] in the various stages of the creation and after the initial disorder;
:11. Serer representation of the Universe – the three worlds: the [[Invisibility|invisible]] world [[Galaxy|from above]], the [[Diurnality|diurnal]] terrestrial world and the [[nocturnal]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 194−218&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process of the creation (Serer-number 3)====
The source of the Universe is attributed to the feminine and maternal nature of Roog. In [[Religious symbolism|Serer symbolism]], the ''number 3'' is attributed to the feminine world. This number is the ingredient of the creation process. There were three [[Dietary mineral|essential elements]], three parts of the [[cosmos]] and three worlds.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt;
This triple [[rhythm]] of Roog and the cosmos is also found in women as the Serer myth relates it:
:"Roog a binda adna noo tiig tew'' (Roog has created the world of its feminine nature).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt;"
The phrase ''"Tiig Tew"'' is attributed to the feminine body of [[motherhood]] and is equivalent to the general [[saying]] of [[Mother goddess#Earth Mother|Mother Earth]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt; The phrase ''"No tiig tew"'' translates to
''"out of a female womb"'' - [[EXIT procedure|ex utero]].&lt;ref name="Gravland in"/&gt; The language here is symbolic.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt; The Serer religion and oral tradition confers to Roog some rather realistic aspects of the initial creation. There were three phases in the [[gestation]] of the creatures within the devine being:
::1. by ''thought'' -  within the living [[World egg|divine egg]], Roog developed the forms and beings to create. It laid the foundations and signs for things to come.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt;
::2. by ''word'' - Roog started the [[gestation period]] and provided everything by word for the smooth realization of its plan.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt;
::3. by ''action'' -  through its maternal nature, Roog opened-up and projected the [[embryo]] and [[placenta]] in a similar fashion as in [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"/&gt;
Roog did not create, nor did it engender all [[beings]] of all kinds. It simply created the [[archetype]]s, not the [[prototype]] of each [[species]], but seven archetypes namely '':''' the three essential elements (air, earth and water) and the top four [[seed]]s (the first tree, first animal and the first human couple - female, then male&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 194-5"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp 194-5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravland in"/&gt;

====Genesis of the Universe (mythical words)====
The genesis of the Universe is found in ''"A nax"'' and ''"A leep"''. Which posits that: "In [[Cosmogony|the beginning]], there was [[nothing]] but [[darkness]] and [[silence]] until the pre-existent being, Roog, began the genesis of the [[world]]&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 195-6"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 195−6&lt;/ref&gt;" [the [[Universe]]&lt;ref&gt;The original source says ''"Adna fee"'', which translates to the [[Universe]], see: {{fr icon}} Kalis, Simone, "Médicine traditionnelle religion et divination chez les Seereer Siin du Senegal", ''La connaissance de la nuit'', L'Harmattan  (1997), p 293, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]. The Serer oral tradition does not speak of Roog's gestation, probably due to cultural [[taboo]], but only when the mythical word was uttered and what was uttered by the supreme being, which is found in ''A nax''. According to ''A nax'', the first mythical words spoken by Roog were:
{{cquote|WATER! AIR! EARTH! &lt;ref name="A nax"&gt;«''A nax''» [in] Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;}}
''A leep'' details the scene of the primordial time in the following terms:
:"A leep à joon maaga
:a roxondox o maaga,
:a gad'wa roog,
:a saay'a lang ke."&lt;ref name="A leep"&gt;«''A leep''» [in] Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Which translates to:
:The Words leap into [[space]],
:He carried the [[Cosmic ocean|sea]] on his head,
:the [[firmament]] on his shoulders,
:the earth in his hands.&lt;ref name="A leep"/&gt;

The mythical words established the three worlds (water, air and earth) based on the [[prologue]] of the Serer genesis provided by ''A nax''.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 195-6"/&gt; In ''A leep'', it gives the order in which they were created and elaborated on it. ''A leep'' posits that, with the words of Roog, the three worlds (the [[Universe]]) began to take shape. The first to be created was the deep sea waters (waters of the [[underworld]]); the second was [[air]] including the high heavens (''Kuul na'', in [[Serer language|Serer]]) such as the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the [[stars]]; and third was earth. However, the [[Earth]] was not one of the first primordial worlds to be formed. It will take a long time before the waters and the Earth were separated.&lt;ref&gt;« ''A leep'' » [in] Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 195−6&lt;/ref&gt;

====First swamp and creation of Earth (''Nqaul'')====
The creation of [[Earth|Planet Earth]] is based on the myth of ''Nqaul'' (a type of tree - ''mitragyna inermis'').&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"&gt;Gravrand, Pangool, pp. 196−7&lt;/ref&gt; In this myth, the formation of the Earth was started by a [[swamp]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; Swamps are integral to [[:Category:Serer culture|Serer culture and traditions]] and have parallels with this Nqaul. The foundation of Serer villages, towns, homes, etc., in many cases, began with a swamp, even today.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; ''Nqaul'' is also significant in the [[Timeline of Serer history|history of the Serers]]. At a time when [[rainfall]] were plentiful, during the rainy season, the [[States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes|founders of ancient Serer villages and towns]] were often surprise when the first rainfalls brought [[flood]]ing (see [[Saltigue]]).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; [[Radiocarbon dating#Calibration|Calibrated]] archaeological dating have shown that, many of the places they had chosen to settle next to were [[shoal]]s.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Descamps, Cyr, "Contribution a la Préhistoire de l'Ouest-sénégalais, thèse, Paris, p. 315. (inédit : unpublished version, p 126)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Andrew, &amp; Else, David, "The Gambia &amp; Senegal", 2nd edition - September 2002, Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd, p 13&lt;/ref&gt; Serer tradition states, on one occasion, the flooding caused severe damage resulting in many people losing their homes, crops and food they had [[farming|farmed]]. After the damage, the people who escaped returned to assess the damage and commiserated each other. They recalled an ancient myth − the myth of ''Nqaul'':&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt;
:''"Ko adoox a adax Nqaul"'' (You start like the beginning of Nqaul).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt;
This phrase evokes the [[Abiogenesis|primordial swamp]] and the ''Nqaul'' tree which grew within the original swamp.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; This tradition is still retained by the Serers as the [[saying]] is so widespread in [[:Category:Serer country|Serer country]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; It is a different kind of tree to ''Saas'' ([[Faidherbia albida|acacia albida]]).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; Whilst some Serer sources postulates that the ''Saas'' was the first tree on Earth, the Serer oral tradition states that the ''Saas'' was not ''Nqual'' (the original tree in the swamp). Instead, ''Saas'' is attributed to one of the sacred trees useful for overall-bodily [[health]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt; Another sacred tree − the ''Nquƭ'', is also thought to have been the first tree. However, the general consensus is that the ''Nquƭ'' which has the properties to cure [[snakebite]] grew on the [[river bank]] whilst ''Nqual'' grew inside the primordial swamp.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 196-7"/&gt;

====Rotational movement around the axis of the world====
{{further|Serer religion#Serer cosmology}}
According to the Serer narrative, this initial [[islet]] was not static, but animated by a whirl around the [[Axis mundi|axis of the world]]. The Serers were able to symbolize the Earth's axis and the whirl in a [[geometric]]al diagram. In [[Serer religion#Serer cosmology|Serer cosmology]], the diagram depicts two crossed lines representing the rotational motion and the [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] points representing the axis of the world. One of the lines depicts the axis running from [[east]] to [[west]], the other from [[north]] to [[south]]. Simultaneously, they are the [[empyrean|Empyrean Heaven]] where the supreme deity is said to have given way to the first elements. In the myth, Roog is portrayed as the mythical deity who somehow "turned its self on". As the deity rotate in space, its rapid motions [[Metric expansion of space|expanded]] with the primordial world it had first created.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 197-8"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 197−8&lt;/ref&gt; Roog's motion also affected the axis of the [[cosmos]]. The [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|vital energies]] it had emitted, rotated in a [[spiral]] motion thereby creating the [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 197-8"/&gt;

Since the time of the [[States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes|ancient Serer Lamanes]], the Serer people have represented the axis of the world in the form of a [[stele]], symbolizing the steles of Roog.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 197-8"/&gt; In the Serer home, sometimes in the courtyard, they represent the most sacred place of the house servicing as the [[centre of gravity]] of [[divine|divine energies]] and one of the [[Earth|pole]]s of the [[cosmogony|coronation]]. In the home, these steles are made of wooden slabs, forming a [[Sacred grove|sacred wood]]. Sometimes they are raised steles supported by three rods and sometimes they are just green trees. There symbolism can be celestial or terrestrial depending on the arrangement of rods that surround them. If there are [[number 12|twelve]] rods arranged in a [[circle]], they symbolize the celestial world, four rods forming a [[square (geometry)|square]] symbolizes the earthly world. They are always built based on the tenets of Serer symbolism, and form the family [[shrine]] devoted to the supreme being (see [[Serer ancient history]]).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 197-8"/&gt;

The creation of the first [[tree]]s and [[vegetation]] are preserved in the Serer [[oral tradition]]. The [[Serer religion]]  offer guidance based on the primordial seed.  This has been a matter of interpretation, and such, there are competing  versions as to which trees were first created and the order in which they appeared. In Serer society, [[Tree worship|trees are viewed as sacred entities]] and some trees are afforded higher religious status depending on the [[Pangool]] (the [[Reincarnation#Serer religion|ancient Serer saints and ancestral spirits]] represented by [[snakes]]) affiliated with them, their [[Serer religion#Medicine, harvest and offerings|medicinal and spiritual value to Serer]] life, etc. Some [[:Category:Serer families|Serer families]] are also associated with certain Pangool (singular: ''Fangool''). The Serer priestly class (the [[Saltigue]]s), guardians of Serer religion, sciences and ethics, still cannot agree on which tree was first created on Earth nor the order in which the first trees appeared.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 198−9&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are probably due to the vast areas [[Timeline of Serer history|the proto-Serers]] once inhabited.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt; At present, the ''Nqaul'' (proper: ''NGawul'',&lt;ref name="Kal"/&gt; var: ''Ngaul''&lt;ref name="Nqaul"/&gt; or  - [[mitragyna inermis]]) and ''Nquƭ'' tree represents the [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and prevailing Serer view,&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt; hence in the myth of Earth's creation, a [[planet]] which was supposed to have come about as a result of a primordial a [[swamp]], the ''Nqaul'' tree grew within the swamp whilst the ''Nquƭ''  grew on the [[river bank]] thereby making them the first trees on Earth according to the Serer creation mythology, with ''Nqaul'' taking precedence as it grew within the primordial swamp.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt; In the creation myth, ''Saas'' is afforded high spiritual and medicinal status as one of the ancient trees, and form part of Serer representation of the Universe. However, it was not the original tree, and it was the tree that fell in "disgrace" after it tried to "abuse its powers".&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt;

Apart from being the first tree and linked to Earth's creation, many of the original narratives of ''Nqaul'' has been [[lost history|lost to history]]. In [[:Category:Serer country|Serer country]], it is used both as a [[medicine|medicinal]] and  [[veterinary]] plant for curing various [[ailment]]s. The leaves are used against [[fever]], hypertension and to stimulate the [[intestine]]; bark [[decoction]] for [[diuretic]] and to stimulates the intestines against [[hypertension]] and fever, etc.  The barks are also applied to [[wound]]s in order to improve the healing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Potel, Anne-Marie, « Les plantes médicinales au Sénégal ».

=====Nquƭ=====
The ''Nquƭ'' tree (proper: ''NGuƭ'',&lt;ref name="Kal"&gt;{{fr icon}} Kalis, Simone, "Médecine traditionnelle, religion et divination ches les Seereer Siin du Sénégal" – La connaissance de la nuit, L’Harmattan, 1997, p 291, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; variation: ''Ngud'' &lt;ref name="Nqaul"/&gt;  - [[guiera senegalensis]]) is highly prized for its [[medicine|medicinal]] properties and is used for curing different kinds of illnesses, wounds and [[snakebite]]s. Traditional [[Saltigue|Serer healers]] specializing in snakebites often use the dried powder in their [[therapy|therapies]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt;

In the Serer narrative, the roots of the tree were believed to move in the [[underworld]] for survival. After the initial trees were created, then came other trees. These new trees would send their roots to the closest ''Nquƭ'' in order to feed from it before starting their [[overwintering]]. After waiting out the winter months, the nourishment they had received from the ''Nquƭ'' prior to their overwintering increased their [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] growth.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt;
At that time, trees moved and talked. They were migratory trees.&lt;ref&gt;A tree that has the supernatural powers to relocate from one place to another. See Thiaw, "Mythe de la création du monde selon les sages sereer"&lt;/ref&gt; They sank deep into the underworld during the day and reappeared at night. The tree is seen as the "tree of luck and good health".&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt; In the village of ''Lang o Maak'' (now part of present-day [[Senegal]]), the tree is [[tree worship|venerated]]: ''xu'doox o'baal'' (big ''guiera senegalensis'' tree in the shape of a pot). At the time of the [[homo|ancients]], the tree appeared one night and everyone saw it. Someone tried to cut it down and he ended up dead.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt;

The Serers believed that, all [[tree]]s are like [[human beings]] and [[animal]]s out of the same [[cosmic egg|divine placenta]] and share the same fate and destiny.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt;

=====Saas=====
The ''Saas'' tree (in [[Serer language|Serer]] and some [[Cangin languages]], var: ''Sas'') is the [[Faidherbia albida|acacia albida]] tree.

Serer advocates for ''Saas'' postulates that, the ''Saas'' is the [[tree of life]], and therefore, the [[origin of life]] on [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 125-6"/&gt; Others reject that view, and posits that ''Saas'' was not the tree that grew within the primordial swamp and therefore, not the original tree. However, Saas is afforded religious and medicinal status useful for overall bodily health and is viewed as one of the ancient trees but not the original tree.  Like the ''Nqual'' tree, many of the original narratives have been [[lost history|lost to history]].  In these contrasting views, some [[:Category:Scholars of Serer religion|scholars of Serer tradition on the origins of life]] postulates that, the ''Saas'' narrative seems to fit the wider [[West Africa]]n creation myth in terms of behaviour and judgement, and any scholar of Serer mythology on the origins of life cannot overlook the importance of ''Saas'.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 125-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravrand, Henry 1971"&gt;Gravrand, Henry, "Revue de Psychopathologie africaines", Dakar (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

In this myth, the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is reported to have infused with the acacia seed vital for energy, and the Saas played a pivotal role in the transmission of life.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 125-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gravrand, Henry 1971"/&gt;
It is believed that, the Saas was once a living tree. The narrative went on to say that, women who wanted to give birth went to it because it was considered to be a lucky tree in the wider Serer mythology and legend. Newborns were also presented to the Saas in order to bring good luck, long life, good health and prosperity to the child’s life. In similarity, if an animal went near Saas it was destined to live a long life. According to the myth, the Saas loved human beings and perhaps too much. It would sometimes lower its [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorny]] ends so people can [[tree hugging|give it a hug]]. Anyone who saw that immediately knew the Saas wanted their company.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 125-6"&gt;Pangool, pp. 125–6&lt;/ref&gt; It did not move until [[sunset]]. It healed the wounded by its barks being rubbed on the bleeding wound. The Saas eventually became  exhausting for people when it started to abuse its supernatural powers. It is generally viewed as the tree that fell in disgrace. [[Timeline of Serer history|The ancients]]  called it by the name ''Nyas'', a name which has two meanings: [[scar]] or [[clot]]. The Myth of Saas still retains a certain degree of importance especially when it concerns the need for vital energy such as:  during  growth, at the time of marriage, in sickness and after death. It is also viewed by many as the [[fertility]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 126&lt;/ref&gt; In the Serer representation of the Universe, the ''Myth of Saas'' forms part of the geometric diagram.

======Fertility tree======
[[File:Graves of the Sereres-1821.jpg|left|thumb|A Serer [[graveyard]] with Serer grave diggers (1821)]]
The Saas is believed to possess fertilizing qualities which is concentrated in its [[green]] branches and [[moisture]]. These fertilizing components may only be abstracted by the use of its own symbol, communicated through prayer. At the birth of a child, a branch of Saas was deposited at the top of an enclosure where the child and his/her mother remains in seclusion for [[8 (number)|eight]] days (the ''Bat'' ceremony&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Panfool", p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;).  The ritual was to ward of [[evil spirit]]s and as such, a small Saas from a [[Crossroads (mythology)|crossroad]] was chosen. The ritual demands the branch to be placed at the top of the enclosure when the child is asleep, whilst the person performing the ritual cite the appropriate prayers. A small stick of Saas is also worn on the waist by young boys and girls in order to preserve their future fertility. At weddings, a stick of the plant is deposited under the bed of the newlywed in order to improve the fertility of the couple.&lt;ref name="Pangool, p 126-7"&gt;Pangool, p. 126−7&lt;/ref&gt;

Saas also played a major role in [[Serer ancient history|ancient Serer]] funerals. As well as accompanying the dead with [[grave goods]], a stick of Saas was placed [[Serer religion#Mummification and Cult of the Upright Stones|inside the tomb of a dead Serer]].  The purpose of this ritual was to help the [[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|dead move on]] to ''[[Jaaniiw]]'' (the abode of souls).  If this ritual was not performed, the [[soul]]s of the dead are believed to remain in the living world to the dismay of the living. A stick of Saas (with the Serer-[[viaticum]]) in their tomb helps them in their journey to the next life. When Serer men finish off burying the dead, they used to wash their hands in a [[calabash]] placed at the entrance of the house. This calabash contained branches of Saas soaked in water. Unlike the trees of the [[savannah]] that lose their leaves during the [[dry season]], the Saas is green throughout the dry and rainy seasons. In effect, the Saas was and still is considered by the Serers as a tree of life.&lt;ref name="Pangool, p 126-7"/&gt;

The Saas tree has an economic value to the Serers.  Its dual [[economics|economic]] role benefits both the [[agriculture|agricultural]] and [[pastoral]] Serers. A Saas tree in a field of [[millet]]s increases millet production. The leaves fertilize the soil, the branches and fruit act as a sort of [[meadow]] which saves air thereby preventing Serer [[cattle|herds]] from starvation. There is also a relationship between Saas density per [[hectare]] and the demographic pressure per hectare. An abundant Saas allows [[crop rotation]] and [[intensive farming]] such as the triangular [[Diohine]]-[[Ngayokhem]]-[[Niakhar Arrondissement|Ñakhar]] (parts of [[:Category:Serer country|Serer country]]). In spite of the allegations levied against it by the ancients, many Serers still believe ''Saas'' to be the tree of life, the sacred and the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 198-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool, p 126-7"/&gt;

=====Mbos=====
Based on the myth of ''Mbos'' ([[Gardenia|gardenia ternifolia]]), the ''mbos'' was the first tree created by the supreme being. However, it grew and kept growing until it reached the supreme being. The creator deity got angry with it, cut off its head and said: "Tree of mbos, return to Earth". Shamed by the words of the deity, the mbos tree quickly returned to earth with its branches intertwined so that no one can climb it or pass under its shadow.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; When Roog created the ancestors of [[modern humans]] (''maak'' - the great or elder), these ancient beings according to the myth hid under the mbos tree. After the creation of these beings, Roog created the ''dong'' (the younger). These new beings, wondered the earth trying to find the ''maak'', whom they found hidden under the mbos tree. From that day on, the mbos tree became much in demand for making [[Amulet|protective charms]].&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; In Serer symbolism, the mbos is the symbol of protection.&lt;ref name="pan 284"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 284&lt;/ref&gt; Mbos means [[miscarriage]]s, as in the song chanted at night by the initiates in [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut classical teachings]]: ''Wagoxaam Mbos'' (I locked myself in the Mbos), a song with hidden meaning.&lt;ref name="pan 284"/&gt;

The [[Adansonia digitata|baobab tree]] (''mbudaay-baak'') also holds great religious significance among the Serers and in Serer religion. Like most revered trees in Serer mythology, before this tree can be cut (which is very rare&lt;ref&gt;It is a sacred tree. See Thiaw "Mythe de la création du monde selon les sages sereer"&lt;/ref&gt;), it is customary to cite the [[incarnation]] prayer (''jat, muslaay, leemaay'') to the [[axe]] before cutting the tree down. In the myth, the baobab is seen as a "migratory tree"&lt;ref&gt;A tree with special powers that has the supernatural ability to relocate to another place.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus linked to the first trees on Earth. It can also be an altar and in certain circumstances, a sacred burial place.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Issa Laye Thiaw|Thiaw, Issa laye]], "Mythe de la création du monde selon les sages sereer", pp. 45−50, 59−61 [in] "Enracinement et Ouverture" – ''"Plaidoyer pour le dialogue interreligieux"'', [[Konrad Adenauer Stiftung]] (23 and 24 June 2009), [[Dakar]] [http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_17308-1522-1-30.pdf?090827174112] (Retrieved: 25 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some Serer [[griot]]s were once buried inside an open baobab tree with [[grave goods]].  This culture sparked criticism from the Serer [[playwright]] Fama Diagne Sène which attracted great controversy among the Serer priestly class (the [[Saltigue]]s).  Although Serer religion dictates that every Serer is entitled to a pyramid burial with grave goods, pyramid burial was reserved primarily for the upper echelons of Serer society (see [[Serer religion]]). Some Serer griots weren’t given a pyramid burial. Fama Diagne Sène portrayed this prejudice in one of her works and practically alienated the Serer priestly class. See [[Fama Diagne Sène]]: {{fr icon}} « ''MBILEM OU LE BAOBAB DU LION'' » de Fama Diagne Sène : ''Une confrontation entre la tradition et la modernité,  [in] PiccMi.com [http://www.piccmi.com/MBILEM-OU-LE-BAOBAB-DU-LION-de-FAMA-DIAGNE-SENE-Une-confrontation-entre-la-tradition-et-la-modernite_a108.html] (Retrieved: 10 May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Somb=====
{{main|Serer ancient history|Serer religion#Mummification and Cult of the Upright Stones|Somb|l2=Mummification and the Cult of Upright Stones}}
After the ancients lost confidence in the ''Saas'', the ''Somb'' tree ([[prosopis africana]] a species of [[prosopis]]) was adopted. The ''Somb'' is one of the largest and most mysterious trees found in Serer country. Its wood is very hard and resistant to [[Dry rot|rot]]. It is harder than [[Khaya senegalensis|cailcedrat]] and [[Aucoumea klaineana|Okoumé]]. It is the same wood found in the Serer [[tumuli]] that are still intact for over a thousand years. The pegs lining the [[burial chamber]] of the Serer notables [[mummy|mummified]] and [[Burial|interned]] in their tombs have not been not  eaten away by [[termite]]s and are still intact in spite of the passage of time. In 1976-8, Descamp and his team carried out an [[archaeological]] [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] of these ancient sites. Gold, silver, armour (a golden [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] in particular), metal and other [[grave goods]] were found in these burial chambers.  The town [[Somb]], in present-day [[Senegal]], took its name from this tree. The Somb tree is the symbol of [[immortality]] in Serer religious symbolism. The ''Somb'' is viewed as the [[Tree of Life]] by most Serers who adhere to the tenets of [[Serer religion]]. That is the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] view.&lt;ref name="Gravland in"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 199-200"/&gt; In the creation myth, it is the only tree that provides a strong challenge to the ''Nqual'' tree. While ''Nqual'' was the first three on [[Earth]] since it grew within the primordial swamp, the Somb tree, is the [[seed]] that produced it and all the [[plant species]] that populated the world.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 199-200"/&gt;

The creation of Somb by the supreme being is found within the [[hermeneutics]] of [[Serer religion]] and  [[tradition]]s. By [[thought]], Roog first plotted the shapes of all the trees or plant species yet to come. Through the mythical words, Roog fashioned its placenta on the primordial seed − the seed of the ''Somb'' tree. Within this seed, Roog placed all the plant species including their reproductive [[energy|energies]] − [[male]] and [[female]]. Through its feminine principle, Roog opened up and "projected the [[Bacteria|germ]] of Somb" which became the bearer of all the plant species found on earth and the [[underworld]]. The Somb seed penetrated the earth, the placenta of Roog where it took root and grew. Growing from this placenta, it kept all the plant species within its trunk. When it became a big tree, its trunk swelled [[diminutive]]ly and opened up as if by [[caesarean section]] or [[explosion]]. From this event, it opened up all the plant species found on Earth, and the rotational movement of the [[Universe]] scattered them all over the world.
Thus, the vegetable seeds fashioned in the [[cosmic egg|divine egg]] and deposited in the Somb, brought forth by Roog, were projected into space at the time of the explosion of Somb. This is how the Earth began to be covered with grass, plants and trees. Thus the vegetable seeds were modeled within the supreme being (Roog) and its outputs ex utero. The primordial mythical tree − Somb, was the [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] and [[transmitter]] of these seeds, carrying their own principles of [[reproduction]].  Fertalized by these germs of life, the [[wetland]] was carpeted with [[vegetation]] and the first [[forest]]s came into being.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 199-200"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool pp 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creation of animals (''Ɓoxo-koƥ'')====
[[File:Side-striped Jackals (Canis adustus)- rare sighting of this nocturnal animal ... (13799101285).jpg|thumb|[[Side-striped jackal]] in [[Kruger National Park]], [[South Africa]].]]

There are two main varying versions regarding the creation of the first [[animals]] (non-[[humans]]). In both versions, the [[jackal]] is believed to be the first animal on [[Earth]], and in accordance with the prevailing Serer view.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool" pp. 201−203&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are differences in the   interpretation, they converge on certain points in the wider understanding of the jackal's significance in Serer mythology. In one aspect, the jackal can be viewed as an [[Earth-diver]] sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen [[prophet]] for disobeying the laws of the divine. In one narrative, the myth does not mention it by name, but only allude to it&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; or when it does, the negative connotations are made obscure, because of its former closeness to the divine before it was disgraced for disobeying the laws of Roog from whose womb it grew out of.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt;

The creation of the original animals comes from the myth of Ɓoxo-koƥ (var: ''"o ɓoox o koƥ"''&lt;ref name="diction"&gt;[[serer language|Serer]] + {{en icon}} "Serere-English / English-Serere Dictionary", Compiled by PCVs: Bethany Arnold (Khady Diouf), Chris Carpenter (Ndiouma Diome),
Guy Pledger (Arfon Sarr), and Jack Brown (Babakar Ndiaye), p. 8, (May 2010), First Edition, Peace Corps - Senegal&lt;/ref&gt; or ''"boxo-kob"''&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;) which translates to: the dog of the forest (the jackal).&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;

In the first narrative, the creation was marked by the emergence of the [[acacia]] and the jackal.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; The following narrative provide further information on the behaviour of the jackal though obsecurely:

:"The [jackal], was the first on Earth.
:And it will be the last.
:Roog sent his messenger to Earth.
:To which it will bring all mankind.
:The messenger went around the Earth.
:It came back saying":
:"Nothing is there.
:Only the [jackal] remains."&lt;ref name="Boxo"&gt;« ''Ɓoxo-koƥ'' » [in] Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative provides a second indication of the behavior of the jackal during the crisis of the first creatures created by Roog. As one of the first animals on Earth that sprang out of first divine placenta, it desicicated the subsequent placenta from which the next phase of Roog's creation where to sprang out of.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt;
The text is deliberately obscure. Respect for the supreme being  and all the entities incurred in the genesis of the Universe is key in Serer religion and tradition as well as the jackal myth which was close to Roog before being transformed into the dog of the forest (or ''pale fox'' according to some).&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; This is why it is not named, but only by allusion. The jackal was the first intelligent creature on earth, before the arrival of humans. It is believed that will still remain on earth after human beings have returned to the divine.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; The Serers believe that, not only does it know in advance who will die, but it  traces the tracks in advance of those who will go to funerals. The movements of the jackal are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a [[Clairvoyance|seer]]&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it. Although believed to be rejected in the bush by other animals and deprived of its original intelligence, it is still respected  because it dared to resist the supreme being who still keeps it alive.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt;

[[Issa Laye Thiaw]]'s "myth de la creation de sereers" provides a further account on the jackal. In this myth, it is named and damned but the narrative is still obscure:

According to the legend of ''Ɓoxo-koƥ'' (dog of the forest&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; or "wild dog" (figuritively)&lt;ref name="diction"/&gt; - ''[[jackal]]''), the jackal was the first living thing created by the supreme deity ''Roog''. The jackal circled the world in a day and two of its [[hand]]s were transformed into [[paws]].  The supreme being gave it the ''ngud'' tree ([[guiera senegalensis]]) and thus ''ngud'' became the first tree and the second thing created by Roog.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; After the creation of ngud, the ''nalafun'' tree ([[Combretum|combretum paniculatum]]) was created to whom the deity told: "Go and keep the ngud tree company, it is lonely".&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt; During the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of the nalafun, the [[tree]] grow so tall that it headed towards the sky. The supreme being considered that an affront and gave it a sharp flick on the head (''mak'' in [[Serer language|Serer]]) and told it: "You are rude. Go! Turn around and go back to where you've just came from". After that event, the nalafun never grew tall as it once did and was always bent.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;
::"The smallest animals were those who resisted Roog."&lt;ref name="Boxo"/&gt;

Another narrative indicates that, all animals (non-humans) were created by some form of [[creation myth#World parent|world parent]], except the jackal. In this myth, Roog went through a [[gestation period|period of gestation]]. By [[thought]], Roog planned this new creation, the animal world. By the mythical words, Roog realized the divine placenta and the internal gestation of the animal [[embryo]] called ''Mbocor''.&lt;ref name="Mbocor"&gt;« ''Mbocor'' » [in] Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 202−3&lt;/ref&gt; Roog then placed in the embryo of this animal, which was the largest of the creation, which included the eggs or seeds of all animals to come, including their [[organism]]s and reproductive energies. After the gestation period, Roog projected the embryo of the Mbocor on Earth, which carried all the animals species on Earth. The embryo of Mbocor [[Acclimatization|acclimatized]] to the earth, feeding on grass and water. It grew rapidly reaching a considerable proportion, as it carried within it the [[bacteria|germs]] of [[animal life]]. At the final stages of the gestation of the eggs and embryos that were within it, the animal ripped apart and released all the species within it. The female animals were created first, some spreading on land, in water, the mythical sea, etc. After delivering these animals, the Mbocor died, but animal life which came from the [[creator god|creator deity]], spread through the world.&lt;ref name="Mbocor"/&gt;

Although Mbocor was sacrificed in order to bring animal life on Earth, the narrative is imprecise on the identity of this animal.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; Some postulates that it was probably the largest animal in [[Africa]], perhaps a [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]] such as: [[hippopotamus]], [[rhinoceros]], [[elephant]], etc.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; The word ''Mbocor'' means "The Mother" (or ''"Mother"'' in old Serer)  − mother of all animals except the jackal.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; It is also probable that ''Mbocor'' is the same as ''Ɓoxo-koƥ'' (the dog of the forest − "jackal"). However, at present, nobody knows what kind of animal ''Mbocor'' was.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt; In any case, the Ɓoxo-koƥ (i.e. the jackal) is believed by most Serers who adhere to the tenets of [[Serer religion]] to be the first living thing that the deity Roog (or Koox) put on [[Earth]]&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 201-3"/&gt;

====The tree and the serpent====
{{see also|States headed by ancient Serer Lamanes|Lamane|Pangool}}
The [[snake|serpent]] is linked to [[Serer religion#Serer cosmology|Serer cosmology]] and mythology. The serpent itself is the symbol of the [[Pangool]] (ancient Serer [[saint]]s or [[ancestor veneration|ancestral spirits]]). Fangool, the singular of Pangool means serpent in Serer language.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Kalis, Simone, "Médecine traditionnelle, religion et divination ches les Seereer Siin du Sénégal" – La connaissance de la nuit, L’Harmattan, 1997, p. 329, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yaal Pangool'' are the masters of the cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Kalis, Simone, "Médecine traditionnelle, religion et divination ches les Seereer Siin du Sénégal" – La connaissance de la nuit, L’Harmattan, 1997, p 48, {{ISBN|2-7384-5196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Serer mythology, there is a relationship between trees and the serpent. In the Serer religion, the [[reincarnation#Serer religion|reincarnation of souls]] is a strongly held belief. When the dead leave the world of the living,
their [[soul]]s or ''"double"'' transforms into an animal, usually a snake, hence why it is [[taboo]] in Serer culture to kill snakes.  The Serer religion posits that, the souls of the dead must make their way to ''Jaaniiw'' (the abode of good souls).&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La civilisation sereer, ''Cosaan'': les origines", vol.1, Nouvelles Editions africaines (1983), p 33, {{ISBN|2-7236-0877-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faye, Louise Diène, "Mort et Naissance le monde Sereer", Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines, 1983. pp. 17-25. {{ISBN|2-7236-0868-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformation into snakes (usually a black snake) is one of the first phases of their effort to reach ''Jaaniiw''. As they transform themselves into snakes, they hide in trees. A snake hiding in a tree has two main symbolic meanings. It can either mean that a person has died and his soul has ''reincarnated'' (''ciiɗ'' in [[Serer language]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Louis Diène Faye|Faye, Louis Diène]], "Mort et Naissance Le Monde Sereer", Les Nouvelles Edition Africaines (1983), pp. 9−10, {{ISBN|2-7236-0868-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or a person may die.  If the latter is the case, then killing a snake would trigger their early death.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;

The ''ngaan mbul'' tree ([[Celtis|celtis integrifolia]]) or ''a mboy xa nafad'' in particular, holds great significance in this reincarnation process. This tree supports the dual serpent-man, beneath which is a big hole where the [[ghost|undead]] take residence.&lt;ref name="Thiaw myth"/&gt;
[[File:Five Pointed Star Lined.svg|thumb|upright|''Yoonir'', symbol of the Universe in Serer cosmology. common known as the [[Sirius|Star of Sirius]].&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, ''"La civilisation sereer : Pangool"'' p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Museum of Civilization "&gt;Madiya, Clémentine Faïk-Nzuji, "Canadian Museum of Civilization", Canadian Centre for Folk Culture Studies, ''"International Centre for African Language, Literature and Tradition", (Louvain, Belgium), pp. 27, 155, {{ISBN|0-660-15965-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Like the serpent and other animals, the cayman and the [[manatee]] also holds significance in Serer mythology. The cayman is the guardian of the secrets of the past whilst the mantee holds the secrets of the future.&lt;ref name="Lamantin"/&gt;

====Origin of the stars (Serer numbers)====
{{main|Serer religion#Cosmology| l1=Cosmology in the Serer religion}}
{{See also|Ndut initiation rite}}
The Serer account regarding origins of the [[star]]s is found in [[Serer religion#Cosmology|Serer cosmology]], especially the Star of ''"Yoonir"'' (in [[Serer language|Serer]] and [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]) more commonly known as the [[Sirius|Star of Sirius]], Serer-[[number]]s and symbolism.
''Yoonir'' (Sirius) is the Serer representation of the [[Universe]] and the [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. Its five branches symbolize [[human]]s on [[Earth]], standing up with their heads held high, their hands raised, which symbolizes work and prayer.&lt;ref name="Pan pp 21 &amp; 468"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 21 and 468&lt;/ref&gt;  The star is spread across the heavens and on Earth figuratively, symbolizing the sign of the supreme deity (Roog or Koox) and the image of man.&lt;ref name="Pan pp 21 &amp; 468"/&gt; In Serer-numbers, three important numbers came into play at the time of the initial creation: number 3, number 4 and number 7. Number 3 represents the [[femininity|feminine world]] as well as the divine; number 4 represents the [[masculinity|masculine world]] as well as humans, and number 7 represents the divine in human beings, which is the perfect number and represents balance or harmony. Number 3 evokes the [[Celestial spheres|celestial]] world and is represented by a [[circle]]. As in the Serer home, the twelve rods arranged in a circle around the [[stele]] of Roog symbolizes the space enveloped by the powers of the divine. Number 3 is thus the symbolic number of Roog whilst number 4 evokes the [[earth|human and terrestrial world]] (the visible world).  This Earthly world is represented by two crossed lines facing the four [[Cardinal direction|cardinal points]]. In addition to [[:Category:Serer culture|Serer culture]], it is for this religious reason why Serer women are allowed to participate in all [[Saltigue|religious]], political and [[:Category:Serer royalty|royal institutions]], because they share the same number with the divine who created the Universe through its feminine principle. For the Serer men, their number is 4. Fixed to the four cardinal points of the Earth, they were the "Masters of the Earth" (the [[Lamane|Lamanic class]]).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 457-8"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp 457–58&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the stars offers a somewhat contradictory account, and is linked to a pact between the [[ostrich]] and the divine. According to the myth, the ostrich stood on a [[sand]]y [[valley]] looking around the wooded savannah that stretched around her. Feeling that the time had come to perform the [[Time immemorial|immemorial]] [[gesture]] of [[Struthio|its kind]], it was immobilized due to the threats posed to its offspring. Each time it had managed to hide its eggs from other animals but on this occasion, a [[deer]] was determined to have its offspring. Feeling powerless against the beast before her, the ostrich asked for Roog's protection and the supreme deity intervened by creating the stars, which inspired her to take her first stroke. Inspired by the powers of the deity, the ostrich drew five trails on the ground representing the stars of the heavens. The ostrich then invaded this space and deposited her eggs inside the star, covering them with sand. After that act, it cited the following prayer, placing herself and her offspring under the protection of the divine:&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 98-9"&gt;Gravrand, Pangool, pp. 98–99&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Col-end}}

The other [[animal]]s were unable to act against the offspring of the ostrich enclosed by the star thanks to Roog, who offered them total protection.  Powerful [[predator]]s also came to devour the eggs but they could not cross the lines engraved on the sand. The myth went on to say that a [[Black people|black]] [[shepherd]] witnessed the hatching eggs.  After the departure of the ostrich with her offspring, he came to the scene and discovered the star engraved on the spot where the eggs hatched.  He understood that the star protected the eggs of the ostrich with the assistance of the supreme deity. It is for this reason Serer mums evoke the ostrich in their prayers for the protection of their children on their departure to another country.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from evoking the ostrich, the myth plays a significant role in the adoption of the new religious symbol (the star) and its transmission to humankind. It is above all "[[World egg|the beginning of the eggs]]" of the ostrich. The Star ''Yoonir'' is a [[religious symbolism|religious symbol]] in the Serer religion. Its five branches are marked and observed in [[Ndut initiation rite|the classical Ndut teachings]]. It is a Serer star and the symbol of the Serer people of [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]]. It has [[Serer religion#Cosmology|religious, medicinal and nationalistic connotations among the Serers]].&lt;ref name="Pangool p 100"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p 100&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The Sun (Gulooxar)=====
''Guloxaar'' is a [[Psalms|psalm]] devoted to the [[Sun]]-god as the [[Timeline of Serer history|ancestors of the Serer people]] used to [[Solar deity|worship the Sun]] – many still do (see also [[Serer ancient history]]). The word ''Guloxaar'' in simple Serer means the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; In a religious sense, it means "one who is bound to come".&lt;ref name="Pangool p 164"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The Sun itself being a [[star]], it is attached to the Serer creation myth.

These secret prayers are only revealed to young Serers on their journey to another country. It is only recited in the morning and at night, at [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The second verse is a prayer of [[adoration]]. Beyond the star is the master of the [[Solar System]] who is [[Evocation|evoked]]. The supreme being is represented by the Sun. The Sun's bright light is just the [[Hierophany|epiphany of its being]]. The prayer has mystical connotations.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 164−5&lt;/ref&gt;

====First rain (Ngam)====
The myth of ''Ngam'' (''"Ngam jam, o yas jam"'') narrates the first time [[rain]] (the essence of life) appeared on [[earth|planet earth]]. This narrative describes the event in a [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaotic manner]].&lt;ref&gt;For creation from chaos, see Leonard, Scott A, &amp; McClure, Michael, "Myth and Knowing – an introduction to world mythology",  McGraw-Hill (2004), pp. 32, 63-172, {{ISBN|076741957X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this myth, the first event was the opening of the heavens by Roog. When the heavens were opened, the sky threatened with heavy and shadowy clouds. [[Tornado]] occurring in a straight line, swept through everything in its path, bearing [[thunder]] in the [[cloud]]s. Bright [[lightning]] rendered the darkness, and the waters of the heavens first littered by the wind, splashed in every direction, before turning into regular, refreshing and nourishing showers.&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The proverb ''Ngam jam, o yas jam'' (rain in peace! Sow in peace) is the first word Serer farmers utter during the [[Wet season|first rain]]. It is also the way the Serers wish each other happy New Year. As well as an expression, it also a religious prayer. The first rain of the season is a pact between the transcendent power and humanity. It is a sign of life which continues to be transmitted by this tutelary power, which has long respected the pact. Custom dictates that, the first three steps on the damp earth of the first rain to be made barefooted in order to connect with mother nature. The father or the mother of the family would be given a [[calabash]] of the water of the first rain, for the whole family to drink. This water is holy and is viewed as sacred which would protect them from all misfortunes that may occur during the rainy season. Under the Saas tree, containers were placed under it to collect the water that touches the tree. This water was used for bathing as a sign of protection.&lt;ref name="Pangool p 100"/&gt;

====Creation of human beings====
=====First human couple=====
Before humans existed, there were three stages in the creation of the Universe and each of these steps followed a consistent order.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; The first phase was the first three elements: air, earth and water. The mythical words of [[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]] found in ''A nax'', led to the formation of the heavens, earth and the sea.
The second phase of the creation was the primordial trees (i.e. Somb, Nqaul, Nquƭ, etc.,). The third phase was the creation of the animal world: the [[jackal]] and ''"Mbocor"'' (which means "The Mother"&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt;) - mother of all animals except the jackal.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; In each of these phases, and before the creation of the first human couple, the supreme deity did not directly create each species, but only  the [[Ancestor|primogenitor]]s who then went on to populate the world with all the species of plant and animal life.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt;
The same was the case at the creation of the first humans.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; By [[thought]], the supreme deity planned for the creation of human beings (a female and a male).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; By [[word]]s, Roog went through a gestation phase which signalled the gestation of man and woman, paired within the divine placenta.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; Through its maternal nature, Roog projected a female and male human being as in [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; The first human was a female, named YAAB.&lt;ref name="Armand Diouf"&gt;« Genesis of YAAB &amp; YOP » narrated by « Armand Diouf » of Ndimaag ([[Senegal]]), [in] Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  p. 204, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second human was a male named YOP (var: ''YOB'').&lt;ref name="Armand Diouf"/&gt;

[[YAAB and YOP]] were the first humans that walked the [[Earth]] according to the narrative. The ancient and sacred village of Yaabo-Yabo (var: [[Yaboyabo]]  or ''YABO-YABO'', in present-day [[Senegal]]) also derives its name from this couple.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt;

=====Ark of Yaabo-Yabo=====
The ark of Yaabo-Yabo is believed to be an ancient [[relic]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 208−9&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the first humans on Earth (YAAB and YOP - female and male respective) boarded this ark when they left the [[Empyrean|Empyrean Heaven]] after their creation by the supreme deity (Roog).&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt; This relic is believed to be under the guardianship of Yaabo-Yabo, one of the sacred villages in Serer religion.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt;  However, it is one of the [[sacred]] Serer relics which holds great religious significance.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt;

The relic exist to the present which is well respected.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt; Most Serer houses have in their possession{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} ancient relics from the past including furniture which are jealousy guarded.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Becker"/&gt; Some are religious while others are secular.&lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;{{fr icon}} Becker, Charles, "Vestiges historiques, témoins matériels du passé dans les pays sereer", CNRS-ORSTOM, Dakar, 1993, [http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_5/b_fdi_01/010014636.pdf] (Retrieved: 25 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[University of Calgary]].

In the Serer pre-colonial [[Kingdom of Sine]], it is called ''MAAK'' (var: ''Maak''), except in [[Diohine]] (a former territory of Sine in [[:Category:Serer country|Serer country]]) where it is called ''Badir''.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt;  Guarded by the elders, it is shaped like a bench. It is believed that, when YAAB and YOP were born to Roog in its Empyrean Heaven, they were deposited in an ark and carried down to Earth. YAAB was the first to arrive as she was the first born then followed by YOP. When they arrived on Earth, the original twins made contact with Mother Earth who would [[nutrition|nourish]] them.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 208-9"/&gt;

=====Historical figures=====
The legend of ''Unan'' and ''Ngoor'' probably dates back to the [[Iron Age]],&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"&gt;Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  pp. 204−5, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Unan being the woman and Ngoor the man. Although not the first human couple that the supreme deity Roog (or Koox) had created,&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"/&gt; like the [[The legend of Jambooñ and Agaire|legend of Jambooñ and Agaire]] (see [[the Point of Sangomar]]), they form a fundamental part of Serer mythology.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"/&gt; The legend agrees pretty much with the general consensus that a female was created first then a male. But in this narrative, it attempts to place Unan and Ngoor as the first human couple.

:"The first human being created by Roog was a woman.
:She lived naked, where  Roog had placed her.
:She slept on the ground at night,
:bitten by the [[fleas]] of the earth.
:She could not sleep.
:Roog moved her to another place.
:At that time, she was alone.
:A man finds her and asks: "What do you eat? From the earth?
:What do you drink? Water?"
:The woman responded: "I do not know what I eat :because I'm not hungry.
:I do not have water to drink."
:He asks her name. She say: "Unan."
:She leaves him to live elsewhere.
:The man followed her for several years [winter years].
:She gave the name Ngoor to the man,
:for the man is he who comes to the woman for company.
:A [[blacksmith]]  found Unan and Ngoor.
:He said to them: "I can  make iron, so you can work" [the earth].
:They [[forge]]d a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]] and a [[machete]].
:The Pangool came and spoiled the work.
:The blacksmith made them protective [[talisman]]s"&lt;ref&gt;« Legend of Unan &amp; Ngoor » narrated by « Ndofen Ndour » of Njagamba [in] Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  pp. 204−5, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The talismans were to protect them from the supernatural being that had entered their realm.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"/&gt;

The name ''Unan'' means one who pile [[millet]], figuratively, "the norisher".&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"/&gt; ''Ngoor'' (or ''Ngor'') is a name for a [[virile]] man.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"/&gt; These names denote the function of the woman and the man but they are not their real [[name]]s.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 204-5"/&gt;
The narrative evokes the first humans created by Roog with a female being the first, and the trials they had faced.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"&gt;Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  pp. 205−8, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also evokes the name of Roog, regarded as the [[Omnipotence]], whom through his paternal nature, acted as a good [[father]] and moved the woman to a more comfortable place when she complained about her discomfort.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; It shows that he is always available to his children.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt; The appearance of the man initially surprised the woman, whom she named ''Ngoor'' (virile), yet, they later became companions and [[procreate]]d.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 205-8"/&gt;

====Crisis and reorganization of the Universe====
=====Crisis=====
{{see also|Kopé Tiatie Cac#Ndut cosmogony|l1=Cosmogony of the Ndut}}
Originally, all the [[animals]] on [[Earth]] lived together with [[human|human beings]] and trees in harmony. However, this peaceful habitation of the Earth came to an abrupt end when one of the [[lion]]s  impregnated a girl causing her to [[give birth]] to a [[monkey]], a half man-half beast. The male society of this distant past were furious and [[Summons|summoned]] all the animals to a [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] in order to determine the [[culprit]].&lt;ref name="John Ballo Diouf &amp; Armand Diouf p 209"/&gt; The lion fearing for the punishment that it may receive from these men, refused to identify itself as the one responsible for the act until a [[dog]] pointed it out as the culprit. A war broke out between the human population, the non-human animals and the trees. The humans were victorious and drove the animals in the bush except the dog who became [[dog#Roles with humans|man's companion]].&lt;ref name="John Ballo Diouf &amp; Armand Diouf p 209"&gt;« John Ballo Diouf » and « Armand Diouf » of Ndimaag, recitation from « ''A leep'' » [in] Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990), p. 209, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the crisis did not end there, as this narrative from ''A leep'' shows:

:"A conflict broke out between all beings.
:Trees, animals and men were killing each other.
:Roog intervened and punished them all.
:He reduced the size of men, who were originally [[Giant (mythology)|giants]].
:He [[paralyzed]] and rendered the trees dumb and blind.
:But he did not render them deaf.
:That is why the trees no longer see, no longer move, no longer speak, but they hear.
:Roog rendered the animals mad.
:The smallest resisted Roog.
:But man’s spirit was the cleverest.
:Through his spirit, he dominated all these beings."&lt;ref name="Armand Diouf p 209"&gt;« Armand Diouf » of Ndimaag, recitation from « ''A leep'' » [in] Gravrand, Henry, "La Civilisation Sereer - ''Pangool''", vol. 2. Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990), p. 209, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative reflects human hostility towards animals especially the lion, "the savage beast". The original cause of the war also identifies the monkey, whose predecessors in that ancient past is believed to be closer to humans, like all animals and plant, from the same divine placenta."&lt;ref name="Pangool p 210"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 2101&lt;/ref&gt;

It also represents a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] of the slaughtering of animals by humans, accompanied by their dogs in their [[hunting|hunting camps]] subsequent to the initial creation.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 210-11"/&gt; Not only did men hunted animals, but trees cut down those closest to them and animals killed each other, as found in the myth of the [[hyena]] and the talking tree.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 210-11"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 210−11&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder led to Roog's direct intervention and its reoganisation of the Universe which the narrative says would have repercussions for Planet Earth.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 212-14"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp 212-14&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Roog's reorganisation of the Universe=====
After the initial crisis on [[earth|Planet Earth]] where humans, animals and plants fought against each other, Roog intervened and punished them all. The tradition states that, Roog was the father and mother of its creation who initially afforded some freedom to its first creation. However, after the first disorder, Roog organised the world on new foundations. That reorganisation was not a second creation but it would have profound effects on the Universe and particularly on Earth.
Roog manifested its powers and will continue to manifest it. Serer phrases such as ''"Roog alone is king"'' and ''"We all come from the hand of Roog"'' are examples of [[conscience]] decision of divine intervention in the events of life, as in the destiny of nations and human kind. Roog will be present in the activities of humans and the cosmos.
Though the trees were the hardest hit by their immobility, trees were afforded special status, such as the tree of life, ability to heal, homes to certain spiritual entities and ability to hear humans beings even the Pangool. They are the object of respect in Serer society. [[Deforestation]] in Serer country is almost unheard of.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 212-14"/&gt;

Animals were also severely affected by Roog's judgement. Although rendered wild and "mad", they still retain their instinct, though their relations with humans would be changed forever. Some became human pets others retained their freedom away from human habitation. Despite this separation, animals are respected and would form part of Serer [[totem|temism]].&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 212-14"/&gt;

Humans were the least affected. The only thing they have lost was their original size and duration of life. Along with being giants, the first humans were believed to have had larger eyes and bigger bones than the present. Roog did not touch the human spirit. Instead, it allowed them to develop their minds and put their own branding on Earth.&lt;ref name="Pangool pp 212-14"/&gt;

====Representation of the Universe====
[[File:Serer cosmogony - representation of the universe.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Serer cosmogonical representation of the [[Universe]]. The three worlds: the invisible world, the terrestrial world and the nocturnal world. ([[Henry Gravrand]], La civilisation sereer ''Pangool'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Gravrand, Henry, "Pangool", p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In Serer cosmogony, the Universe is represented [[Intelligent agent|schematically]].  There were three worlds: the invisible world from above; the diurnal terrestrial world and the noctanal world. A [[Geometry|geometric]] representation of these three worlds form the [[Serer religion#Cosmology|Serer star]].&lt;ref name="pp 215-6"/&gt;
The invisible world from above is the source of energies and life. The diurnal Earthly world (e.g. the sun) is divided into two strands: the ''Saas'' tree symbolizing the [[tree of life]] and human beings assisted by the noctanal world (the ''Pangool''). The nocturnal world depicts the role of the [[moon]], the ''Pangool'' (ancient Serer saints and ancestral spirits), ''Ciid'' (proper, var: ''Ciiƭ'' or ''Cyid'', the disembodied souls in search of [[wikt:Hominization|re-hominisation]] or reincarnation) and ''"Jaaniiw"'' or ''"Honolu"'' (the sacred abode of the departed souls). After a sacrifice of [[domestication|domestic animals]] and/or offering of [[millet]] to the Pangool and ancestors, vital energies are returned.&lt;ref name="pp 215-6"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", p. 215−6&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The invisible world from above=====
The invisible world represents the vital energies which originates from the transcendent powers of [[Roog (Serer deity)|Roog]], which spreads worldwide. The supreme being is the source of all life in the cosmos as well as human beings. In the world of Roog, certain entities and elevated humans are afforded sacredness and called upon to live with Roog. They form the demi-goods, saints and ancestral spirits (Pangool), etc.&lt;ref name="pp 217-8"&gt;Gravrand, "Pangool", pp. 217−8&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The diurnal terrestrial world=====
The diurnal terrestrial world is represented around a network of topical or utopian transcendence.  Topically, it is centred around the sacred, people or accessible places. [[wiktionary:Utopianly|Utopianly]], it resides in the imagination. There are two types of people on Earth: visible [[human beings]] and the invisible, living far away from human beings with their own paths and dwelling place. These invisible people, reside in the [[souterrain]] world.&lt;ref name="pp 217-8"/&gt;

=====The nocturnal world (Jaaniiw)=====
''Jaaniiw''  is the abode where the souls of the dead go. Their star is not the sun (the star which illuminates the diurnal world), but the moon which illuminates the activities of the night and [[beings]] of the night. Flying from ''Jaaniiw'' to  ''Ciid'', their aim is to return to earth for a new course of [[human evolution]].&lt;ref name="pp 217-8"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5378">The '''Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society''' was founded in 1849. The Society bought [[Taunton Castle]] in 1874, and leases it to [[Somerset County Council]] to house the [[Museum of Somerset]]. A substantial proportion of the items held by the Museum were originally collected by the Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanhs.org/Collections.htm|title=Collection|publisher=Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it opened in 2010, the Society's office and library have been located at the [[Somerset Heritage Centre]], alongside the County Council's Heritage Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanhs.org/Library.htm|title=Library|publisher=Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The society was founded in 1849, by members of Taunton's society who had an interest in history and archeology and by 1851 it had grown to 420 members. It was originally based at the Victoria Rooms in Taunton until in 1874, the society purchased Taunton Castle for its new base of operations.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; The castle was purchased for £2,850 ({{inflation|UK|2850|1874|fmt=eq|cursign=£}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000406/18740821/026/0006|accessdate=1 September 2016|work=Western Gazette|date=21 August 1874|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the society funded repairs to the castle, including a new roof for the large 'Somerset Room' in 1884, the refitting of the Great Hall to be a museum in 1899, and the creation of a library in 1908.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Somersetshire Archaeological and Natural History Society; 1849-present|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/library/archives/catalogue/dserve.exe?dsqServer=placid&amp;dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqSearch=Code==%27PX10685%27&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl|website=Natural History Museum|accessdate=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The society was responsible for excavations at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] during the early 20th century, but the Director of Excavations, Frederick Bligh Bond, had to be dismissed as he claimed he had been helped by ghosts of Glastonbury monks. The present museum at the castle was fitted during mid 20th century, and around the same time the 18th century staircase from [[St Mary Redcliffe]]'s vicarage was installed in the Great Hall.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Taunton Castle is now leased to Somerset County Council and it's museum has become the [[Museum of Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/public/services/directory/service?rid=/guid/60bb8eed-0437-2c10-c095-b61e3531c2f7|title=Taunton Castle|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=1 September 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523203516/http://www.somerset.gov.uk/irj/public/services/directory/service?rid=%2Fguid%2F60bb8eed-0437-2c10-c095-b61e3531c2f7|archivedate=23 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Women with Large Feet''' was a [[British people|British]] [[organization]] founded by [[Airton]] resident Mrs. Phyllis Crone in 1949. It [[lobbying|lobbied]] for clothing manufacturers to better provide for tall women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Something is Sure to Happen|last=|first=|date=1 February 1951|work=Evening Dispatch (Edinburgh)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members had to be at least 5 feet 8 inches tall.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://find.galegroup.com.ezproxy.is.ed.ac.uk/dvnw/infomark.do?&amp;source=gale&amp;prodId=DVNW&amp;userGroupName=ed_itw&amp;tabID=T003&amp;docPage=article&amp;docId=CS67325275&amp;type=multipage&amp;contentSet=LTO&amp;version=1.0|title=A Tale of Tall Women|last=|first=|date=27 October 1951|work=The Times|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association was originally formed to convince [[footwear]] [[Shoe manufacture|manufacturers]] to provide more attractive options for women with larger [[shoe]] sizes. However, it expanded to lobby clothing manufacturers more generally to provide for tall women, with some success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8039128.Craven_through_the_years/|title=Craven Through the Years|last=|first=|date=2 August 2001|work=Telegraph and Argus|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association made direct approaches to manufacturers, and if they agreed to provide for tall women, their details were circulated to all members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The group changed its name to The Association of Tall Women in October 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/winnipeg-free-press-oct-29-1951-p-10/|title=Long-Stemmed Ladies Reject "Big Feet" Title|last=|first=|date=29 October 1951|work=Winnipeg Free Press|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase its appeal and membership. There were reportedly 10 branches across the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by this point, with members joining at a rate of around 50 per week. Membership fees were 3 [[shilling]]s and 6 [[pence]] (3s 6d) per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 1952 the group was reported to have 2,000 members in London alone.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/63480306/5612524|title=Helping London's Tall Women|last=|first=|date=4 November 1952|work=Townsville Daily Bulletin|access-date=5 August 2018|location=Queensland, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of their campaign, in 1952 the Association held a public display of [[clothing]] for taller women at a London [[department store]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Successes included convincing [[stocking]] manufacturers to produce [[Nylon stockings|nylons]] with longer foot and leg measurements, "ending a nightmare for taller women", &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE{{!}}EE1864454054|title=End of a Nylon Nightmare|last=|first=|date=23 August 1952|work=Daily Mail|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the establishment of a London shop called "Tall Girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE{{!}}CS254768737|title=Outsize Department|last=|first=|date=1 March 1972|work=The Times|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}

==7th century==
*About 625 - It was thought [[Ireland|Irish]] [[monk]]s settled in the Faroe Islands and were the first people there. In earlier historical studies, it was assumed, that they came around 725. After botanical researches it had to be dated back to 675, and today Faroese scientists believe, that [[oat]]s have been cultivated on the Faroes since about 625, for example in [[Mykines, Faroe Islands|Mykines]].

==8th century==
*About 795 - Irish monks reach [[Iceland]]. It is suggested, that they came from the Faroes after banished by the [[Viking]]s. [[Diucil]] refers to it 825, but maybe some of the monks stayed in the Faroes.

==9th century==
*About 825 - [[Grímur Kamban]] is said to be the first Norse settler in the Faroes at the place, which is named [[Funningur]] (the ''find'').
*About 885-890 - Second wave of immigration to the Faroes under king [[Harald Hårfagre]] of [[Norway]]. Most of the settlers come from western Norway, but also many from Ireland and [[Scotland]].

==10th century==
*Around 900 - The [[Faroese Althing]] is assumed to be founded. If this is true, it is the oldest existing parliament of the world.
*Around 970 - The [[Færeyinga saga]] starts with its main story. The murder of [[Brestir and Beinir]] is assumed to have happened in 969.
*983 - Return of [[Sigmundur Brestisson]].
*999 - The Faroese Althing adopts Christianity against [[Tróndur í Gøtu|Trónd's]] resistance.

==11th century==
*1005 - Sigmundur Brestisson is killed by [[Tórgrímur Illi]] in [[Sandvík]].
*1026 - King [[Olaf II of Norway]] tries to encash taxes from the Faroes and to establish Norwegian law - but fails.
*1028 - The murder of the Norwegian legate [[Karl of Møre]] ends Olav's attempts.
*1035 - Death of [[Tróndur í Gøtu]], the last Viking chieftain of the Faroes. [[Leivur Øssursson]] becomes Christian autocrat over the Faroes as [[feud]] under Norwegian government. The [[Viking age on the Faroes]] is over.

==12th century==
*Around 1100 - The Faroes become the [[Diocese of the Faroe Islands]], initially suffragan to the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]]. The Faroese [[bishop]] has his seat in [[Kirkjubøur]] until 1538.
*Around 1104 - The diocese comes under the archbishopric of [[Lund]], (today [[Sweden]]).
*1152/53 - The diocese becomes part of the archbishopric in [[Nidaros]], [[Norway]].
*1156 - [[Sverre I of Norway|Sverre]] comes to the Faroes in the age of 5 for further education in Kirkjubøur. He returns to Norway in 1176 and becomes King there.

==13th century==
*About 1200 - [[Slavery]] on the Faroes is abolished by King Sverre
*1269 - [[Bishop Erlendur]] from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]] becomes bishop in the Faroes
*1271 - King [[Magnus Lagabøte]] of Norway establishs the ''elder'' [[Gulatingslog]] on the Faroes. The [[Faroese Althing]] changes from a legislative into a consultative body. 1274/76 the ''younger'' Gulatingslog was adopted.
*1280 - The [[Hereford map]] is the first known map, which mentions the Faroes - as '''Farei'''.
*1290 - The [[Hanseatic League]] is forbidden to trade with the Faroes.
*1298 - The [[Sheep Letter]] (Seyðabrævið) becomes law. Obviously the slavery is reintroduced, for the sheep letter regulates, among other things, the exposure to slaves.

==14th century==
*Around 1300 - Beginning of the construction of the [[Magnus Cathedral|Saint Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjubøur]]. It was never finished, but is still the main historical building of the country.
*1302 - The prohibition against the [[Hanseatic League]] is renewed by Norway.
*Around 1303 - [[Bishop Erlendur]] is forced to leave the Faroes.
*Around 1349 - The [[Black Death]] reaches the Faroes - a third of the population (estimated at least 1000 of 3000) dies.
*1350 - The [[Dog Letter]] (Hundabrævið) becomes law.
*1361 - The Hanseatic trade is legalized under the same conditions as of the business people from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].
*1397 - Within the [[Kalmar Union]], the Faroes remain under Norway's rule.

==15th century==
*Around 1400 - The ''Althing'' is renamed into [[Løgting]]. This name is still in use today.
*Around 1447 - Attempts by the bishop Goswin of [[Iceland]], to get the Faroes under his diocese, fail.
*1490 - [[Netherlands|Dutch]] tradesmen get the same privileges in the Faroe business as the [[Hanseatic League]].

==16th century==
*Since around 1500 - The Faroes are exposed to [[pirate]] raids from the [[British Isles]] and western [[France]], later also [[Barbary pirates|Barbary]] (then a [[vassal]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]).
*Around 1520 - [[Joachim Wullewever]] from [[Hamburg]] becomes [[Vogt|reeve]] over the Faroes on behalf of King [[Christian II of Denmark]].
*1524 - After going into exile, Christian II offers the Faroes and [[Iceland]] to [[Henry VIII of England]] as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a [[loan]]. Henry denies. Historians believe this saved the two countries from losing their languages, as it happened with the [[Norn language]] in [[Shetland]] and [[Orkney]].
*1540 - Land which belonged to the church now became property of the Danish king (kongsjørð). The land was leased by Faroese peasants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://setur.fo/fileadmin/user_upload/GFS/PDF-filur/N%C3%A1msrit/Namsrit7_2006.pdf setur.fo, Bygdin – fyrr, nú og í framtíðini, pp 5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319014130/http://setur.fo/fileadmin/user_upload/GFS/PDF-filur/N%C3%A1msrit/Namsrit7_2006.pdf |date=19 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later the school was moved to Tórshavn.

==20th century==
*1906 - The political party [[Sambandsflokkurin]] (Union Party) was founded.
*1906 - The political party [[Sjálvstýrisflokkurin]] ([[Self-Government Party]]) was founded.

* 6 October 1992 – The bank [[Sjóvinnubankin]] declares bankruptcy and this starts off the worst economic depression in Faroese history.

==21st century==
*2005 - The Takeover Act (Overtagelsesloven) of 24 June 2005 which is an extension to the Self-governing Act of 1948, grants the Faroe Islands extended self-rule. The [[Constitution of Denmark]] (1953), The Self-governing Act (1948) and The Takeover Act (2005) make up the legal rights of the Faroe Islands within the Danish Realm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stm.dk/_a_2565.html Stm.dk, Den færøske selvstyreordning (''in Danish'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==

1829: The first public examination of an American girl in [[geometry]] was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O4kEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=the+first+public+examination+of+a+girl+in+geometry+(1829)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iP5ShzK5u-&amp;sig=sBOKjFQxaCHgVm10oM2EE4g1BNg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U-iYTdm4D-GS0QHBpZj6Cw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA# |title=History of Woman Suffrage: 1848–1861, Volume 1|page=36|editor1=Elizabeth Cady Stanton |editor2=Susan B.

1886: [[Winifred Edgerton Merrill]] became the first American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics, which she earned from Columbia University.&lt;ref name="PDF1959518127"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=59|issue=4|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201204/rtx120400504p.pdf|title=Winifred Edgerton Merrill:"She Opened the Door"|author1=Susan E. Kelly  |author2=Sarah A. Rozner |lastauthoramp=yes |date=28 February 2012|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1913: [[Mildred Sanderson]] published her theorem about modular invariants in her thesis. It states: “To any modular invariant i of a system of forms under any group G of linear transformations with coefficients in the GF[pn], there corresponds a formal invariant I under G such that I = i for all sets of values in the field of the coefficients of the system of forms.” She was [[Leonard Dickson]]’s first female graduate student, and he later wrote of her thesis, “This paper is a highly important contribution to this field of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is a remarkable piece of mathematics.” [[E.T. Bell]] wrote, “Miss Sanderson’s single contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges as one of the classics of the subject.”&lt;ref name="agnesscott"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/sander.htm|title=Mildred Leonora Sanderson|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
