'''Adventure education''' is the promotion of learning through adventure centered experiences.

Adventure centered experiences can include a wide variety of activities, due to the different ways people experience adventure. Outdoor sports, [[Ropes course|challenge courses]], races, and even indoor activities can be used in adventure education. Adventure education is related to adventure programming, [[adventure therapy]], and [[outdoor education]]. It is an active process rather than a passive process of learning that requires active engagement from the learners as well as the instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Often adventure education is linked to an incorporation of all five senses within the experiences which can heighten the opportunities for learning and retaining information. The learning experiences within adventure education programs are structured for a potential increase in human performance and capacity. Sometimes the adventure lies more in the journey than the destination.  The venture lies in the struggle, not in the prize.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C. Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of adventure ==
Merriam-Webster defines adventure as "an undertaking usually involving danger and unknown [[risks]]". Danger is defined as "exposure or liability to injury, pain, harm, or loss." Danger involves two factors which are perils – the origins of injury or the causes of loss, and [[hazards]] – the conditions that emphasize the chance of injury or loss.&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; Risk is defined as "potential loss or injury". Risk can be described as "real risk" or "perceived risk"&lt;ref&gt;Priest, S., &amp; Gass, M. A. (2005). Effective Leadership in Adventure Programming. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[bungee jumping]]; it seems as though there is a high level of risk, but with proper equipment it can be relatively safe. Danger, then is the exposure, or magnitude, of the harm a person may encounter; risk is the probability of that harm. These two variables are filtered through a person's perceptions, which may or may not be accurate.

Consequently, adventure is created through a person's perception of the magnitude of the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as [[adventure racing]] or [[slacklining]]) may be just as much of an adventure as an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport [[rock climbing]], [[skydiving]], or riding a [[roller coaster]]).

== Outcomes of adventure education programming ==
Adventure education has many positive outcomes. A meta-analysis of adventure education studies identified forty major outcomes, grouped into the following six categories: leadership, self-concept, academic, personality, interpersonal, and adventuresomeness.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., &amp; Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Adventure education often employs practical skills that will benefit an individual in areas beyond the activities in an adventure program. There are three theories of transfer in adventure education in which the participant may apply what they learned into future experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these theories is "specific transfer" – the learner applies the habits and skills learned during an experience to a new and similar experience (e.g. when an individual learns how to [[belay]] during a rock climbing experience and then applies that knowledge to [[Abseiling|rappelling]]). The second theory is "nonspecific transfer" – the learner establishes some common principles acquired through previous experiences and applies them in a new learning situation (e.g. when an individual develops trust through a trust building activity). The third theory is "metaphoric transfer" – the learner applies similar underlying principles to other areas and situations (e.g. when individuals utilize teamwork during an activity such as [[canoeing]] and later applies it to the workplace or other group experiences).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, J. C., Priest, S. (1999). Adventure Programming. State College, PA: Venture Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Program characteristics that contribute to program outcomes ==
There are six categories of program characteristics that contribute to achieving the program outcomes described above. These are the physical environment, activities, processing, the group, instructors, and the participant.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical environment ===
Unfamiliar environments contribute a great deal to program outcomes experienced by adventure education participants. Being in a new environment allows participants to gain new perspectives on familiar environments&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; and gives them the freedom to experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, R. O., &amp; Bacon, S. B. (1993). The wilderness challenge model. In M. A. Gass (Ed.), Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 11-41). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; An unfamiliar environment also creates some level of anxiety for the participant, as well as creating the perception of risk. Overcoming the challenges presented by unfamiliar environments through the mastery of specific tasks results in positive benefits to the individual, such as increased self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Nadler, R. S. (1993). Therapeutic process of change. In M. A. Gass (Ed.) Adventure therapy: Therapeutic applications of adventure programming (pp. 57-69). Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Positive outcomes are offered by several types of environments, including wilderness, non-wilderness (e.g. ropes-course), or a traditional classroom. However, wilderness is often considered as providing additional benefits to participants, thus being the optimal environmental setting for adventure education programs.&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J., Marsh, H., Neill, J. T., &amp; Richards, G. (1997). Adventure education and Outward Bound: Out-of class experiences that make a lasting difference. Review of Educational Research, 67(1), 43–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activities ===
Rather than activities themselves, it is the qualities of activities that are responsible for achieving program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of challenge, mastery, and success in activities is what led to participant growth. Challenges should be holistic in order to maximize positive outcomes. Programs should include mental, emotional, and physical challenges, and encourage concurrent mastery in all three domains.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges should also increase incrementally, so as not to overwhelm participants early on in the program but allow them to grow and develop throughout. Activities should be well organized and matched to suit the particular needs and requirements of the participants. The GRABBS model&lt;ref&gt;Schoel, J., Prouty, D., &amp; Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; (Goals, Readiness, Affect, Behavior, Body, and Stage of Development) is a good method for matching activities and participants. Success in the activities must be achievable. However, some failure may also be good for participant development.&lt;ref&gt;Witman, J. P. (1995). Characteristics of adventure programs valued by adolescents in treatment. Monograph on Youth in the 1990s, 4, 127-135.&lt;/ref&gt; Program participants can learn from their failures to achieve success. Goal-setting is critical to achieving program outcomes, at both the individual and group levels. It is also important to allow participants to have personal choice related to activities. The "challenge-by-choice" philosophy of adventure programming allows the participant to have some autonomy related to the activities s/he participates in.

While the qualities of activities are most important in achieving program outcomes, there are also specific activities that are well-suited to adventure programming.&lt;ref&gt;Schoel, J., Prouty, D., &amp; Radcliffe, P. (1988). Islands of healing: A guide to adventure based counseling. Hamilton, MA: Project Adventure, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; These include activities related to trust and empathy (e.g. trust falls), communication, decision-making and problem solving, social responsibility, and personal responsibility.

=== Processing ===
Processing is defined as "the sorting and ordering of information" that enables program participants to internalize meaning gained from an adventure education experience&lt;ref&gt;Luckner, J. L., &amp; Nadler, R. S. (1997). Processing the experience: Strategies to enhance and generalize learning. Dubuque, IA: Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Three models have been identified by which participants process meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, S. B. (1987). The evolution of the Outward Bound 
process. Greenwich, CT: Outward Bound.&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Mountains Speak for Themselves" model, participants are responsible for reflecting on their experiences on their own, without facilitation from the instructor. In the "Outward Bound Plus" model, the instructor serves as a counselor, facilitator, and discussion leader. In the metaphoric model, activities are consciously framed so that they become experiential metaphors that can be applied to challenges in participants' daily lives.

=== The group ===
Several characteristics of the group also contribute to achieving program outcomes. In terms of the size of the group, small groups of seven to fifteen individuals are usually more conducive to achieving desired outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, V. &amp; Golins, G. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School.&lt;/ref&gt; Reciprocity within the group is also important. This refers to group members learning to cooperate with one another and capitalize on the strengths of each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, D., &amp; Putnam, R. (1993). Personal growth through adventure. London, England: David Fulton Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomy of individuals and personal relationships are other aspects of the group that contribute to achievement.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instructors ===
Certain aspects of program instructors such as biographical characteristics, personality, and interpersonal interactions can have a large influence on participants' achievement of desired program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors may be required to have a Bachelors Degree in Outdoor Leadership to instruct at most Universities and community colleges. Instructors may also be required to hold certain certifications in Wilderness First Responder [https://www.nols.edu/en/coursefinder/courses/wilderness-first-responder-WFR/], American Mountain Guides Single Pitch [https://amga.com/single-pitch-instructor/ Instructor] and American Canoe Association Whitewater Instructor [https://www.americancanoe.org/page/Become_an_Instructor Certification], among many others.

=== The participant ===
The age, gender, background, and expectations of program participants have also been shown to be related to the achievement of program outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, M.D. (2000). How are adventure education program outcomes achieved?: A review of the literature. Australian Journal of Outdoor Education, 5(1), 19-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the program a student is in, the program may require the student to be autonomous during expeditionary courses. Student autonomy can be beneficial to students by enhancing personal growth, an increase in self-reliance, and enhancing the overall group experience. However, student autonomy  is considered to be controversial in regards to outdoor adventure educational programs, due to risk management concerns. Yet, it is recommended that the instructors of these types of programs must fully understand the risks of student autonomy prior to implementing them as part of an adventure education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobilya|first=Andrew|date=2012|title=Autonomous Student Experience: Are they too risky for Today's outdoor adventure Program?|url=|journal=SAGE|volume=|pages=353-357|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Adventure education programming can be implemented in several contexts, including therapy for youth at risk,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R. (2002). The effects of an adventure education program on perceptions of alienation and personal control among at-risk adolescents. Journal of Experiential Education, 25(1), 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt; survivors of sexual assault,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, S. (2003). The therapeutic effects of an adventure challenge program on the personal empowerment of women survivors of sexual trauma.

'''''Bait 3D''''' is an Australian-Singaporean 3D [[Horror film|horror]] [[disaster film]] directed by [[Kimble Rendall]] based on the screenplay by John Kim and [[Russell Mulcahy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2012-09-18|first=Bill|last=Gibron|title=The 10 Greatest Shark Films of All Time|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/163250-the-10-greatest-shark-films-of-all-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured [[Sharni Vinson]], [[Phoebe Tonkin]], [[Xavier Samuel]], [[Julian McMahon]], [[Cariba Heine]], [[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]], [[Lincoln Lewis]], Alice Parkinson, and [[Dan Wyllie]]. The film was released on 20 September 2012 in Australia.

==Plot==
The movie opens with a hungover lifeguard, Josh ([[Xavier Samuel]]) being woken up by friend and fellow lifeguard Rory ([[Richard Brancatisano]]). Rory tells Josh that he shouldn't have proposed to his sister, Tina ([[Sharni Vinson]]) then offers to set a buoy for Josh. Josh visits Tina, who discusses their upcoming move to Singapore. As Rory boards into the ocean to set a buoy, a shark appears and kills a man in the water. Alerted to the danger, Josh quickly takes a jet ski and goes to get Rory, but is too late. As Rory is pulled into the water, and Josh is unable to save him before he is devoured.

A year later, Josh now works for a supermarket. While stocking shelves with Naomi (Alice Parkinson) he sees Tina with her new boyfriend Steven ([[Qi Yuwu]]) returned from Singapore. At the same time two teenagers, Kyle ([[Lincoln Lewis]]) and Heather ([[Cariba Heine]]) are parked for a make-out session, accompanied by Heather's dog, Bully. In the supermarket a young girl, Jaime ([[Phoebe Tonkin]]) is caught shoplifting, and temporarily evades the security guard by meeting up with her boyfriend Ryan ([[Alex Russell (actor)|Alex Russell]]) who also works at the store. The store manager, Jessup ([[Adrian Pang]]) catches up with her, fires Ryan, and calls the police. The arresting officer, Todd ([[Martin Sacks]]) arrives, and is revealed to be Jaime's dad. After this, Jessup is held at gun point by a robber, Doyle ([[Julian McMahon]]). The tense situation eventually escalates, and Doyle's partner appears and shoots assistant manager Julie (Rhiannon Dannielle Pettett).

At the height of the commotion, a tsunami wave descends on the city and floods the supermarket. Doyle's partner is killed by the flood, and the survivors injured, forcing them to take shelter on top of the shelving units in the store. As the survivors try to find a way out the security guard is dragged under water. It becomes apparent that a [[Great white shark|great white shark]] has been washed into the store by the tsunami. Additionally, a broken wire threatens to electrocute them all. Steven volunteers to shut off the power, and the others dress him in crude armor made of shopping carts and shelves to protect him from the shark. He succeeds but loses his oxygen tube and drowns. Despite their previous conflicts, the survivors work together to get Jessup into a ventilation shaft to go for help. A flood of crabs slides out of the vent, startling Jessup and causing him to fall back, however, he manages to grab hold of the vent. Unfortunately, the shark jumps out of the water and eats Jessup.

In the parking garage, Kyle, Heather, and Ryan have been cut off from the others, surviving the flooding of the car park as their cars were sealed when the water hit and they thus escaped the initial water damage. Ryan helps the couple escape from their drowned car, but a second great white shark is revealed. Kyle ditches the dog, Bully at the last second and they manage to get to temporary safety. After several unsuccessful attempts at luring the shark away, Ryan decides to join them on top of his flipped van, but the shark gives chase. Ryan successfully gets onto the flipped van but Kyle falls and is devoured.

Inside the supermarket, the remaining group make a plan to catch their shark so they can swim to safety. Jaime manages to swim to the butcher section and grab a hook with meat to use as bait. The shark does not go for the bait, so fellow survivor, Kirby ([[Dan Wyllie]]) grabs a hook and puts it through Naomi's shirt, using her as bait. Kirby is revealed to be Doyle's partner, who changed out of his clothes and mask so the others wouldn't know he was the murderer. Doyle stabs Kirby with a makeshift harpoon, and throws him into the water with the hook. Naomi is pulled from the water as the shark devours Kirby, catching its jaw on the hook and ensnaring itself in the trap. Josh apologizes to Tina, feeling guilt over her brother's death, but Tina reassures him and kisses him.

Below, Bully is found alive. Heather's newfound hope inspires Ryan to start banging on the pipes, calling for help. Jaime hears Ryan' call and with Josh goes to rescue him. Below, they are alerted to the second shark's presence. Josh and Jaime find her dad's car, in which are a shotgun and taser. Josh kills the shark with the shotgun, and the four of them get back into the supermarket. A tremor strikes as they are all swimming to the entrance, breaking the first shark loose. Josh kills the shark with the taser as Doyle wires a truck jammed in the entrance to explode, breaking a hole in the debris and freeing them. The survivors leave the supermarket, reaching the severely damaged city, and Tina asks Josh what to do now. At sea, a seagull swoops low over the water, and a shark jumps out and devours it.

==Production==
Initially, Russel Mulcahy was going to direct the film; however, his involvement with the television series ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'' made this impractical, and so he hired Kimble Rendall to direct instead.&lt;ref name="Dread"&gt;{{cite|title=Exclusive: Director Kimble Rendall Talks Sharks in a Supermarket for Bait 3D, Blowback and More|website=Dread Central}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began shooting on 29 November 2011.&lt;ref name="fba-review" /&gt; Three [[animatronic]] sharks were used for filming.&lt;ref name="Dread"/&gt; Although Rendall wanted to entirely avoid using [[computer-generated imagery]], the budget negated that some scenes required its use.&lt;ref name="Dread"/&gt;

==Release==
''Bait'' had its premiere at the [[Venice Film Festival]] where it was shown out of competition on 1 September 2012. The film was released theatrically on 20 September 2012 Australia and on 29 November 2012 in Singapore.&lt;ref name="fba-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/bait |title=Bait |work=Film Business Asia |accessdate=1 October 2012 |date=20 September 2012 |author=Elley, Derek |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519021527/http://www.filmbiz.asia/reviews/bait |archivedate=19 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released on DVD in Australia on 16 January 2013 without the "3D" subtitle as ''Bait''; it was only released in 3D on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]].

==Reception==
The film received a 47% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 32 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/771311373/|title=Bait - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Pomeranz]] rated the film 3.5/5 stars and said it would appeal to a specific genre audience, while [[David Stratton]] rated it 2.5/5 stars and criticized the film for not investing the audience in its characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/txt/s3589652.htm|title=Bait|last1=Pomeranz|first1=Margaret|last2=Stratton|first2=David|work=[[At the Movies (Australian TV series)|At the Movies]]|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Jake Wilson of ''[[The Age]]'', saw it as a film that is somewhat enjoyable on the basis of being an "awful" film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/bait-not-quite-dead-in-the-water-20120919-266q2.html|title=Bait not quite dead in the water|last=Wilson|first=Jake|work=[[The Age]]|date=20 September 2012|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
Production of a sequel called ''Deep Water'', about a plane en route from China to Australia crashing in the [[Pacific Ocean]], was suspended in March 2014 due to "uncomfortable similarities" to the disappearance of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/film-deep-water-about-a-china-plane-crash-shelved-due-to-missing-malaysia-airlines-flight-mh370/story-fnk850z8-1226864059632|title=Film Deep Water about a China plane crash shelved due to missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 |publisher=AAP/News Corp Australia|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/aussie-flight-disaster-film-deep-690546|title=Aussie Flight Disaster Film 'Deep Water' Shelved Over Eerie Resemblance to Missing Malaysia Flight|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battlezone II: Combat Commander''''', often abbreviated to ''BZ2'', is a 1999 [[Video game|computer game]] released by [[Pandemic Studios]] as a sequel to [[Activision]]'s 1998 ''[[Battlezone (1998 video game)|Battlezone]]''. Like Activision's ''Battlezone'', ''Battlezone II'' is a hybrid tank shooter, [[first-person shooter]]&amp;nbsp;(FPS) and [[real-time strategy]]&amp;nbsp;(RTS) game. The player pilots various futuristic vehicles, while using the [[function key]]s to select and command units and structures. ''Battlezone II'' features two races, the ISDF (humans) and the Scions. A remastered version was released in March 2018 under the title ''Battlezone: Combat Commander'' on the gaming platforms [[GOG.com|GOG]] and [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/01/battlezone-combat-commander-review-oil-vinegar-together-7353099/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pcgamer.com/rebellion-unveils-battlezone-combat-commandera-remaster-of-battlezone-2/&lt;/ref&gt;


== Plot ==
''Battlezone II'' is set in the same [[Alternate history|alternative history universe]] as ''Battlezone''. Its plot takes place in 1990s about 30 years after the original story of Battlezone and features an [[alien invasion]] theme. [[United States|America]]'s NSDF (National Space Defense Force) and the [[Soviet Union]]'s CCA (Cosmos Colonist Army), the foes of the [[Cold War]] conflict, were forced to work together in order to combat their common enemy, the Furies. Access to alien technology has necessitated the creation of an international peacekeeping force, the International Space Defense Force (ISDF), whose role is to oversee distribution of the rare ''bio-metal'' resource and mediate disputes between member nations. To prevent the future misuse of bio-metal, the AAN (Alliance of Awakened Nations) is created to oversee the even distribution of the resource between the countries.

After several years, General Armand Braddock, former commander of the NSDF's elite Black Dog Squadron, secretly builds a base on [[Pluto]] from diverted resources without the knowledge of the AAN, and begins what he dubs 'Project Pedigree'. By fusing human test subjects (the former members of the Black Dogs) with biometal, Braddock is able to create a highly advanced force of powerful and intelligent combatants. However, tired of Braddock's deceit and enraged by what he has done to them, the subjects mount a [[rebellion]] and flee into space. Unable to pursue without arousing suspicion, Braddock is forced to monitor the edge of the [[Solar System]], where they also discover a new celestial body, dubbed the "Dark Planet" because of its hidden nature, and even build a small facility there as well. Shortly after the loss of the Voyager-2 probe to a missile attack, contact with Cerberus Base on Pluto was lost.

A whole fleet of ISDF troops was dispatched to find out what happened, including Lieutenant John Cooke, whom Battlezone II's storyline revolves around.

===Alternate endings===
''Battlezone II'' has two alternate endings available to the player:
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite video game
 |title=Battlezone II: Combat Commander
 |developer= [[Pandemic Studios]]
 |publisher=[[Activision]]
 |date=1999
 |platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]
 |version=1.0
 |level=Fanning the Fire
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ISDF alternate ending ====
John obeys his superior's command and destroys the Scion craft. Braddock informs him that Manson and his men survived, but they refused to obey, saying that Braddock is a traitor to the AAN. Cooke inserts a small team under his lead and destroys the base. Manson's body is found at the outskirts of the base. They also find out that Burns has escaped.

Following Scion transmissions, they locate the heart of the Scion society, a medium-sized planet called the "Core" planet, which is presumed to be artificial. After establishing an outpost, Cooke follows a convoy to a hole in the crust, leading to the planet's interior. He descends, and after dispatching numerous automated defenses, destroys the central crystal, causing the planet to collapse and detonate.

==== Scion alternate ending ====
Instead of shooting the Scion as commanded by Braddock, Cooke orders the Tug carrying Burns to follow the Scion. After leading him through an underground tunnel, the Scion confirms that she is Shabayev. She was found by the Scions on Bane after the crash. She explains that Braddock ordered the attack on the drop ships to silence them. He had also ordered the Voyager to be shot down to prevent the AAN from detecting the ISDF base on the Dark Planet. She also reveals to John that the Scions are actually humans who have been fused together with bio-metal. At the core of the Collective are the former members of the Black Dog Squadron. After the uprising, they fled to the Dark Planet, then into the Scion system, where they found the Cthonian ruins on Mire and embraced their culture. Their ultimate goal is not to destroy Earth, but to bring the enlightened Cthonian culture back to humanity.

John is transformed into a Scion to better aid their cause. He is informed by Burns that the three machines that were disarmed were called alchemators, and that they did not destroy planets but rather [[Terraforming|terraform]]ers. The Core Planet is dying, as evidenced by a large number of dead Scions found on Pluto and Dark Planet before. The Scion can only survive if they find a new planet, and the Dark Planet is the ideal candidate.

A routine patrol manages to steal one of the power crystals of the three machines. Shabayev asks John to escort the Hauler towing the power crystal to a nav point where it can be carried away by a Scion dropship. When the convoy arrives at the passage, a landslide occurs, causing them to have to reroute the Hauler. Cooke investigates the other side and sees a departing Scion vehicle. After the incident, Burns requests that John find and return the last two crystals. The second crystal is stolen from a base with a clever tactic: John lures the defenders into an ambush, then shuts down the defenses with a surgical artillery strike on the power generators. When the third crystal is acquired, each is sent to their respective alchemators. However, when he brings the final crystal to Rend, his team is ambushed by a much larger force of rebels who capture the crystal.

Burns receives information that Manson's AAN loyalists (including himself) have defied Braddock and are under siege from his New Regime troops. After breaking the siege, Cooke counterattacks with Manson's forces, destroying the NR base and even intercepting a rebel convoy carrying the crystal which they are willing to trade with Braddock for bio-metal.

With the last crystal in his possession, Cooke lands on Rend for a final payback. Braddock personally defends the alchemator with a trio of Attila Combat Walkers, but he is ultimately defeated and the crystal is placed. The three alchemators are then activated, and their combined beam is shot through a wormhole into the Solar System. The beam impacts into the Dark Planet, gradually transforming it into a new Core Planet at Earth's doorstep.

==Gameplay==
[[Pandemic Studios]] continued and expanded the concept of a [[real-time strategy|RTS]] and [[first-person shooter|FPS]] hybrid where the player drives the vehicle in the game, but using a mixture of the [[reticle]] and the space bar, selects units and buildings to build and orders units around the battle field. The F keys at the top of the keyboard were used to create groups of units for easy selection of the units presently on the battlefield when they were not in the range of the player to select via the spacebar.

''Battlezone II'' was not very popular, likely due to Pandemic Studio's attempts to blend two genres together; both styles of player had trouble adapting to an unfamiliar genre. Programmer Ken Miller said, "''BZ2'' was meant to do that [appeal to both genres] at first, but headed in the opposite direction. The problem is that mixed-genre games only attract players that like both genres (the intersection) as opposed to either genre (the union). It mainly comes down to learning curve. Action/shooter gamers can pick up just about any action/shooter game on the market and play it in short order, as almost all of them use the same control scheme and feature similar gameplay conventions. Similarly, strategy gamers can pick up just about any strategy game on the market and play it, although strategy games tend to differ from each other more than action games. Confronting an action/shooter gamer with strategy or a strategy player with action tends to force them outside their genre "comfort zone" and requires a steeper learning curve. My pithiest, if somewhat unfair, summation is this: 'FPS players don't want to think; RTS players don't want to die.'"&lt;ref name="bzissue1"&gt;''Battlezone Magazine'' Issue #1, p. 4 ([http://www.jtworld.net/bzmag/bzissue1.pdf online copy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321020736/http://www.jtworld.net/bzmag/bzissue1.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
When ''Battlezone II'' was released to the public in January 2000 the game was met with a lot of enthusiasm, but it quickly began receiving negative views because of out-of-the-box bug issues and over the top requirements to run the game for its time. With a multiplayer that was broken and not fixed until patch 1.1 the game received a lot of negative publicity while it was on the shelf.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Fehrenbacher [http://www.gamesfirst.com/reviews/rick/Battlezone2/bz2.htm ''Battlezone II by Activision''] – review at gamesfirst.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Nathan Mates, a programmer that worked on ''Battlezone II'', attempted to explain why after the first game, ''BZ2'' did not fare well on the market, in an interview with the Battlezone Magazine. "Despite things not being a huge success at retail, there's a definite, but smaller, portion of the population that likes the FPS+RTS genre. Their options are somewhat limited. So they stick with what they know and love. As I said above [about why Battlezone III was never made], this tenaciousness can really backfire and hurt things – if the ''BZ1'' fans hadn't bashed ''BZ2'' for so long, then there might have been more people exposed to ''BZ2''. I see this with different ''BZ2'' versions – there's an extreme amount of anger directed at anything that changes."&lt;ref&gt;''Battlezone Magazine'' Volume 1 Issue No. 4, p. 3 ([http://www.jtworld.net/bzmag/bzissue4.pdf online copy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321020640/http://www.jtworld.net/bzmag/bzissue4.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modifications ==

''Battlezone II'' was one of the first few games to begin supporting modifications and was greatly expanded on the release of the [[unofficial patch]] 1.3 by Nathan Mates and Ken Miller, two employees of Pandemic Studio who had continued developing the game on their own time. Carey Chico, Art Director on Battlezone II said, "Well, the goal of all our effort was to provide for a strong mod community to keep the game going. Seems like it's working."&lt;ref&gt;''Battlezone Magazine'' Volume 1 Issue#5, p. 3 ([http://www.jtworld.net/bzmag/bzissue5.pdf online copy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321020658/http://www.jtworld.net/bzmag/bzissue5.pdf |date=21 March 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/09/08/battlezone-ii-its-alive-er-still/ battlezone-ii-its-alive-er-still] on [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] (2009/09/08)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Battlezone II'' was designed to be able to support player [[mod (computer gaming)|mod]]ifications and featured an in-game mapping tool. Existing vehicles can be modified and new vehicles can be created. Weapons, buildings and missions can also be edited.

[[File:Ground cinnamon.jpg|thumb|275px|The cinnamon challenge involves consuming one spoonful of powdered cinnamon.]]

The '''cinnamon challenge''' was a viral internet [[food challenge]]. The objective of the challenge is to film oneself eating a spoonful of ground [[cinnamon]] in under 60 seconds without drinking anything,&lt;ref name="Healy" /&gt; then upload the video to the Internet.&lt;ref name="Joplin"&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Dr. Food Science’ mixes bananas and Sprite, conducts other questionable food experiments |work=[[The Joplin Globe]] |first=Dustin |last=Shipman |date=April 29, 2008 |url=http://www.joplinglobe.com/food/local_story_120162143.html/resources_printstory |accessdate=October 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121216091812/http://www.joplinglobe.com/food/local_story_120162143.html/resources_printstory |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkup/2010/04/swallowing_cinnamon.html | title=Swallowing cinnamon by the spoonful | publisher= [[The Washington Post]] | date=April 5, 2010 | accessdate=January 8, 2012 | author=Huget, Jennifer LaRue}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sports Illustrated"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/matthew_waxman/08/25/daily.blog/ | title=Milking the situation: To support Florida batboy, I try other food challenges | publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]] | date=August 25, 2005 | accessdate=January 8, 2012 | author=Waxman, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is difficult and carries substantial health risks because the cinnamon coats and dries the mouth and throat, resulting in coughing, gagging, vomiting and inhaling of cinnamon, leading to throat irritation, breathing difficulties, and risk of [[pneumonia]]&lt;ref name="Healy"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/28/news/la-heb-teen-cinnamon-challenge-20120328 | title = Teens' 'cinnamon challenge': Dangerous, not innocent | accessdate = March 28, 2013 | last = Healy | first = Melissa | date = March 28, 2012 | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Pneumothorax|collapsed lung]].&lt;ref name="cbsnews" /&gt;

The challenge has been described online since 2001, and increased in popularity in 2007, peaking abruptly in January 2014 and falling off almost as sharply through the first half of that year, then tapering off almost to its previous level by 2014.&lt;ref name=GoogleInsights&gt;[https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Cinnamon%20challenge Google Insights for Search - Web Search Interest: "cinnamon challenge" - Worldwide, 204 - present], ''[[Google Insights for Search]]'', accessed July 26, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=February 2014}} By 2010, many people had posted videos of themselves attempting this challenge on [[YouTube]] and other social networking websites.&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; The cinnamon challenge continues to be active,&lt;ref name="NBC4 Washington"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nbcwashington.com/blogs/capital-games/Nick--JaVale-Do-The-Cinnamon-Challenge-134009978.html | title=Nick &amp; JaVale's Cinnamon Challenge | publisher= NBC Washington 4 | date=November 17, 2011 | accessdate=January 9, 2012 | author=Kogod, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Twitter]] mentions peaking at nearly 70,000 per day in January 2012.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; It is similar to the [[saltine cracker challenge]], which involves ingesting at least six [[saltine crackers]] &amp;ndash; also known as soda crackers &amp;ndash; within 60 seconds without drinking anything,&lt;ref name="Joplin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sports Illustrated"/&gt; the [[Gallon challenge]], and the [[Banana Sprite challenge]].

==Health dangers==
The stunt can be dangerous, as there is a risk of [[Gag reflex|gagging]] on the cinnamon, especially if it forms a clump and clogs one's [[airway]]s. Accidental inhalation of cinnamon can seriously damage the lungs&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"/&gt; by causing [[inflammation]] and leading to infection.&lt;ref name="Painter"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Painter | first = Kim | title = Cinnamon challenge: | url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/healthyperspective/post/2012-03-19/cinnamon-challenge-viral-videos-with-health-risks/651200/1 | accessdate = March 19, 2012 | publisher = [[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual result of this stunt is "a coughing, gagging fit involving clouds of cinnamon" which "leaves some people gasping for air".&lt;ref name="Painter" /&gt; Sometimes those performing the stunt may gag, choke or cough and accidentally exhale the cinnamon through their noses, coating their skin and mucous membranes in cinnamon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Vohora | first=D. | last2=Vohora | first2=S.B. | title=Safety Concerns for Herbal Drugs | publisher=CRC Press | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-4822-5662-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY_wCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79 | access-date=May 29, 2017 | page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; As cinnamon is rich in the compound [[cinnamaldehyde]], the challenge often results in considerable irritation, discomfort, burning, or itching of the affected nasal tissue and nostrils.

[[File:Cinnamon Challenge At School 2 - excerpt.webm|thumb|An excerpt from a cinnamon challenge video]]
Many people upload their cinnamon challenge to YouTube. Comedian [[Colleen Ballinger]] told ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that she took the challenge in character as [[Miranda Sings]], in 2012, to increase her YouTube traffic after hundreds of her fans had asked her to take the challenge. Her video received more than 2 million views, even though it is on a discontinued YouTube channel.&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;Keates, Nancy. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304537904577279663808279888 "Just a Spoonful of Cinnamon Makes the Internet Rounds"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', March 14, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballinger, Colleen.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyk7utV_D2I "The Cinnamon Challenge ... by GloZell and her Big Behind Earrings"], [[YouTube]], January 30, 2012, accessed May 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2012/03/19/youtube-viewers-flock-to-watch-quinn-take-cinnamon-challenge/ |title=YouTube Viewers Flock to Watch Quinn Take 'Cinnamon Challenge' |publisher=CBS Chicago |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A large group attempt at the cinnamon challenge was held in 2012  at [[RMIT University]] in Australia and involved 64 participants in quick succession.&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZuaUhHukjc |title=RMIT Cinnamon Challenge |publisher=YouTube |year=2012 |accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2012 episode of the [[Discovery Channel]] series ''[[MythBusters]]'', each member of the Build Team attempted the challenge. [[Kari Byron]] and [[Grant Imahara]] failed, while [[Tory Belleci]] completed it by tucking his spoonful into his cheek and letting [[saliva]] accumulate in his mouth until he could swallow. However, it took him more than 60 seconds to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXkGtJUP0WE "Mythbusters Cinnamon Challenge"], [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 episode of ''[[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Chicago Fire]]'' titled "[[List of Chicago Fire episodes#Season 2 .282013.E2.80.9314.29|Defcon 1]]", a cinnamon challenge is held to determine who will get to live in [[Chicago Fire (TV series)#Main|Severide]]'s new apartment. The challenge is abandoned, and the team is reprimanded by the chief. In 2015, [[Freddie Flintoff]] took the challenge on ''A League of Their Own'' (S9 ep1), and ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' actor [[Matthew Gray Gubler]] was recorded taking the challenge unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1nkXvBAlo0 "matthew gray gubler calmly eats a spoonful of cinnamon"], [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is also featured on Fox's ''[[Family Guy]]''{{'}}s 14th-season opener, "[[Pilling Them Softly]]", in which [[Peter Griffin]] makes numerous attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Guy Season 14 Episode 1 Review: Pilling Them Softly|url=https://www.tvfanatic.com/2015/09/family-guy-season-14-episode-1-review-pilling-them-softly/|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=TV Fanatic|date=28 September 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1968">'''Claudine Mercier''' (born November 3, 1961) is a [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]]e comedian, singer, actress and impressionist.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Claudine Mercier.jpg|frame|Claudine Mercier]] --&gt;

Mercier began her performing career in the early-80's singing with the a cappella vocal group Artishows for several years, and with Canadian singer [[Norman Iceberg]]. After graduating from the [[Université du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM)]] (Drama Major) in 1989, she went on to become one of [[Quebec]]'s most prominent comedians.

In 1993, she gained widespread recognition in Quebec with her first One Woman Show. Best known for duplicating celebrities such as [[Ireland|Irish]] singer [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and Quebec businesswoman Lise Watier, she also eventually won critical acclaim in [[Europe]]. She has received numerous nominations and awards, including one [[Felix Award|Felix]] in 1998, and three Olivier in 1999 for her second One Woman Show.

In 2003, Mercier's third One Woman Show included new impressions, and was well attended.

In 2005, Claudine Mercier made her film debut, playing four different characters in the popular ''[[Idole Instantanée]]'' - directed by Yves Desgagnés, and produced by [[Denise Robert]].

The '''Drama-Logue Award''' was an American [[Theatre|theater]] award established in 1977, given by the publishers of [[Backstage (magazine)#Drama-Logue|Drama-Logue]] newspaper, a weekly west-coast theater [[Trade journal|trade publication]].&lt;ref name="LATimes_24May1998_Theater_DemiseofDrama-Logue"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/may/24/entertainment/ca-52984|title=Assessing the Demise of Drama-Logue - Los Angeles Times|last=Shirley|first=Don|date=24 May 1998|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winners were selected by the publication's theater critics, and would receive a certificate at an annual awards ceremony.  The award categories included [[Theatrical producer|Production]], [[Theatre director|Direction]], [[Music director|Musical Direction]], [[Choreography]], [[Playwright|Writing]], [[Actor|Performance]], [[Ensemble cast|Ensemble Performance]], [[Scenic Design]], [[Sound Design]], [[Lighting Design]], [[Costume Design]] and [[Cosmetology|Hair &amp; Makeup Design]].

However, whereas most Sigilverse titles were set in the far future, ''El Cazador'' took place on Earth during the [[Golden Age of Piracy]] of the 17th century. It contains none of the magical, science-fiction, or fantastical elements of the other Sigilverse titles.

''El Cazador'' began in [[2003 in comics|2003]] and ran for six issues before CrossGen's [[bankruptcy]] brought the series to a halt. The company also published a prequel [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], ''El Cazador: The Bloody Ballad of Blackjack Tom'', which revealed the history of the title's main villain. ''El Cazador'' was one of the few [[pirate]]-themed comic book series in the Modern Age of comic books, and perhaps the only recent [[ongoing series]] of the [[genre]] to feature a female lead. ''El Cazador'' was written by [[Chuck Dixon]] and pencilled by [[Steve Epting]].

==Plot and characters==
In the opening issue, the ship carrying Spanish noblewoman Donessa Cinzia Elena Marie Esperanza Diego-Luis Hidalgo and others of her family are attacked by a pirate captain named Blackjack Tom. The Donessa is one of the few survivors of the attack. She swears to hunt down Tom and rescue his prisoners. To accomplish this, she renames her ship El Cazador ("The Hunter") and becomes a pirate herself, dubbed "Lady Sin" by her crew. The remaining issues of the series detail the beginnings of Lady Sin's quest as she forsakes her privileged past for life on the high seas.

'''Emma Harris''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Эммы Ричардовна Харрис Мизикина), 9 October 1871 in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] — After 1940 in [[New York City|New York]]) was an [[United States|American]]-born Russian and Soviet actress, singer, dancer, cabaret artist and writer.

==Early life==
Emma Elizabeth Matthews was born on October 9, 1871 on (or near) the John Phinizy Plantation in Richmond County, Georgia, near the city of Augusta to former slaves, Sarah Green and Richard Matthews. In summer 1880, upon finishing fourth grade at Ware High School, Emma was sent to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] to live with her widowed Aunt Hattie to continue her studies and later attend the Negro Mission College (which opened 1883). But after a few years, her Aunt suddenly died, leaving the young Emma stranded in Virginia with no place to go.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3wRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA245&amp;dq=Emma+Harris+russia+opportunity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIh_aXxNXXAhUG44MKHaPcBBkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Emma%20Harris%20russia%20opportunity&amp;f=false I.D.W. Talmadge. Journal of Negro Life]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career (1896–1900)===
Instead of returning home, Emma caught the next train north, enrolling herself into the [[Boston]] Musical Conservatory and finding work as a chambermaid to support herself. Early 1896, [[Sissieretta Jones]] arrived in Boston to organize her Black Patti Troubadours, a vaudeville revue featuring Negro operatic singers, dancers and blackface comedians. After opening in Pittsfield, the show traveled to New York City in October.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3wRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA245&amp;dq=Emma+Harris+russia+opportunity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIh_aXxNXXAhUG44MKHaPcBBkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Emma%20Harris%20russia%20opportunity&amp;f=false I.D.W. Talmadge. Journal of Negro Life]&lt;/ref&gt; That winter, while performing in Brooklyn, Emma met and married local janitor, Joseph B. Harris. They settled into a small apartment, where they hoped to start a family. She also assisted in bringing several of her relatives up from the South. After the sudden death of their only child, Emma began focusing on her singing career. Due to her staunchly religious parents' disapproval of her career as an entertainer, Emma quit the Black Troubadours and began singing in the Trinity Baptist Church Choir for nearly five years. However, In 1900 she rejoined the entertainment world by joining Theodore Drury's Opera Company.

===European career (1901–1913)===
In spring 1901, German Impresario, Paula Kohn-Wöllner, approached Emma (and seven other women) to organize a Negro revue Louisiana Amazon Guards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pannonjazz.hu/article.php?condition=hot&amp;id=96&amp;index=0&amp;search=1 Simon Géza Gábor. The Pre-History of Jazz In Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt; In early May, the show arrived in Germany and rehearsed and opened in [[Leipzig]] before touring across Germany that summer. That fall, the four-act revue began its European tour, traveling across [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]] &amp; [[Sweden]]. The show reorganized late-1902, after firing Mrs Kohn-Wollner, the revue relocated to Berlin and continued touring Germany until July 1903, when Mrs. Kohn-Wöllner was rehired and launched the girls on a British tour before opening in [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]] early March.

Unfortunately as the troupe immediately dissolved upon arrival, Emma and fellow members, Coretté Alefred and/or Fannie Smith formed the Koretty Kreol duo and opened at the Aquarium Gardens. Shortly afterwards (now as a trio), the women opened in [[Helsinki]]'s Hotell Fennia before traveling south to appear in [[Moscow]]'s Aumont Theater, run by the manipulative French director, Charles Aumont. During these first weeks in Russia, Emma learned her lonely husband died back in Brooklyn.

On January 22, 1905, while the women were appearing in St. Petersburg and attending a party hosted by William Caton (popular American jockey), the women witnessed the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]] riots outside the Tsar's palace and across the city. The trio quickly returned to Moscow that night and performed at the Aumont Theatre until Emma quit the trio sometime in February.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pannonjazz.hu/article.php?condition=hot&amp;id=96&amp;index=0&amp;search=1 Simon Géza Gábor. The Pre-History of Jazz In Hungary]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month in Helsinki, now as a solo artist, Emma opened successfully at the Princess Restaurant with her singing and classical dances. After her Finnish appearances, she began an extended [[Siberian]] concert tour. While performing in [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Vyatka]], Emma met a handsome, English speaking scientist and museum curator named Baranov.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3wRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA245&amp;dq=Emma+Harris+russia+opportunity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIh_aXxNXXAhUG44MKHaPcBBkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Emma%20Harris%20russia%20opportunity&amp;f=false I.D.W. Talmadge. Journal of Negro Life]&lt;/ref&gt; The two quickly became lovers, and Emma joined his Central Russian lecture tour, as he promised they would travel to America together the following year. As they toured the major cities along the [[Volga river]], Baranov held his lectures while Emma would perform. Trains hardly reached many parts of Russia during that period, so much of the journey was using 'troikas' and were often followed by hungry wolves. But soon Emma realized he was a charlatan. Baranov presented her as his singing African savage, manipulating and stealing her money after the show. Arriving in [[Kazan]], Emma escaped, but Baranov reported her to the authorities as a Japanese spy. Emma was thrown in jail until an intervention from the US Consulate in Moscow. Returning to Moscow to meet the Consul Samuel Smith, he was shocked to discover she was a Negro. Realizing she couldn't count on America for further help, Emma decided to remain in Russia. 
Towards the end of the year, Emma ran into an old friend, Baltimore businessman, Harry Leans who was visiting Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3wRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA245&amp;dq=Emma+Harris+russia+opportunity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIh_aXxNXXAhUG44MKHaPcBBkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Emma%20Harris%20russia%20opportunity&amp;f=false I.D.W. Talmadge. Journal of Negro Life]&lt;/ref&gt; He offered to fund her first solo tour across Europe. From late 1905-1917, Emma (as Oriedo Galima: the Black Nightingale) toured the Russian Empire, [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and [[Egypt]] singing in Russian, German &amp; French and performing Algerian belly dances in numerous theaters and cabarets. Briefly around 1908, Emma joined Afro-American comedian Edgar H. Jones on one of his many Russian tours.

In 1911, while touring through the [[Caucasus mountains]], Emma met Russian theater and film director, Alexander Ivanovitch Mizikin who became her business manager. Sometime in 1912-13, the couple married and established a residence in [[Kharkiv]] (becoming Emma Richardsovna Mizikina). Alex opened a string of cinemas across the [[Ukraine]] (such as the Zerkalo Zhizni Cinema) which featured Russian and American films. Meanwhile, Emma continued her concert tours throughout Russia.

===World War I and the Russian Revolution (1914–1925)===
Upon the outbreak of World War I, the couple relocated to Moscow and purchased a 15-room house (12 Kozikhinskiy Ln) in the central part of the city and hired six servants and a personal chauffeur. To supplement extra income as her concert tours had come to a halt, Emma became the madam of an exclusive brothel run out of her home, which served wealthy and aristocratic clientele. In spring 1915, while her husband fought on the front lines, Emma shifted from performing to acting. At the G.I. Libken Studios in [[Yaroslavl]]. Emma appeared onscreen in an interesting attempt on Russian soil an American adventure film ''Satan's Woman'' (Zhenshchina Satana), about life within the circus and musichall. Directed by Sigismund Veselovsky and produced through the 'Alians' Film Office {F. Parkhomenko}, the film was released on May 14, 1915. Eventually the film was lost (or censured) after the Bolshevik Revolution. The film however perhaps made Emma the first major black silent film actress in Imperial Russian cinema. Several months later, she appeared in the comedy film ''Legs Up!'' (Nogi Vverkh) produced through the 'Kinolent' Film Office.

Early 1917, Emma joined the [[Red Cross]], working as a nurse on armored train no.1045 aiding the [[Red Army]] across the Ukraine. After the February Land Act was enacted early 1918, Emma moved to a large house (4 Kalanchevskaya Ln) in Moscow's Red Gate district which she turned into a boarding house for visiting American journalists and diplomats, whom she threw large dinners and was kindly referred to by as the 'Mammy of Moscow'. Sometime in March 1918, during a massive rally, Emma was pushed to the front and introduced to [[Vladimir Lenin]], who believed blacks represented the "ideal Communist". Shortly afterwards, she was given a government position in the Commissariat of the People's Education, teaching English to government officials in the city of [[Simbirsk]] near the Russian front lines on the Siberian Front. In September 1919, the [[Cheka]] raided her boarding house, and arrested Emma under suspicion of hiding [[White Army]] soldiers. After a few days in [[Lubyanka Prison]], she was released as the government refused to execute a Negro woman.

In 1920, with her husband now apart of a Soviet film Company, Emma returned to acting appearing in well-received propaganda filled films (which Emma later admitted was really poorly produced). As the Great Famine ravaged central Russia in 1921, Emma joined Col. William Haskell's [[American Relief Administration]] aiding the starving population until the end of the famine during the summer of 1923.

===Soviet worker (1926–1933)===
After divorcing Alexander in 1926, Emma retired from the stage, shared a two-room apartment with one of her former prostitutes and joined the workforce as an interpreter for Proletarsky Trud Silk Mill until 1929 when she became one of the lead speakers for the [[International Red Aid]] (MOPR), she traveled Russia giving fiery speeches protesting against racism, singing Spirituals and writing poems for Soviet newspapers.

In June 1932, Emma was among those who welcomed 21 African Americans (among those was [[Langston Hughes]]) who had come to organize and appear in the political anti-racism film ''Black &amp; White'' with the Meschrabpom Film company. Emma was also asked to be a part of the film, due to her acting experience in Russian cinema. During the productions, she gave several powerful speeches at the Park of Rest &amp; Culture in fluent Russian protesting the [[Scottsboro boys]] trials&lt;ref&gt;[https://nkaa.uky.edu/nkaa/items/show/1930 NKAA, Notable Kentucky African Americans Database]&lt;/ref&gt; in the American South. However, the film never materialized and Emma was given a job with the Moscow Torgsin Store.

In early 1933, she became chief correspondent for the Stankoimport State Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k3wRAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA245&amp;dq=Emma+Harris+russia+opportunity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIh_aXxNXXAhUG44MKHaPcBBkQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Emma%20Harris%20russia%20opportunity&amp;f=false I.D.W. Talmadge. Journal of Negro Life]&lt;/ref&gt; That August, after an interview mentioning a wish to visit the US, took a trip to [[Latvia]] to receive an American passport then caught the caught the next ship from [[Hamburg]], back to New York after 32 years living abroad.

===Later life===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}Harris spoke across the United States speaking of her success and experiences in Russia throughout the up until 1937. By then she was no longer interested in remaining in the United States and disappeared shortly after writing up the transcript of her biography, many sources claiming she soon died. However, American Communist leader, [[Homer Smith]] mentioned that she returned to Russia only to receive permission from the Soviet government in 1945, to return to the US only to die not long after arriving. Emma may have returned to Russia in 1937, but was definitely back in the New York by spring 1940 living with her nephew (a few of her relatives moved to New York just before her arrival in Europe). There she remained, hoping to return to Russia after the war, instead passing away in Brooklyn sometime after 1945.

'''European Arenas Association''' ('''EAA''') is an international association that represents 31 indoor [[arena]]s from 20 [[Europe]]an countries. These structures must be enclosed, multifunctional, with a capacity of at least 6,000 seats, and managing to maintain high quality standards in all areas.&lt;ref name=aboutEAA&gt;[http://www.europeanarenas.com/about-the-eaa About EAA at the official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and activities==
The European Arenas Association was formed in the early 1990s, with its main goal to create a common platform for a number of leading venues in Europe. The membership at the EAA involves a maximum of three arenas per country (until 2007, only two arenas per country were allowed). However, each of the [[countries of the United Kingdom]] is counted separately, so [[United Kingdom]] currently has five members – three from [[England]] and one from both [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The main subjects of cooperation between the EAA members include commercial activities, technical and maintenance requirements, technology and market trends.&lt;ref name="aboutEAA"/&gt;

==List of arenas==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2033">'''George McClennon''' (died 1937, [[Chicago]]) was an American [[jazz]] clarinetist, singer, and dancer.

McClennon was the adoptive son of [[Bert Williams]] and worked in theater revues and in [[vaudeville]] in the 1910s. As a clarinetist, he specialized in the style known as [[gas pipe clarinet]], using the instrument to make noises that sounded like animals or sound effects. He was able to dance wildly as he played for comic effect and often performed in [[blackface]]. He played with [[Eddie Heywood]] and [[Willie "The Lion" Smith]], and recorded with a group called the Harlem Trio and under his own name for [[Okeh Records]] in 1924-1926. Sidemen on these recordings included Heywood, [[Buddy Christian]], [[Bob Fuller]], [[Charlie Irvis]], [[John Lindsay (musician)|John Lindsay]], [[Thomas Morris (musician)|Tom Morris]], and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]].

[[File:Grand Guignol poster (crop).png|thumb|Promotional poster for a Grand Guignol performance|upright=.8]]
'''''Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol''''' ({{IPA-fr|ɡʁɑ̃ ɡiɲɔl}}: "The Theatre of the Great Puppet") – known as the '''Grand Guignol''' – was a theatre in the [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]] area of Paris (at 20 bis, {{ill|rue Chaptal|fr}}). From its opening in 1897 until its closing in 1962, it specialised in naturalistic [[Horror and terror|horror]] shows. Its name is often used as a general term for graphic, [[Amorality|amoral]] horror entertainment, a genre popular from [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan and Jacobean]] theatre (for instance Shakespeare's ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', and Webster's ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]'' and ''[[The White Devil]]''), to today's [[splatter film]]s.

==Theatre==
''Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol'' was founded in 1894 by [[Oscar Méténier]], who planned it as a space for [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalist]] performance. With 293 seats, the venue was the smallest in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=http://www.grandguignol.com/time1950.htm|title=Paris Writhes Again|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=January 16, 1950|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former chapel, the theatre's previous life was evident in the boxes – which looked like confessionals – and in the angels over the orchestra. Although the architecture created frustrating obstacles, the design that was initially a predicament ultimately became beneficial to the marketing of the theatre. The opaque furniture and gothic structures placed sporadically on the walls of the building exude a feeling of eeriness from the moment of entrance. People came to this theatre for an experience, not only to see a show. The audience at "Le Théâtre du Grand-Guignol" endured the terror of the shows because they wanted to be filled with strong “feelings” of something. Many attended the shows to get a feeling of arousal.&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt; Underneath the balcony were boxes (originally built for nuns to watch church services) that were available for theatre-goers to rent during performances because they would get so aroused by the action happening on stage. It has been said that audience members would get so boisterous in the boxes, that actors would sometimes break character and yell something such as “Keep it down in there!” Conversely, there were audience members who could not physically handle the brutality of the actions taking place on stage. Frequently, the “special effects” would be too realistic and often an audience member would faint or vomit during performances.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, Richard J., and Michael Wilson. Grand-Guignol The French Theatre of Horror. Exeter: University of Exeter Press, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre owed its name to [[Guignol]], a traditional [[Lyon]]naise puppet character, joining political commentary with the style of [[Punch and Judy]].&lt;ref name=HISTORY /&gt;

The theatre's peak was between World War I and World War II, when it was frequented by royalty and celebrities in evening dress.&lt;ref name="FADING"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider |first=P. E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/03/17/archives/fading-horrors-of-the-grand-guignol-after-sixty-years-the-paris-the.html?sq=Fading%2520Horrors%2520of%2520the%2520Grand%2520Guignol&amp;scp=6&amp;st=cse|title=Fading Horrors of the Grand Guignol|work=The New York Times Magazine|page=SM7|date=March 18, 1957|accessdate=10 April 2007}}, at http://www.grandguignol.com/nytmag.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important people==
[[File:Metenier, Oscar.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Oscar Méténier]]
[[Oscar Méténier]] was the Grand Guignol's founder and original director. Under his direction, the theatre produced plays about a class of people who were not considered appropriate subjects in other venues: prostitutes, criminals, street urchins and others at the lower end of [[Paris]]'s social echelon.

[[Max Maurey]] served as director from 1898 to 1914. Maurey shifted the theatre's emphasis to the horror plays it would become famous for and judged the success of a performance by the number of patrons who passed out from shock; the average was two faintings each evening. Maurey discovered [[André de Lorde]], who would become the most important playwright for the theatre.

De Lorde was the theatre's principal playwright from 1901 to 1926. He wrote at least 100 plays for the Grand Guignol and collaborated with experimental psychologist [[Alfred Binet]] to create plays about insanity, one of the theatre's favourite and frequently recurring themes.

Camille Choisy served as director from 1914 to 1930. He contributed his expertise in special effects and scenery to the theatre's distinctive style.

{{ill|Paula Maxa|fr}} was one of the Grand Guignol's best-known performers. From 1917 to the 1930s, she performed most frequently as a victim and was known as "the most assassinated woman in the world." During her career at the Grand Guignol, Maxa's characters were murdered more than 10,000 times in at least 60 different ways and raped at least 3,000 times.&lt;ref name="FADING" /&gt;

Jack Jouvin served as director from 1930 to 1937. He shifted the theatre's subject matter, focusing performances not on gory horror but psychological drama. Under his leadership, the theatre's popularity waned and, after [[World War II]], it was not well-attended.&lt;ref name=HISTORY&gt;{{cite news|last=Pierron|first=Agnes|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/history.htm|title=History|publisher=Grand Guignol Online|date=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Nonon was the theatre's last director.&lt;ref name=REALITY&gt;{{cite news|last= |first= |url=http://www.grandguignol.com/time1962.htm|title=Outdone by Reality|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 30, 1962|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plays==
[[File:Grand-Guignol-Scène-1937 (2).jpg|thumb|A 1937 scene from Grand Guignol]]
At the Grand Guignol, patrons would see five or six plays, all in a style that attempted to be brutally true to the theatre's [[naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] ideals. The plays were in a variety of styles, but the most popular and best known were the horror plays, featuring a distinctly bleak worldview as well as notably gory special effects in their notoriously bloody climaxes. The horrors depicted at Grand Guignol were generally not [[supernatural]]; these plays often explored the altered states, like insanity, hypnosis, or panic, under which uncontrolled horror could happen. To heighten the effect, the horror plays were often alternated with comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/|title=What is Grand Guignol?|publisher=Grand Guignol Online|date=|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GS&gt;{{cite news|last=Pierron|first=Agnes|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/grandstreet.htm|title=House of Horrors|work=Grand Street Magazine|date=Summer 1996|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Laboratoire des Hallucinations'', by [[André de Lorde]]: When a doctor finds his wife's lover in his operating room, he performs a graphic brain surgery, rendering the adulterer a hallucinating semi-zombie. Now insane, the lover/patient hammers a chisel into the doctor's brain.&lt;ref name=Time1947&gt;{{cite news|last= |first=|url=http://www.grandguignol.com/time1947.htm|title=Murders in the Rue Chaptal|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 10, 1947|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Un Crime dans une Maison de Fous'', by André de Lorde: Two hags in an insane asylum use scissors to blind a pretty, young fellow inmate out of jealousy.&lt;ref name=Time1947 /&gt;

''L'Horrible Passion'', by André de Lorde: A nanny strangles the children in her care.&lt;ref name=GS /&gt;

''Le Baiser dans la Nuit'', by [[Maurice Level]]: A young woman visits the man whose face she horribly disfigured with acid, where he obtains his revenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatredamned.blogspot.com/2010/11/violence-and-vitriol-exploring-le.html Violence and Vitriol&amp;nbsp;– Exploring 'Le Baiser dans la nuit'] Retrieved 2011-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre closing==
Audiences waned in the years following World War II, and the Grand Guignol closed its doors in 1962. Management attributed the closure in part to the fact that the theatre's faux horrors had been eclipsed by the actual events of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] two decades earlier. "We could never equal [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]]," said its final director, Charles Nonon. "Before the war, everyone felt that what was happening onstage was impossible. Now we know that these things, and worse, are possible in reality."&lt;ref name=REALITY /&gt;

The Grand Guignol building still exists. It is occupied by {{ill|International Visual Theatre|fr}}, a company devoted to presenting plays in [[sign language]].

==Legacy==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2013}}
Grand Guignol flourished briefly in London in the early 1920s under the direction of [[Jose Levy]], where it attracted the talents of [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Noël Coward]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatredamned.blogspot.com/2011/01/dame-sybil-thorndike-londons-queen-of.html Dame Sybil Thorndike&amp;nbsp;– London's Queen of Screams] Retrieved 2011-17-01.&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of short English "Grand Guignol" films (using original screenplays, not play adaptations) was made at the same time, directed by [[Fred Paul]]. Several of the films exist at the [[BFI National Archive]].

The Grand Guignol was revived once again in London in 1945, under the direction of Frederick Witney, where it ran for two seasons at the Granville Theatre. These included premiers of Witney's own work as well as adaptations of French originals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theatredamned.blogspot.com/2010/10/fredrick-witney-forgotten-legend-of.html Fredrick Witney&amp;nbsp;– A forgotten legend of the Grand Guignol] Retrieved 2011-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, English director-writer, [[Richard Mazda]], has re-introduced New York audiences to the Grand Guignol. His acting troupe, The Queens Players, have produced six mainstage productions of Grand Guignol plays, and Mazda is writing new plays in the classic Guignol style. The sixth production, ''Theatre of Fear'', included De Lorde's famous adaptation of Poe's ''[[The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether]]'' (''Le Systéme du Dr Goudron et Pr Plume'') as well as two original plays, ''Double Crossed'' and ''The Good Death'' alongside ''[[The Tell-Tale Heart|The Tell Tale Heart]]''.

The 1963 [[mondo film]] ''Ecco'' includes a scene which may have been filmed at the Grand Guignol theatre during its final years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.grandguignol.com/video.htm |title=Excerpt from the film ''Ecco'' (1963) |publisher=Grand Guignol Online |date= |accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American avant-garde composer [[John Zorn]] released an album called ''[[Grand Guignol (album)|Grand Guignol]]'' by [[Naked City (band)|Naked City]] in 1992, in a reference to "the darker side of our existence which has always been with us and always will be".&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes of ''Grand Guignol'' CD&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington, D.C.'s Molotov Theatre Group, established in 2007, is dedicated to preserving and exploring the aesthetic of the Grand Guignol. They have entered two plays into the Capital Fringe Festival in Washington, D.C. Their 2007 show, ''For Boston'', won "Best Comedy", and their second show, ''The Sticking Place'', won "Best Overall" in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The Swiss theatre company, Compagnie Pied de Biche revisits the Grand Guignol genre in contemporary contexts since 2008. The company staged in 2010 a diptych ''Impact &amp; Dr. Incubis'', based on original texts by Nicolas Yazgi and directed by Frédéric Ozier.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pied-de-biche.ch/pied-de-biche/compagnie/frederic-ozier.html&lt;/ref&gt; More than literal adaptations, the plays address violence, death, crime and fear in contemporary contexts, while revisiting many trope of the original Grand Guignol corpus, often with humour.

Recently formed London-based Grand Guignol company Theatre of the Damned, brought their first production to the [[Camden Fringe]] in 2010 and produced the award nominated ''Grand Guignol'' in November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23904853-its-a-scream-theatre-of-the-macabre-is-a-runaway-hit.do It's a scream: theatre of the macabre is a runaway hit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213000012/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23904853-its-a-scream-theatre-of-the-macabre-is-a-runaway-hit.do |date=2010-12-13 }} ''London Evening Standard'' Retrieved 2011-01-02.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, they staged ''Revenge of the Grand Guignol'' at the [[Courtyard Theatre, London]], as part of the London Horror Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Grand Guignol – The Courtyard|url=http://www.thecourtyard.org.uk/whatson/184/revenge-of-the-grand-guignol|website=thecourtyard.org.uk|accessdate=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also based in London, Le Nouveau Guignol form the UK's only permanent repertory Grand Guignol company; plays within their current repertoire include French Guignol classics such as ''The Final Kiss'', ''Tics... Or Doing the Deed'', ''The Lighthouse Keepers'', ''Private Room Number Six'' and ''The Kiss of Blood''. However, as their company remit also includes encouraging new writing, they have also staged several new plays in the Grand-Guignol style, including ''Eating For Two'', ''Penalty'' and ''Ways and Means''. Le Nouveau Guignol took part in the London Horror Festival alongside Theatre of the Damned at Courtyard Theatre in November 2011.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The Grand Guignolers in Los Angeles, California, established in 2007, create and perform traditional Grand Guignol and original works as a 1920s Parisian theatre troupe. Shows are staged as event and draw on multiple forms of traditional physical theatrical genres in new ways including Commedia dell'arte, melodrama, mime, mask, clown, dance, vaudeville, magic, and puppetry. Many shows play with the literal 'big puppet' theme utilizing puppetry at various levels including the Petits Guignolers, a French existentially lewd finger puppet show with Grand Guignol effects. The company paid homage to its namesake by staging a surprise 200th birthday party for Guignol with ''A Grand Guignol Children's Show* (*NOT for Children)''. In addition to evenings of classic Grand Guignol, original productions have included ''A Very Grand Guignol Christmas'' and ''Absinthe, Opium and Magic, 1920s Shanghai''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In August to October 2013, the Xoregos Performing Company presented ''Danse Macabre'', a contemporary tribute to Grand Guignol at  [[Theater for the New City]] in New York City. ''Danse Macabre'' was a program of four plays of psychological and physical terror, one humorous work and a dance, in keeping with Grand Guignol's programming history.  The run ended October 27 at the [[Bronx Museum of the Arts]].  The playwrights were Dave deChristopher, Jack Feldstein, Dylan Guy, Pamela Scott and Joel Trinidad.  Choreographer and Director, Shela Xoregos.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In November 2014, 86 years after the last show of Alfredo Sainati's ''La Compagnia del Grand-Guignol'', founded in 1908 and which had been the only example of Grand Guignol in Italy, the Convivio d'Arte Company presented in Milan ''Grand Guignol de Milan: Le Cabaret des Vampires''. The show was an original tribute to Grand Guignol, a horror vaudeville with various horror and grotesque performances such as monologues, live music and burlesque, with a satirical black humour conduction.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
 
While the original Grand Guignol attempted to present naturalistic horror, the performances would seem melodramatic and heightened to today's audience. For this reason, the term is often applied to films and plays of a stylised nature with heightened acting, melodrama and theatrical effects such as ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow|Sleepy Hollow]]'', ''[[Quills]]'', and the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Horror]] films that went before them. ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962 film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''; ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]''; ''[[What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?]]''; ''[[What's the Matter with Helen?]]''; ''[[Night Watch (1973 film)|Night Watch]]'' and ''[[Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?]]'' form a sub-branch of the genre called [[Grande Dame Guignol]] for its use of aging A-list actresses in sensational horror films.

[[Image:Hallingkast.jpg|thumb|325px|Hallgrim Hansegård (Frikar) demonstrating the ''Halling'' during the annual [[Peer Gynt]] Festival at Lake [[Gålå]].]]
The '''Halling''' (''hallingdansen'') is a [[folk dance]] (''[[bygdedans]]'') traditionally performed in rural [[Norway]], although versions of the halling can also be found in parts of Sweden{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}. The dance is traditionally performed by young men at weddings and parties.

==Overview==
The halling is a quick (95–106 bpm) dance in {{music|time|6|8}} or {{music|time|2|4}} that includes acrobatic, athletic competition between the dancers. Hallingdans can best be described as rhythmic acrobatic dance and consists of a number of steps which requires both strength and softness elation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkemusikk.no/norwegian-traditional-music.137786.no.html ''Norwegian Traditional Music''  (Folkemusikk og folkedansorganisasjonen i Noreg)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724175707/http://www.folkemusikk.no/norwegian-traditional-music.137786.no.html |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dance is associated with the valleys and traditional districts of [[Valdres]] and [[Hallingdal]], where it is often referred to as the ''laus'' (loose dance). The term refers to it being danced solo, not in couples (although coupled halling dancing is traditional in the western parts of the country). According to some scholars, the word may refer to the fact that the dance was "half" the performance, as the other half was the [[springar]] (after the fashion of a Renaissance dance suite).

The meter of the dance is {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|6|8}} of a quite fast (95–106 bpm), sharp quality which calls for an experienced musician. The musician has to give the dancers enough impetus to perform the various challenging moves that are involved in the dance such as the ''nakkespretten'' (neck jump), ''kruking'' (hooked dancing), ''hodestift'' (going over the head) and especially the ''kast'' (throw). The dancer Olav Thorshaug performed hallingdans shows in the United States of America around 1910–1920, incorporating the [[headspin]] in his dance.

One of the dance moves is called ''hallingkast''. In this move, a girl has traditionally held a hat high using a stick or something similar, and the dancer is supposed to kick down the hat. ''Kast'' is seen as the test of strength, which involves kicking a hat that is held about 230 to 280&amp;nbsp;cm above the floor.  Some girls have been able dancers themselves, and known to be as agile as any man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snl.no/halling ''Halling'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
Noted Norwegian composer [[Edvard Grieg]] composed several pieces of music for the halling dance in his ''[[Lyric Pieces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.song-list.net/edvardgrieg/halling/tracks ''Halling (Norwegian Dance) Op.38 No. 4'' (Edvard Grieg song list)]&lt;/ref&gt; The finale of [[Geirr Tveitt]]'s Piano Concerto No. 5, published in 1954, is described as 'Tempo di Halling'.

The dance was performed by the [[Frikar Dance Company]] to the Norwegian winning contribution for the 2009 [[Eurovision Song Contest]], "[[Fairytale (Alexander Rybak song)|Fairytale]]", by singer and fiddle player [[Alexander Rybak]].

Frikar Dance Company has toured 29 countries with halling dance the last years. The company's founder and choreographer Hallgrim Hansegård is known as the reinventor of halling, exploring the tradition in meeting with new artistic expressions and arenas as for example in the computer game "Age of Conan".&lt;ref&gt;[http://multemusic.com/2009/02/24/norwegian-halling-dance-heads/ ''Norwegian halling dance heads to Eurovision 2009'' (Multe Music)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hard Truck''''' is a series of [[truck driver|trucking]] [[simulation game|simulators]] and [[racing video game]]s published in the [[United States]] by [[ValuSoft]]. The series currently has three released installments so far.

== ''Hard Truck'' ==
[[File:Hard truck english small valusoft.jpg|100px|thumb|right|The original ''Hard Truck'']]The original Hard Truck was developed by [[Russia]]n developer [[SoftLab-NSK]] published by [[Buka Entertainment]], and released on April 20, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.softlab-nsk.com/Pro/truck.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305213811/http://www.softlab-nsk.com/Pro/truck.html |archivedate=2010-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasized [[truck racing]], although it had a mode where the player could deliver [[cargo]]. The [[map]]s were simple, usually with 2 or 3 routes to reach the destination, and had no [[traffic]] model.

Similar to the original, but more of an emphasis on delivery of goods. [[Police]] are added to the maps. The police give chase for only a limited time period, after which they simply give up and dispatch a [[machine gun]] [[helicopter]] to attempt to slow the player down. Once they've demolished the player's truck, they write the player out a simple ticket.

== ''Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel'' ==
{{Main|18 Wheels of Steel}}
[[File:Hard Truck - 18 Wheels of Steel cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Hard Truck: 18 Wheels of Steel'']]
In this installment, developed by SCS Software, the racing option is removed completely and, instead, the game focuses on delivery of goods. A traffic model is added and the game also features a simple [[business simulation game|business management simulation]], where drivers can be hired and routes set up to make a profit.

There are three maps, each depicting an area of the United States, including:

* [[Phoenix, Arizona]]
* [[Los Angeles, California]]
* [[San Francisco, California]]
* [[Denver, Colorado]]
* [[Boise, Idaho]]
* [[Chicago, Illinois]]
* [[Louisville, Kentucky]]
* [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas, Nevada]]
* [[Helena, Montana]]
* [[Reno, Nevada]]
* [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]
* [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]
* [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]
* [[Detroit, Michigan]]
* [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]

The following trucks include:

# Rusty (based on the truck from [[Duel (1971 film)|Spielberg's Duel]])
# Topolino
# T1000
# Brava
# Roadmaster
# FreightWay
# Glutton [was either an update or the only thing you can unlock in the game]

Notices: Some versions of the game didn't have timed loads like the European version but the North American version did have timed loads. Also, when you hit traffic AI they slide out of the way.

All further trucking simulations from ValuSoft are in the series ''[[18 Wheels of Steel]]''.

== Spin off: ''Hard Truck Apocalypse'' ==
''[[Hard Truck Apocalypse]]'' shares the same name, but is in actuality a standalone game.

A completely different take on the hard truck games, developed by the Russian developer [[Targem Games]], released on June 26, 2006, this game takes place in an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]], ''[[Mad Max]]''-like future. A disaster occurred and everyone on Earth has to wear special masks to survive. Trade runs between villages to make money can still be done but the main method for making money is to loot destroyed enemies of cargo and weapons.

The game takes place in an apocalyptic version of [[Europe]], with different zones depicting countries like [[Germany]], [[France]], [[England]], and many more. Five vehicles, from a simple [[van]] to the gigantic [[BelAZ]], are available to drive. The guns vary from roof-mounted machine guns, shotguns, and mortars to laser and energy weapons.

The game was soon followed by ''[[Hard Truck Apocalypse|Hard Truck Apocalypse: Rise of Clans]]'', The official standalone expansion to ''Hard Truck Apocalypse'', also developed by [[Targem Games]]. It has not been released in western stores yet, but can be purchased and downloaded online at [[GamersGate]]. It takes place in an apocalyptic version of North America. In the game the player is a [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]], a strong loner who is searching for the mythical city of [[Edmonton]] in "le canada".

The game reuses a lot of material from ''Hard Truck Apocalypse'' but most of the vehicles, weapons, and enemies are the same. There are four new zones and a whole new storyline.

==Reception==
In the United States, the ''Hard Truck'' series sold 790,000 copies between January 2000 and August 2006.&lt;ref name=edgesales&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017165955/http://www.edge-online.com/features/top-100-pc-games-21st-century/ |url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/top-100-pc-games-21st-century/ |title=The Top 100 PC Games of the 21st Century| author=''Edge'' Staff | date=August 25, 2006 |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |archivedate=October 17, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
"'''Homeward'''" is the 165th [[episode]] of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. The 13th episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 7)|seventh season]].

In this episode, [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Worf]], the [[Klingon]] Chief of [[Starfleet Security|Security]] of the Federation [[Starfleet]] [[Starship]] [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise'']], must work with his human adoptive brother Nikolai Rozhenko, a Federation [[anthropologist]], to save a small group of natives from a primitive alien culture on a dying planet.

==Plot==
The ''Enterprise'' receives an emergency distress call from Rozhenko, currently posted to [[List of Star Trek planets: A-B#B|Boraal II]], a [[class M planet]] in the process of suffering an atmospheric catastrophe.

The [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] observation post is found to be deserted, but [[force shield|force field]] shielding has been set up nearby which protects a series of caverns. ''Enterprise'' [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard]] decides to send an [[away team (Star Trek term)|away team]] to investigate. Concerned for his brother, Worf volunteers, and Picard orders him to go alone and be surgically altered to pass as a Boraalan. Worf [[Transporter (Star Trek)|transports]] to the planet and discovers that his brother set up the shield to protect the local villagers.

Rozhenko meets with the ship’s senior officers and describes his plan to save one village of the doomed planet by setting up a concealed artificial [[biosphere]]. Picard replies that the Federation [[Prime Directive]] prohibits interference with the natural development of the Boraalan civilization; it is not for them to decide that one group shall survive while the rest of the planet perishes.

After witnessing the atmospheric dissipation [[extinction event]] transpire, the crew is puzzled by an unexpected power drain, the origin of which Worf tracks to the [[Holodeck]]. His brother has transported the population of the Boraalan village aboard the ship, using the Holodeck to replicate caverns identical to those on the planet, misleading the villagers into thinking they are still on Boraal II.

Rozhenko tells Worf and Picard that he believes offering the Boraalan culture a chance of survival is more important than following the Prime Directive. He champions his updated plan of transporting the Boraalans to a new home on a different planet. Picard reluctantly authorizes the plan and orders Chief Medical Officer Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]] and Operations Officer Lt. Commander [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] to find a new home planet for the Boraalans.

Crusher and Data choose [[List of Star Trek planets: T-Z#V|Vacca VI]] as the new Boraalan home world, but it is almost two days away at maximum [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp]]. Ship’s [[Chief Engineer]] Lt. Commander [[Geordi La Forge]] tells Picard and Rozhenko that the Holodeck program may not run that long. Rozhenko volunteers to return to the Boraalans and help account for any anomalies in the program. A mistrustful Picard orders Worf to accompany him.

Returning to the Holodeck, Nikolai and Worf tell the Boraalans that they will lead them to a new home. As they travel, Worf and Rozhenko nearly come to blows when Worf learns that his brother has impregnated one of the villagers, and Nikolai tells Worf that he intends to remain with the Boraalans.

Vorin, the village chronicler, finds his way out of the Holodeck and suffers severe [[culture shock]] at the reality of the world outside. ''Enterprise'' [[Mental health professional|Counsellor]] [[Deanna Troi]] and Picard try to help him adjust, offering him the choice of returning to his people or staying on the ship. Ultimately Vorin can’t live with what he has discovered and commits ritual suicide.

The ''Enterprise'' arrives at the new Boraalan home, and the Boraalans are [[Transporter (Star Trek)|beamed]] down to the eventual site of their new village. Worf and Nikolai make peace when Worf accepts that the Boraalan race would not have survived if not for his brother’s unconventional methods. Nikolai assuages Worf by telling him that he is going to stay with  the villagers and become the new village chronicler. Aboard the ''Enterprise'', Picard muses with Crusher that while their plan for the Boraalans worked out well, he is disappointed that Vorin wasn’t able to bridge the gap between their two cultures.

Penny Johnson and Michael Dorn would reunite on ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]''.

'''International Students' Day''' is an [[international observance]] of the [[student]] community, held annually on [[November 17]]. Originally commemorating the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] storming of [[List of Czech universities#Old universities|Czech universities]] in 1939 and the subsequent killing and sending of students to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], it is now marked by a number of universities, sometimes on a day other than November 17, as a nonpolitical celebration of the [[multiculturalism]] of their [[International student|international students]].

==Origin==
The date commemorates the anniversary of the 1939 Nazi storming of the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] after demonstrations against the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] and the killings of [[Jan Opletal]] and worker [[Václav Sedláček]]. The Nazis rounded up the students, murdered nine student leaders and sent over 1,200 students to concentration camps, mainly [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]. They subsequently closed all Czech universities and colleges. By this time Czechoslovakia no longer existed, as it had been divided into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]] and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–45)|Slovak Republic]] under a fascist puppet government.&lt;ref name="sulc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ústřední svaz československého studenstva v exilu za války 1940-45
 |last=Šulc|first=Bohuslav
 |publisher=Rozmluvy|date=1990|isbn=978-80-900209-5-5
 |language=Czech|trans-title=Central Association of Czechoslovak students in exile during the war 1940-45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1939 the Nazi authorities in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia suppressed a demonstration in Prague held by students of the Medical Faculty of [[Charles University]]. The demonstration was held on 28 October to commemorate the anniversary of the independence of the Czechoslovak Republic (1918). During this demonstration the student Jan Opletal was shot, and later died from his injuries on 11 November. On 15 November his body was supposed to be transported from Prague to his home in [[Moravia]]. His funeral procession consisted of thousands of students, who turned the event into an anti-Nazi demonstration. However, the Nazi authorities took drastic measures in response, closing all Czech higher education institutions, arresting more than 1,200 students, who were then sent to concentration camps, executing nine students and professors without trial on 17 November. Historians speculate that the Nazis granted permission for the funeral procession already expecting a violent outcome, in order to use that as a pretext for closing down universities and purging anti-fascist dissidents.&lt;ref name="studyeu"&gt;[http://www.study.eu/article/17-november-international-students-day 17 November: International Students’ Day], Study.EU. Retrieved 2017-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="radiocz"&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/the-17th-of-november-remembering-jan-opletal-martyr-of-an-occupied-nation "The 17th of November: Remembering Jan Opletal, martyr of an occupied nation"], Radio Praha. Retrieved 2017-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine students and professors executed on 17 November in Prague were:
* '''[[Josef Matoušek]]''' (historian and [[associate professor]]; participated in the organisation of Opletal's funeral)
* '''Jaroslav Klíma''' (student of law; Chairman of the National Association of Czech Students in Bohemia and Moravia, requested the release of students arrested by the [[Gestapo]] during Opletal's funeral)
* '''Jan Weinert''' (student of [[Bohemistics]] and [[Germanistics]]; requested the release of students arrested by the [[Gestapo]] during Opletal's funeral)
* '''Josef Adamec''' (student of law; secretary of the National Association of Czech Students in Bohemia and Moravia)
* '''Jan Černý''' (student of medicine; requested the release of students arrested by the [[Gestapo]] during Opletal's funeral)
* '''Marek Frauwirth''' (student of economics; as an employee of the Slovak embassy in Prague, he was issuing false passports to Jews trying to flee from the Nazis)
* '''Bedřich Koula''' (student of law; secretary of the Association of Czech students in Bohemia)
* '''Václav Šafránek''' (student of architecture; record-keeper of the National Association of Czech Students in Bohemia and Moravia)
* '''František Skorkovský''' (student of law; Director of a Committee of the [[Confédération Internationale des Étudiants]], Chairman of the Foreign Department of the National Association of Czech Students in Bohemia and Moravia)

An initial idea to commemorate the atrocities inflicted on students in German-occupied Czechoslovakia was discussed among Czechoslovak Army troops in England in 1940. A small group of soldiers, former elected student officials, decided to renew the Central Association of Czechoslovak Students (USCS) which had been disbanded by the German Protectorate in Czechoslovakia. The idea of commemorating the November 17 tragedy was discussed with the British [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students of England and Wales]] and other foreign students fighting the Nazis from England. With the support of [[Edvard Beneš]], President-in-Exile of Czechoslovakia, the USCS was reestablished in London on 17 November 1940, one year after the events at the Czech universities, with the following members:

{{div col|colwidth=30em}}
* [[Václav Paleček]], Chairman 
* [[Čeněk Adamec]], Vice Chairman
* [[Karel Macháček]], Vice Chairman
* [[Bohuslav Šulc]], Secretary General
* [[Božetěch Dubový]], Treasurer
* [[Pavel Kavan]], Chairman of the Foreign Section
* [[Lubor Zink]], Chairman of the Cultural Section
* [[Leopold Rozbořil]], Chairman of the Organization Section
* [[Jiří Bleier]], Chairman of the Social Section
* [[Milan Smutný]], Chairman of the High School Section
* [[Gustav Galko]]
{{div col end}}

Throughout 1941 efforts were made to convince students of other nations to acknowledge November 17 as a day of commemoration, celebrating and encouraging resistance against the Nazis and the fight for freedom and democracy in all nations. These negotiating efforts were mostly carried out by Zink, Paleček, Kavan and [[Lena Chivers]], Vice President of the NUS. Fourteen countries eventually agreed and signed the following proclamation:

"We, students of Great Britain and its territories and India, North and South America, the USSR, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, China, Holland, Norway, Poland, Yugoslavia and all free nations, to honour and commemorate the tortured and executed students who were the first to raise their voices to reject Nazi oppression and condemn the occupation of 1939, proclaim November 17 as International Students' Day."

The inaugural meeting was held in London's [[Caxton Hall]] on 16 November 1941, with support from President Beneš. The proclamation was read and accepted by all attendees, among them representatives of all governments who were in exile in London. The meeting was presided over by USCS Chairman Paleček; the key speakers were [[Sergej Ingr]], Czechoslovak Secretary of Defence; Lena Chivers and [[Elizabeth Shields-Collins]] of the UK; [[Olav Rytter]] of Norway; [[Claude Guy]] of France, A. Vlajčić representing Yugoslavia. 

On 17 November 1941, members of the USCS Executive Committee had a long audience with President Beneš, and similar meetings with the President took place annually on November 17 throughout WWII. The BBC's Czechoslovakian department prepared a special report for November 17 which was broadcast to occupied Czechoslovakia. Many British universities interrupted their schedule to commemorate the events in Prague two years earlier, by reading the proclamation of November 17. Among them were [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], [[University of Reading|Reading]], [[University of Exeter|Exeter]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[University of Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth]], [[University of Leicester|Leicester]], [[University of London|London]], [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Holloway College]], [[University of Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]], [[King's College London]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[Bangor University|Bangor]], [[University of Cardiff|Cardiff]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]]. During the war [[Oxford University]] extended assistance to the closed Charles University, allowing dozens of Czechoslovak students in exile to graduate.

==Observances==
In 1989 independent student leaders together with the [[Youth organizations in Communist Czechoslovakia|Socialist Union of Youth]] (SSM/SZM) organized a mass demonstration to commemorate International Students’ Day. The students used this 50th-anniversary event to express their dissatisfaction with the ruling [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]]. By nightfall, what had begun as a peaceful commemorative event turned violent, with many participants brutally beaten by riot police, red berets, and other members of law enforcement agencies. About 15,000 people took part in this demonstration. The only person left lying where the beatings took place was thought to be the body of a student, but in fact turned out to be an undercover agent. The rumour that a student had died due to the police brutality triggered further actions; the same night, students and theatre actors agreed to go on strike. The events linked to the International Students' Day of 17 November 1989 helped spark the [[Velvet Revolution]] in Czechoslovakia. ''Struggle for Freedom and Democracy Day'' is today observed as an official holiday in both [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic|the Czech Republic]] (since 2000, following a campaign by the Czech [[Student Chamber of the Council of Higher Education Institutions]]) and [[National holidays in Slovakia|Slovakia]].

After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the resulting crisis within the [[International Union of Students]], celebrations for 17 November were held in only a few countries without any international coordination. During the [[World Social Forum]] held in [[Mumbai]], India, in 2004, some international student unions such as the [[Organization of Caribbean and Latin American Students]] (OCLAE) and some national unions such as the Italian [[Unione degli Studenti]] decided to re-launch the date and to call for a global demonstration on 17 November 2004. Student movements in many countries mobilised again that year and continued observing International Students' Day in following years with the support of the [[Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions]] (OBESSU) and the [[European Students' Union]] (ESU).

In 2009, on the 70th anniversary of 17 November 1939, OBESSU and ESU promoted a number of initiatives throughout Europe to commemorate the date. An event was held from 16 to 18 November at the [[University of Brussels]], focusing on the history of the students' movement and its role in promoting active citizenship against authoritarian regimes, and followed by an assembly discussing the role of student unions today and the need for the recognition of a European Student Rights Charter. The conference gathered around 100 students representing national students and student unions from over 30 European countries, as well as some international delegations.&lt;ref name="obessu"&gt;[https://www.obessu.org/resources/news/17th-of-november-and-its-historical-meaning/ "17th of November and its historical meaning"], OBESSU.

'''John William Sublett''' (February 19, 1902 &amp;ndash; May 18, 1986), known by his stage name '''John W. Bubbles''', was a [[vaudeville]] performer. He performed in the duo "Buck and Bubbles." He is also known as the father of "rhythm tap."

==Life and career==
Subblett was born in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on February 19, 1902,&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; but soon moved with his family to [[Indianapolis]]. There, he formed a partnership with [[Buck Washington|Ford L. "Buck" Washington]] in 1919. Their duo was known as "Buck and Bubbles." Buck played [[stride piano]] and sang, and Bubbles tapped along.&lt;ref name="finding aid"&gt;{{Cite archival metadata

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were so popular that the duo moved to [[Manhattan, New York City]] in September of that year. They played together in the Columbia Theater, the Palace and played with artists [[Al Jolson]], [[Eddie Cantor]] and [[Danny Kaye]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt; They were on the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]] of 1931.'' They also became the first black artists to perform at the [[Radio City Music Hall]]. "Buck and Bubbles" performed live in the first scheduled 'high definition' [[television]] program on November 2, 1936 at [[Alexandra Palace]], London, for the [[BBC]], becoming the first black artists on television anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="NYTimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="finding aid" /&gt;

Though unable to read music, Bubbles was chosen by [[George Gershwin]] to create the role of Sportin' Life in his opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' in 1935. Since he didn't understand the music score, Gershwin spent the time to teach it to him as a tap rhythm. Sublett caused some problems because he often made up rhythms which caused confusion with other members of the cast.&lt;ref name="what the eye hears"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seibert|first1=Brian|title=What the Eye Hears: A History of Tap Dancing|date=2015|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|location=New York|isbn=9780865479531|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3GcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340&amp;dq=john+bubbles+tour+vietnam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FbsraI3KVk&amp;sig=an80sU8rqb7Xub1g5gF2LgjL1Ps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyzrfytPPMAhUPV1IKHawyCZsQ6AEIMzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20bubbles&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|218}} Sublett performed the role occasionally for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="musicology" /&gt; In 1963, in a [[studio recording]] of ''Porgy and Bess'' featuring [[Leontyne Price]] and [[William Warfield]], he performed Sportin' Life's two main arias from the opera, "[[It Ain't Necessarily So]]" and "There's A Boat Dat's Leavin' Soon For New York".&lt;ref name="porgy and bess"&gt;{{cite web|title=Gershwin: Porgy &amp; Bess Highlights|url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Porgy_And_Bess__1963_.html|website=Album Liner Notes|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920 he gave lessons in tap dancing to [[Fred Astaire]], who considered Sublett the finest tap dancer of his generation. In the number "Bojangles of Harlem" from ''[[Swing Time (film)|Swing Time]]'' (1936) Astaire dresses in [[blackface]] as the Sportin' Life character and dances in the style of Sublett while ostensibly paying tribute to [[Bill Robinson]].&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite book

Sublett appeared in [[Hollywood]] films of the late 1930s and 1940s, including ''[[Varsity Show (film)|Varsity Show]]'' in 1937, ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' in 1943 and ''[[A Song Is Born]]'' in 1948.  In later life, he also made television appearances, one of his last being on a musical episode of ''[[The Lucy Show]]'',&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=John William Sublett|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836970/|website=IMDb|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also guest-starred [[Mel Tormé]]&lt;ref name="imdb lucy show"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucy Puts Main Street on the Map|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0637437/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1|website=IMDb|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a featured performance on [[Barbra Streisand]]'s 1967 TV special, ''The Belle of 14th Street'', a tribute to the bygone era of [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref name="barbara streisand"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Belle of 14th Street: Taping The Show (1967)|url=http://barbra-archives.com/tv/60s/belle_of_14th_street_taping.html|website=Barbara Streisand Archives Television|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Vietnam War, John Bubbles toured the war zone with the [[United Service Organizations|USO]].&lt;ref name="what the eye hears" /&gt;{{rp||340}}  In 1965, he appeared with [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] on a USO tour, visiting many outposts and camps in the early war years.

In 1978, John Bubbles spoke at the Variety Arts Theatre in Los Angeles as a participant in a seminar on vaudeville.  Someone asked him who the best tap dancer was.  Bubbles answered, "You're looking at him."  Then he added, "Honestly, if I had to name the best dancer, it would be Fred Astaire.  He could tap.  He had a good teacher.  But he could ballroom, dance with a partner.  All in all, he's the best."&lt;ref name="famous tap dancers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous Tap Dancers in History|url=http://infomory.com/famous/famous-tap-dancers-in-history/|website=Infomory.com|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same night, Bubbles mentioned that Astaire had brought him into the rehearsal hall to work on "Bojangles of Harlem" and John's chops are right there in the number.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;!--looks like this phrase comes directly from Fred Astaire's Guide to Tap Dance but I can't access it online--&gt;

He performed at the Newport Jazz Festival in New York in 1979, which was one of his last public appearances.

==Legacy==
Sublett is known as the father of "rhythm tap," a form of [[tap dance]].  Sublett included percussive heel drops in his tap style, as opposed to the tap dancing of [[Bill Robinson]] (Bojangles) who emphasized clean phrases and toe taps.  Sublett's taps were made to the traditional eight-bar phrase, but allowed for more rhythmic freedom.  He blended the improvisational style of jazz music with the traditional techniques of tap to create a unique style and sound.&lt;ref name="JUBA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.itvs.org/juba/tap.html |title=Tap History |work=Juba - Masters of Tap &amp; Percussive Dance |accessdate=19 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025421/http://archive.itvs.org/juba/tap.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masters of tap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tap-dance.de/englisch/ueberstep.htm |title=Tap Dance – An International Coproduction |accessdate=19 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jolly Rover''''' is a 2D [[graphic adventure game]] developed by Australian studio Brawsome. The game was released in early 2010 for the PC, distributed digitally. 

The game takes place in an 18th-century pirate setting in which all of the characters are dogs. The game's story revolves around a [[sausage dog]] named Gaius James Rover, who is kidnapped by a crew of pirates, before becoming a pirate himself. The game play, characters, and story are comparable to the [[Monkey Island (series)|''Monkey Island'' series]], which the game makes multiple references to.

==Gameplay==
''Jolly Rover'' is a traditional [[point-and-click]] adventure game in which players control the character of Gaius James Rover. The player must explore a range of environments, and solve a series of puzzles in order to progress through the game. The majority of the game's controls are performed with the use of the cursor, as the player uses Gaius to travel through different environments, pick up items, combine items, examine objects and converse with various non-playable characters.

At the beginning of the game, Gaius meets and befriends a parrot by the name of Juan Leon. The character of Juan Leon doubles as a hint system throughout the game, as Gaius may ask Juan questions in order to receive subtle hints. The player may also use Gaius to feed Juan crackers in order to receive increasingly stronger hints from the parrot.

==Plot==
{{plot|date=September 2013}}

The game is focused on a young and naive British Dachshund named Gaius James Rover who is sailing across the seas to deliver a cargo of Jolly Rover, a brew made of rum spoiled by tobacco to governor Guy DeSilver residing on Groggy Island, a small backwater and haven for pirates. However, James is quickly captured by pirates led by Captain Howell who is the first one to give him the nickname and titular name Jolly Rover. 

After three weeks in capture, James Rover manages to escape and disguises himself and meets Juan Leon the Parrot, a wisecracking animal sidekick that would serve as the hint system for the game progress. But Jame finds that they have already arrived at Groggy Island and captain Howell simply orders him to roar him into shore.

James tries to confront Governor DeSilver and accuses captain Howell for trying his cargo but Howell denies it and settles the arrangements with delivering the same cargo of rum that he stole from James. DeSilver then proceeds to threaten a rather desperate and reluctant James to settle the debt of 50 pieces-of-eights by paying him 5 pieces per month or be put in jail and most likely hanged. James agrees the terms reluctantly and is recruited by captain Howell to be their ship cook for making up for the incident and that James disposed of their previous cook earlier.

During his quest to make "Salamagundi", a favored salad dish for the pirates, James is given by a Dalmatian retired pirate a guide book on Voodoo which will be very useful for the game such as Raise the Dead, Voices of the Dead, Scare Beast and Heat Iron. He also learns that DeSilver was a notorious pirate hunter who betrayed his own brother privateer later known as the legendary pirate Captain Silvereye, the nickname being that he used an eye patch with a silver coin attached to it. After Captain Silvereye mysteriously disappeared, DeSilver semi retired and became governor of Groggy Island, controlling the blackmarket trade with an iron fist. 
To make matters worse, James sneaks into his office and it is accidentally revealed that the corrupt governor is in league with a sinister voodoo priest by supplying him with human sacrifices (or rather dog sacrifices in this case) in exchange for immortality. 

James completes his task by making the salad dish to the pirates and they have a round of rum. Though reluctant, James toasts his share of rum with the pirates but being extremely light headed, James promptly faints after only one drink.

During a dream flashback, it is revealed that when he was a young pup, Jame's father was a famous clown working for a circus and that the young pup promised to have his very own circus one day. James' father proudly encourages his sick son to sleep and walks off to work where it is highly suggested that it was the very same night where James' father was tragically comedic killed from a blow to the groin from an improperly loaded joke cannon.

James Rover wakes up on Cannibal Island dumped by captain Howell as a distraction to the supposedly cannibals who lives there. However the cannibals is revealed to be an all-female pirate crew led by captain Marianne posing as cannibals to either kill or scare off any intruders, males specially. James disguises and infiltrates the camp where he meets a female cocker spaniel and love interest Clara DeSilver, the daughter of Captain Silvereye. 

The two team up to escape the island since Clara no longer desires to be with her previous crew and arrives to a labyrinth cave where her father's ship The Red Herring is hidden but none of them can really find it. But James uses his voodoo book to hear the ghostly voices and uses it to guide themselves to the ship, but none of them can really sail a ship since the ship needs a crew and James is the son of a clown. James uses the Raise the Dead spell and summons the spirit of Captain Silvereye who takes the ship to Shipwreck Island, Clara's family home.

Guided by the pirate ghost, Clara and James arrive to her home where they find that Clara's ghostly father has finally put into rest near her mother's grave. Clara decides to rest in her room up in the tree house while James Rover decides to search for the treasure that captain Silvereye left behind. After a series of puzzles, James finally reaches his goal but the evil governor DeSilver has followed him behind, intent to kidnap Clara for his own evil purposes. James finally embraces his destiny as Jolly Rover the Pirate and challenges DeSilver... Only to get a sword handle delivered to his head which knocks him out.

Oddly enough while he is passed out, James receives a spiritual guidance by his father who states how proud he is with his son even though James regretted to never fulfill his promise to have his own circus while they pass juggling balls to each other. When James asks his father what to do next, he simply says "think fast!" and knocks James out and softly says to him to wake up.

James wakes up and finds himself on a very small island with a simple palm tree and an empty barrel and a hangman's knot. But James manages to lure a sea turtle and ties it to the barrel with the rope and he runs off back to Groggy Island to save Clara from DeSilver and the voodoo priest.

James infiltrates the secret cave via the governors office where DeSilver is trying to perform a voodoo ritual over to Clara with the voodoo priest but James simply walks in confident, juggling with some red balls. Distracting DeSilver by shouting "Think fast!", James throws one of his red balls on a very confused DeSilver who stumbles over the voodoo priest and they both fall over the cliff into a pit of hot boiling water. James rescues Clara, but the volcano starts to increase the hot water. James quickly manages to build up a balloon (though he calls it a Jolly Floater) by using the hot steam and they both fly off just before the steam erupts. They are followed by a shape that looks like DeSilver before he disappeared into the steam. 

James and Clara looks across the sea and witnesses a glorious sunset. The balloon flies from the screen and the credits rolls right after Jolly Rover exclaims "Oh my!" at Clara's subtle proposal to further develop their romantic relationship.

[[File:Kapla.JPG|thumb|250px|Building constructed of Kapla blocks]]

'''Kapla''' is a [[construction set]] for children and adults. The sets consists only of identical wood planks measuring 11.7&amp;nbsp;cm x 2.34&amp;nbsp;cm x 0.78&amp;nbsp;cm. This 15:3:1 ratio of length:width:thickness is different than the dimensions used for traditionally proportioned [[building blocks]] (such as [[unit blocks]]), and are used for building features such as [[lintels]], [[roofs]] and [[floor]]s. They are known for their [[wikt:stability|stability]] in the absence of [[fastening]] devices.&lt;ref name="kapla-about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Kapla|url=http://www.kaplaplanks.co.uk/about-kapla-planks/|website=Kapla Website|accessdate=2016-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name origin==
[[Image:Kapla-blocks.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Individual Kapla blocks]]
"KAPLA" is an abbreviated form of the Dutch phrase "kabouter plankjes," which means "Gnome Planks."

==History==
KAPLA was invented in 1987 by Dutchman Tom van der Bruggen. A student of [[art history]], Bruggen had hopes of building a [[castle]] from an early age. Inspired by an old abandoned farm on the [[Tarn River]] in the [[South of France]], Bruggen converted the farm into his dream castle, complete with carriage entrance, fountains, and towers. To help him visualize the finished construction of his castle, Tom van der Bruggen used wooden blocks, but soon realized that they would not be suitable for certain aspects of the construction, such as the lintels, roofs and floors.

==Assembly==
KAPLA requires no glue, screws or clips to fix the planks. Each plank is placed one on top of the other, and held in place by gravity and balance alone. 
There are 3 possible ways to use Kapla planks:
* Flat
* On the side
* Standing up (vertically)
Also, similar KAPLA constructions can create different assemblages:
* Piled up as bricks: embedding
* Piled up as spiral stairs: stacking
KAPLA is intended for children to safely build, create and experiment by using their imagination.

==Varieties==
KAPLA bricks are made of [[pine wood]] and are available in many different colors. They are sold in sets ranging in size from 40 to 1000 pieces.

==Construction and art==
KAPLA has created four educational art books, intended to inspire children who use their products. 
They are meant to encourage the use of [[geometry]], [[physics]] and [[technology]], while exposing children to the world of art, [[Form (visual art)|forms]] and [[volumes]]. 
The books are also created with the intention to help children in understanding the unique and demanding nature of construction.

''La técnica cubana'', often abbreviated as ''técnica'', is a form of Cuban contemporary dance that was founded by [[Ramiro Guerra Suarez]] in Cuba in 1959.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement|last=John|first=Suki|publisher=McFarland|year=2012|isbn=978-0786449019|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other forms of traditional Cuban dance, ''técnica'' fuses many different dance forms together, such as those from Africa, Europe, and North America. It is a highly expressive and robust dance form, incorporating many quick jumps and undulating movements of the torso and pelvis. ''Técnica'' blends a high amount of movement and expression with a degree of synchronization, producing an athletic, theatrical dance form.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Técnica'' was founded directly following the [[Cuban Revolution|1959 Cuban Revolution]]. The Revolution was driven by ideas of socialism and a lack of Cuban [[nationalism]], which brought about major change to the political, economical, and social realms of Cuba.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cuba Represent!: Cuban Arts, State Power, and the Making of New Revolutionary Cultures|last=Fernandes|first=Sujatha|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0822338918|location=Durham|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Fidel Castro|Castro]] regime provided funding and government support to expand the arts, and thus técnica, a new revolutionary Cuban dance form was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music and Revolution: Cultural Change in Socialist Cuba|last=Moore|first=Robin|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0520247116|location=Berkeley|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The similar timing of ''técnica''’s birth allowed the dance form to incorporate many revolutionary ideas—boosting Cuban nationalism and providing a sense of national and personal identity for Cubans. ''Técnica'' incorporated this nationalist vision into its dance technique and created a sense of ''cubanidad'', or “Cuban-ness.”

== History ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:TeatroNacional de Cuba.JPG|thumb|Teatro Nacional in Havana Cuba]]
''La técnica cubana'' was founded in Cuba in 1959 and is intimately linked to revolutionary ideals and social activism. The [[Cuban Revolution|Cuban Revolution of 1959]], led by [[Fidel Castro]], transformed the Cuban economy and enacted a series of progressive social reforms in which wealth was redistributed, health care services became free of charge, and racial boundaries were diminished.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Contemporary Cuba Reader: Reinventing the Revolution|last=Brenner|first=Phillip|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=978-0742555075|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban nationalism was on the rise for the first time since before Spanish control. The revolutionary government employed culture as a way to unite the Cuban population and promote nationalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In keeping with this effort to promote Cuban culture, Castro’s new regime fostered expansion of the arts by encouraged the creation of new art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Robin|date=2001|title=¿Revolución con Pachanga? Dance Music in Socialist Cuba|jstor=41800169|journal=Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro’s government appointed [[Ramiro Guerra]], an accomplished dancer and choreographer, as the director of the [[Department of Modern Dance]], housed within the [[National Theatre of Cuba|Teatro Nacional]] ([[English language|English]]: National Theatre) in the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] in Cuba.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Danza-Contemporanea-cuatro.jpg|left|thumb|276x276px|Dancers from Danza Contemporanea]]
The goal of the department was to create a dance group with original repertory that was rooted in an original Cuban contemporary dance style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Guerra and his colleagues thus founded a contemporary dance group, ''Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna'' ([[English language|English]]: The National Modern Dance Ensemble) with support from the new Castro regime. This group gave ''técnica'' a mandate and a place to grow and develop. Although the group had the benefit of Guerra’s leadership, it was created with influences from a group of people, including [[Martha Graham]], [[José Limón]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/07/arts/dance/what-comes-next-for-cuban-modern-dance.html|title=What Comes Next for Cuban Modern Dance?|last=Seibert|first=Brian|date=May 2016|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguishes ''técnica'' from other modern dance groups, as most other groups originated and were associated with a specific individual. In this way, ''técnica'' naturally reflected the wide range of Cuban movement intelligence, rather than the sole artistic genius of one person. Conjunto Nacional de Danza Moderna was officially established in 1959 and held its first show in 1960 at the Teatro Nacional in Havana.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The financial support of the revolutionary government contributed to great initial success, as the dancers and creators of técnica did not have to rely on outside jobs for income, finance rehearsal space, or commission compositions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Técnica'' was created with the social backing of the new regime and aimed to link the power of dance with Cuban national image. As a result, ''técnica'' was a key component of the intellectual socialist production of the new revolutionary Cuba in 1959. Guerra incorporated nationalist ideals of inclusion into his work by combining academic dance elements with popular traditions on the streets, which he then raised to a national level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This new dance language not only reflected Cuban history and experience, but also provided space to accommodate the rapidly changing culture. Guerra had the dream to bring together groups of dancers from different cultural backgrounds to contribute to the Cuban [[ajiaco]], or stew. His dance company consisted of 12 white and 12 black dancers from both amateur and professional backgrounds of Afro-Cuban dance, nightclub dance, and ballet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''La técnica cubana'' constantly transcended the boundaries of dance with respect to behavior, culture, and aesthetic. The group that Guerra founded and led for eleven years is presently known as [[Danza Contemporanea de Cuba]] and is now led by Miguel A. Iglesias Ferrer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gahl|first=Elizabeth|date=October 2014|title=The Cuban dance construct: A mechanism for creative agency and identity formation|url=|journal=ProQuest|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Identity ===
One of the critical aspects of the founding of ''la técnica cubana'' was to strengthen national identity and heighten the pride of ''cubanidad'', or ‘Cuban-ness.’ This idea of national identity had its roots in the [[Cuban Revolution]], where one of the major goals was to establish a sense of Cuban nationalism not embraced since the rule by [[Spain]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The revolutionary regime reinvigorated Cuba’s strong dance heritage in order to provide a unifying factor for the Cuban people. Thus, ''la técnica cubana'' was founded to reflect Cuba’s legendary dance heritage and its diverse population, while regaining a symbol of national identity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essays on Cuban History: Historiography and Research|last=Peréz|first=Louis|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=1995|isbn=978-0813013299|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State support for dance in Cuba not only created a new technique and style, but also a sense of identity and value for Cuban dancers; contemporary dance was part of a movement toward Cuban creativity and individuality. The artistic expression of ''técnica'' resonated with the Cuban audience. Ramiro Guerra, known as the founder of ''técnica'', created his choreography “in search of a certain ''cubanía'' in his style of dance.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''La técnica cubana'' played a crucial role in revitalizing Cuba’s vibrant dance community and was a key contributor to the expanding Cuban national sentiment. The national sentiment of Cuba today is still influenced by the original creation of ''técnica'' and its continued growth throughout the years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Plurality of Influences ==
[[File:Banrarra Afro-Cuban dance troupe, Havana Jan 2014, image by Marjorie Kaufman.jpg|thumb|Bán Rarra, a Cuban rumba dance group, in Havana, Cuba|266x266px]]
''La técnica cubana'' is a hybrid of Afro-Cuban dance traditions, European [[ballet]], [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], [[flamenco]], Cuban nightclub cabaret, and North American dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal in creating ''técnica'' was to establish a distinctly Cuban modern dance form that represented Cuba’s multicultural population.

The major African dance traditions currently in Cuba are derived from four major African groups: [[Efik people|Carabali]], [[Kongo people|Kongo-Angolan]], [[Arará]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; African heritage is characterized by dance rituals and orisha worship. Each [[orisha]], or spirit, has his or her own gestures, footwork and rhythms that correspond to Yoruba legends and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Afro-Cuban Religiosity, Revolution, and National Identity|last=Ayorinde|first=Christine|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=2004|isbn=978-0813027555|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive features of Afro-Cuban dance traditions, such as movements of the arms and head and presence of vibrant music, are incorporated within ''la técnica cubana. Técnica'' celebrates the vibrant African heritage and fuses aspects of their dance technique into ''técnica''’s style.

European ballet techniques are also highly prevalent in ''técnica''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; European ballet is characterized by big turns, multiple jumps and precise balance. ''Técnica'' dancers are well known for their high jumps and completion of multiple turns across stage, as so are their balletic counterparts. Ballet also boasts a strong lower body foundation, which is coupled with the African-tradition use of the arms and fused into ''técnica''’s technique. European ballet style is also a key component of the training of ''técnica'' dancers. Ballet, with its international fame, contributes to the style of ''técnica'' alongside Afro-Cuban dance traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Flamenco en el Palacio Andaluz, Sevilla, España, 2015-12-06, DD 07.JPG|thumb|Use of the hands in Flamenco dance]]
''Técnica'' also included aspects of rumba, a traditionally Cuban dance that arose as a secular genre of Cuban music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rumba: Dance and Social Change in Contemporary Cuba|last=Daniel|first=Yvonne|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0253209481|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stylistic techniques of the elongated torso and flexed posture in rumba are present in the stance of ''técnica'' dancers: knees are bent and the body is tilted forward from the hips. ''Técnica'' combines the rhythms, chants and posture of rumba and incorporates them into the multifaceted style of ''la técnica cubana''.

Influences from the Spanish-based Flamenco dance can also be seen in ''técnica''. The vibrant use of the arms and hands in the dance technique of técnica is derived from ''floreo'', flourishes of the hand, and ''[[Glossary of ballet|port de bras]]'', arm movement, in Flamenco dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The dance elements and techniques from these strong dance forms are all reflected or subtly referenced in ''técnica''. ''La técnica cubana'' merges a unique blend of indigenous and external dance forms to create a new modern form that is the heartbeat of Cuban dance.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It is a hybrid dance form, intertwining many of the dance legacies in Cuba, all while still grounded in the modern, social context of Cuba. ''Técnica'' was created intentionally to reflect the diversity of Cuban culture and to include a plurality of dance influences.

== Dance Technique ==
The dance technique of ''la técnica cubana'' is athletic and powerful, reflective of the multitude of dance influences from Africa, Europe, North America, and Cuba. ''Técnica'' dancers are known to jump higher, undulate faster, and complete more turns than their dancer counterparts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Técnica is demanding and dynamic, producing dancers that move with remarkable ease.

A class in ''la técnica cubana'' begins with a warm up on the center floor and barre exercises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dancers alternate between parallel, first position, and second position. The warm up includes stretching of the upper body and hamstrings by extending the torso and arms in various directions. Guerra credits Afro-Cuban folkloric dance for the torso and pelvis movements prevalent in ''técnica''. He states, “The use of the pelvis is highly developed in our dances. Its instinctive for us. And all of the upper torso work is not only like this, but also in torsion.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the torso and pelvis movements, hip rolls, relevés, drops to plié and neck twists usually follow the warm up, starting on one side and repeating on the other.
[[File:Banrarra Afro-Cuban dance troupe 3, Havana Jan 2014, image by Marjorie Kaufman.jpg|thumb|Expressive nature of Cuban dance|276x276px]]
Although the warm up includes many techniques derived from European ballet, such as [[Glossary of ballet|relevés]], [[Glossary of ballet|pliés]], [[Glossary of ballet|tendus]], and [[Arabesque (ballet position)|arabesques]], the sequences themselves are composed of unparalleled elements. Dancers execute big jumps while traveling across the floor, incorporating turns and extensions. They balance on the balls of their feet, drop their bodies to the floor and leap up in a large split. One main characteristic of ''técnica'' is the large jumps, which range from barrel turns to ''tours en I’air'' to standard leaps.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The final portion of the class includes a cool down that incorporates the rhythms of several orisha images.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The gentle walks are combined with undulating the spine and shaking the rib cage.

Improvisation also plays a large role in the choreographing of ''técnica''. Guerra explains, “improvisation comes from popular dances, and from African tradition. We are very conscious of rhythm; we can do one rhythm with our hands and another with our feet, and this comes in part from flamenco.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One hallmark of a ''técnica'' class is the use of a musical ensemble.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A mixture of guitarists, drummers, singers, and flute players accompany every class, playing a variety of music types ranging from orisha songs, Afro-Cuban folklore, and country tunes. If the musicians play a familiar folk melody, the dancers join in singing all together. The presence of live music transforms the dance studio and affects the rhythm and kinetics of the dance techniques. After observing a ''técnica'' class at the National School of Dance, Suki John reflects, “the variations in dynamic and speed by the rhythmic complexity of the music affect the feeling of the movement profoundly.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The incorporation of live music is unique to ''técnica'' and links the dance technique to its Cuban heritage.

The dance technique of ''la técnica cubana'' is unique and expressive, and it encompasses a variety of other dance styles. ''Técnica'' is ever changing and the technique continues to evolve on stage where dancers and choreographers alike speak to changing times.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''"Left Bank Two"''' is a piece of [[Production music|library music]] composed by Wayne Hill in 1963 and performed by the Noveltones, a group of session musicians from the [[Netherlands]]. It is best known in UK popular culture as the music used in "The Gallery" sequence during the children's television programmes ''[[Vision On]]'', in which the art sent into the programme by young viewers was displayed, and subsequently in the equivalent segment in early series of ''[[Take Hart]]'', a programme presented by [[Tony Hart]], formerly a co-presenter on ''Vision On''.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7837849.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Magazine &amp;#124; A bit of vibraphone nostalgia |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used later on in the 2000s for the Gallery segment in ''[[SMart]]''.

However, the tune almost never got recorded.  The session musicians who were recording a number of library music pieces for De Wolfe had some studio time left over on their session, so the question was asked "Does anyone have anything else they'd like to try?" to which the young vibes player, Wayne Hill, replied "Well, there is this thing I've been working on …" and produced the tune which is now so famous.  Wayne and the other musicians quickly completed the composition and recorded it on the spot as a "throwaway" piece in their left-over studio time.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The piece has become synonymous with the making of art for those growing up in the 1970s, and has been used in a number of adverts for clients including [[Volkswagen]] and [[Castrol]] Oil.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
The track was used as background music in the 2008 [[PlayStation 3]] video game ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]'' and used again in ''[[LittleBigPlanet 2]]'', the latter as an 8-bit version of the track. It has also been used in a 2011 advertisement for the British supermarket chain [[Waitrose]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The track was used during seasons seven and nine of NBC's ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', and during season two of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|the X Factor]]'' Also, the BBC panel show ''[[QI]]'' features it in some episodes.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

'''Leçons de ténèbres''', literally translated ''lessons of darkness'', is a genre of French [[baroque music]] which developed from the [[polyphonic]] [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet|lamentations]] settings for the [[tenebrae]] service of Renaissance composers such as [[Sermisy]], [[Carlo Gesualdo|Gesualdo]], [[Thomas Tallis|Tallis]], and [[Tomás Luis de Victoria]] into virtuoso solo chamber music.

==''de'' or ''des'' Ténèbres?==
In the original French sources '''Leçons de ténèbres''' is more common; The spelling '''Leçons des ténèbres''' is increasingly common in later resources, however modern sources still use '''de'''; as seen in Sébastien Gaudelus ''Les offices de Ténèbres en France, 1650–1790'' (2005). Capitalisation of ténèbres varies.

==Liturgical function==
The [[tenebrae]] service uses the text of the [[Lamentations of Jeremiah]], originally deploring the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)]] and subsequent desolation of the city, but applied allegorically to the three days of mourning for Christ between his crucifixion and resurrection.

However the context of the French ''Leçons de ténèbres'' was often private performance. Delalande's 15-year-old daughter sang for Louis XIV first in his living rooms and then in chapel, becoming the praise of all Paris. Philidor's catalogue indicates that Delalande's three surviving virtuoso solo Leçons de ténèbres were composed for such occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 5. Leçons des ténèbres in Lionel Sawkins, John Nightingale, ''Michel-Richard de Lalande (1657–1726)''  British Academy&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete set of Leçons de ténèbres for the full three days of [[Holy Week]] would have included nine lessons, with each of these leçons requiring the setting of specific texts from Lamentations, although the conventions of exactly which texts to set varied slightly from the Renaissance to the Baroque, and by local custom. The following represents the typical French baroque schema set by [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]],&lt;ref&gt;per Jacobs and Lesne recordings, C. Cessac ''Charpentier'' appendix, but see also [http://www.medieval.org/emfaq/misc/lamentations.htm Emfaq, Lamentations] for comparisons with other composers&lt;/ref&gt; which follows the order of the Roman Breviary of St. Pius V as it was promulgated after the [[Council of Trent]] in 1568.

:Holy Wednesday
* ''Première leçon pour le mercredi Saint'' – 1:1–5
* ''Deuxième leçon pour le mercredi Saint'' – 1:6–9
* ''Troisième leçon pour le mercredi Saint'' – 1:10–14
:Holy Thursday
* ''Première leçon pour le jeudi Saint'' – 2:8–11
* ''Deuxième leçon pour le jeudi Saint'' – 2:12–15
* ''Troisième leçon pour le jeudi Saint'' – 3:1–9
:Good Friday
* ''Première leçon pour le vendredi Saint'' – 3:22–30	
* ''Deuxième leçon pour le vendredi Saint'' – 4:1–6
* ''Troisième leçon pour le vendredi Saint'' – 5:1–11

However, in practice composers rarely supplied a complete set of all 9 settings. A notable exception being Charpentier who authored a complete set ''Les Neuf Leçons de ténèbres'' (H. 96–110) and duplicated all the settings several times over.&lt;ref&gt;[[Catherine Cessac]], Reinhard G. Pauly ''Marc-Antoine Charpentier'' 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the services required antiphons and supplementary motets – 9 for each day, 27 in total. Charpentier again produced extensively in this genre, such as his ''Les neuf répons du mercredi saint'' (H. 111–119, 120–125, 135–137). As with the lessons the French répons are stylistically differentiated from the Renaissance [[responsories for Holy Week]] of Victoria and Gesualdo.

==Musical style==
The characteristic style of the Leçons de ténèbres is defined by the trend to soloist virtuoso performance, for one or two vocalists with [[basso continuo]], and introspective and melismatic music – specifically in the melismas on the Hebrew letters introducing each Latin verse.

By way of contrast the larger scale choral and orchestral lamentations of provincial composer [[Jean Gilles (composer)|Jean Gilles]] stand outside the mainly Parisian genre, and more in line with the lamentations of Central European baroque composers such as [[Zelenka]] and [[Johann David Heinichen|Heinichen]].

==Composers==
Of the settings by far the best known are the [[Leçons de ténèbres (Couperin)|Leçons de ténèbres of Couperin]], however Couperin's were not the first nor was he the most prolific composer in the genre:&lt;ref&gt;Sébastien Gaudelus ''Les offices de Ténèbres en France, 1650–1790'' – 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Michel Lambert]] 1689&lt;ref&gt;The Harvard biographical dictionary of music Don Michael Randel&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Michel Richard Delalande]] before 1711 – one setting each for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday survive.
* [[François Couperin]] 1714, [[Leçons de ténèbres (Couperin)|3 settings for Wednesday]] survive, the other 6 settings for Thursday and Friday are lost.
* [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] – many complete settings.
* [[Nicolas Bernier]]
* [[Jean-Baptiste Gouffet]]
* [[Joseph Michel]] 1688–1736
* [[Charles-Henri de Blainville]]
* [[Guillaume Bouzignac]]
* [[Michel Corrette]]

Later composers who in part followed the French chamber style in their settings of lamentations include:
* [[Joseph-Hector Fiocco]]
* [[Franz Xaver Richter]]
* [[Arnaud Dumond]] – Suite of nine nocturnes for solo guitar

==Selected recordings==
* [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] – [[Judith Nelson]], [[Anne Verkinderen]] (sopranos), [[René Jacobs]], [[Concerto Vocale]] René Jacobs, 1979.
* [[François Couperin]] - [[Hasnaa Bennani]], [[Isabelle Druet]], [[Claire Lefilliâtre]] (sopranos), [[Vincent Dumestre]], [[Le Poème Harmonique]], 2014. 
* [[Michel Richard Delalande]] - [[Claire Lefilliâtre]] (soprano), [[Vincent Dumestre]], [[Le Poème Harmonique]], 2002.
* [[Michel Richard Delalande]] - [[Sophie Karthäuser]] (soprano), [[Sébastien Daucé]], [[Ensemble Correspondances]], 2015.

'''''Love Torn in a Dream''''' (French: '''''Combat d'amour en songe''''') is a 2000 film directed by [[Raúl Ruiz (director)|Raúl Ruiz]]. The film's narrative spans nine interweaving stories, most of which take place in the 17th or 18th centuries, which feature fantastical characters such as pirates, nuns, young priests, a cannibal, a sultana, the Devil, and many more. To further complicate the already dizzying web of tales, many different characters are played by the same handful of actors across stories. This theme of the same individual portraying numerous identities extends beyond the limits of this one film (as many of Ruiz's themes do) and can be viewed in the larger context of Ruiz's work: for instance, lead actor [[Melvil Poupaud]] is someone who has been in several of Ruiz's films since his childhood. In 1983, at age ten he starred in Ruiz's ''[[City of Pirates]]'' and went on to act in ''[[The Insomniac on the Bridge]]'', ''[[Treasure Island (1985 film)|Treasure Island]]'', ''[[Three Lives and Only One Death]]'', and ''[[Genealogies of a Crime]]''.

Produced by [[Gemini Films]], Madroga Filmes, [[Canal+]], Radiotelevisao Portuguesa, among others, ''Love Torn in a Dream'' premiered August 20000 at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] where it won for its category. From there, it went on to be released in France November 2000, Portugal May 2001, the Netherlands January 2002 at the [[International Film Festival Rotterdam]], and Poland October 2002 at the Warsaw Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0252335/releaseinfo?ref_=ttco_sa_2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Opening in black and white with a puzzlingly self-aware narrated scene of ''Love Torn Within a Dream'' producer Paulo Branco welcoming the cast at a celebratory ceremony, the film quickly establishes (with the help of an illustrated configuration upon a chalkboard, one that explicitly references the theories of [[Ramon Lull]]’s ''[[De Arte Combinatoria|ars combinatoria]]'', one of Ruiz’s ongoing artistic preoccupations) that there are nine stories that will weave in and out of each other throughout the film: The Meditations, The Robber Mirror, Twenty Two Rings, The Healing Painting, The Discussion, The Pirate’s Treasure, The Prophetic Site, The Castle of Dreams, and The Traveling Companion. Through overlapping threads and exchanged objects, these nine stories form some supposed twelve in total, though the situation becomes increasingly jumbled and less clear as the film goes on. A handful of actors portray different characters across storylines and centuries – Lucrezia, the nun-turned mystical nymph is played by the same woman ([[Elsa Zylberstein]]) who portrays modern-day Jessica who interacts with Paul, a student disturbed by a website foretelling his future. Paul is played by the same actor ([[Melvil Poupaud]]) who plays the troubled young Catholic who discovers he is Jewish, while many pirates and thieves, corpses and even the devil exchange actors in less pronounced roles throughout the film.

Themes of a young [[theology]] student grappling with doubts over institutional ideologies and hypocrisy, the dangerous power of storytelling, shifting and self-proclaimed denial of identities, as well as piracy, charmed objects which act upon the bearers rather than the other way around, maps, and cannibalism are all recognizable as curious preoccupations and trademarks of Ruiz’s work to any seasoned fan.

==Cast==
*[[Melvil Poupaud]] as Paul, the young priest, doubting twin brothers
*[[Elsa Zylberstein]] as Lucrezia, Jessica, the sultana
*[[Lambert Wilson]] as Sebatol, pirate
*[[Christian Vadim]] as David, pirate thief
*[[Marie-France Pisier]] as mother, married woman
*[[Rogerio Samora]] as Baniel, pirate
*[[Diogo Dória]] as Mariani, painter, father

==Reception==
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' identified it as "witty diversion for upscale auds," perhaps hinting at the lofty, enigmatic narrative games it plays, praised it as "another sly, spry intellectual game", but complained about the excessive length of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|title=Review: 'Love Torn in Dream'|url=https://variety.com/2000/film/reviews/love-torn-in-dream-1200464220/|website=Variety Magazine|publisher=Variety Magazine|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' found it impossible to summarize, and suggested it was a kind of self-parody of Ruiz's earlier films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/films-a-l-affiche/combat-damour-en-songe-2/ Combat d’amour en songe], Les InRocks&lt;/ref&gt;
Dennis Schwartz, of [[Ozus' World Movie Reviews]], gave this "idiosyncratic film" a B- on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and described it as "an acting exercise to show-off the film-makers rich imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Dennis|title=It Veers from Being Silly to Profound|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/lovetorninadream.html|website=Ozus' World Movie Reviews|publisher=Ozus' World Movie Reviews|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Love Torn in a Dream'' won the [[FIPRESCI Prize]] (International Press Award) in [[Montreal World Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards of Montreal World Film Festival - 2000|url=http://www.ffm-montreal.org/en/awards/17-awards-of-the-montreal-world-film-festival-2000.html|website=Festival des Films Monde|publisher=Festival des Films Monde|accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
[[Jorge Arriagada]] composed the music and score of this film. He has worked with Ruiz on forty-four different films since their first collaboration on Ruiz's 1977 ''[[Colloque de chiens]]''. Arriagada is the youngest composer to have won a [[Guggenheim fellowship]], which he did at age 29 in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jorge Arriagada|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005948/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|website=IMDb|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luzhanqi''' ({{zh|c=陸戰棋|p=lùzhànqí}}) (lit. “Land Battle Chess”) is a two-player [[China|Chinese]] [[board game]] . There is also a version for four players. It bears many similarities to [[Dou Shou Qi]], [[Game of the Generals]] and the Western board game [[Stratego]]. It is a [[abstract strategy game|non-perfect abstract strategy game]] of partial information, since each player has only limited knowledge concerning the disposition of the opposing pieces. Because of the Chinese nature of the game, terms used within the game may vary in translation.

Luzhanqi is mainly played by children as a precursor to games like [[xiangqi]] and [[Go (game)|weiqi]],&lt;ref&gt;Haiwang Yuan; ''The magic lotus lantern and other tales from the Han Chinese'', Libraries Unlimited, 30 May 2006 {{ISBN|978-1-59158-294-6}} p52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terill, Ross; ''Flowers on an iron tree: five cities of China'', Little, Brown, 1975 p199&lt;/ref&gt; but people of other ages may also enjoy it as a game of leisure.

==Objective==
The aim of the game is to capture the opponent’s flag through penetrating his defenses, while trying to prevent him from capturing the player's own flag.

==Board==
The Luzhanqi board has a number of features which affect how pieces move.

*'''Post''' (兵站) - also ''Soldier Station'': a normal space, marked as a rectangle on the board. Pieces can move on or off these spaces at will, and can be attacked and captured on them.
*'''Roads''' - usually marked as thin lines on the board. A piece can only travel one space across a road at any time.
*'''Railroads''' – usually marked as thick lines on the board, a piece can travel any number of spaces along a railroad in a straight line, as long as its path is not obstructed by another piece.
*'''Campsite''' (行营) – marked as a circle on the board, with 5 in each player's territory. A piece on a campsite cannot be attacked.
*'''Mountains''' (山界) – pieces cannot move over these two spaces.
*'''Frontlines''' (前线) – these three spaces are the only points at which a piece can enter the opponent’s territory. Pieces do not land on these spaces, they pass over them.
*'''Headquarters''' (大本营) – positioned at two sides of the central axis at the sixth rank of the player's territory, the Flag must be placed on one of these two spaces. It, together with the other piece placed on the other headquarters, must not move after the game starts.

==Pieces==
[[File:HK 軍棋 Land Battle Chess.jpg|thumb|300px|The pieces]]
Each player has 25 pieces, which are identical except for markings on one side. They are listed here in order of order, where any piece of a higher order may capture one of lower order (if the enemy is of the same order, both pieces will be removed from the board). Each player has:

*one '''Field Marshal''' (司令), order 9
*one '''General''' or Army Commander (军长), order 8
*two '''Major Generals''' or Division Commanders (师长), order 7
*two '''Brigadier Generals''' or Brigade Commanders (旅长), order 6
*two '''Colonels''' or Regiment Commanders (团长), order 5
*two '''Majors''' or Battalion Commanders (营长), order 4
*three '''Captains''' or Company Commanders (连长), order 3
*three '''Lieutenants''' or Platoon Commanders (排长), order 2
*three '''Engineers''' or Sappers (工兵), order 1
*two '''Bombs''' (炸弹)
*three '''Landmines''' (地雷)
*one '''Flag''' (军旗)

Some of these pieces have special features and abilities:

*'''The Engineers''' are the only pieces which can turn corners when travelling along the Railroad. Engineers can also capture Landmines without being removed from the board.
*'''Bombs''', when in contact with any opponent piece, destroy both itself and the piece. They may capture the opponent's flag. Bombs cannot be placed on the front line (the first rank) during the initial set-up.
*'''Landmines''' are immune to any attack, and cause the destruction of attacking pieces (except when attacked by an Engineer or destroyed by a bomb). Depending on the ruleset used, Landmines may or may not be removed from play following a capture. Landmines may only be placed on the fifth and sixth ranks during set-up. The Landmine cannot move from its original position.
*'''The Flag''' must be placed on one of the two Headquarters spaces on the sixth rank. It cannot move. Its capture brings the victory of the attacker and ends the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancientchess.com/page/play-luzhanqi.htm |title=Luzhanqi rule booklet at |publisher=Ancientchess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when '''Field Marshal''' is destroyed, the Flag must be revealed to the opposing player.

==Gameplay==
Both players begin by arranging their pieces on their half of the board, with the markings that indicate rank facing towards them (and hence invisible to the opponent). Some version allows the pieces to be placed face up, allowing both players to see them. Initially, all pieces must be placed on posts or headquarters; bombs may not be placed on the first rank, landmines must be placed on the last two ranks, and the flag must be placed in one of the headquarters spaces.

Play then proceeds by turns, with each player moving one piece per turn. On each move a piece may move to any connected adjacent space, or use the Railroad lines to travel to more distant spaces.

When a piece lands on a space occupied by an opposing piece, the respective orders of the two pieces are compared (either by the players or by an '''independent referee'''). The lower-ordered piece is removed from the board; if the two are of equal order, both are to be removed from the board. Special pieces (see above) also play their respective roles.

As soon as a player's Field Marshal (order 9) is lost (having collided with the opposing Field Marshal, or was destroyed by a bomb or landmine), he must declare so by revealing the headquarters in which his Flag is placed.

When a player attacks his opponent's headquarters, he will win the game if he enters the one with the flag; if he picked the other headquarters, then normal attacking rules apply, and if the attacking piece captures the headquarters piece, it must remain there and not move, revoking its purpose as a piece. However, with this, it becomes obvious to the attacking player that the flag must be planted in the other headquarters. (Some variants do not include this rule.)

==Strategies==
It is feasible to send the Brigadier Generals or Major Generals (order 6 and 7) to attack the opponent's pieces, for these pieces are effective in getting rid of lower-ordered pieces and identifying those of higher order. Smaller-ordered pieces can be used to infiltrate the opponent's campsites, while Engineers are employed to remove landmines when the route to the opponent's fifth and sixth ranks is clear. Bombs should be sent to campsites as soon as possible to prevent accidental bombing, and should only be employed to destroy the highest-ordered pieces of order 8 and 9, to defend one's own flag from being captured, or to destroy a blocking landmine. The arrangement of landmines and nearby pieces should also be carefully thought out to secure the defense of the headquarters.

==Four-player version==
[[File:Junqi Gameboard.svg|thumb|A typical 4-player Junqi gameboard]]

One of the main spin-offs of Luzhanqi is derived from arranging a board for four-players, with each taking up a territory adjacent to another at 90-degree angles. Players at opposite ends team up to defend against the other pair; the game ends when both players of a team has their flags captured, or when all sides are unable to defeat each other and thus agree to a draw.

If a player has his flag captured, he must admit defeat, thus removing all of his pieces off the board. He may also do so by resigning if his situation looks hopeless. In this case, if his ally across the board is still in the game, the game continues; otherwise, it ends with the victory of the other team. Even if a player admits defeat or resigns, his team may still win if his ally is able to defeat both opposing teams.

As shown in the diagram, there will no longer be Mountains or No-man's Lands, for the 9 shared spaces in the middle of the territories will be public territory. There are now curved railroads, where the rule for railroads still apply across the curve for all pieces: in a single turn, moving pieces can still travel along any part of the yellow line in the diagram, but not in the direction of the arrow. Engineers are still spared from this restriction and may move to any space accessible via railroads.

==Other variants==
There are many variant rules of Junqi. Before a game, players usually decide which rule to use.

===Common===
*"''Flying Bombs''": Under this rule, Bombs move the same way Engineers do.
*"''Explosive Mines''": Under this rule, An attempt by pieces (other than an Engineer) to capture a Mine kills both the moving piece and the Mine, as opposed to killing only the moving piece. An Engineer still captures a Mine. This rule is more common in 2-players game.

===Two players===
*"''Flag Carrier''": Under this regional variant, games are not won by merely capturing flags. In order to win, a player has to let a piece "take" the flag with it, and carries it back to his/her own flag. A piece carrying the flag moves normally, and if it is captured, the Flag returns to the original headquarters it was in. Also, under this variant, pieces do ''not'' become immobile upon entering a headquarters.

===Four players===
*"''Allied Visible''": Under this rule, a player has the right to know his/her ally's piece arrangement, i.e. the rank of all his/her ally's pieces. (In some online games, allied players' pieces are simply made visible to each other.)
*"''All Visible''": Under this rule, all players place their pieces with their marked side up, that is, making all pieces' rank visible to all players, effectively making it an [[abstract strategy game]] of full information.

'''Organizational storytelling''' is a concept in [[management]] and [[organization studies]]. It recognises the special place of [[narration]] in human communication, making narration "the foundation of discursive thought and the possibility of acting in common.&lt;ref name="Gir"&gt;Nicole Giroux and Lissette Marroquin, "L'approche narrative des organisations", Revue française de gestion, 2005/6, No 159, pp.15-42, ISSN 0338-4551.&lt;/ref&gt;" This follows the [[narrative paradigm]], a view of human communication based on the conception of persons as ''homo narrans''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Fisher (professor)|Walter R. Fisher]] 1984. "Narration as a human communication paradigm: The case of public moral argument." ''[[Communication Monographs]]'',51 (March): 1–22. {{doi|10.1080/03637758409390180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business organisations explicitly value "hard" knowledge that can be classified, categorized, calculated, analyzed, etc., practical [[know-how]] (explicit and [[tacit knowledge|tacit]]) and [[know-who]] (social connections). In contrast, [[storytelling]] employs ancient means of passing wisdom and culture through informal stories and anecdotes. The narrative is said to be more "synthetic" than "analytic", and help to: share norms and values, develop trust and commitment, share tacit knowledge, facilitate unlearning, and generate emotional connections.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Sole, Daniel Gray Wilson, "Storytelling in Organizations: The power and traps of using stories to share knowledge in organizations", Learning Innovation Laboratory (LILA), Harvard University, retrieved from LILA Harvard University Web site http://www.providersedge.com/docs/km_articles/Storytelling_in_Organizations.pdf on 2017-12-26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Storytelling is an ingredient to make an idea "stick".&lt;ref&gt;Heath, C. &amp; Heath, D. 2007. ''[[Made to Stick|Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]]''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the business context, storytelling is nowadays also used in [[advertising]]&lt;ref&gt;Recep Yilmaz (editor), "Narrative Advertising Models and Conceptualization in the Digital Age", IGI Global, February 2017. {{ISBN| 9781522523734}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[marketing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.i-scoop.eu/art-storytelling-6-content-marketing-context-questions/|title=The art of storytelling in 7 content marketing context questions|date=2014-07-01|work=i-SCOOP|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
 
== Perspectives ==
Giroux and Marroquin&lt;ref name="Gir"/&gt; distinguish five perspectives in writings on organizational storytelling:

The functionalist perspective sees storytelling as a management tool. It considers a top-down communication (for example, the communication of a boss to his employees), and aims at the efficiency of the transmission. As such, the narration must be brief and consistent with objectives.
&lt;ref name="Gir"/&gt; However, strategic ambiguity is sometimes not a bug, but a feature.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, M. (1984) "Ambiguity as strategy in organizational communication." ''[[Communication Monographs]]'', 51: 227–242. {{doi|10.1080/03637758409390197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interpretative perspective considers the organization as a subjective universe that the researcher can only grasp through the representations that the actors summon in their narrations. The narratives then bear both the central values and culture of the organization and the differences, conflicts and contradictions. Thus, officially promoted values are confronted with those that emerge from the narratives.&lt;ref name="Gir"/&gt; There have been attempts to develop institutional interpretative devices by combining insights from anthropology, literary theory and institutionalism, for example&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Czarniawska|Czarniawska, Barbara]]. 1997. ''Narrating the Organization: Dramas of Institutional Identity.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|978-0226132297}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Antenarrative]]
&lt;ref&gt;Boje, David M.  2001. ''Narrative Methods for Organizational and Communication Research.'' London: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; tries to link retrospective narrative to a living story.

The process perspective, following the work of [[Karl E. Weick]], considers the organization not as a fixed entity but as an organising process that emphasises the interactions and co-construction. The researchers then study the narratives in situations of organizational change, controversy or deliberation. This perspective postulates that actors demonstrate a narrative intelligence, which refers to their "ability to produce and understand stories".&lt;ref name="Gir"/&gt;

The critical perspective emphasizes the asymmetrical relationships within organizations. The narration can be used to "create a culture of submission". The critical feminist prospective focuses on gender differences, revealing how they are created, nurtured, conveyed and challenged by narratives.&lt;ref name="Gir"/&gt;

The postmodern perspective, which is the most recent and controversial, sees society and organization as fragmented. It places textuality at the center of the researcher's approach, and promotes the polyphony of speech. The researcher becomes a narrator by giving a voice to marginalized employees.&lt;ref name="Gir"/&gt;

'''''Oscar's Orchestra''''' is a British children's animated TV series that ran from 1994 to 1996 comprising a total of three seasons and 39 episodes as a BBC Competitor to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Budgie the Little Helicopter]]''. The series was produced by the popular British animation studio [[Collingwood O'Hare|Collingwood O'Hare Entertainment]] (which is also famous for producing other such animated TV series and films as ''[[Dennis and Gnasher (1996 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Captain Zed and the Zee Zone]]'', ''[[The Secret Show]]'' and ''[[Rarg]]'') in association with [[Warner Music Vision]] and [[Europe Images]] and was originally shown on the [[BBC]] as part of their children's block [[CBBC]]. It also aired on the British children's cable networks [[The Children's Channel]] (TCC) and [[Nickelodeon (UK &amp; Ireland)|Nickleodeon]] and has broadcast in over more than 100 different countries worldwide such as [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] in [[Germany]], [[France 2]] in [[France]] and [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] in [[Australia]].

It is set in the distant future, in the year 2743 (735,022,381,604 Tuesdays from the show (The 2743 was calculated with year 735, month 22, week 381 and day 604, as well as from the year the show was released, 1994)) in a city called ''New [[Vienna]]'', and was about a talking piano called Oscar, who rebels against the evil dictator of the world, Thaddius Vent, who has banned music. Oscar and his fellow musical instruments plot against Vent and his henchmen, Lucius and Tank, and his soothsayer, Goodtooth, spouting his catchphrase 'You screamed, master!'. The voice of Oscar was provided by [[Dudley Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb name|0001545|Dudley Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other members of the orchestra included Monty the violin, Trevor the tuba, Sylvia the flute and Eric the triangle. Based on an idea by Jan Younghusband, ''Oscar's Orchestra'' was designed to inspire children with the delights of classical music and incorporates famous orchestrated works from the great composers in each episode such as [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig Van Beethoven]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]]. The programme's opening music is [[Mikhail Glinka]]'s Overture to ''[[Ruslan and Lyudmila (opera)|Ruslan and Lyudmila]]''. The episode titles continue the theme, for example 'Bach To The Future'.

==Characters==
;Oscar the Piano
Oscar the Piano is a blue talking piano, who is a so-called 'illegal instrument.' He is constantly trying to avoid Thaddius Vent's traps, while still doing the thing he loves, which is playing music. Oscar has a brave, strong personality, and was voiced by [[Dudley Moore]] and later by [[David Holt (voice actor)|David Holt]] in season 3.

;Rebecca and Mr. Crotchet
Rebecca (aged 10) and her grandfather, Mr. Crotchet, are the only good humans in this story, and they hide Oscar and his Orchestra in their house. They are constantly having to think of new ideas to avoid Thaddius Vent. They used to run a diner before Oscar and his orchestra came into their lives.

;Thaddius Vent
Thaddius Vent is a dictator. He has banned music, and is helped by his hapless [[henchmen]], Goodtooth, Lucius and Tank. Vent is a small, middle-aged man, who wears a Georgian-style wig. He also talks to his teddy bear, who is called 'Teddy.' Vent's evil schemes are always foiled by Oscar, and his orchestra.

;Lucius
Lucius is the deputy of Thaddius Vent. He is a small man with green skin, greasy hair and a moustache. Lucius always thinks of new ideas, and patrols the streets of [[Vienna|New Vienna]] to find illegal instruments. His pet is Tank, a savage.

;Tank
Tank is a savage. He is Lucius' pet, and has pink skin. Tank always helps Lucius with his schemes, but often ruins them because of his non-existent intelligence. Tank sleeps in Lucius' bedroom in Vent's palace, chained to the end of Lucius' bed.

;Goodtooth
Goodtooth is Thaddius Vent's [[Divination|soothsayer]]. He always introduces himself as 'I, Goodtooth, bringer of potions and portents!' Whenever Goodtooth arrives, he frightens Vent, who screams. Then, Goodtooth replies to Vent by saying 'You screamed, master!' Goodtooth is named that because of the fact he only has one, rotten tooth.

;Others
Other characters in Oscar's Orchestra are the instruments that are part of Oscar's orchestra, who include Monty the Violin, Eric the Triangle, Kevin the Keyboard (created by Tim Wall the winner of a ''[[Blue Peter]]'' competition, to design a new character), Trevor the Tuba, Sylvia the Flute, Louis the Oboe and Crash and Stan the Cymbals.

'''The Outer Space Men''' – also known as the '''Colorform Aliens''' – is a group of seven "bendy" [[action figure]]s (similar to Mattel's [[Major Matt Mason]]) produced by the [[Colorforms|Colorforms Company]] in 1968, they were designed by toy inventor [[Mel Birnkrant]]. The 3.5" to 7" bendable action figures incorporate a pliable metal wire [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] encased in painted soft vinyl bodies with "accordion" joints, just like the aforementioned [[Major Matt Mason]] line, with whom The Outer Space Men were initially designed to be utilized. Each fictional character represents an [[Extraterrestrial life#Extraterrestrial life in the Solar System|extraterrestrial]] being from the planets in our [[Solar System]], as well as various places in our [[Galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy]].

'''Figures in the series include:'''
*Alpha 7, the Man from Mars: A diminutive alien molded in lime green with green skin, a bald, green head with antennae and a metallic blue space suit with a green-tinted (removable) helmet.
*Astro-Nautilus, the Man from Neptune: alien molded in purple with a large, octopoid head (designed after the [[cephalopod]] from the 1961 film ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]''), four poseable tentacles and a metallic gold space suit.
*Commander Comet, the Man from Venus: The most human-looking alien, molded in pink with large, (removable) angelic wings, a pink-tinted, (removable) helmet, and a metallic gold space suit.
*Colossus Rex, the Man from Jupiter: The largest and fiercest-looking alien, molded in lime green and resembling [[Creature from the Black Lagoon|The Creature From The Black Lagoon]], wearing only dark purple shorts over a huge, muscular body.
*Electron+, the Man from Pluto: A bald, robotic-looking alien molded in gray, entirely painted silver with a clear, (removable) space helmet. Resembled the alien from the 1951 movie ''[[The Man from Planet X|The Man From Planet X]]''.
*Orbitron, the Man from Uranus: The tallest alien, molded in pink with the least amount of paint, was an alien with a large, exposed brain, a beak-like mouth, long, gangly limbs and pincers in place of hands. Orbitron was designed to resemble the Metaluna Mutant from the 1955 film ''[[This Island Earth]]''.
*Xodiac, the Man from Saturn: molded in deep red, with a red bald head, pointed ears and chin, a blue metallic space suit with a (removable) pink-tinted helmet and "[[Saturn]]" emblem on chest.

Each character was armed with some type of weapon, and several also included a helmet or other accessory (the accessories/weapons were constructed of hard-cast [[polystyrene]] of various colors).
There was also a proposed second series of characters that never made it to market, although a few prototypical examples, both carded and loose, exist.

'''Figures in the proposed 2nd series include:'''
*Cyclops the Giant from Beyond the Milky Way
*Gamma X the Man from the 4th Dimension
*Gemini the Man from Twin Star Algol
*Inferno the Flame Man of Mercury
*Metamorpho the Man from Alpha Centauri
*Mystron the Man from Hollow Earth

'''Related Products:'''
*Space Warriors Colorforms Playset
*Space Warriors Alpha 7 Puzzle
*Space Warriors Electron+ Puzzle
*Space Warriors Orbitron Puzzle
*Space Warriors Colossus Rex Puzzle

The Puzzles are unusual as some also depict the 2nd series figures.

Unlicensed hollow vinyl knock-off figures were produced by Bullmark of Japan for the Asian markets. Some smaller knock-off figures also exist, both as wired-armature, rubber "bendy" figures and hard plastic figures (included in playsets).

'''Modern Series'''

In 2008, creator Birnkrant partnered with Wall Street specialist Gary Schaeffer to form a company called The Outer Space Men, LLC, which has revived the 'OSM' brand with release of a graphic novel, and a number of related products, including a new series of action figures.

[[Four Horsemen Studios]] was granted the rights to produce new action figures based on the OSM characters, marking the ''first'' time the sculptors have acquired a licensed property to develop on their own. Translucent versions of Waves one and two of this series went on sale as a Comic-Con International exclusive in late July 2010. The new figures are rendered in a smaller 3-3/4&amp;nbsp;inch 'scale', not using wire armatures, but instead utilizing a proprietary Glyos joint system, and were initially packaged in a simple poly. bag with full-color cardboard header, before switching to a standard blister card package. The characters Astro-Nautilus, Inferno, Metamorpho, and Xodiac were chosen for the debut release. Five hundred of each was produced for the event, and availability was split between Internet sale and on-site purchase at the convention. The set of four sold at a retail price of $40;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.storehorsemen.com/ouspmealphwa.html&lt;/ref&gt; both venues sold through this exclusive offering completely in about 24 hours.

This toyline continued for four more years, releasing the following characters throughout its duration, in a wide variety of colours:

*Astro-Nautilus (The Man from NEPTUNE)
*Xodiac (The Man from SATURN)
*Metamorpho (The Man from ALPHA CENTAURI)
*Inferno (The Flame Man from MERCURY)
*Alpha 7 (The Man from MARS)
*Commander Comet (The Man from VENUS)
*Mystron (The Man from HOLLOW EARTH)
*Electron+ (The Man from PLUTO)
*Orbitron (The Man from URANUS)
*Gemini (The Man from the Twin Star ALGOL)
*Cyclops (Giant from Beyond the MILKY WAY)
*Colossus Rex (The Man from JUPITER)
*Gamma-X (The Man from the 4th DIMENSION)
*Terra Firma (The Woman from PLANET EARTH)
*Jack Asteroid (The Man from PLANET EARTH)
*Horroscope (The Woman from SATURN)
*Ohpromatem (The Woman from ALPHA CENTAURI)

In 2018, 4 new characters will be released to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the original toyline:

*Astrodite (The Woman from VENUS)
*Zero Gravity (Man from the Dark Side of the MOON)
*Cthulhu Nautilus (Ancestor of the ELDER GODS)
*Luna Eclipse (Woman from the Dark Side of the MOON)

With presentational acting, the actor acknowledges the audience. With representational acting, the audience is studiously ignored and treated as voyeurs.

In the sense of '''actor-character relationship''', the type of theatre that uses 'presentational acting' in the actor-audience relationship, is often associated with a performer using 'representational acting' in their actor-character methodology. Conversely, the type of theatre that uses 'representational acting' in the first sense is often associated with a performer using 'presentational acting' methodology.

==The actor–audience relationship==

In every theatrical performance the manner in which each individual [[actor]] treats the [[audience]] establishes, sustains or varies a particular kind of '''actor-audience relationship''' between them.

In some plays all of the actors may adopt the same attitude towards the audience (for example, the entire cast of a production of a [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhovian]] drama will usually ignore the audience until the curtain call); in other plays the performers create a range of different relationships towards the audience (for example, most [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespearean]] dramas have certain characters who frequently adopt a downstage 'platea' playing position that is in direct contact with the audience, while other characters behave as if unaware of the audience's presence).&lt;ref name="Weimann"&gt;Weimann, Robert. 1978. ''Shakespeare and the Popular Tradition in the Theater: Studies in the Social Dimension of Dramatic Form and Function.'' The Johns Hopkins University Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-3506-2}} Pbk. See also Counsell, Colin. 1996. ''Signs of Performance: An Introduction to Twentieth-Century Theatre.'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-10643-5}} Pbk. p.16-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentational acting===
{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:45em; max-width: 45%;" cellspacing="1"
| style="text-align: left;" |
Conventionalized '''presentational''' devices include the apologetic [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]], the [[Induction (play)|induction]] (much used by [[Ben Jonson]] and by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]''), the [[Story within a story#Play within a play|play-within-the-play]], the [[aside]] directed to the audience, and other modes of direct address. These premeditated and 'composed' forms of actor-audience persuasion are in effect [[Metatheatre|''metadramatic'' and ''metatheatrical'']] functions, since they bring attention to bear on the fictional status of the characters, on the very theatrical transaction (in soliciting the audience's indulgence, for instance), and so on. They appear to be cases of [[Fourth wall#Breaking the fourth wall|'breaking frame']], since the actor is required to step out of his role and acknowledge the presence of the public, but in practice they are licensed means of ''confirming'' the frame by pointing out the pure facticity of the representation.

'Presentational acting', in this sense, refers to a relationship that acknowledges the audience, whether directly by addressing them, or indirectly through a general attitude or specific use of language, looks, gestures or other [[Semiotics|signs]] that indicate that the character or actor is aware of the audience's presence.&lt;ref name="semiotics"/&gt; (Shakespeare's use of [[pun]]ning and [[Word play|wordplay]], for example, often has this function of indirect contact.)&lt;ref name="Weimann"/&gt;

===Representational acting===
'Representational acting', in this sense, refers to a relationship in which the audience is studiously ignored and treated as 'peeping tom' voyeurs by an actor who remains in-character and absorbed in the dramatic action. The actor behaves as if a [[fourth wall]] was present, which maintains an absolute autonomy of the dramatic fiction from the reality of the theatre.

Robert Weimann argues that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Each of these theatrical practices draws upon a different register of imaginary appeal and "[[Power (sociology)|puissance]]" and each serves a different purpose of playing. While the former derives its primary strength from the immediacy of the physical act of histrionic delivery, the latter is vitally connected with the imaginary product and effect of rendering absent meanings, ideas, and images of artificial persons' thoughts and actions. But the distinction is more than [[epistemology|epistemological]] and not simply a matter of [[poetics]]; rather it relates to the issue of function.&lt;ref&gt;Weimann (2000, 11).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The actor–character relationship==

The use of these critical terms (in an almost directly ''opposed'' sense from the critical mainstream usage detailed above) to describe two different forms of the '''actor–character relationship''' within an actor's methodology originates from the American actor and teacher [[Uta Hagen]]. She developed this use from a far more [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] formulation offered by the seminal Russian [[theatre practitioner]] [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] in chapter two of his acting manual ''An Actor's Work'' (1938).

===Stanislavski's typology===
[[File:Benoit Constant Coquelin.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Konstantin Stanislavski|Stanislavski]] considered the French actor [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin|Coquelin]] (1841-1909) to be one of the best examples of "an artist of the school of representation".&lt;ref&gt;Stanislavski (1936, 21).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{further|Art of representation}}
In "When Acting is an Art", having watched his students' first attempts at a performance, Stanislavski's fictional persona Tortsov offers a series of critiques, during the course of which he defines different forms and approaches to acting.&lt;ref&gt;"When Acting is an Art" is the second chapter of ''[[An Actor Prepares]]'' (Stanislavski 1936, 12-30).&lt;/ref&gt; They are: 'forced acting', 'overacting', 'the exploitation of art', 'mechanical acting', '[[art of representation]]', and his own 'experiencing the role'. One common misrepresentation of Stanislavski is the frequent confusion of the first five of these categories with one another; Stanislavski, however, goes to some lengths to insist that 'two of them deserve to be evaluated as '[[art]]': his own approach of 'experiencing the role' and that of the 'art of representation'. He also makes the concession that so called "mechanical" can appear (when done well enough) to be almost the same as representation in the eyes of the audience, and is therefore occasionally artistic in quality.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to Stanislavski's ''An Actor's Work'', for his conception of 'experiencing the role' see Carnicke (1998), especially chapter five.&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' and 'representing the part' (which Stanislavski identifies with the French actor [[Benoît-Constant Coquelin|Coquelin]]) turns on the relationship that the actor establishes with their character during the performance. In Stanislavski's approach, by the time the actor reaches the stage, he or she no longer experiences a distinction between his or her self and the character; the actor has created a 'third being', or a combination of the actor's personality and the role (in Russian, Stanislavski calls this creation ''artisto-rol'').&lt;ref&gt;See Benedetti (1998, 9-11) and Carnicke (1998, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; In the art of representation approach, whilst on-stage the actor experiences the distinction between the two (the philosopher and dramatist [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] calls this psychological duality the actor's 'paradox').&lt;ref&gt;For Diderot's conception, see Roach (1985), especially the chapter on Stanislavski.&lt;/ref&gt; Both approaches use 'living the role' or identifying with the character during rehearsals; Stanislavski's approach undertakes this process at all times onstage, while the 'art of representation' incorporates the results of the rehearsal process in a "finished" form.

==Confusion of terms==
Due to the same terms being applied to certain approaches to acting that contradict the broader theatrical definitions, however, the terms have come to acquire often overtly [[Contradiction|contradictory]] senses. In the most common sense (that which relates the specific dynamics of [[theatre]] to the broader [[aesthetic]] category of '[[Representation (arts)#History|representational art]]' or '[[Mimesis#Aristotle|mimesis]]' in [[drama]] and [[literature]]), the terms describe two contrasting functional relationships between [[Presentational acting and Representational acting#The actor–audience relationshp|the actor and the audience]] that a performance can create.&lt;ref name="semiotics"&gt;Elam , Keir. 1980. ''The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama''. New Accents Ser. Methuen. {{ISBN|0-416-72060-9}} Pbk. p.90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the other (more specialized) sense, the terms describe two contrasting methodological relationships between [[Presentational acting and Representational acting#The actor–character relationship|the actor and his or her character]] in performance.&lt;ref name="stan&amp;uta"&gt;Stanislavski (1936, 12-32) and Hagen (1973, 11-13).&lt;/ref&gt;

The collision of these two senses can get quite confusing. The type of theatre that uses 'presentational acting' in the first sense (of the actor-audience relationship) is often associated with a performer using 'representational acting' in the second sense (of their methodology). Conversely, the type of theatre that uses 'representational acting' in the first sense is often associated with a performer using 'presentational acting' in the second sense. While usual, these [[Chiastic structure|chiastic]] correspondences do not match up in all cases of theatrical performance.

Stanislavski's choice of the phrase '[[art of representation]]' to describe an artistic approach that diverges from his own has led to some confusion, given that the theatre that is often associated with his own 'experiencing the role' approach (realistic, not acknowledging the audience) is '[[Representation (arts)|representational]]' in the wider critical sense. Uta Hagen's decision to use 'presentational' as a synonym for Stanislavski's 'experiencing the role' served to compound the confusion,&lt;ref name="Uta"&gt;Hagen (1973, 11-13).&lt;/ref&gt; part of the reason she preferred to refer to them more clearly as "formalistic acting" and "realistic acting".&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"&gt;Hagen, Uta 1991.  ''A Challenge for the Actor''. New York: Scribner's.  {{ISBN|0-684-19040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentational versus representational acting===

In their textbooks for actors, both Stanislavski and Hagen adhere to a mode of theatrical performance that starts with the subjective experience of the actor, who takes action under the circumstances of the character, and trusts that a form will follow. They deem it more useful for the actor to focus exclusively on the fictional, subjective reality of the character (via the actor's "emotional memory" or "transferences" from his own life), without concerning himself with the external realities of the theatre.  Both teachers were fully aware of the 'outside' to the dramatic fiction, but they believed that from the actor's perspective these considerations do not help the performance, and only lead to false, mechanical acting.&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanislavski, Constantin 1936. ''An Actor Prepares''. New York, Theatre Arts, Inc. {{ISBN|0-87830-983-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many types of drama in the [[history of theatre]] do make use of the presentational 'outside' and its many possible interactions with the representational 'inside'—[[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare]], [[Restoration comedy]], and [[Epic theater|Brecht]], to name a few significant examples.  However, both Stanislavski and Hagen applied their processes of acting towards these types of drama as well, fully aware of their unique requirements to the audience.  Hagen stated that style is a label given to the "final product" by critics, scholars, and audience members, and that the "creator" (actor) need only explore the subjective content of the playwright's world.  She saw definitions of "style" as something tagged by others onto the result, having nothing to do with the actor's process.

Shakespearean drama assumed a natural, direct and often renewed ''contact'' with the audience on the part of the performer. '[[Fourth wall]]' performances foreclose the complex layerings of theatrical and dramatic realities that result from this contact and that are built into Shakespeare's [[dramaturgy]]. A good example is the line spoken by [[Cleopatra]] in act five of ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1607), when she contemplates her humiliation in Rome at the hands of Octavius Caesar; she imagines mocking theatrical renditions of her own story: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore" (5.2.215-217). That this was to be spoken by a boy in a dress in a theatre is an integral part of its dramatic meaning.  Opponents of the Stanislavski/Hagen approach have argued that this complexity is unavailable to a purely 'naturalistic' treatment that recognizes no distinction between actor and character nor acknowledges the presence of the actual audience.&lt;ref&gt;It is worth qualifying this non-acknowledgment of the audience as of the ''actual'' audience, since Hagen recommends treating moments of direct audience address as if speaking to an audience ''within'' the fictional world of the drama (rather than one that observes that world ''from the outside''). See Hagen (1991, 203-210).&lt;/ref&gt; They may also argue that it is not only a matter of the interpretation of individual moments; the presentational dimension is a structural part of the meaning of the drama as a whole.&lt;ref name="shakespeare"&gt;The complexity of these dimensions of Shakespeare's dramaturgical strategies is outlined in Weimann (1965) and (2000); see also Counsell (1996, 16-23).&lt;/ref&gt; This structural dimension is most visible in Restoration comedy through its persistent use of the [[aside]], though there are many other [[metatheatre|meta-theatrical]] aspects in operation in these plays.

In Brecht, the interaction between the two dimensions—representational and presentational—forms a major part of his '[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]' dramaturgy and receives sophisticated theoretical elaboration through his conception of the relation between ''[[mimesis]]'' and ''[[Gestus]]''. How to play Brecht, in regard to presentational vs. representational has been a controversial subject of much critical and practical discussion.  Hagen's opinion (backed up by conversations with Brecht himself and the actress who was directed by him in the original production of ''[[Mother Courage]]'') was that, for the actor, Brecht always intended it to be about the character's subjective reality—including the direct audience addresses.  The very structure of the play was enough to accomplish his desired "alienation".&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"/&gt;

       Autumn Song

 Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf 
 How the heart feels a languid grief 
         Laid on it for a covering, 
         And how sleep seems a goodly thing 
 In Autumn at the fall of the leaf? 

 And how the swift beat of the brain 
 Falters because it is in vain, 
         In Autumn at the fall of the leaf 
         Knowest thou not? and how the chief 
 Of joys seems—not to suffer pain? 

 Know'st thou not at the fall of the leaf 
 How the soul feels like a dried sheaf 
         Bound up at length for harvesting, 
         And how death seems a comely thing 
 In Autumn at the fall of the leaf? 

                   --[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174271 Autumn Song by Dante Gabriel Rossetti]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4216">'''Residual media''' refers to media that are not [[new media]], but are nonetheless still prevalent in society. The term is offered as an alternative to the term [[old media]]. Residual media attempts to act as a corrective to the idea that when media become old, they absolutely become obsolete, or “dead media.” Residual media “reveals that, ultimately, new cultural phenomena rely on encounters with the old”.&lt;ref&gt;Acland, Charles R. ''Residual Media'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2007), Backcover.&lt;/ref&gt; While old media can, and often does, become obsolete, they do not die. Instead, old media persist in our culture—either in storage units or landfills, or as cultural capital for niche groups—or they can be moved to other parts of the world and other cultures. Regardless of where they end up, the media is not dead, they are still very much living, changing, and evolving. Residual media helps show that the transition between old and new media is not simplistic, well-defined, or sweeping. Examples of residual media include [[film cameras]] and [[film]], [[record players]] and [[LP records]], [[radio]], [[letter (message)|letters]], and [[postcard]]s, etc.

==History==
Residual media was first defined in the edited collection ''Residual Media'' by [[Charles R. Acland]]. The term itself stems from [[Raymond Williams]]' study of culture’s dominant, emergent, and residual forms. The residual forms, Williams says, are “experiences, meanings and values which cannot be expressed in terms of the dominant culture,” but “are nevertheless lived and practiced on the basis of residue—cultural as well as social—of some previous social formation”.&lt;ref name="Raymond 41"&gt;Williams, Raymond. "Base and Superstructure in Marxist Cultural Theory." ''Problems in Materialism and Culture'' (New York: Verso, 1973/1980), 41&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to media, the dominant culture would be new media, while the residual would be the forms of media that have come before, but are still in use regardless of the new supplanting them. Williams’s definition of the residual is also important because it emphasizes that these old forms of media are “still active in the cultural process, not only and often not at all as an element of the past, but as an effective element of the present”.&lt;ref name="Raymond 41"/&gt; Residual media, though antiquated or seen as lesser than the new media, still exist in the present and still affect that which is dominant. The way we interact with the old still informs the way we interact with the new, and the new informs the way we interact with the old. The idea of residual media is closely related to [[Jay David Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin]]'s theory of [[Remediation (Marxist theory)]].

==Examples==
*'''The [[Vinyl revival]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Since 2006, sales of vinyl records, a form of residual media, have been rising while the sales of CDs, new media, have been dropping. In 2012, vinyl sales in the [[United States]] went up 17.7%, while CD sales dropped 13.5%; in the [[United Kingdom]] vinyl sales jumped 15.3%, while CD sales dropped 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/the-turntable-strikes-back/ Digital Trends - The Turntable Strikes Back]&lt;/ref&gt; Digital downloads are still the most utilized method of purchasing music, but vinyl records still remain culturally relevant.
*'''[[Skeuomorph]]ism'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues from structures that were necessary in the original.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Basalla|first=George|title=The Evolution of Technology|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-29681-1|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital skeuomorphs found in places like [[Evernote]], which showed physical notebooks, or Apple iOS6's Notes app, which looked liked a lined reporter's notebook, show how "old media" still exert a pressure on the new. (For more examples see [[Skeuomorphs in popular culture]])

'''Sam Bernard''' (born '''Samuel Barnett''', 5 June 1863 – 16 May 1927) was an English-born American [[vaudeville]] comedian who also performed in [[musical theatre]], [[comic opera]] and [[burlesque]] and appeared in a few [[silent film]]s.

==Life and career==
Bernard was born in [[Birmingham]], England, and moved to the United States as a child.  He began performing a song and dance act with his brother Dick in variety houses in [[Manhattan]], changing their stage name from Barnett as they considered the name Bernard more "ethnic".  Sam went solo in 1884, and joined [[B. F. Keith]]'s theatre company in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].  After a brief tour in England, he returned to the U.S., performed in the Night Owls comedy troupe, and then became the part-owner and leading comedy actor in the French Folly Company.  He was friendly with [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]] and [[Lew Fields]], and in 1890 agreed to manage their troupes, the Russell Brothers Comedians and then the Vaudeville Club touring company, in which Bernard also starred.&lt;ref name=cullen&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XFnfnKg6BcAC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Sam+Bernard+1927&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5vvCqNs9C3&amp;sig=qLG9XGQR8Fa_LqAln2HmaaAqG3A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU3YPQ44vTAhVIJMAKHatOBywQ6AEIVTAP#v=onepage&amp;q=Sam%20Bernard%201927&amp;f=false  Frank Cullen, ''Vaudeville old &amp; new: an encyclopedia of variety performances in America'', Psychology Press, pp.100–101]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

In 1896, Bernard became the star performer in the newly-formed Weber &amp; Fields Music Hall company, and appeared in many of their classic theatre sketches, often performing with Weber and Fields.  He remained with the company until 1902, except for a period in 1899–1900 when he starred with [[Marie Dressler]] in the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''The Man in the Moon''.  After 1902, he worked primarily in [[Broadway musical]]s, including ''[[The Girl from Kays]]'' (1903), in which he created his character Mr Hoggenheimer and starred with [[Hattie Williams]].  His later successes included ''[[The Rollicking Girl]]'' (1905), ''The Rich Mr Hoggenheimer'' (1906), ''The Girl and the Wizard'' (1909), ''He Came From Milwaukee'' (1910); ''All for the Ladies'' (1910); ''The Belle of Bond Street'' (1914); and ''The Century Girl'' (1916).&lt;ref name=cullen/&gt;&lt;ref name="gammond"/&gt;

He began to explore acting in motion pictures in 1915, after he was signed to the [[Triangle Film Corporation]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}  His movies included ''Fatty and the Broadway Stars'' (1915, with [[Fatty Arbuckle]]), ''[[Poor Schmaltz]]'' (1915), ''The Great Pearl Tangle'' (1916), and ''Because He Loved Her'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0076382/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm  Sam Bernard, ''imdb.com'']. Retrieved 4 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to stage [[revue]]s in ''Friendly Enemies'' (1918), ''As You Were'' (1920), and [[Irving Berlin]]'s ''[[Music Box Revue]]'' (1921), and wrote and starred in ''Nifties of 1923''.&lt;ref name=cullen/&gt;&lt;ref name="gammond"&gt;{{cite book| first1= Peter| last1= Gammond| year= 1991| title= The Oxford Companion to Popular Music| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford| pages=55 | isbn= 0-19-311323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5538">&lt;!-- If moved to "Season pass": {{About|the video game business model|real-world tickets|Season ticket}} --&gt;
A '''season pass''' is a discounted package for current and future [[downloadable content]] packs for a [[video game]]. Its name originates from the concept of a [[season ticket]]. The idea has caused controversy due to the fact that they seldom divulge their contents beforehand, and the fact that some season passes do not contain all planned DLC, with some season passes being called scams by the [[gaming press]].

== History ==
One of the first season passes in video games was used by [[Rockstar Games]] with ''[[L.A Noire]]'' in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.take2games.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=86428&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1568889&amp;highlight=|title=Take-Two Interactive Software - Investor Relations - Take-Two News Release|website=ir.take2games.com|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP1004-BLES00933_00-PLANOIREXX000007|title=L.A. Noire Rockstar Pass|website=PlayStation™Store|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same month [[Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment]] continued the trend with ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/125487/Warner_Bros_To_Offer_Season_Pass_DLC_Bundle_For_Xbox_360_Mortal_Kombat.php|title=Warner Bros. To Offer 'season pass' DLC Bundle For Xbox 360  Mortal Kombat|first=Kyle|last=Orland|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronic Arts]] released their EA Sports Season Ticket in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/ea-sports-season-ticket-launches-today|title=EA SPORTS Season Ticket Announces Today|first=Electronic|last=Arts|date=1 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, season passes had become "ubiquitous" in [[AAA (video game industry)|AAA games]], due to their popularity amongst [[Gamer|gamers]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/dear-everyone-its-time-to-stop-buying-season-passes-at-launch|title=Dear everyone: it's time to stop buying season passes at launch|work=PCGamesN|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, season passes continue to be offered for many AAA games, although some publishers began to forgo offering them in favor of free DLC in 2017 due to the negative publicity created by their announcement shortly after release.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/07/10/with-the-apparent-death-of-season-passes-and-15-dlc-did-we-actually-end-up-with-a-worse-deal/|title=With the apparent death of season passes and $15 DLC, did we actually end up with a worse deal? - VG247|date=2017-07-10|work=VG247|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising popularity of [[Loot box|loot boxes]] also played a role in the decreasing popularity of the season pass, although the gaming press has speculated that this may result in less post-release content overall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
Season passes have been criticized for being [[Anti-consumerism|anticonsumer]], as they psychologically pressure customers to spend more money.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also impossible to know if they are worth buying since they cannot be reviewed until they are released, and the discounts they offer are sometimes offset by poor-quality content that the player would otherwise not have bought.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, if games perform poorly, the price of the DLC can fall faster than any discount people would have received by immediately buying the season pass.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Andrew Reiner of [[Game Informer]] called some season passes for 2016 games sounding like "scams coming from money-hungry corporations", due to the fact that such little information is divulged that consumers can be subject to [[bait-and-switch]] tactics like using a lower quality studio to develop the content and delaying the content's release significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/02/01/season-passes-are-starting-to-feel-like-a-scam.aspx|title=season passes Are Starting To Sound Like Scams|website=Game Informer|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar+]] criticized multiplayer season passes as splitting the community of online games, praising games that had instituted a different model that was more dependent on cosmetic DLC rather than downloadable maps, such as ''[[For Honor]]'' and ''[[Titanfall 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/the-multiplayer-season-pass-is-almost-dead-this-is-how-for-honor-and-titanfall-2-are-killing-it/|title=The multiplayer season pass is almost dead, this is how For Honor and Titanfall 2 are killing it|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shacknews]] criticized a number of games for having disappointing season passes, such as ''[[Evolve (video game)|Evolve]]'' and ''[[Aliens: Colonial Marines]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/88266/the-most-and-almost-disappointing-season-passes-of-all-time|title=The Most (and Almost) Disappointing season passes of All Time|website=Shacknews|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The draw-down in season passes in 2017 was "positively received" by a large portion of gamers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Sludge''' is a fictional character in the [[Transformers]] franchise. Sludge is a slow witted but powerful Dinobot. Sludge's strength is considered to be second only to [[Grimlock]]'s in the Dinobot faction. Sludge also has the great power to shake the ground violently and make huge tremors when stomping around in his Brontosaurus mode, which is a good weapon for shaking up [[Decepticon]]s. Sludge also was seen at times to shoot laser beams from his eyes and an energy weapon from his mouth. Sludge's biggest weakness is his belief that the strongest [[Autobot]] should lead and not necessarily the smartest. Another weakness of Sludge's is that he is depicted as being mentally slow. He joined the Autobots in the cartoon and comics in their first year, but didn't have a toy until 1985. The other members of the Dinobots are [[Slag (Transformers)|Slag]], [[Snarl (Transformers)|Snarl]], [[Swoop (Transformers)|Swoop]], and their leader, [[Grimlock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Ultimate Guide | last=Furman | first=Simon | year=2004 | publisher=DK Publishing Inc.| ISBN=1-4053-0461-8 | page= 31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sludge''' ('''Terro''' in [[Québec]], '''Bronto''' in [[Italy]]) is the [[Brontosaurus]] [[Dinobot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0-7643-1364-9 | page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sludge represents both prehistoric times and an ultra-tech future, which are many children's preferred worlds these days.&lt;ref&gt;The New Yorker: Volume 61, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

He is sometimes known as '''Slog'''.

===Marvel Comics===
In the ''[[The Transformers (Marvel Comics)|Transformers]]'' comic series, Sludge was among the Autobots who joined Optimus Prime in his mission on board the Ark to save the planet Cybertron from a meteor shower 4 million years ago. They were attacked by Megatron and his Decepticon forces. After crashing on the planet Earth, they were followed to Earth by the Decepticon named Shockwave.&lt;ref&gt;"Transformers" #4 (March 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Grimlock and his soldiers were reformatted by the Ark's computer [[Teletraan I]] using the last of its energy to resemble Earth native animals. They attacked Shockwave and were buried with him together in a tar pit in the [[Savage Land]] until the 1980s when the Autobot Ratchet recovered and repaired them.

The tar pit had corroded vital systems and the Dinobots lapsed into primitive savagery. Sludge took up a peaceful existence in a swamp, which was discovered by TV journalist Joy Meadows; as a result of the attention she gave to him, Sludge developed a long-standing crush on her. During the Dinobot Hunt, he was captured by Soundwave and made to fight Grimlock, a battle that destroyed a town and which Sludge won before the Autobots could recapture him. Once fully repaired, Sludge's crush on Joy lead him to seek her out and this led the Dinobots to assist her in trying to expose the Robot-Master scam, battling both the Decepticons and the Triple-I intelligence organisation.

Sludge remained tied to the Dinobots and happily followed them in going AWOL, returning to the Ark &amp; supporting Grimlock as leader, battling the Predacons, and joining the Autobot Earthforce.&lt;ref&gt;Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide to comics By Robert G. Weiner page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

He was seemingly destroyed by the Underbase-powered [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]].

Sludges's body was seen among the deactivated Autobots Ratchet was doing his best to revive in Transformers #56, "Back from the Dead".

Along with his fellow Dinobots was one of the first Transformers to be revived by Nucleon. He was part of the united Autobot and Decepticon forces who opposed Unicron's assault on the planet Cybertron in 1991 (Transformers #75).

===Animated series===
Sludge was created by [[Wheeljack]] and [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] on Earth in 1984. He was created along with Grimlock and Slag as the original three Dinobots. At first they rampaged through the Ark and [[Optimus Prime]] ordered that the Dinobots be put offline permanently, but when he and the other Autobots were captured by [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], Sludge and the other Dinobots were used to rescue Optimus and the other Autobots.

Shortly after, Megatron convinced Sludge and the Dinobots that Optimus and the Autobots were their enemies and the Dinobots kidnapped Optimus Prime. Wheeljack and Ratchet, with the help of Chip Chase, created Swoop and Snarl and the two new Dinobots were used to rescue Prime from Grimlock, Slag, and Sludge. During that battle, Optimus saved the original Dinobots' lives and they then realized that the Autobots were really their friends.

In 1985, an Island with real dinosaurs was found by [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]] and [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]]. Optimus decided that Dinobot Island would be a good place for the Dinobots to train and practice their fighting skills, because the Ark was too small for the giant Dinobots. Megatron and the Decepticons found out about the island and wanted to harvest it for all the energy it produced. The Dinobots were thrown in a pit of tar, but were later rescued and got a bunch of real dinosaurs to help them attack Megatron.

Later, the Cybertronian Autobots and Decepticons began to malfunction because they ran out of Cybertonium, a crystalline substance only found on [[Cybertron]]. The Dinobots were made on Earth, so they were the only Transformers not affected and were sent to Cybertron to get some. When they got to Cybertron, they disappeared. Spike and Carly went to Cybertron to find them and found Swoop, who led them to the other Dinobots that were captured and working for [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. Eventually they were freed and brought the Cybertonium back so that the Autobot's bodies could be restored.

In [[The Transformers: The Movie]], the Dinobots came in the shuttle with Optimus Prime towards the end of the attack on [[Autobot City]]. When [[Galvatron]] attacked, they went in the shuttle with [[CHEAR|Kup]] and [[Hot Rod (Transformers)|Hot Rod]]. The shuttle was shot down on [[Quintessa]] and Kup and Hot Rod were captured by the [[Quintessons]]. On Quintessa, the Dinobots met [[Wheelie (Transformers)|Wheelie]], who led them to Kup and Hot Rod and they were able to rescue the two Autobots from the Quintessons. They took a ship to the planet of [[Junk (Transformers)|Junk]] and were with the Autobots when they attacked [[Unicron]]. They helped with the attack on Unicron but were not very effective. Sludge's speaking role in the movie was very limited. He only said "QUIET!" but with Grimlock's voice.

Only Grimlock played a large role in the episodes following the movie, although Sludge and the other Dinobots could be seen from time to time.

In the episode "Call of the Primitives" Primacron's assistant mistakenly called Sludge by the name ''Sweep''.

===Books===
Sludge was featured in the 1985 [[Find Your Fate]] Junior book called ''[[Dinobots Strike Back]]'' by [[Casey Todd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_item.php?id=1144&amp;PHPSESSID=4d7776a874ecb72d37230c8f12a49c24 |title=Dinobots Strike Back |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-345-34150-3|title=Dinobots Strike Back
|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sludge appeared in the 1986 story and coloring book ''[[List of Transformers books#The Lost Treasure of Cybertron|The Lost Treasure of Cybertron]]'' by Marvel Books.

Sludge made a cameo, as with the other Dinobots, in the audiobook Jaws Of Terror.

===Dreamwave Productions===
When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron 8.7 million years ago between the Autobots and Deceptions, Sludge joined the Autobot cause.

When Autobot leader Optimus Prime and Decepticon leader Megatron disappeared in an accident with the space bridge 7.4 million years ago, the Autobot and Decepticon forces broke up into factions. Sludge joined up with the [[Lightning Strike Coalition]] under the command of Grimlock. In The War Within, Sludge's alternate mode is a Cybertronian driller.

Grimlock lead L.S.C. members [[Ironhide]], [[CHEAR|Kup]], Slag, Sludge, Snarl, Swoop and Wheeljack in stealing a shipment of Energon from [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and the Predacons at the Moon Alpha Space Port (Transformers: The War Within - The Dark Ages #1).

[[Ultra Magnus]] reunited the Autobot factions, with Grimlock working as one of his advisors. Sludge became a member of the [[Dynobots]], a special Autobot unit directly under Grimlock's command.

The Dynobots were assigned to security at the peace talks between the Autobots, Decepticons and Ultracons 6 million years ago. It was their actions which saved the participants from being blown up in a sneak attack by Starscream and his [[Predacon]]s (Transformers: Age of Wrath #1).

After Optimus Prime and the crew of the Autobot ship the Ark were lost in space 4 million years ago, the Dynobots formed a search party to recover them. They tracked the Autobot ship to the planet Earth, where the Dynobots were reformatted into mechanical dinosaurs, and Sludge gained his current form. The Dynobots were ambushed by the [[Insecticon]]s, and left in stasis lock until they were discovered by Prime and his crew in the 1980s. Because of their new alternate forms they were renamed the Dinobots.

===Devil's Due Publishing===
In 2004 Sludge was among the Autobots under the leadership Optimus Prime who attempted to take back the planet Cybertron from the Decepticon tyrant [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]]. After an accident with the teleportational systems of the supercomputer [[Teletraan 3]], Slag found himself sent back in time and on the planet Earth. He was reformatted in the form of an Earth [[dinosaur]] with several other Autobots. A group of humans were able to bring the new Dinobots back to Cybertron and they helped overcome Shockwave (G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers II #4).

===IDW Publishing===
In a flashback in ''[[Maximum Dinobots]]'' #1 Grimlock lead the Dynobots in taking a Decepticon energon silo in Sub-Sector Nine on Cybertron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=1590 |title=Preview: The Transformers: Maximum Dinobots #1 |publisher=Comicbookresources.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dinobots-spotlight.jpg|right|thumb|The Dynobots attack Shockwave in Transformers Spotlight #1''.]]
In the [[The Transformers: Spotlight|Transformers Spotlight]] issue on Shockwave, Grimlock and the 'Dynobots' (sporting Cybertronian designs much like their War Within designs) appear in a story that partially homages their Marvel G1 origin. Seeking payback for a humiliating defeat by Shockwave, Grimlock pursued him to prehistoric Earth (which Shockwave was seeding with Energon). In order to protect themselves against Energon surges, the Dynobots required alternate modes covered by a layer of synthetic flesh; Grimlock refused to transform into Ice Age mammals and made the decision to go with dinosaurian forms instead as he thought them more impressive. The Dynobots got the initial jump on Shockwave, as their attack was too illogical for him to understand, but he quickly recovered and blasted the entire team into stasis lock with their synthetic skins destroyed. Grimlock got the final laugh, as the Dynobot ship fired a pre-programmed blast into the surrounding volcanoes to unleash a flow of lava that engulfs all six Transformers until they were uncovered by human paleontologists in 2006.

===Fun Publications===
According to the biography printed in the Transformers Collectors Club magazine, Slag and Sludge were part of Grimlock's band of Decepticon hunters on board the ship ''Graviton''. When Grimlock left Ultra Magnus in charge to join Optimus Prime on Earth, Slag and Sludge departed the ''Graviton'', not wanting to be under the command of Magnus. The two Dinobots went off on their own, and happened across Nightbeat. Nightbeat offered them a job as muscle, which they took because they figured Nightbeat has a nose for finding trouble, which they enjoy.

The Fun Publications 2008 ''Timelines'' Summer Special, entitled "Cheap Shots", features Autobots Nightbeat, Slag, Sludge, and Siren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seibertron.com/news/view.php?id=12187 |title=New Club Exclusive And Transformers Timeline #3 Announced! |publisher=Seibertron.com |date=2015-06-07 |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this story Nightbeat's crew are hired by a sentient ship named Amory to relocate her pilot. After investigating they find the whole job is a trap set by the Decepticon [[Ruckus (Transformers)|Ruckus]], now leading the [[Mayhem Attack Squad]]. Ruckus is holding the pilot hostage, but Slag cuts Ruckus's arm off and recovers the pilot, for which Amory pays them.

Sludge appears in "[[At Fight's End]]".

Kup told the Dinobots and Rodimus the story of how he became a member of the Autobot Elite Guard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Thomas Deer &amp; Josh Perez |date=Spring 2009 |editor=Pete Sinclair &amp; Brian Savage |inker= Guido Guidi &amp; Josh Warner |issue=4 | letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Guido Guidi &amp; Dan Khanna |publisher=Fun Publications |story=[[Wings of Honor]] |title=Transformers Timelines| volume=2 |writer=Forest Lee &amp; Rik Alvarez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botcon.com/BotCon09/ |title=Transformers: BotCon 2009! |publisher=Botcon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media===
Sludge appears in the [[TFcon]] 2008 voice play prelude comic called "Ground Effects" where Grimlock orders the other Dinobots to dig up a Transformer on Dinobot Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meesum Abidi|title=Ground Effects|publisher=[[TFcon]]|others= Illustrator Dylan G.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Sludge appears among the rest of the Dinobots in the 2012 video game ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]''. He is separated from the other Dinobots, wounded and attached to a wall with slime by The Insecticons. It is unknown if he escaped along with the other Dinobots. However he appeared in his Dinobot form in the end credits along with the other Dinobots.{{-}}Sludge is confirmed to appear in "[[Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark]]", meaning that he did survive in Fall of Cybertron and has reunited with his fellow Dinobots and Autobots and will continue to fight against the Decepticons.

===Transformers Prime: Rage of the Dinobots===
Since Sludge appears on the cover of volume 1, it is assumed that he did get out of the cave, reunited with his teammates, and received his Dinobot form.

'''Son of the Bronx''' was a website that compiled [[Nielsen ratings]] data for [[cable channel]]s in the United States. Founded by former [[VH1]] intern Douglas Pucci ([[nickname]] "Son of the Bronx") on the [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] service, it specialized in publishing detailed listings of ratings for various major cable channels, as well as multiple [[sports television]] networks. From its inception in 2011, the site was referenced by numerous sources, using its data for selected cable ratings reports and comparisons of top-performing programs by websites such as [[TV by the Numbers]] and [[The Futon Critic]]. The site shut down on May 22, 2014, following reports of [[copyright infringement]].

==History==
[[File:Son of the Bronx ratings sample.png|thumb|right|upright|Sample table from a post on the site; all posts cite [[Nielsen Media Research]] for ratings data.]]
Son of the Bronx was founded by former VH1 intern Douglas Pucci, whose nickname lends the website's title. From 2011, Pucci published Nielsen ratings data for major cable channels such as [[Cartoon Network]], [[Nickelodeon]], and the [[Hub Network]], as well as multiple sports television networks. Many of the site's ratings, specifically those for [[Adult Swim]] and the Hub Network, were later republished on the television news site TV Media Insights, of which Pucci is a contributor.&lt;ref name="TV Media Insights2013"/&gt; On May 22, 2014, Pucci announced that the site had been site shut down following [[copyright infringement]] reports.&lt;ref name="Pucci2014"/&gt;

==Impact==
From its inception, the site was referenced by numerous sources. Robert Seidman and Bill Gorman, founders of [[TV by the Numbers]], attributed Pucci for use of his data in their selected cable rating reports,&lt;ref name="Seidman2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidman2011b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidman2011c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidman2011d"/&gt; comparisons of top-performing programs,&lt;ref name="Gorman2011a"/&gt; final-day broadcast ratings and time-period breakdowns,&lt;ref name="Seidman2011e"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorman2011b"/&gt;{{efn|TV by the Numbers defines the former term for Friday-broadcast ratings published the following Monday and Sunday-broadcast ratings posed the following Tuesday.&lt;ref name="TV by the Numbers 'Help'"/&gt;}} among others.&lt;ref name="Seidman2011f"/&gt; [[The Futon Critic]], a similar website, also republished Pucci's data for its select cable ratings reports.&lt;ref name="The Futon Critic2011a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Futon Critic2011b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Futon Critic2011c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Futon Critic2011d"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8314">[[File:Flash109.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover to ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' vol. 2 #109 (January 1996), showing the [[Flash (Wally West)|title character]], with fellow speedsters [[Jesse Chambers|Jesse Quick]], [[Bart Allen]], and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] in the background. Art by [[Oscar Jimenez (comics)|Oscar Jimenez]].]]

A '''speedster''' is a character whose powers primarily relate to '''superhuman speed'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also known as '''superspeed'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA; 'Superspeed (fiction)' redirects here--&gt;). Primary abilities shared by all speedsters include running at speeds far in excess of human capability (to varying degrees) and resistance to the side effects (air resistance, inability to breathe, dynamic shock resulting from contact with objects at high speed, etc.) that result from such velocity. In almost all cases, speedsters are able to physically attack opponents by striking them while at high speed to impart huge amounts of kinetic energy without suffering harm, although this has on rare occasion been [[wikt:lampshade#Verb|lampshaded]] by characters discovering that they cannot do this and suffering severe injury from the attempt. A variety of other powers have been attributed to speedsters depending on the story, the origin of the power, and the established continuity and rules of a given universe.

==Plausibility and artistic license==
The use of speedsters in fiction requires [[artistic license]] due to the laws of [[physics]] that would prohibit such abilities.  Moving at the speed of sound, for example, would create [[sonic boom]]s that are usually not heard in such stories.  An enormous amount of energy would be required to achieve such speeds, and as some speedsters can actually move close to or at the [[speed of light]], this would cause them to gain near-infinite mass, according to the laws of [[theory of relativity|relativity]].

For example, the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]'' states that the character [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]] maintains speeds which can be considered "modest," especially when carrying a passenger. The Handbook also concedes that a solid object moving in the Earth’s atmosphere at several times the speed of sound or faster would wreak havoc on the planet and that moving at such speeds would prohibit Northstar from breathing, while the generated wind/friction would ravage his body. On the other hand, the Handbook states that the character [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] was born with adaptations that make higher speeds possible, such as enhanced [[cardiovascular]], [[respiratory]], [[musculature]], and [[Digestion|digestive]] systems, a more efficient [[metabolism]] (which has been a weakness for some incarnations of [[The Flash (2014 TV series)|the Flash]], calling themselves "[[Justice League (film)|snack holes]]"), better lubricated joints, [[tendon]]s with the [[tensile strength]] of spring steel, unidentified bone composition that can withstand the dynamic shock of his touching the ground at speeds over 100 miles an hour, and a brain that can process information fast enough for him to react to his surroundings at high speed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'', by Mark Gruenwald and Peter Sanderson; Volume Five; Pages 55 &amp; 128.&lt;!-- Bibliographic information here is needed. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In comics published by [[DC Comics]], the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] family of speedsters derive their abilities from an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|extradimensional]] energy source known as the [[Speed Force (DC Comics)|Speed Force]], which grants them superspeed and various other abilities required to use it, such as durability.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/speed-force-facts/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Speed Force is not the source from which other DC characters with superspeed such as [[Superman]] or [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel/Shazam]] derive their powers.

Writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] maintained modest abilities for the speedster character Danny Hilltop in his series ''[[John Byrne’s Next Men]]''.  Although Danny can keep pace with a race car, the friction generated by his speed melts any footwear he wears, burning his feet.  Thus he runs barefoot, having toughened the soles of his feet through a regimen of pounding increasingly harder materials (sand, gravel and then broken rock).&lt;ref&gt;John Byrne’s Next Men #7; September 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  The costume he wears has a built-in guidance system.

Other writers choose not to offer any scientific explanations for the questions raised by the actual use of such abilities.

Comic book writer [[Peter David]], whose run on the series ''[[Young Justice]]'' included the junior speedster [[Impulse (DC Comics)|Impulse]], has opined that speedsters are inherently difficult to write, saying:
{{cquote|Speedsters make me nervous, because if you play them accurately, they're impossible to beat...The moment someone sees him coming, it's too late.  You shout, "It's the Flash!" and you haven't even got "It's" out before you're done&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000870.html Question and answer with Peter David]&lt;/ref&gt;...I could deal with Impulse because he was easily distracted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterdavid.malibulist.com/archives/000943.html Further discussion with Peter David]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some speedsters may also end up destroying their surroundings or entire astronomical structures around them by their sheer speed alone if they are not careful enough. For example, [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Saitama|Saitama]] from ''[[One-Punch Man]]'' accidentally destroyed a large portion of the Moon when he jumped back to Earth from it within ten seconds during his battle with [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Boros|Boros]].

==In other media==
[[File:Tachyon1.jpg|thumb|A [[webcomic]] speedster character.]]Speedsters in other media include [[Daphne Millbrook]] (played by Brea Grant), a character in the [[NBC]] television [[superhero]] drama ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]''. Daphne first appeared in that series' third season in 2008, initially as a [[supervillain|villain]].&lt;ref&gt;The character is referred to as a "speedster" on Page 3 of the August 25, 2008 ''[[TV Guide]]'', and refers to herself as such in "[[The Second Coming (Heroes)|The Second Coming]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many characters exist in other media such as [[film]], [[video games]], [[anime]] and [[manga]] who possess the abilities to perform feats at incredible speeds that exceed the abilities of those around them.  Examples include the video game character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], and the animated cartoon characters [[Speedy Gonzales]], the [[Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner|Road Runner]], Morton of ''[[Horton Hears A Who! (film)|Horton Hears A Who!]]'', several [[Ben 10]] Aliens including [[List of Ben 10 aliens#XLR8|XLR8]], [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Jetray|Jetray]], and [[List of Ben 10 aliens#Fasttrack|Fasttrack]], [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]] (and in one case, Pinkie Pie taking on an alter ego called 'Filisecond' in a comic book universe) from ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', [[Saitama (One Punch Man)|Saitama]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Speed o' Sound Sonic|Speed o' Sound Sonic]], [[List of One-Punch Man characters#Flashy Flash|Flashy Flash]] and several other characters of ''[[One-Punch Man]]'', several Stand users and almost all other characters from ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]'', [[Goku]], [[Vegeta]], [[Frieza]], [[Beerus]], [[Whis]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Jiren|Jiren]] and practically every single character in the entire ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise and [[Dashiell Robert Parr|Dash Parr]] of ''[[The Incredibles]]''. [[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)#Cast and characters|Bree Davenport]], the superhero from ''[[Lab Rats (U.S. TV series)|Lab Rats]]'' is the one the characters depend on to take them to mission sights.

'''''Sponsus''''' or '''''The Bridegroom''''' is a [[medieval Latin]] and [[Occitan]] [[Drama|dramatic treatment]] of [[Jesus|Jesus']] [[parable of the ten virgins]]. A [[Liturgical drama|liturgical play]] designed for [[Easter Vigil]], it was composed probably in [[Gascony]] or western [[Languedoc]] in the mid-eleventh century. Its scriptural basis is found in the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'' (25:1&amp;ndash;13), but it also draws on the ''[[Song of Songs]]'' and the [[Church Fathers|Patristics]], perhaps [[Jerome|Jerome's]] ''Adversus Jovinianum''. In certain respects&amp;mdash;the portrayal of the merchants, the spilling of the oil, the implicit questioning of accepted [[theodicy]]&amp;mdash;it is original and dramatically powerful.

"Sponsus" is the Latin word for groom/husband and is a [[cognate]] of the English "spouse". The feminine form is "sponsa" (bride/wife).

==Story==
The play opens with an unnamed narrative voice explaining the [[allegory]] of the parable, the identity of the bridegroom with Jesus, and the [[Gospel]]. This unnamed voice has been identified with both [[Gabriel]] and the [[Christian Church|Church]] (''Ecclesia'') personified. The next speaker of the play, who uses Occitan, is probably Gabriel, though this [[rubric]] is fragmentary and identifies only those whom he addresses: the ''prudentes'', prudent ones. The angel tells the five wise virgins&amp;mdash;the five foolish ones have presumably fallen asleep after ''Ecclesia'''s more general caution&amp;mdash;to attend a groom, Jesus Christ, who came to save them from their sins. He gives them the ominous warning ''Gaire no.i / dormet'': "Don't fall asleep!", which is repeated several times.

After Gabriel's message, the foolish virgins (recognised from the rubric ''fatue'') enter and announce that they have spilled the oil for their lamps. The spilling of the oil was probably acted out for dramatic effect, though the bible knows nothing of it. The foolish then plead with the wise to share their oil, capping each [[strophe]] with the lamenting refrain ''Dolentas, chaitivas, trop i avem dormit'': "We, wretched in our grief, have slept too long!" The wise virgins turn them away without pity, inviting them to buy oil from the [[merchant]]s nearby. The foolish (who now seem wise) only blame themselves, but the merchants, who are presented sympathetically, tell them that they cannot help them and advise them to beseech their sisters in God's name. The merchants' eight lines, which are significant to the dramatic movement, are given in Occitan without any comparable Latin. The dramatist builds tension between the foolish, who are repentant, the wise, who are condescending, and the merchants, who are sympathetic to the foolish and trusting of the charity of the wise. The text's English translator, [[Peter Dronke]], praises the dramatist's clever portrayal and insights into [[human nature]].

The foolish do not follow the merchants' advice, having been twice rebuffed by their wise sisters. The drama ends when ''modo veniat sponsus'': "Now let the bridegroom arrive." ''Christus'' arrives as bridegroom and promptly dismisses the foolish virgins' pleas, sending them away. They are then taken by [[demon]]s to [[Hell]]: the earliest attested appearance of demons in western drama.&lt;ref name=davidson310&gt;Davidson, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Christ's lines are sung to the same melody as ''Ecclesia'''s and the drama closes where it has begun, with the foretold penalty for negligence being meted out by the agents of Hell. It is possible that the play was acted above the stairwell that led to the [[crypt]] and that a [[brazier]] may have sufficed as an inferno for the maidens to be led into by [[grotesque]] demons. There is a possible ''serio-comic'' combination of gravity and levity in the final scenes of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Dronke, pp. 7&amp;ndash;9, who also uses ''fearsome-comic'', derived from  Robert Weimann's ''furchtbare Komik''.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Davidson suggests that the demons must have been portrayed in grim seriousness as personifications of real human fears.&lt;ref name=davidson310/&gt;

==Language and style==
''Sponsus'' is one of the earliest fully dramatic accounts of the parable of the virgins. The pitiless treatment of the foolish virgins, who are portrayed sympathetically, was probably designed to question the official interpretation of the Scriptures. A later medieval [[German language|German]] play on the same theme and style, the ''[[Ludus de decem virginibus]]'' (the [[Eisenach]]er ''Zehnjungfrauenspiele''), so disturbed the [[landgrave of Thuringia]], [[Frederick I, Margrave of Meissen|Frederick I]], and caused him to doubt God's mercy, that he took to his bed ill on 4 May 1321.&lt;ref&gt;Dronke, p. xxi; Davidson, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript in which ''Sponsus'' is  preserved is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Latin 1139, the [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|Saint-Martial]] codex, folios 53r&amp;ndash;55v. It was copied in the late eleventh century in or around [[Limoges]], since the Occitan appears to be the [[Limousin dialect]], though originally it may have been another dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Dronke suggests [[Provençal dialect|Provençal]], which is at odds with its being from "southwestern France" (p. 9).&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably composed in the 1050s or 1060s.

Scholarship is divided over whether the Latin and Occitan parts of ''Sponsus'' were written at the same time (Peter Dronke) or whether the Occitan parts are later additions (D'Arco Silvio Avalle). The latter school of thought regards them as explanations (''[[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]'' or ''farcitures'') of the Latin. Regardless, the vernacular Occitan portions were probably intended for the unlearned audience, who would not be familiar with Latin, as the clerical audience would. Dronke believes the dramatist to be more powerful in his native tongue, and it is in that language that Christ delivers the final lines of the play.

==Melody and poetry==
The music of ''Sponsus'' has been praised by Rafaello Monteross for "redeem[ing] the anonymous poet's colourless paraphrase of the gospel text from its generic inexpressiveness."&lt;ref&gt;''Shakespeare und die Tradition des Volkstheaters'' (Berlin: 1967), quoted in Dronke, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The melodic phrasing is varied, but only four different melodies are used for the entire play, though none of them is liturgical, and none form [[Motif (music)|motif]]s. The entire score is original and is recorded in [[Aquitainian]] [[neume]]s.

The strophic structure of the play is consistent throughout. The two principal metres are fifteen-syllable lines (for the Latin), with antecedents in [[Classical antiquity|classical]] [[trochaic]] [[septenarius|septenarii]], and ten-syllable lines (used for both Latin and Occitan), with predecessors in [[late antique]] and [[Merovingian]] [[hymn]]s. The late antique hymn ''Apparebit repentina dies magna domini'' may have been an inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Dronke, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of original music, unique theme, and implicit questioning of traditional theodicies have led to the suggestion that the play may stand at the very beginning of non-liturgical and vernacular drama in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Hiely, p. 267, remarks on this, while pointing out that the play is found in a large collection of liturgical works.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Vestiarium Scoticum''''' (full title, ''Vestiarium Scoticum: from the Manuscript formerly in the Library of the Scots College at Douay. With an Introduction and Notes, by [[John Sobieski Stuart]]'') was a book which was first published in 1842 by [[William Tait (publisher)|William Tait]] of [[Edinburgh]] in a limited edition. John Telfer Dunbar, in his seminal work ''History of Highland Dress,'' referred to it as "probably the most controversial costume book ever written".

The book itself is purported to be a reproduction, with colour illustrations, of a 15th-century manuscript on the clan tartans of Scottish families. Shortly after its publication it was denounced as a forgery, and the "Stuart" brothers who brought it forth were also denounced as impostors for claiming to be the grandsons of [[Bonnie Prince Charlie]]. It is generally accepted today that neither the brothers themselves nor the ''Vestiarium'' are what they were purported to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Tartans Resources: Vestiarium Scoticum - 1842|url=http://scottishtartans.org/resources/vestiarium.php|website=Scottishtartans.org|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the role of the book in the history of Scottish [[tartan]]s is immense, with many of the designs and patterns contained therein passing into the realm of "official" [[clan]] tartans.

==Background==

The 1842 edition of the ''Vestiarium'' had its beginnings in the late 1820s, when the Sobieski Stuart brothers, then residents of [[Moray, Scotland]], produced a copy of a document containing tartan patterns and showed it to their host, Sir [[Thomas Dick Lauder]], [[Baronet|Bt]]. This manuscript, however, was not the one that the brothers claimed to be the basis for the later publication of the ''Vestiarium''.

As explained in the Preface to the 1842 edition (which is extensively excerpted in Dunbar's ''History of Highland Dress''), the copy which Sir Thomas saw, now known as the Cromarty MS, which bore the date 1721 on the first page and with the title ''Liber Vestiarium Scotia'', was said by its possessors to have been obtained from a certain John Ross of Cromarty, and was said also by them to be an inferior copy of an earlier manuscript.

In this same Preface, it is claimed that the 1842 edition is based on an original manuscript, now known as the Douay MS, whose date was claimed to be 1571 (or earlier), which was at that time in the possession of [[John Lesley]], [[Bishop of Ross (Scotland)|Bishop of Ross]]. This Douay MS is said by the author of the Preface to be the "oldest and most perfect" copy of the ''Vestiarium''. Having once been in the possession of Bishop Ross, it had found its way subsequently into the library of the [[Scots College, Douai|Scots College at Douay]]. From there, it was supposed to have come into the possession of Bonnie Prince Charlie himself, who took over the MS when on a visit to the Scots College in the early 1750s.

==The Lauder–Scott correspondence==

Soon after Sir Thomas saw the book, he wrote of it to [[Sir Walter Scott]], in a letter dated 1 June 1829. In this letter, Lauder highly commended the book, stating that several clan chiefs, such as Cluny MacPherson and McLeod, had derived their "true and authentic" tartans therefrom. Lauder described the manuscript in detail, stating that he had obtained drawings, in colour, of all of the tartans contained therein (about 66 in number) and sent some of these to Sir Walter Scott himself. In addition to material on tartans, the book also contained appendices on women's plaids ([[Highland dress#Historical descriptions|arisaids]]) and on hose and trews. In the end, Lauder urged the brothers to have the book published and made inquiries concerning costs and procedures to that end. A plan was adopted to publish it, illustrated by swatches of silk in the tartan colours and patterns.

In his reply of 5 June 1829 Scott expressed scepticism over the claims of both the brothers Sobieski and the manuscript itself, at the same time requesting that a copy of the MS be sent for investigation by competent authorities in antiquities. Among other things, he disputed the assertion that Lowlanders had ever worn tartans or plaids, questioned the lack of any corroborating evidence (including any in Bishop Lesley's writings even though Lesley was said to have been in possession at one time of the original upon which the present MS was based), and called into question the authenticity of the brothers. He also noted that the title – ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' – was, in his words, "false Latin".

On 20 July 1829 Sir Thomas replied to Sir Walter. In this letter, he describes the (alleged) 1571 original from which the 1721 copy, which he saw, is said to be derived and which was in the possession of the brothers' father in London. Sir Thomas then goes on to discuss the brothers' character, credibility, and society's opinion of them, admitting that the "[[Quixotism]] of the two brothers must render these very unfortunate individuals for the introduction of a piece of antiquarian matter to the world…". He nevertheless reasserts his belief in the authenticity of the MS and goes on to discuss the "false Latin" and the presumed use of tartans in the Lowlands.

In a final letter in this exchange from Scott to Lauder, dated 19 November 1829, Scott rejected again the authenticity of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' and further rejected the notion that Lowlanders ever wore clan tartans. He went further and rejected the entire notion of clan tartans, stating that the "idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a fashion of modern date…".

==Publication of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum''==

The ''Vestiarium'' was finally published in 1842. A summary of its contents follows.

* Preface, in which is described the origin of the manuscripts, together with observations on the supposed author and date
* Rolls of the Clans
* Introduction
* Text of the Vestiarium
* The setts, stripes, and colours of the tartans, together with a listing of clans and families whose tartans are described
* Colour plates - seventy five plates (in colour) illustrating the tartans of the clans and families mentioned in the previous section

==The tartans==

The tartans presented in the ''Vestiarium'' were divided into two sections. First came the "Highland clans" and this was followed by "Lowland Houses and Border Clans". In the listing below, the clan name (with original spelling as it appeared in the VS) is followed by the [[Scottish Tartans Society]] number (TS#) and the (modern) thread count. Please note that these may not be the official clan tartans. For example, the tartan shown for [[Clan Campbell]], known as "Campbell of Argyll", was only worn by the Sixth Duke of Argyll. The standard Campbell tartan is the [[Black Watch]] tartan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Quarterly Review''==

In June 1847, a highly critical review of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' was published in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]''. Though the review was initially published anonymously, now the authors are now known to have been Professor George Skene of [[Glasgow University]] and Rev. Dr. Mackay, the editor of the [[Highland Society of Scotland|Highland Society]]'s Gaelic Dictionary.

The ''Quarterly Review'' article was occasioned by the appearance of a book by John Sobieski and Charles Edward Stuart entitled ''The Tales of the Century''. These stories, although presented in fictional terms, lay out the authors' claims to be direct descendants of Prince Charles Edward, the Young Pretender. The ''Quarterly Review'' article, while nominally a response to these claims, in fact mainly consisted of an examination of the authenticity of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum''.

In 1848, John Sobieski Stuart replied to the ''Quarterly Review'' article with a treatise of his own entitled ''The Genuineness of the Vestiarium Scoticum''. In this reply, Stuart offered the 1721 edition for inspection. In his part, Skene expressed a desire for the original manuscript, which was said to have once belonged to Bishop Ross, to be exhibited. In the end, no record of anyone examining the 1721 copy at that time exists, and no one, other than the Sobieski Stuart brothers, ever saw the Ross copy.

In 1895, the ''Glasgow Herald'' published a series of articles titled "The ''Vestiarium Scoticum'', is it a forgery?" authored by Andrew Ross. Ross was able to locate the 1721 copy, but not any earlier manuscripts. He gave a detailed description of the 1721 copy, and had it subjected to chemical testing by Stevenson Macadam, a chemist. Macadam reported that the "document [bore] evidence of having been treated with chemical agents in order to give the writing a more aged appearance than it is entitled to". He concluded that "the manuscript cannot be depended upon as an ancient document".

This 1721 copy was also presented for examination to a Mr. Robert Irvine, the director of a chemical firm who reported that it was "impossible to arrive at any accurate conclusion pointing to the age of the writing".

In earlier years, there was some discussion of publishing a second edition of the ''Vestiarium Scoticum'' (the first edition had a press run of only several dozen copies), but nothing came of these discussions.
