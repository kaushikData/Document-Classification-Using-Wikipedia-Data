[[File:ST. MARY MOORFIELDS ROMAN CATHOLIC CHAPEL.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The now demolished church of [[St Mary Moorfields]], London: Aglio painted the panoramic fresco of the Crucifixion behind the high altar.]]
'''Agostino Aglio''' (December 15, 1777 – January 30, 1857)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=nr89-16560|accessdate=2008-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Italy|Italian]] painter, decorator, and engraver.

He was born at [[Cremona]]. He initially studied at the [[Brera Academy]] under [[Giocondo Albertolli]], and then traveled to Rome to work under [[Campovecchio Mantovano]].&lt;ref&gt;Graselli, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1803 he came to England to assist [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]], the well-known architect, in the production of his ''Antiquities of Magna Graecia'' which was published in 1807. For many years Aglio was employed in the decoration of theatres, churches, and country mansions both in England and Ireland. In 1819, he was employed, along with the architect [[Giovanni Battista Comolli]], in painting vast frescoes for the Roman Catholic Church of [[St Mary Moorfields]], London. Between the years 1820 and 1830, he published several books on art including a ''Collection of Capitals and Friezes drawn from the Antique'' and ''[[Antiquities of Mexico]]'' illustrated with over 1000 plates, drawn from the originals. He also painted a portrait of [[Queen Victoria]], which was engraved.

A street in modern-day Cremona is named after the artist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5367">'''Alfonso Caso y Andrade''' (February 1, 1896 in Mexico City – November 30, 1970 in Mexico City) was an [[Archaeology|archaeologist]] who made important contributions to [[pre-Columbian]] studies in his native [[Mexico]]. Caso believed that the systematic study of [[List of pre-Columbian civilizations#Mesoamerica|ancient Mexican civilizations]] was an important way to understand Mexican cultural roots. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

His notable discoveries include the excavations at [[Monte Albán]], in particular ''"Tomb Seven"'',&lt;ref&gt;According to Conrado Martínez, a researcher from University of California, San Diego, some archeologist and historians have problematized the discovery or the attibution of the discovery of said tomb. Martínez argued that Tomb Seven could have been produced by the local elites because the city was in a desesperate situation after the 1931 earthquake.&lt;/ref&gt;in which several gold pieces and offerings were found (now shown in the Regional Museum of [[Oaxaca]]). He also discovered many sites in the [[La Mixteca|Mixtec]]a (a region in the state of Oaxaca), such as [[Yucuita]], [[Yucuñudahui]] and [[Monte Negro (Oaxaca)|Monte Negro]]. As well as discovering new sites Caso also sought to interpret them, establishing the chronology of [[Monte Albán]] history, and deciphering Mixtec [[Codex|codices]].

Throughout his life Caso wrote books about native Mesoamerican cultures, including those of the [[Olmec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]], and [[Aztec]]. He was one of the first to recognize the Olmecs as the earliest [[Mesoamerica]]n [[civilization]], declaring that they were the "''cultura madre''" (Mother culture) of Mesoamerica.&lt;"Esta gran cultura, que encontramos en niveles antiguos, es sin duda madre de otras culturas, como la maya, la teotihuacana, la zapoteca, la de El Tajín, y otras” (This great culture, which we encounter in ancient levels, is without a doubt mother of other cultures, like the Maya, the Teotihuacana, the Zapotec, that of El Tajin, and others". Caso (1942), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; His argument has subsequently been debated by Mesoamerican archaeologists; it is currently unclear how the [[Olmec influence on Mesoamerican culture|Olmec interacted with other Mesoamerican cultures]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1631">'''Annie G. Hunter''' (1860 – 1927) was an English professional artist and illustrator, best known for her reproduction drawings of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] monuments and inscriptions. In the late 1890s Hunter was commissioned by the early [[Mayanist]] scholar [[Alfred Maudslay]] to provide drawings and watercolored illustrations of Maya monuments. (She worked from casts, lintels and stelae in museum holdings, and photographs.)  Her illustrations appeared in Maudlay's pioneering archaeological and iconographic survey ''[[Biologia Centrali-Americana]]: Archaeology'' (London: R.H. Porter and Dulau, 1889-1902).

Hunter's work provided an important basis for the study of Maya iconography and inscriptions in the early 20th century; her careful renderings provide scholars access to texts that otherwise would be difficult to study. Hunter's work for Maudslay gained her acclaim, and after World War I she was commissioned by the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]] to provide [[watercolour]] and line-drawn illustrations of [[Maya ceramics]] artefacts held in a number of collections, for publication in portfolio.

Hunter is described in Ian Graham, ''Alfred Maudslay and the Maya: A Biography'', (University of Oklahoma press, 2002), pp.&amp;nbsp;221–223.

[[File:ATTILA - thumbnail US Half-Sheet 1958.jpg|thumb|left|ATTILA - US Half-Sheet 1958]]
'''''Attila''''' ({{lang-it|'''Attila, il flagello di Dio'''}}; {{lang-fr|'''Attila fléau de Dieu'''}}) is a [[1954 in film|1954]] Italian-French co-production, directed by [[Pietro Francisci]] and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Carlo Ponti]]. Based on the life of [[Attila the Hun]], it stars [[Anthony Quinn]] as Attila and [[Sophia Loren]] as [[Justa Grata Honoria|Honoria]], with [[Henri Vidal]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Ettore Manni]] and [[Christian Marquand]]. [[Scott Marlowe]] (1932–2001) made his screen debut in the film. Along with ''[[The Pride and the Passion]]'' and ''[[Houseboat (film)|Houseboat]]'', it was one of Loren's biggest box-office successes during the [[1950s in film|1950s]]. 

Filmed immediately following the breakthrough Italian-American co-production, ''[[Ulysses (1954 film)|Ulysses]]'' ([[Lux Films]]/Ponti-DeLaurentiis/[[Paramount Pictures]], 1954), ''Attila, Scourge of God'' represented an independent attempt by the same Italian producers to make a film with an American lead actor in hopes of licensing it to a US studio for distribution on more lucrative terms.  It failed to secure this goal for a variety of reasons unforeseen at the outset.  However, three and a half years later (retitled, ''Attila'') it proved to be the vehicle which launched the career of Joe Levine ''(Joseph E. Levine presents)'' as a producer and presenter of international films, many of them Italian in origin.  While never to be a financially or critically acclaimed motion picture, ''Attila'' ultimately achieved the status of a significant product in the evolution of world film markets.


==Plot==

The story is set in 450 A.D. The [[Huns]], a horde of barbarians from the distant plains of Asia, move toward the rich western lands of [[Germania]], led by a savage chief, Attila.

[[Flavius Aetius]], a Roman general, is the only person who knows Attila since he was in a continuation of legation with the Huns for years. Aetius and his companion Prisco carry a message from the Roman emperor [[Valentinian III]] to the Hun's king [[Rugila|Rua]]. After reaching their palace, Aetius learns that the king died, and that two brothers [[Bleda]] and Attila are now ruling the Hun kingdom. Bleda favours peace and tolerance, but Attila is at odds with him, and tensions develop. Yet Aetius knows to make an alliance between the [[Western Roman Empire]] and the Huns.

Aetius returns to the Imperial court at [[Ravenna]], where the childish emperor Valentinian III is busy with Roman parties in his palace and enjoying himself, while ignoring the fact that the Empire is beginning to [[Decline of the Western Roman Empire|fall apart]]. Because of this, his mother [[Galla Placidia]] is ruling the Empire. [[Honoria]], daughter of Galla Placidia and sister of Valentinian hopes to get rid of them, but needs help to do so. She asks Aetius to join her in a coup d'état, but he has vowed an oath to serve the Empire and refuses, even if he's arrested and stripped of his military rank by Valantinian and Galla Placidia due to his alliance to the Huns.

The two brothers battle, Attila wins by ordering his bodyguard to fire [[arrow]]s at Bleda and his bodyguard during the hunt, and declares himself the sole leader of the Huns, riling them to support his aspirations of conquering the Roman Empire.

Flavius Aetius returns to Ravenna, and finds Emperior Valentinian enraged by imagined attempts against his rule. Galla Placidia realizes that the Empire is now on the edge of destruction and gives Aetius full military power in an effort to protect her son.  As a Roman field army marches to block Attila's path, Honoria slips away from the Imperial court and visits the Hun in his camp.  

The battle is eventually joined with a frontal attack on the Roman encampment by Hunnic cavalry.  This first move is a deception, designed to draw the legions out of their fortified position.  Aetius decides to pursue the retreating Huns, anyway.  His cavalry charges and his foot soldiers follow them into the fray.  After a clash of arms on the open plains, the fighting moves into the Hun camp.  Here Honoria is found hiding in a nomad cart and killed.  But Aetius is soon killed by an arrow through the neck and the Romans lose their will to fight.  They flee the field and the Huns follow to burn their encampment.  As night falls, Attila takes his young son, Bleda, to view the carnage strewn battlefield.  There, a badly wounded Roman archer manages to fire a last shot.  The arrow misses Attila, but kills Bleda.  This emotionally traumatizes the Hun.  He appears to lose his passion for conquest and plunder.

On the way toward Rome, a sullen Attila and his horde come upon a procession of Christians led by [[Pope Leo I]]. Bewildered by the assembly he faces, Attila speaks alone with the Pope in the middle of a stream that separates his army from the religious gathering.  Leo calmly tells Attila,  ''"You can kill everybody...old people, women, children..."'' and Attila suddenly hears the disembodied words of his murdered brother Bleda.  ''"Innocent blood won't be washed away. It will come back to haunt you."''   With this warning in mind, Attila suddenly decides to turn back towards the [[Alps]], leaving Rome unscathed.

[[File:ATTILA thumbnail.jpg|thumb|Poster for ATTILA, US release, 1958.]]

==US Release (1958): ''The Dawn of Saturation Booking'' ==
[[File:Joseph E. Levine 1958.jpg|thumb|left|Joseph E. Levine, Embassy Pictures, 1958]]
''Attila's'' release was a signal moment in US film distribution. It established an exhibition pattern which came to be known as ''"saturation booking"''. [[Joseph E. Levine]], previously a US states-rights distributor/exhibitor based in Boston, quickly moved some 90 prints through regional distribution hubs, managing to assemble ad hoc arrays of mostly low-end theaters, where he could book short period playdates with favorable box-office terms.  This dense concentration of venues allowed for the cost effective use of local TV and radio spots, and he spent far more than most would have considered prudent.  Following this pattern, Levine was able to generate over $2 million in US box-office rentals with only a ten-day-per-screen exhibition average.  The success of ''Attila'' proved that an exploitable picture with heavy TV-advertising, and a dense concentration of theaters, could break through traditional road blocks to success for an independent release.  The results Levine achieved were then intensified (utilizing Warner Bros' nationwide network of print exchanges) in realizing the far greater take ($4.7 million, North American rentals) for his promotional blockbuster, ''[[Hercules (1958 film)|Hercules]]'', released the following summer with over 600 prints (175 of these played simultaneously in the Greater New York City area, at a time when studio releases often opened, nationally, with such a number).  Warner Bros. was so impressed with the exhibition showmanship and business acumen that Joe Levine had brought to ''Attila'', they paid him a $300,000. advance to secure the distribution rights to ''Hercules''. 

Levine licensed the US theatrical, non-theatrical, and television exhibition rights to ''Attila'' for a 10-year term (through March 1968) for $90,000, plus the cost of supplied film and sound mastering elements from ''Lux Films/Ponti-DeLaurentiis''. He also remade the picture's main title and head credits in English, typesetting them over a simple weaved-cloth background.  In all, about $110,000. was expended to get the film ready for printing.  In the course of its initial release, Levine also spent $590,000 on print and newspaper advertising, and $350,000 on radio and TV spots, enabling the picture to earn back over $2 million in US rentals.&lt;ref name="joe"&gt;Scheuer, P.

Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/167430798&lt;/ref&gt;  It was re-released in 1962 on a double-bill with Steve Reeves' ''Hercules'', then sold into TV-syndication. 

By contract, all US 35mm and 16mm, prints and masters, were collected and disposed of in 1968.  The film was then out of US distribution for decades.  The picture's 1958 US copyright was renewed in 1986, by a Parisian law firm believed to be acting on behalf of Carlo Ponti and the French ''StudioCanal'' film library.  An Italian-language version (with English sub-titles) was finally issued to US home video in 2008 as part of a 4-film collection from ''Lionsgate'' which contained some of Sophia Loren's earlier works.  Since the movie's initial release, English-language versions have featured a track dubbed by Anthony Quinn.   This track was also used on Joe Levine's American distribution prints and contains many lines in English which do not match the dialogue spoken in Italian.

'''Bonapartism''' is the political ideology of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his followers and successors. It was later used to refer to people who hoped to restore the [[House of Bonaparte]] and its style of government. After Napoleon, the term was applied to the French politicians who seized power in the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], ruling in the [[French Consulate]] and subsequently in the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire|Second]] French Empires under the [[House of Bonaparte]] (the family of Bonaparte and his nephew [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoleon]]). The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or [[authoritarian]] [[centralized government|centralized state]], with a [[strongman (political)|strongman]] charismatic leader based on [[populism|anti-elitist]] rhetoric, army support, and conservatism.

[[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] developed a vocabulary of political terms that included Bonapartism, derived from their analysis of the career of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], and was a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used "Bonapartism" to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class.

According to his essay "[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]" (1852), Marx believed that both Napoleon and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] had corrupted revolutions in [[France]] in this way. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history by saying: "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

More generally, "Bonapartism" may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Many &lt;!--who, specifically, with cite to RS --&gt;modern-day [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other leftists use the phrase "left Bonapartist" to describe those, such as [[Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], who controlled 20th-century bureaucratic socialist regimes. In addition, [[Leon Trotsky]] was accused of using his position as commander of the [[Red Army]] to gain top-level power after [[Lenin]]'s death.

Noted political scientists and historians greatly differ on the definition and interpretation of Bonapartism. Sudhir Hazareesingh's book ''The Legend of Napoleon'' explores numerous interpretations of the term. He says that it refers to a 
"popular national leader confirmed by popular election, above party politics, promoting equality, progress, and social change, with a belief in religion as an adjunct to the State, a belief that the central authority can transform society and a belief in the 'nation' and its glory and a fundamental belief in national unity."{{cn|date=December 2015}} Hazareesingh believes that although recent research shows Napoleon used forced conscription of French troops, some men must have fought believing in Napoleon's ideals. He says that to argue Bonapartism co-opted the masses is an example of the Marxist perspective of [[false consciousness]]: the idea that the masses can be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends. 

==Ideology==

Philosophically, Bonapartism was Napoleon's adaptation of principles of the [[French Revolution]] to suit his imperial form of rule. Desires for public order, French national glory, and emulation of the [[Roman Empire]] had combined to create a [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] ''coup d'etat'' for General Bonaparte on [[18 Brumaire]]. Though he espoused adherence to revolutionary precedents, he "styled his direct and personal rule on the Old Regime monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Truesdell |first=Matthew |title=Spectacular Politics: Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and the Fête impériale, 1849-1870 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510689-3|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f1SwirhmHMC&amp;pg=PA58 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonapartists, the most significant lesson of the Revolution was that unity of government and the governed was paramount. 

The [[Bee (mythology)|honey bee]] was a prominent political emblem for both the First and Second Empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/essential_napoleon/symbols/index.asp#abeilles |title=History of the Two Empires: The Symbols of Empire |author= |year=2008 |publisher=Fondation Napoléon |accessdate=17 September 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the Bonapartist ideal of devoted service, self-sacrifice and social loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Englund |first=Steven  |title=Napoleon: A Political Life |year=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-01803-7 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ZJbxGwU4cC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristics of political Bonapartism were flexibility and adaptability. [[Napoleon III]] once commented on the diversity of opinions in his cabinet, united under the banner of Bonapartism. Referring to the leading figures in the government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], he remarked: "The [[Empress Eugenie|Empress]] is a [[Legitimist]], [[Duc de Morny|Morny]] is an [[Orléanist]], [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]] is a [[republicanism|Republican]], and I myself am a [[Socialist]]. There is only one Bonapartist, [[Persigny]]&amp;nbsp;–  and he is mad!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jerrold |first=Blanchard |title=The Life of Napoleon III |year=1882 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |page=378 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbUwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Common Violet.JPG|thumb|During his exile to Elba (1814–1815), Napoleon Bonaparte announced he would return in the spring. The violet became a symbol of this and of Bonapartism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lindsay|first=Suzanne G.|title=Funerary Arts and Tomb Cult: Living with the Dead in France, 1750-1870|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2261-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pONxfBACLPUC&amp;pg=PA172 172] (footnote 16)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[France|French]] [[politics|political]] history, ''[[Bonapartiste]]s'' were [[monarchist]]s who desired a French Empire under the House of Bonaparte, the [[Corsica]]n family of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Napoleon I of France) and his nephew Louis-Napoleon ([[Napoleon III of France]]).

Bonapartism developed after Napoleon I was exiled to [[Elba]]. The Bonapartists helped him regain his power, leading to the [[Hundred Days]] period. Some of his acolytes could not accept his defeat in 1815 at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] or the [[Congress of Vienna]], and continued to promote the Bonaparte ideology. After Napoleon I's death in exile on [[Saint Helena]] in 1821, many of these people transferred their allegiance to other members of his family. After the death of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt (known to Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II]]), Bonapartist hopes rested on several different members of the family.&lt;ref name=Riff1990&gt;{{Cite book|last=Riff |first=Michael A.|title=Dictionary of Modern Political Ideologies |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-3289-9|page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh4NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbances of 1848 gave hope to the nascent political undercurrent. Bonapartism, as an ideology of politically neutral French peasants and workers (EJ Hobsbawm), was essential in the election of Napoleon I's nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and gave him the political support necessary for his 1852 discarding of the constitution and proclaiming the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte assumed the title [[Napoleon III]] to acknowledge the brief reign of Napoleon's son Napoleon II at the end of the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815 (see the [[abdication of Napoleon (1815)|abdication of Napoleon I]] in 1815).

In 1870, the [[French National Assembly]] forced Napoleon III to sign a declaration of war against Prussia; France suffered a disastrous defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The emperor surrendered to the Prussians and their German allies to avoid further bloodshed at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]]. He went into exile after a parliamentary coup created the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Acton|first=Lord |authorlink=John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton |title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA495|accessdate=18 September 2011|year=1909|publisher=Macmillan Co. |location=New York |page=495ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonapartists continued to agitate for another member of the family to be placed on the throne. From 1871 forward, they competed with [[Monarchist]] groups that favoured the restoration of the family of [[Louis-Philippe]], [[King of the French]] (1830–1848) (the [[Orléanist]]s), and also with those who favoured the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]], the traditional French [[royal family]] ([[Legitimist]]s). The strength of these three factions combined was powerful, but they did not unite on the choice of the new French monarch. Monarchist fervor eventually waned, and the French Republic became more or less a permanent facet of French life. Bonapartism was slowly relegated to being the civic faith of a few romantics as more of a hobby than a practical political philosophy. The death knell for Bonapartism was probably sounded when [[Eugène Bonaparte]], the only son of Napoleon III, was [[Anglo-Zulu War|killed in action]] while serving as a [[British Army]] officer in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] in 1879. Thereafter Bonapartism ceased to be a significant political force.

The current head of the Bonaparte family is the Prince Napoleon, great-great-great-grandson of Napoleon I's brother Jérôme Bonaparte, [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon|Jean-Christophe Napoléon]] (born 1986). There are no remaining descendants in the male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There is no serious political movement that aims to restore any of these men to the imperial throne of France.

==Bonapartist claimants==
[[File:Pierson - Jérôme Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|Jérôme Bonaparte, founder of the legitimate line]]

After becoming Emperor in 1804, Napoleon I established a Law of Succession, providing that the Bonapartist claim to the throne should pass firstly to Napoleon's own legitimate male descendants through the male line. At that time he had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. He eventually achieved an annulment, without Papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine. He married the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], with whom he had one son. 

The law of succession provided that if Napoleon's own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph and his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien and Jerome, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession (even though Lucien was older than Louis) because they had either politically opposed the Emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. Napoleon abdicated in favor of his son after his defeat in 1815. Although the Bonapartes were deposed and the old Bourbon monarchy restored, Bonapartists recognized this child as Napoleon II. A sickly child, he was virtually imprisoned in Austria, and died young and unmarried, without any descendants. When the Bonaparte Empire was restored to power in France in 1852, the Emperor was Napoleon III, [[Louis Bonaparte]]'s only living legitimate son (their brother Joseph having died in 1844 without having had a legitimate son, only daughters).

In 1852, Napoleon III enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim was given to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line (though at that time he had no son, Louis later had a legitimate son, [[Eugène Bonaparte]], who was recognized by Bonapartists as "Napoleon IV" before dying young and unmarried). If Napoleon III's line died out, he decreed that the claim should pass to Jerome, Napoleon's youngest brother (who had previously been excluded), and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of Württemberg]] in the male line. (Excluded were his descendants by his first marriage, to the American commoner [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved.) The Bonapartist claimants since 1879, have been the descendants of Jerome and Catherine of Württemberg in the male line.

The Bonapartist laws of succession were far from traditional. The family members ignored [[primogeniture]] (by excluding [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and his descendants); they annulled marriages to achieve their goals; and they did not submit to the Pope's rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.

==Marxism==

Based on the career of [[Louis Bonaparte]], [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] defined Bonapartism as a political expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/], Marxists website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], as well as a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used the term ''[[Bonapartism (Marxism)|Bonapartism]]'' to refer to a situation in which [[counterrevolutionary]] military officers seize power from [[revolutionaries]], and use selective [[reformism]] to co-opt the radicalism of the masses. In the process, Marx argued, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower [[ruling class]]. He believed that both Napoleon I and Napoleon III had corrupted revolutions in France in this way.  Marx offered this definition of and analysis of Bonapartism in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', written in 1852. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history with one of his most quoted lines, typically condensed aphoristically as: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Surveys in Exile |last=Marx |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx |editor=David Fernbach |year=1973 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |isbn=978-0-14-021603-5 |page=146 |quote=Hegel remarks somewhere that all great events and characters of world history occur, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that a Bonapartist regime could exert great power, because there was no class with enough confidence or power to firmly establish its authority in its own name. A leader who appeared to stand above the class struggle could take the mantle of power. He believed that this was an inherently unstable situation, as the apparently all-powerful leader would be swept aside when the class struggle in society was resolved. 

[[Leon Trotsky]] described [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime as Bonapartist, as he believed it was balanced between the [[proletariat]], victorious but shattered by war, and the [[bourgeoisie#The Marxist view|bourgeoisie]], broken by the revolution but struggling to re-emerge.  The failure of Stalin's regime to disintegrate under the shock and disruption of the losses of the Second World War, and the success of its expansion into Eastern Europe, challenged this analysis. Many [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] rejected the idea that Stalin's regime was Bonapartist. [[Tony Cliff]] described such regimes as [[State capitalism#Use by Trotskyists|state capitalist]] in type and not as deformed [[socialist state|workers' states]] at all. In the last year of his life, Trotsky argued the example of Napoleon's expanding empire. He had achieved the abolition of serfdom in Poland and other French holdings, but his empire was still "Bonapartist."

"Bonapartism" may be used generally to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Some modern-day Trotskyists and others on the left use the phrase ''left Bonapartist'' to describe leaders such as Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]], who controlled left-wing or populist totalitarian regimes. Bonapartism was an example of the Marxist idea of false consciousness: the masses could be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends.

==Bonapartism in the French political spectrum==

According to historian [[René Rémond]]'s famous 1954 book, ''Les Droites en France'', Bonapartism constitutes one of the three French [[right-wing]] families; the latest one after [[far-right]] [[Legitimism]] and [[center-right]] [[Orleanism]]. Both [[Boulangisme]] and [[Gaullism]] would be forms of Bonapartism.

However, Bonapartists have consistently disagreed with this classification, as one of the fundamentals of Bonapartism as an ideology is the refusal to adhere to the left-right divide, which they see as an obstacle to the welfare and unity of the nation. Martin S Alexander, in his book "French History since Napoleon" (London, Arnold, New York, Oxford University Press, 1999) notes that Bonapartism as an idea would not have made a significant impact if it had been classifiable as either left-wing or right-wing. The historian Jean Sagnes in "The roots of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's Socialism" notes that the future Emperor of the French edited his political works through far-left publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Sagnes |title= Les racines du socialisme de Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte |location= Toulouse |publisher= Privat |date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Bonapartist philosophy would fit into the space occupied by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]], the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Mouvement Démocrate]], the [[European Social Liberal Party|Nouveau Centre]] and the left wing of the conservative [[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]], as these parties occupy the ideological space between parties advocating class struggle and race-based politics, both of which are anathema to Bonapartists, as contrary to the ideal of national unity and religious and ethnic tolerance. This is demonstrated by Napoleonic policy towards industrial disputes, one expression of which&amp;nbsp;– as Frank McLynn writes&amp;nbsp;–  is that strikes were forbidden by Napoleon I but in exchange the police sometimes prevented wages from being lowered,{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=482}} while another is the [[Napoleon and the Jews|assimilation and protection of the Jews.]]

The Marxist theory of "Left" and "Right" Bonapartism can be considered an illustration of what McLynn refers to as Napoleon I's appeal in equal measure "to both the Right and the Left",{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=667}} and what Vincent Cronin describes as "middle of the way", or "moderate" government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Cronin |date=1994 |title=Napoleon |publisher=HarperCollins |chapter=Chapter 19 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III situated Bonapartism (or the "Napoleonic Idea") between the radicals and conservatives (respectively the Left and the Right) in "Des Idées Napoléoniennes", published in 1839. He expounded on this point to explain that Bonapartism, as practiced by his uncle Napoleon the Great (and represented by himself) was in the middle of "two hostile parties, one of which looks only to the past, and the other only to the future" and combined "the old forms" of the one and the "new principles" of the other.

==Modern Bonapartism==
{{further|Neo-Bonapartism}}

In contemporary times, the term "Bonapartism" has been used in a general sense to describe autocratic, highly centralized regimes dominated by the military.&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;{{Cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Craig J. |authorlink=Craig Calhoun |title=Dictionary of the Social Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-512371-5 |page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfISGq3aB2UC&amp;pg=PA47 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, an official ''Mouvement Bonapartiste'' exists, based in France, headed by Paul-Napoléon Pierre Calland with an unknown number of members around the world. Its official mission statement is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]o defend, make known and to spread the principles and values of Bonapartism. [The movement] is based on popular support for a policy of recovery combining the efforts of individuals, associations and State services. The movement defends the Bonapartist principles on which it is founded, and which govern its internal organisation. It also defends the memory of Napoleon the Great, as well as those of Napoleon III and their sons, Napoleon II and Napoleon IV. It recognises Napoleon IV as having reigned without governing, by virtue of the plebiscite of May 1870. The movement recognises no emperor after 1879, because of the absence of a plebiscite. Republican, it gives priority to the happiness, interest and glory of peoples, and envisages the restoration of the Empire only if the foundations of the regime are republican and approved by referendum."&lt;ref name=mouvementbonapartiste&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mouvementbonapartiste.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/bonapartist-movement |title=Bonapartist Movement |year=2011 |publisher=Mouvement Bonapartiste |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The milestones for [[carbon capture and storage]] show the lack of commercial scale development and implementation of CCS over the years since the first [[carbon tax]] was imposed.

The time line of '''carbon capture and storage''' announcements and developments follows:

==2009==
===Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute===
10 July 2009 major economies forum meeting on climate change: Australian Prime minister Mr Rudd, who shared the stage with [[US President]] [[Barack Obama]], said the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (CCS) would now be an international initiative led by Australia - which will act as a clearing house for research of new technologies, legislation to pave their path and as a vehicle to streamline funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8143245.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Rudd announces carbon capture project |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The practical challenge we face...is what do we do about the problem, the challenge, of coal. There are practically no large carbon capture and storage projects under construction now," Mr Rudd said. "Australia in the last 12 months has decided to work with other major economies, and all the major energy companies, on the establishment of a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. That is what we are here launching today." He said carbon capture and storage, which captures {{CO2}} and seeks to inject it in safe stores deep underground, is an important potential future weapon in the battle against global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/environment/pm-rudd-shares-centre-stage-with-us-president-obama-20090710-dezn.html |title=PM Rudd shares centre stage with US President Obama |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=2009-07-10 |accessdate=2012-02-09 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electricity sourced from fossil fuels accounts for more than 40 per cent of the world’s energy-related {{CO2}} emissions. A further 25 per cent comes from large-scale industrial processes such as iron and steel production, cement making, natural gas processing and petroleum refining. 
 
With world energy demand projected to grow by more than 40 per cent over the next two decades, reducing {{CO2}} emissions is a significant challenge the nation of Australia has a particular interest in helping to solve. Australia’s is the world’s biggest coal exporter, and the Australian economy is heavily dependent upon coal—its biggest export.
Renewable energy technology continues to develop, but fossil fuels, in particular coal and gas, will continue to provide the bulk of the world’s energy for the foreseeable future.

However, there is a way to harness fossil fuels while significantly reducing CO2 emissions.
The answer lies in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide and other climate influencing greenhouse gases.

===GreenGen Project led by China Huaneng Group (CHNG) will begin construction in early 2009===
GreenGen Project aims to research, develop and demonstrate a coal-based power generation system with [[hydrogen production]] through coal gasification, power generation from a [[combined cycle]] gas turbine and fuel cells, and efficient treatment of pollutants and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the efficiency of the coal-based power generation will be greatly improved, and the pollutants and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions will be near zero.&lt;ref&gt;Development Plan of The GreenGen Co. {{cite web|url=http://www.greengen.com.cn/en/developmentplan_01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707015238/http://www.greengen.com.cn/en/developmentplan_01.htm |archivedate=2011-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008==
=== Reality campaign launched ===
3 December 2008: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090115205556/http://www.thisisreality.org/ This Is Reality.org], a coalition of US environmental organisations, launches a campaign to highlight that no [[fossil fuel power station]] in the USA captures other than token amounts of the [[greenhouse gas]] that the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and all [[Scientific opinion on climate change|other significant scientific organisations]] acknowledge are causing [[climate change]], [[global warming]], [[Arctic shrinkage]] and [[sea level rise]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisisreality.org/#/?p=facility Retrieved 11 January 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115205556/http://www.thisisreality.org/ |date=15 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CCS inclusion in CDM postponed===
Plans to allow organizations to earn credits for CCS under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) have been dropped at the climate change talks in Poznan － the 14th session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
The proposal, led by Australia, was supported by a majority of representatives and the IEA but Brazil and a few other countries blocked the move. The decision will then be postponed until next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Setback for CCS inclusion in CDM|url=http://www.carboncapturejournal.com/news/setback-for-ccs-inclusion-in-cdm/2477.aspx|publisher=Carbon Capture Journal|date=10 December 2008|accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbon assessment software developed===
Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) designed a new software that will help developers of [[clean coal technology]] to accurately measure how much {{CO2}} they can store underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/innovation/2008/1201/1227828880572.html |title=Mon, Dec 01, 2008 - Carbon assessment software developed |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2008-12-12 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BP and CAS established the Clean Energy Commercialization Center===
BP and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have agreed to establish the Clean Energy Commercialization Center (CECC), a joint venture in Shanghai investing some $73 million to commercialize Chinese clean energy technologies. Subject to final government approvals, the CECC venture is expected to be established by early 2009.
The CECC will serve as an international platform for further collaboration among research institutes, enterprises and other institutions to improve indigenous Chinese innovation capabilities and market applications in areas such as clean coal conversion, zero emission technologies, and carbon capture and storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://cleantechnica.com/2008/12/02/bp-to-help-commercialize-clean-energy-in-china/ |title=BP to Help Commercialize Clean Energy in China |publisher=CleanTechnica |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK Energy Bill received Royal Assent===
On 26 November 2008, The UK Energy Bill received Royal Assent and was passed into law. The bill mentions to create a regulatory framework to enable private sector investment in Carbon capture and storage projects. As it has the potential to reduce the carbon emissions from fossil fuel power stations by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/energy.html |title=Energy Act 2008 — UK Parliament |publisher=Services.parliament.uk |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute planned===
The Australian government in September committed A$100 million annually to help establish an international institute to accelerate development of clean-coal technologies, including the long-term aim of storing carbon dioxide permanently underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.morningstar.com/newsnet/ViewNews.aspx?article=/DJ/200812152241DOWJONESDJONLINE000809_univ.xml |title=News Archive: Top Stories |publisher=News.morningstar.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following a two-day preparatory meeting in London, the institute now has eight foundation industry members: Shell International Petroleum; Rio Tinto Ltd.; Mitsubishi Corp.; Anglo American; Xstrata Coal; Services Petroliers Schlumberger; Alstom; and The Climate Group.

===Clean-coal debut in Germany===
The world's first coal-fired power plant designed to capture and store carbon dioxide that it produces began operations in Spremberg, Germany.
Built alongside the 1,600MW Schwarze Pumpe power plant in north Germany, the demonstration experiment will capture up to 100,000 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; a year, compress it and bury it 3,000m below the surface of the depleted Altmark gas field, about 200&amp;nbsp;km from the site.
"It's a very important and tangible step forward," said Stuart Haszeldine, a geologist and CCS expert at the University of Edinburgh. "It is the first full-chain demonstration of oxyfuel as a carbon capture technology. It connects all that for the first time in a working system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alok Jha, green technology correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/05/carboncapturestorage.carbonemissions |title=World's first carbon capture pilot fires up clean-coal advocates &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-09-05|accessdate=2012-02-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Energy Group launches carbon capture scheme===
Providence Resources, an Irish oil and gas group, is launching a project that could lead to the first carbon capture &amp; storage (CCS) scheme in the British Isles.
Providence Resources is working with Star Energy Group, a UK gas storage company owned by Petronas of Malaysia, on the Ulysses Project.
The scheme will evaluate the Kish Bank Basin in the Irish Sea to decide whether its underground saline reservoirs can be used for [[carbon sequestration]] and natural gas storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pepei.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=ARTCL&amp;SubSection=Display&amp;PUBLICATION_ID=6&amp;ARTICLE_ID=337429 |title=Irish energy group launches carbon capture scheme - Power Engineering |publisher=Pepei.pennnet.com |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New organic liquids to Capture CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===

==1998==
===EnCana announced plans to implement Weyburn EOR project===
In 1998, a Canadian oil and gas corporation (the PanCanadian Petroleum Limited, now [[EnCana Corporation]]) announced plans to implement a large scale EOR project in an oilfield near Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada, using {{CO2}} captured from [[Dakota Gasification Company]]. The [[Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project]] provided a chance to demonstrate and study a large-scale geological storage project and to provide the data to evaluate the safety, technical and economic feasibility of such storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sequestration.mit.edu/tools/projects/weyburn.html |title=Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies @ MIT |publisher=Sequestration.mit.edu |date=2013-08-12 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1997==
===DGC agreed to send all of the waste gas (96% {{CO2}}) to the Weyburn oil field===
The Weyburn oil field is situated in Canada, near the USA border. The carbon dioxide for the Weyburn EOR project is produced in the Great Plains Synfuels Plant in [[Beulah, North Dakota]], USA, which is operated by the [[Dakota Gasification Company]]. In 1997, DGC agreed to send all of the waste gas (96% {{CO2}}) from its Great Plains Synfuels Plant through a pipeline to the Weyburn oil field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetseed.com/relatedarticle/weyburn-oil-field-enhanced-oil-recovery |title=Enhanced Oil Recovery &amp;#124; Science Articles |publisher=PlanetSEED |date=2013-06-24 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1996==
===Sleipner — a carbon dioxide capture-and-storage project===
The [[Sleipner gas field]] is in the North Sea, about 250&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Stavanger, Norway]]. It is operated by Norway’s largest oil company Statoil. The Sleipner field produces natural gas and light oil from the Heimdal sandstones, which are about 2,500 m below sea level. The natural gas produced at Sleipner contains unusually high levels (about 9%) of carbon dioxide, but the customers require less than 2.5%.

To encourage companies to cut their carbon emissions, the Norwegian government imposes a carbon tax equivalent to about $50 per ton of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; released into the atmosphere. To avoid paying the tax, and as a test of alternative technology, all of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; extracted since 1996, when gas production started at Sleipner, has been pumped back deep underground.
The Sleipner project is the first commercial example of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; storage in a deep saline aquifer, so there is a lot of interest from around the world in its success. In particular, scientists want to know how the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moves inside the aquifer and if there is a risk that it could escape back to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetseed.com/relatedarticle/sleipner-carbon-dioxide-capture-and-storage-project |title=Sleipner Carbon Capture and Storage &amp;#124; Science Articles |publisher=PlanetSEED |date=2013-06-24 |accessdate=2013-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1991==
===The Norwegian government instituted a tax on {{CO2}} emissions===
In 1991, the Norwegian government instituted a tax on {{CO2}} emissions, which motivated Statoil to capture the {{CO2}} emitted from its Sleipner oil and gas field in the North Sea and inject it into an underground aquifer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esteem-tool.eu/fileadmin/esteem-tool/docs/CASE_24_def.pdf |title=Case 24: Snohvit CO2 capture &amp; storage project |author=E.

==1989==
===The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT initiated===
Initiated in 1989, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program at MIT conducts research into technologies to capture, utilize, and store {{CO2}} from large stationary sources.&lt;ref name="ilp-www.mit.edu"/&gt; It is globally recognized as a leader in the field of carbon capture and storage research.

==Early 1970s==
===The use of {{CO2}} for commercial EOR began in US in the early 1970s.===
The use of {{CO2}} for commercial [[enhanced oil recovery]] started in USA in the early 1970s. There are currently about 120 registered CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; floods worldwide, almost 85% of which are in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;全球碳捕集与封存信息中心 http://www.captureready.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Caroline''' or '''Carolean era''' refers to the era in English and [[Scotland|Scottish]] history during the [[Stuart period]] (1603–1714) that coincided with the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625–1642), ''Carolus'' being Latin for Charles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirsch|first1=Edward|title=A Poet's Glossary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1flJAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|accessdate=16 September 2016|page=93|language=en|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caroline era followed the [[Jacobean era]], the reign of Charles's father [[James I of England|James I]] (1603–1625); it was followed by the [[English Civil War]] (1642–1651) and the [[English Interregnum]] (1651–1660).

==Highlights of the Caroline era==
The Caroline era was dominated by the growing religious, political, and social conflict between the King and his supporters, termed the Royalist party, and the [[Puritan]] opposition that evolved in response to particular aspects of Charles's rule. Aside from the bloody conflict of the [[Thirty Years' War]] then raging in continental Europe, the Caroline period in Britain was one of an uneasy peace, growing darker as the civil conflict between King and Puritans worsened toward the latter part of Charles's reign.

This conflict between King and [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] dominated society to such a degree that other developments have seemed mere continuations of previous innovations. Some of those continuations, however, were of major significance for the future. English efforts at the colonization of North America continued throughout Charles's reign, with the foundation of new colonies in [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] (1629), [[Maryland]] (1634), [[Connecticut]] (1635), and [[Rhode Island]] (1636) standing as important steps in the process. Development of previously-established colonies in [[Virginia]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] also continued. (In Massachusetts, the [[Pequot War]] of 1637 was the first major armed conflict between New England settlers and a Native American people.)

==Literature==
In literature, and especially in drama, the Caroline period has often been regarded as a diminished continuation of the trends of the previous two reigns. Caroline theatre unquestionably saw a falling-off after the peak achievements of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]], though some of their successors, especially [[Philip Massinger]], [[James Shirley]], and [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], carried on to create interesting, even compelling theatre. In recent years the comedies of [[Richard Brome]] have gained in critical appreciation.

In poetry, however, the Caroline period saw the flourishing of the [[Cavalier poet]]s (including [[Thomas Carew]], [[Richard Lovelace]], and [[John Suckling (poet)|Sir John Suckling]]) and the [[Metaphysical poets]] ([[George Herbert]], [[Henry Vaughan]], [[Katherine Philips]] and others), movements that produced powerful figures like [[John Donne]], as well as lyrically satisfying artists like [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]]. If the [[Elizabethan era]] was the golden age of English drama, the Caroline age was nearly as rich in the realm of non-dramatic poetry, bringing as it did the beginnings of the career of [[John Milton]], in addition to the poets of the movements already mentioned.

(In the specialized domain of literary criticism and theory, [[Henry Reynolds (poet)|Henry Reynolds]]'s ''Mythomystes'' was published in 1632, in which the author attempts a systematic application of Neoplatonism to poetry. The result has been characterized as "a tropical forest of strange fancies" and "perversities of taste.")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/217/1105.html Cambridge History of English and American Literature, Vol. VII.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
In the visual arts, the portraiture of [[Anthony van Dyck]] (appointed "painter to the king," 1633–1641) was a dominant influence, and has sometimes been credited with founding an English school of painting. Upon his death in 1641, his position as portraitist to the royal family was filled, practically if not formally, by William Dobson (ca. 1610–1646), making Dobson the most prominent native-born English artist of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain 1530 to 1790,''  fourth edition, New York, Viking Penguin, 1978; pp. 80–5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inigo Jones]] carried forward his work in architecture and design, though without breaking new ground. The peculiar artistic form of the court [[masque]] was still being written and performed, including the final masques of Ben Jonson (printed 1625–34). The lavish expenditures on these showpieces—the production of a single masque could approach £15,000&lt;ref&gt;[[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle]], spent between £14,000 and £15,000 on staging Jonson's last masque, ''[[Love's Welcome at Bolsover]]'', for the King and Queen on 30 July 1634. Henry Ten Eyck Perry, ''The First Duchess of Newcastle and Her Husband as Figures in Literary History,'' Boston, Ginn and Co., 1918; p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; —was one of a growing number of grievances that critics in general, and the Puritans in particular, held against the King and his court.

==Sciences and mathematics==
The sciences saw a major step forward with the 1628 publication by [[William Harvey]] of his study of the [[circulatory system]], ''Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus'' ("Anatomical Essay on the Motion of the Heart and Blood in Animals").The reception granted to Harvey's work was, unfortunately, highly critical and hostile; but within a generation his work began to receive the valuation it deserved. More broadly, the revolution in thinking that connects Sir [[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626) with the foundation of the [[Royal Society]] (1660) was ongoing throughout the Caroline period; Bacon's ''The New Atlantis'' was first printed in 1627, and contributed to the evolving new paradigm among receptive individuals. The men who would begin the Royal Society were for the most part still schoolboys and students in this period—though [[John Wilkins]] was already publishing early works of Copernican astronomy and science advocacy, ''The Discovery of a World in the Moon'' (1638) and ''A Discourse Concerning a New Planet'' (1640).

Lacking formal scientific institutions and organizations, Caroline scientists, proto-scientists, and "natural philosophers" had to cluster in informal groups, often under the social and financial patronage of a sympathetic aristocrat. This again was an old phenomenon: a precedent in the prior reigns of Elizabeth and James can be identified in the circle that revolved around the [[Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland|"Wizard Earl" of Northumberland]]. Caroline scientists often clustered similarly. These ad hoc associations helped individuals to avoid the dark by-ways of [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]], [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Kabbalah]] and [[sympathetic magic]]—temptations that trapped more than a few in this era (like Sir [[Kenelm Digby]] with the [[Powder of Sympathy]]).

In mathematics, three major works were published in a single year, 1631—the ''Artis analyticae praxis'' of [[Thomas Harriot]] (1560–1621), published ten years posthumously, and the ''[[Clavis mathematicae]]'' of [[William Oughtred]] (1575–1660). Both contributed to the evolution of modern mathematical language, the latter giving us the &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; sign for multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;Carl B. Boyer, ''A History of Mathematics,'' second edition, revised by Uta C. Merzbach; New York, John Wiley, 1991; pp. 306–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy, [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) was already writing some of his works and evolving his key concepts, though they would not see print till after the end of the Caroline era.

And on the dark and obscure flipside of science, the occultist [[Robert Fludd]] continued his series of enormous and convoluted volumes of esoteric lore, begun during the previous reign. In 1626 appeared his ''Philosophia Sacra'' (which constituted Portion IV of Section I of Tractate II of Volume II of Fludd's ''History of the Macrocosm and Microcosm''), which was followed in 1629 and 1631 by the two-part medical text ''Medicina Catholica''. Fludd's last major work (there were various minor ones in between) would be the posthumously-published ''Philosophia Moysaica'' (1638). However one chooses to evaluate Fludd's intellectual achievement, the superb and daedally complex illustrations in his books, masterpieces of the engraver's art, are a cultural enrichment.

'''Conceptual history''' (also the '''history of concepts''' or, from German, '''''Begriffsgeschichte''''') is a branch of historical and cultural studies that deals with the historical [[semantics]] of terms. It sees the [[etymology]] and the change in meaning of terms as forming a crucial basis for contemporary cultural, conceptual and linguistic understanding. Conceptual history deals with the evolution of paradigmatic ideas and value systems over time, such as "liberty" or "reform." It argues that [[social history]] – indeed all historical reflection – must begin with an understanding of historically contingent cultural values and practices in their particular contexts over time, not merely as unchanging ideologies or processes.

Interest in conceptual history was given a particular boost in the 20th century through the publication of the ''Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie'', the ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe'' and the journal [[Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte]].

Conceptual history is an [[interdisciplinary]] methodology. Alongside the [[philosopher]] [[Joachim Ritter]], the [[historian]]s [[Otto Brunner]] and  [[Reinhart Koselleck]] and the [[sociologist]] [[Erich Rothacker]] are viewed as the leading scholars of the research area in the German-speaking world and internationally. [[Raymond Williams]] is the leading scholar in the English-speaking world. Examples of conceptual histories include a genealogy of the concept of globalization drawing on the approach of Williams written by Manfred B. Steger and Paul James:

{{cquote|Although keywords represent a critical mass of the vocabulary of any given era, the history of their meaning construction often remains obscure. ‘Globalization’ is no exception. While the meanings of other seminal ‘keywords’ such as ‘economics’, ‘culture’, or ‘modernity’ evolved rather slowly and built upon a relatively continuous base, ‘globalization’ has had a very short and discontinuous history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Steger | first2= Manfred B. | title= A Genealogy of Globalization: The Career of a Concept | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4#.VR0vDzuUdPM | journal= Globalizations | volume=  11 | issue=  4 | pages= 418–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8711">'''Consanguineous marriage''' is matrimony between individuals who are closely related. Though it may involve [[incest]], it implies more than the sexual nature of incest. In a clinical sense, marriage between two family members who are second cousins or closer qualify as having a consanguineous marriage. This is  based on the gene copies their offspring may receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Consanguineous marriages|last=Hamamy|first=Hanan|date=November 22, 2011|pmc=3419292|pmid=22109912|doi=10.1007/s12687-011-0072-y|volume=3|pages=185–92|journal=Journal of Community Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these unions are still prevalent in some communities, as seen across the [[Greater Middle East]] region, many other populations have seen a great decline in family marriages.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;Heidari F, Dastgiri S, Tajaddini N, et al. Prevalence and Risk Factors of Consanguineous Marriage. European Journal of General Medicine [serial online]. December 2014;11(4):248-255. Available from: Academic Search Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed October 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence and stigma ==
[[File:Global_prevalence_of_consanguinity.svg|thumb|Global prevalence of consanguine marriage, illustrating a higher prevalence of [[cousin marriage in the Middle East]].]]
Globally, 8.5% of children have consanguineous parents, and 20% of the human population live in communities practicing [[endogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;Obeidat BG, Khader YS, Amarin ZO, Kassawneh M, AlOmari M. Consanguinity and adverse pregnancy outcomes: the north of Jordan experience. Matern Child Health J 2010;14(2);283-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Akrami SM, Montazeri V, Shomali SR, Heshmat R, Larijani B. Is there a significant trend in prevalence of consanguineous marriage in Tehran? A review of three generations. J Genet Couns 2009;18(1):82-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Theories on the developments of consanguineous marriage as a taboo can be supported as being both a social, and a biological development.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

=== Social factors ===
In a social perspective, the observed inclination to practice consanguinity has been due to advantages to social and financial status. Upholding familial structure and assets, and ease of marital arrangements are valued among consanguineous marriages.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Shawky RM, El-Awady MY, Elsayed SM, Hamadan GE. Consanguineous matings among Egyptian population. Egypt J Med Human Genet 2011;12(2):157-63.&lt;/ref&gt; Low age and a lack of awareness of the consequences of inbreeding are common in consanguineous marriages.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Consanguineous marriage is present in every religion, and cannot be accredited to any one religious mandate.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Alvarez G, Quinteiro C, Ceballos F. Inbreeding and Genetic Disorder. Advances in the Study of Genetic Disorders 2011. Available from: http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/23704/ InTech- Inbreeding_and_genetic_disorder.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Consanguinity is practiced regardless of religious influences and is a result of cultural, historical, regional, and socio-economic factors.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Masood SN, Jamil N, Mumtaz SN, Masood MF, Muneer S. Congenital malformations in newborns of consanguineous and non-consanguineous parents. Pak J Med Sci 2011;2:1- 5.&lt;/ref&gt; A greater number of consanguineous marriages are observed in rural areas compared to urban areas within the same region. This is attributed to the tendency of individuals in rural areas to marry at younger ages, have a lower socio-economic status, and lesser education than those who live in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tadmouri | first1 = GO | last2 = Nair | first2 = P | last3 = Obeid | first3 = T | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2009 | title = Consanguinity and reproductive health among Arabs | journal = Reproductive Health | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 17 | doi=10.1186/1742-4755-6-17 | pmid=19811666 | pmc=2765422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedehi M, Keshtkar A, Golalipour MJ.

J Clin Diagnostic Res 2012;6(7):1233-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Parent's grade of job has also been credited as a factor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In cases of incest involving a child and adult, legislation usually considers it to be a form of [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Levesque, Roger J. R. (1999).

Indiana University Press. pp. 1,5–6,176–180.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm "United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |date=June 11, 2010 }}.

== Epidemiological features ==
Multiple studies have established consanguinity as a high cause for birth defects and abnormalities. A risk of [[autosomal recessive disorder]]s increases in offspring coming from consanguineous marriages due to the increased likelihood of receiving recessive genes from cognate parents.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; According to population based case-control studies, a higher risk of [[stillbirth]] is associated with consanguineous marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Maghsoudlou S, Cnattingius S, Bahmanyar S, et al. Consanguineous marriage, prepregnancy maternal characteristics and stillbirth risk: a population-based case-control study. ''Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica'' [serial online]. October 2015;94(10):1095-1101. Available from: Academic Search Complete, Ipswich, MA. Accessed October 25, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inbreeding is associated with decreased cognitive abilities in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fareed | first1 = M | last2 = Afzal | first2 = M | year = 2014 | title = Estimating the Inbreeding Depression on Cognitive Behavior: A Population Based Study of Child Cohort | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 9 | issue = 10| page = e109585 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0109585 | pmid=25313490 | pmc=4196914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger ages of marriage are commonly seen in consanguineous marriages, which may account for the increase in fertility seen in these unions. Chances of postnatal mortality are higher in offspring.The first year holds the highest chance of death due to the risk of [[Autosomal recessive disorder|autosomal recessive genes]]. This is also the cause of health complications as children born from consanguinity enter adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Bittles, A. (1994). The Role and Significance of Consanguinity as a Demographic Variable.

The '''''Cyranides''''' (also '''''Kyranides''''' or '''''Kiranides''''') is a compilation of magico-medical works in [[ancient Greek|Greek]] first put together in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;David Bain, "περιγίνεσθαι as a Medical Term and a Conjecture in the ''Cyranides''," in ''Ethics and Rhetoric: Classical Essays for Donald Russell on His Seventy-Fifth Birthday'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995), p. 283 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WVpdaXDgvq4C&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA283,M1 online.] Christopher A. Faraone, ''Ancient Greek Love Magic'' p. 121, dates the work to the 1st century.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Latin]] translation also exists. It has been described as a "[[farrago (disambiguation)|farrago]]" and a ''texte vivant'',&lt;ref&gt;[[French language|French]], "living text"; that is, an "open" document or text undergoing continuing revision by multiple hands and existing in no one authoritative form; see [[Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; owing to the complexities of its [[Textual criticism#Process|transmission]]: it has been abridged, rearranged, and supplemented. The resulting compilation covers the magical properties and practical uses of gemstones, plants, and animals, and is a virtual encyclopedia of [[amulet]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Faraone, ''Ancient Greek Love Magic'', pp. 11 and 121.&lt;/ref&gt; it also contains material pertinent to the history of western [[alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;David Bain, "Μελανῖτις γῆ in the ''Cyranides'' and Related Texts: New Evidence for the Origins and Etymology of Alchemy," in ''Magic in the Biblical World: From the [[Aaron's Rod|Rod of Aaron]] to the [[Seal of Solomon|Ring of Solomon]]'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2003), pp. 209–210, especially note 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[New Testament]] studies, particularly in illuminating meanings of words and magico-religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey B. Gibson, ''Temptations of Jesus in Early Christianity'' (Continuum International Publishing, 2004), p. 246 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd6YCDdfSCcC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  online]; used as a source by James A. Kelhoffer, ''The Diet of [[John the Baptist]]: "Locusts and Wild Honey" in Synoptic and Patristic Interpretation'' (Mohr Siebeck, 2005), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a medical text, the ''Cyranides'' was held in relatively low esteem even in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] because of its use of [[vernacular]] language and reliance on [[folklore|lore]] rather than [[Hippocratic]] or [[Galen]]ic medical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Mavroudi, "Occult Science and Society in Byzantium: Considerations for Future Research," University of California, Berkeley, p. 84, full text [http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/cmrs/medstudies_readings/mar2_mavroudi.pdf downloadable.]{{dl|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'', [[Thomas Browne]] described the ''Cyranides'' as "a collection out of [[Harpocration]] the Greek and sundry [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabick writers]] delivering not only the Naturall but Magicall propriety of things."&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Bain, "Μελανῖτις γῆ," p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''Cyranides'' was considered "dangerous and disreputable" in the Middle Ages, it was translated into Latin by [[Pascalis Romanus]], a [[cleric|clergyman]] with medical expertise who was the Latin interpreter for Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]]. The 14th-century [[cleric]] [[Demetrios Chloros]] was put on trial because he transcribed magical texts, including what was referred to as the ''Coeranis''.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "Μελανῖτις γῆ," p. 208, note 61; Mavroudi, "Occult Science and Society in Byzantium," p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form and structure==
The original 4th-century ''Cyranides'' comprised three books, to which a [[redaction|redactor]] added a fourth. The original first book of the ''Cyranides'', the Κυρανίς (''Kuranis''), was the second component of a two-part work, the first part of which was the Ἀρχαϊκἠ (''Archaikê''). Books 2–4 are a [[bestiary]]. The [[Cyranides#Editions|edition of Kaimakis (see below)]] contains a fifth and sixth book which were not transmitted under the name ''Cyranides'' but which were included with the work in a limited number of manuscripts. A medieval [[Classical Arabic|Arabic]] translation of the first book exists, and portions of it are "reflected" in the [[Old French]] work ''Le livre des secrez de nature'' (''The Book of Nature's Secrets'').

The ''Cyranides'' begins by instructing the reader to keep its contents secret, and with a fictional narrative of how the work was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "Μελανῖτις γῆ," pp. 195 [https://books.google.com/books?id=JCNplxqmQpEC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA195,M1 online], 203 and 209; "περιγίνεσθαι as a Medical Term," p. 283; "Some Textual and Lexical Notes on ''Cyranides'' 'Books Five and Six'," ''[[Classica et Mediaevalia]]'' 47 (1996), pp. 151–168 [https://books.google.com/books?id=uOT0qTRW0gQC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; In one 15th-century manuscript, the author of the work is said to be Kyranos (Κοίρανος), king of [[Persian Empire|Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;Mavroudi, "Occult Science and Society in Byzantium," p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sample remedies and spells==
The ''Cyranides'' devotes a chapter to the healing powers of the water snake; its [[bezoar]] is used to cure [[edema|dropsy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "περιγίνεσθαι as a Medical Term," p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Fish [[gall]] is recommended for healing white spots in the eye; fish liver is supposed to cure blindness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erich S. Gruen]], ''Diaspora: Jews Amidst Greeks and Romans'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), p. 319 [https://books.google.com/books?id=t1IR4WtFjGUC&amp;pg=PA319&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; For a "large and pleasurable" [[Erection#Penile erection|erection]], a mixture of [[arugula]], spices, and honey is recommended, as is carrying the tail of a lizard or the right [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] of a [[skink]].&lt;ref&gt;Faraone, ''Ancient Greek Love Magic'', p. 21, note 93. The possession of a molar by a skink seems not to be questioned; one wonders whether the translation is accurate.&lt;/ref&gt; The fumigation or wearing of [[Bear#Culture|bear]] hair turns away evil spirits and fever.&lt;ref&gt;Mavroudi, "Occult Science and Society in Byzantium," p. 84, note 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Ogden, a specialist in magic and the supernatural in antiquity, has gathered several references from the ''Cyranides'' on the use of gemstones and amulets.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Ogden, '' Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Sourcebook'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), ''passim'', limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3QRxWQQtcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0  online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The collection offers spells to avert the child-harming demon [[Gello]], who was blamed for [[miscarriage]]s and [[infant mortality]], and says that [[aetites|aetite]] can be worn as an amulet against miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Iles Johnston, ''Restless Dead: Encounters Between the Living and the Dead in Ancient Greece'' (University of California Press, 1999), pp. 166–167 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qbihKIJw_OUC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magico-religious tradition==
[[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympidorus]] provides a summary of a passage from the work, not part of the abridged version now extant, that has [[cosmology|cosmological]] as well as alchemical implications:

[[File:Talpa europaea MHNT Tete.jpg|thumb|The mole: once a man, and cursed for revealing the secrets of the sun, according to the '''''Cyranides''''']]
{{cquote|Again in ''Kyranis'' [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]], speaking riddlingly of the egg, said that it is properly the substance of gold-[[solder]] and the moon. For the egg challenges the golden-haired cosmos: the [[Rooster|cockerel]], Hermes says, was once a man, cursed by the sun. This he says in the book called ''Ancient'' (''archaike''). In it he also makes mention of the [[Mole (animal)|mole]], saying that it too was once a man. It was cursed by god for revealing the secrets of the sun. And the sun made it blind and if it happens to be observed by the sun, the earth does not receive it till evening. He says '&lt;the sun made it blind&gt; as it knew as well what was the shape of the sun.' He exiled it in the ''melanitis'' land [black earth?],&lt;ref&gt;Based on the Latin translation and a poor text of the Greek, [[E.H.F. Meyer]] thought that μελανῖτις γῆ referred to southern [[Greater Syria|Syria]]; others have thought [[Ethiopia]]; [[Egypt]] is now the standard view.&lt;/ref&gt; as a law-breaker and divulger of his secret to the human race.&lt;ref&gt;Bain, "Μελανῖτις γῆ," p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the extant version, the ''Cyranides'' contains a description of the ''heliodromus'', a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]-like bird from [[India]] which, upon hatching, flies to the rising sun and then goes west when the sun passes the [[zenith]]. It lives only a year, and, according to some interpretations  of an unreliable text, leaves behind an [[androgyny|androgynous]] progeny.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roel van den Broek|R. van den Broek]], ''The Myth of the Phoenix According to Classical and Early Christian Traditions'' (Brill, N.D.), pp. 286–287 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=cyranides&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA286,M1 online.].

The '''General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina''', also known as the '''Dayton Agreement''', '''Dayton Accords''', '''Paris Protocol''' or '''Dayton–Paris Agreement''', ({{lang-bs|Dejtonski mirovni sporazum}}, {{lang-sr|Dejtonski mirovni sporazum}}, {{lang-hr|Daytonski sporazum}}) is the peace agreement reached at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] near [[Dayton, Ohio]], United States, on 1 November 1995, and formally signed in [[Paris]], [[France]], on 14 December 1995. These accords put an end to the {{frac|3|1|2}}-year-long [[Bosnian War]], one of the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

==Negotiation and signature ==
Though basic elements of the Dayton Agreement were proposed in international talks as early as 1992,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976369,00.html Munich All Over Again?], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 31 August 1992&lt;/ref&gt; these negotiations were initiated following the [[Peace plans offered before and during the Bosnian War|unsuccessful previous peace efforts and arrangements]], the August 1995 Croatian military [[Operation Storm]] and its aftermath, the government military offensive against the [[Republika Srpska (1992&amp;ndash;95)|Republika Srpska]], conducted in parallel with NATO's [[Operation Deliberate Force]]. During September and October 1995, world powers (especially the United States and Russia), gathered in the [[Contact Group]], applied intense pressure to the leaders of the three sides to attend the negotiations in Dayton, Ohio.

The conference took place from 1–21 November 1995. The main participants from the region were the President of the [[Republic of Serbia (1992–2006)|Republic of Serbia]] [[Slobodan Milošević]] (representing the Bosnian Serb interests due to the absence of [[Radovan Karadžić|Karadžić]]), President of Croatia [[Franjo Tuđman]], and President of Bosnia and Herzegovina [[Alija Izetbegović]] with his Foreign Minister [[Muhamed Sacirbey|Muhamed Šaćirbeg]].

The peace conference was led by US Secretary of State [[Warren Christopher]], and negotiator [[Richard Holbrooke]] with two Co-Chairmen in the form of EU Special Representative [[Carl Bildt]] and the First Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia [[Igor Ivanov]]. A key participant in the US delegation was General [[Wesley Clark]] (later to become NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe ([[SACEUR]]) in 1997). The head of the UK's team was [[Pauline Neville-Jones]], political director of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The UK military representative was [[David Leakey|Col Arundell David Leakey]] (later to become Commander of [[EUFOR]] in 2005). [[Paul Williams (professor)|Paul Williams]], through the [[Public International Law &amp; Policy Group]] (PILPG) served as legal counsel to the Bosnian Government delegation during the negotiations.

The secure site was chosen in order to remove all the parties from their [[comfort zone]], without which they would have little incentive to negotiate; to reduce their ability to negotiate through the media; and to securely house over 800 staff and attendants. Curbing the participants' ability to negotiate via the media was a particularly important consideration. [[Richard Holbrooke]] wanted to prevent posturing through early leaks to the press.

After having been initialled in Dayton, Ohio, on 21 November 1995, the full and formal agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=30 March 1996|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/or/dayton/|title=Dayton Accords|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and witnessed by [[Spanish Prime Minister]] [[Felipe Gonzalez]], [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]], [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]], [[UK Prime Minister]] [[John Major]], [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] and [[Russian Prime Minister]] [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]].

==Content==
The agreement's main purpose is to promote peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to endorse regional balance in and around the former [[SFRJ|Yugoslavia]] (Article V, annex 1-B), thus in a regional perspective.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cannon, P., The Third Balkan War and Political Disunity: Creating A Cantonal Constitutional System for Bosnia-Herzegovina, Jrnl. Trans. L. &amp; Pol., Vol. 5-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The present [[political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and its [[politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|structure of government]] were agreed upon, as part the constitution that makes up Annex 4 of the General Framework Agreement concluded at Dayton. A key component of this was the delineation of the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]] to which many of the tasks listed in the Annexes referred.

The State of Bosnia Herzegovina was set as of the [[Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and of the [[Republika Srpska]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a complete state, as opposed to a confederation; no entity or entities could ever be separated from Bosnia and Herzegovina unless by due legal process. Although highly decentralised in its entities, it would still retain a central government, with a rotating State Presidency, a central bank and a constitutional court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The agreement mandated a wide range of international organizations to monitor, oversee and implement components of the agreement. The NATO-led [[IFOR]] (Implementation Force) was responsible for implementing military aspects of the agreement and deployed on 20 December 1995, taking over the forces of the [[UNPROFOR]]. The [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|Office of the High Representative]] was charged with the task of civil implementation. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] was charged with organising the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina general election, 1996|first free elections in 1996]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On 13 October 1997, the Croatian 1861 Law Party and the Bosnia-Herzegovina 1861 Law Party requested the [[Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to annul several decisions and to confirm one decision of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more importantly, to review the constitutionality of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina since it was alleged that the agreement violated the [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in a way that it undermined the integrity of the state and could cause the dissolution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court reached the conclusion that it is not competent to decide the dispute in regards to the mentioned decisions since the applicants were not subjects that were identified in Article VI.3 (a) of the Constitution on those who can refer disputes to the Court. The Court also rejected the other request:

{{quote|(...) the Constitutional Court is not competent to evaluate the constitutionality of the General Framework Agreement as the Constitutional Court has in fact been established under the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to uphold this Constitution (...) The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted as Annex IV to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and consequently there cannot be a conflict or a possibility for controversy between this Agreement and the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-7/97, p. 2 and 3, [[Sarajevo]], 22 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was one of the early cases in which the Court had to deal with the question of the legal nature of the Constitution. By making the remark in the manner of ''[[obiter dictum]]'' concerning the Annex IV (the Constitution) and the rest of the peace agreement, the Court actually "established the ground for ''legal unity''"&lt;ref&gt;Vehabović, Faris (2006). Odnos Ustava Bosne i Hercegovine i Evropske konvencije za zaštitu ljudskih prava i osnovnih sloboda. Sarajevo: ACIPS, 24. {{ISBN|9958-9187-0-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the entire peace agreement, which further implied that all of the annexes are in the hierarchical equality. In later decisions the Court confirmed that by using other annexes of the peace agreement as a direct base for the analysis, not only in the context of systematic interpretation of the Annex IV. However, since the Court rejected the presented request of the appellants, it did not go into details concerning the controversial questions of the legality of the process in which the new Constitution (Annex IV) came to power and replaced the former Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Court used the same reasoning to dismiss the similar claim in a later case.&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U-1/03, Sarajevo, 25 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial changes==

 [[File:Bih dayton en.png|thumb|right|Political division of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the Dayton Agreement.]]
Before the agreement, [[Bosnian Serbs]] controlled about 46% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (23,687&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), [[Bosniaks]] 28% (14,505&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[Bosnian Croats]] 25% (12,937&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Bosnian Serbs got large tracts of mountainous territories back (4% from Bosnian Croats and some small amounts from Bosniaks), but they had to surrender Sarajevo and some vital Eastern Bosnian/Herzegovian positions. Their percentage grew to 49% (48% by excluding the Brčko District, 24,526&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) from a little bit more than 46% prior to Dayton.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Bosniaks got most of [[Sarajevo]] and some important positions in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina while they lost only a few locations on Mount [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] and in western Bosnia. Their percentage grew from 28%, prior to Dayton to 30%, and they greatly improved the quality of the land. Large tracts of prewar Bosniak (and Bosnian Croat) inhabited lands remained under Bosnian Serb control.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Bosnian Croats gave most (4% of BiH territories) back to the Bosnian Serbs (9% of today's RS) and also retreated from Una-Sana [[Donji Vakuf]] (in Central Bosnia) afterward. A small enlargement of Posavina ([[Odžak]] and parts of Domaljevac) have not changed the fact that after Dayton Bosnian Croats controlled just 21% of Bosnia and Herzegovina (10,640&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), especially when compared to more than 25% prior to Dayton. One of the most important Bosnian Croat territories ([[Posavina]] with [[Bosanski Brod]], [[Bosanski Šamac]], [[Derventa]]) was left out of Bosnian Croat control.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Control of Republika Srpska===
*About 89.5% (22,059&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was under control of [[Bosnian Serbs]]
*About 9% (2,117&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of today's territories of Republika Srpska was controlled by Bosnian Croat forces; mainly in municipalities of [[Šipovo]], [[Bosanski Petrovac|Petrovac]], [[Istočni Drvar]], [[Jezero, Republika Srpska|Jezero]], [[Kupres (Republika Srpska)|Kupres (RS)]] and part of [[Banja Luka]] municipality
*About 1.5% (350&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of today's territories of Republika Srpska was controlled by Bosniak forces, mainly some villages in [[Ozren (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Ozren]] (Doboj and [[Petrovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Petrovo]]), western Bosnia ([[Krupa na Uni]] and parts of [[Novi Grad, Bosanska Krajina|Novi Grad]] and [[Oštra Luka]]).

===Control of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina===
*About 53% (13,955&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was under [[Bosniak]] control.
*About 41% (10,720&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina was under the control of [[Bosnian Croats]].
*About 6% (1,435&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was under control of [[Bosnian Serbs]].

==Analysis==
The immediate purpose of the agreement was to freeze the military confrontation and prevent it from resuming. It was thefore defined as a "construction of necessity".&lt;ref&gt;Rory Keane, ''Reconstructing sovereignty. Post-Dayton Bosnia uncovered'', London: Ashgate 2001, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, the Dayton Agreement proved to be a highly flexible instrument, allowing Bosnia and Herzegovina to move from an early post-conflict phase through reconstruction and consolidation, passing from a [[consociationalism|consociationalist]] approach to a more integrationist one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Many scholars refer to it as "the most impressive example of conflict resolution".&lt;ref&gt;Charles-Philippe David, "Alice in Wonderland meets Frankenstein: Constructivism, Realism and Peacebuilding in Bosnia", ''Contemporary Security Policy'' 22, No.1, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Petritsch]], [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina|OHR]], has argued that the Dayton framework has allowed the [[international community]] to move "from statebuilding via institutions and capacity-building to identity building", putting Bosnia and Herzegovina "on the road to [[Brussels]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Petritsch]], "My lessons learnt in Bosnia and Herzegovina", Sarajevo, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Dayton Agreement has come across much criticism since its inception, including:

A complicated government system - 
As part of the Dayton agreement, Bosnia was divided into 2 entities and a government structure was created to appease all sides. However, by creating such a dissolved government, Bosnia has stalled in moving forward as every important issue is deadlocked within the central government as each party is championing opposing priorities that are based on ethnic policies and not shared ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yourdin|first1=C|title=Society Building in Bosnia: A Critique of Post-Dayton Peacebuilding Efforts'|journal=Journal of Diplomacy and international Relations|date=2003|volume=4|issue=2|pages=59–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency and control of international actors - 
Dayton was very much an international vision, led by the United States who supported an end to the war, but that didn't allow Bosnian leaders to negotiate an ending to the war, therefore leaving no incentive in the afterward peacebuilding process and no area for leaders to discuss the underlying root causes of the conflict. International actors also played an extensive role in shaping the postwar agenda in Bosnia, including enacting punishment over local political actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=David|title=From Dayton to Europe|journal=International Peacekeeping|date=2005|volume=12|issue=3|pages=336–349|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13533310500074077|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influx of NGOs and international actors to kick start investment in the country post war also failed to kick start the economy, with Bosnia suffering from poor economic growth (2% in 2015). The lack of economic development has been attributed to poor coordination between international actors and lack of consideration for local capacity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kell, Kudlenko|first1=S, A|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina 20 years after Dayton, complexity born of paradoxes|journal=International peacekeeping|year=2015|volume=22|issue=5|pages=471–489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ending the war but not promoting peace - 
The primary aims of Dayton was to stop the war, but the agreement was only meant to be a temporary measure while a long term plan was developed. While Dayton has halted the conflict and there has not been an resurgence of violence, the stability in the conflict does not give an accurate assessment of peace. There is still currently a large military presence to mitigate any chance of violence and to enforce peace in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berdal |first1=M| last2=Collantes-Celador|first2=G|title=Post-War Violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina|journal=Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding|pages=75–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforcing such peace can be seen as highlighting the still deep rooted tensions in the country, with Dayton covering the cracks of a fractured society that could be plunged back into conflict as soon as military forces left.

==Disappearance of original document==
On 13 February 2008, the head of the [[Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] [[Željko Komšić]] said that the original Dayton Agreement was lost from the Presidency's archive. High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina [[Miroslav Lajčak]] said: "I don't know whether the news is sad or funny".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Izgubljen original Dejtonskog sporazuma |url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Republika-Srpska/30394/Izgubljen-original-Dejtonskog-sporazuma |work=[[Blic]] |date=13 February 2008 |language=Serbian |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November 2009 the French Foreign Ministry delivered the certified copy of the Dayton agreement to the French embassy in Sarajevo. The copy was later transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia-Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Francuska dostavila BiH kopiju Dejtonskog sporazuma |url=http://www.politika.rs/vesti/najnovije-vesti/FRANCUSKA-DOSTAVILA-BiH-KOPIJU-DEJTONSKOG-SPORAZUMA-i112057.lt.html |newspaper=[[Politika]] |date=16 November 2009 |language=Serbian |accessdate=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original was found in 2017 in a private residence in [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]], resulting in arrest of one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.b92.net/eng/news/region.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=11&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=102695|title=Man arrested in possession of original Dayton Agreement|work=b92.net|date=1 November 2017|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julieka Ivanna Dhu''' (commonly referred to as '''Ms Dhu'''; her first name was generally not used in media reports out of respect for [[Australian Aboriginal avoidance practices#Avoidance of naming the dead|Aboriginal naming customs]]) was a 22-year-old [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] woman who died in police custody in [[South Hedland]], [[Western Australia]], in 2014. On 2 August that year, police responded to a report that Dhu's partner had violated an [[Injunction#Australian apprehended violence orders|apprehended violence order]]. Upon arriving at their address, the officers arrested both Dhu and her partner after realising there was also an outstanding arrest warrant for unpaid fines against Dhu. She was detained in police custody in South Hedland and was ordered to serve four days in custody to clear her debt.

While in custody, Dhu complained of pain and was taken to the Hedland Health Campus hospital twice. Medical staff believed her complaints were exaggerated and suspected drug withdrawal. On 4 August, Dhu reported that she could no longer stand. Police officers, who accused her of faking her condition, handcuffed her,  carried her to the back of their van and returned her to the hospital; she was pronounced dead shortly after arrival. The official cause of death was an infection due to her partner's breaking of her ribs three months earlier.

An internal police investigation found that 11 officers had either failed to comply with regulations or were otherwise guilty of misconduct. They were given written and verbal warnings. A [[coroner|coronial]] inquest found that she had suffered "unprofessional and inhumane" handling by police and "deficient" treatment from hospital staff.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; It also established that police and hospital staff had been influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginal people. The inquest recommended that the justice system should stop imprisoning people for unpaid fines and introduce a [[Custody Notification Scheme]] (CNS). {{As of|May 2018}}, the state government has promised to have a CNS operational by the end of 2018, and a reform proposal to end jailing people for unpaid fines is expected to be introduced into state parliament in late 2018.

==Background==
===Ms Dhu===
Julieka Ivanna Dhu was born on 26 December 1991 in [[Port Hedland]], [[Western Australia]] (WA).&lt;ref name=coroner/&gt; She was [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and of the [[Yamatji]] people.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; She lived with her parents until they separated when she was three, after which she was mostly raised by her grandmother in [[Geraldton]], though her parents remained in regular contact with her. She was described as a "cheerful" child whose only health issue was mild [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=coroner&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coronerscourt.wa.gov.au/_files/dhu%20finding.pdf |title=Inquest into the death of Julieka Ivanna DHU |last=Fogliani |first=Rosalinda |date=16 December 2016 |publisher=Western Australian Coroner's Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhu completed [[Year Eleven]];&lt;ref name=coroner/&gt; according to her family, after leaving school, she seemed to associate "with a bad crowd" and was a "wild child".&lt;ref name=paying/&gt;

In November 2009, when she was 17, police found Dhu sleeping near [[Cable Beach]]; when they woke her she appeared to be intoxicated, swore at them and said "I don't remember anything after taking that [[MDMA|eccy]]".&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Police arrested her for disorderly conduct and failing to give her name and address, and she was detained in police custody overnight. She was released on bail the next day but failed to appear at her hearing at the Children's Court and was fined $200.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; The following year, Dhu was involved in two more minor incidents involving police after she moved back to Port Hedland. On one of the occasions, she kicked a female police officer while being arrested for disorderly conduct and was later also charged with obstructing and assaulting police. Dhu was again fined by the courts.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt;

In 2013, at age 21, Dhu began a relationship with a 42-year-old man, Dion Ruffin, who had several children by previous partners and—unknown to Dhu—had criminal convictions for [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; By late December that year, Dhu's mother said her daughter had become withdrawn and had lost weight. Dhu told her mother that she and Ruffin were using [[methamphetamine]]s and their fortnightly [[Centrelink]] payments were always spent on the drug in a day or two.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Around the Easter holidays in 2014, Dhu told her grandmother Ruffin had physically assaulted her. Her grandmother helped Dhu leave Ruffin and paid for the {{convert|1100|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} bus journey from Geraldton to [[Karratha, Western Australia|Karratha]], where they had relatives.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Ruffin discovered where Dhu had sought refuge and after several weeks persuaded her to return to him. They lived together in a rented house in [[South Hedland, Western Australia|South Hedland]]. In July 2014, Dhu told her father Ruffin had broken her ribs. Ruffin subsequently admitted to the assault, saying he struck her after she had stabbed him in the leg with a pair of scissors.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt;

==Arrest==
On 2 August 2014, police received a telephone call informing them Ruffin had violated the terms of an [[Injunction#Australian apprehended violence orders|apprehended violence order]]; at the later inquest into her death, nobody gave evidence about the caller's identity.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Three months earlier, a warrant for her arrest for the unpaid fines relating to her three arrests when she was a teenager had been issued. When police arrived at their home and spoke to the pair, they discovered the outstanding arrest warrant for Dhu. Both were arrested and placed in adjoining cells in the [[South Hedland]] police station. Dhu's fines totaled $3,622, and she was ordered to serve four days in custody to repay part of the debt at the standard rate of $250 per day.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt;&lt;ref name=relive/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-20/jailing-fine-defaulters-wa-prison-overcrowding-report/7433028|title=Scrapping jail for fine defaulters will not tackle WA prison overcrowding, report finds|first=Rebecca|last=Turner |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=20 May 2016|archivedate=22 May 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522034304/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-20/jailing-fine-defaulters-wa-prison-overcrowding-report/7433028 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2016|March}}, Ruffin was in prison for violating the apprehended violence order, burglary, assault and criminal damage.

==Deterioration and death==
Dhu complained of pain soon after her arrest.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; When police asked Dhu why she was in pain, she was vague with her answers; Ruffin was sitting nearby when she was questioned.&lt;ref name=blue&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blue |first1=Ethan |title=Seeing Ms. Dhu: inquest, conquest, and (in)visibility in black women's deaths in custody |journal=Settler Colonial Studies |date=27 September 2016 |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=299–320 |doi=10.1080/2201473X.2016.1229294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers gave her two [[paracetemol]] tablets and took her to the Hedland Health Campus at 8&amp;nbsp;pm that night. After a brief examination, she was given a [[triage]] score of four; the second-lowest level of urgency. Dr. Annie Lang, who assessed Dhu, later told the inquest she believed Dhu's pain was genuine but that she was exaggerating her condition. She gave Dhu [[endone]] and [[diazepam]], and declared her well enough to return to police custody. Dhu was returned to her cell shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt;&lt;ref name=paying/&gt;

Dhu's father told Bond he did not have that much money and also told him Dhu was a user of methamphetamine. Bond later told the inquest he formed the opinion that Dhu was faking her condition so she would be removed from her cell; he informed other officers of his opinion. Late that afternoon, police took Dhu, who was handcuffed, back to the Health Campus. Medical staff notes said Dhu was "Crying in pain&amp;nbsp;...

Dhu asked to go to the hospital again on the morning of 4 August, telling officers she was no longer able to stand. Officer Shelly Burgess, who had just arrived on shift, stated that Sgt.

At that time, the [[government of Western Australia]] and WA police were still said to be investigating the matter; a report was being prepared for the coroner.&lt;ref name=distressed&gt;{{cite web|date=30 October 2014|title=Ms Dhu death: Family distressed by details of WA lockup death amid calls for urgent inquiry|first1=Caitlyn|last1=Gribbin|first2=Dale|last2=Owens|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-23/family-distressed-by-details-of-wa-death-in-custody-ms-dhu/5835084|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213150009/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-23/family-distressed-by-details-of-wa-death-in-custody-ms-dhu/5835084|archivedate=13 February 2016|deadurl=no|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premier Barnett expressed his sympathy for Dhu's family at a Perth rally in late 2014, and promised to make sure that "the full truth will come out",&lt;ref name=castan/&gt; but insisted the inquest they were calling for would not be necessary.&lt;ref name=castan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Castan |first=Steven |year=2014 |title=Downunderallover: Developments around the country |journal=[[Alternative Law Journal]] |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=277–278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, an anonymous activist group called 'allies of Ms Dhu' began projecting images of Dhu and her family on buildings in Perth to raise awareness over her death and the upcoming inquest.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=klip/&gt; On the first anniversary of her death, multiple protests were held around Australia demanding an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2015/08/04/demands-answers-anniversary-death-custody |title=Demands for answers on anniversary of death in custody |last=Burton-Bradley |first=Robert |date=8 October 2016 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180408124845/https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2015/08/04/demands-answers-anniversary-death-custody |archivedate=8 April 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=8 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dhu's death and her family's activism attracted national media attention, something that is rare for [[Indigenous deaths in custody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wahlquist |first1=Calla |last2=Evershed |first2=Nick |last3=Allam |first3=Lorena |title=We examined every Indigenous death in custody since 2008.

Police and medical staff consistently testified they thought Dhu had been faking her illness;&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Burgess said she thought Dhu had pretended to faint to get quicker treatment.&lt;ref name=burgess/&gt; The inquest heard that 11 police officers had received disciplinary notices for failing to follow correct procedure and that an internal police investigation found four of them had "engaged in unprofessional conduct" and their handling of the situation was "without any sense of urgency&amp;nbsp;... [they] failed to comprehend and respond to the seriousness of the situation".&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Burgess received the severest disciplinary action of the eleven; a warning notice from the assistant commissioner for the "lack of urgency" she displayed after Dhu hit her head on the concrete.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; Three other officers were given written warnings and seven received verbal warnings. None of the warnings resulted in immediate disciplinary action; they only affected the officers' chance of promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/03/police-may-have-contributed-to-ms-dhus-death-in-custody-inquest-told |title=Police 'may have contributed' to Ms Dhu's death in custody, inquest told |last=Wahlquist |first=Calla |date=5 December 2015 |work=[[Guardian Australia]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180407134626/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/03/police-may-have-contributed-to-ms-dhus-death-in-custody-inquest-told |archivedate=7 April 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=7 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the police officers told the inquest that at the time they did not understand the notices or the reasons they had been given them. Two of the officers who received warnings had since been promoted; Sgt. Bond had quit the police force, telling the inquest he had done so for "family reasons".&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; When asked if he treated Dhu inhumanely, Bond responded, "I wouldn't say inhumane. I would say unprofessional."&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; A medical expert testified that if Dhu's condition had been correctly diagnosed on her second visit to hospital, her life could have been saved.&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Sandra Thompson, Professor of Rural Health at the [[University of Western Australia]], told the inquest that if Dhu had been a white middle-class person, "there would have been much more effort made to understand what was going on with that person's pain. So that's what institutional racism represents."&lt;ref name=paying/&gt; Senior medical officer Ganesan Sakarapani said the Hedland Health Campus did not have a culture of [[institutionalised racism]] and rejected a suggestion that if Dhu had been white, she would have been treated differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=26 November 2015|agency=AAP|title=Hedland Health Campus denies racism against Ms Dhu at Aboriginal death in custody inquest|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/hedland-health-campus-denies-racism-against-ms-dhu-at-aboriginal-death-in-custody-inquest/news-story/078c5855077b5593a730a9fb4546dcb9|work=[[Perth Now]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306182815/http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/hedland-health-campus-denies-racism-against-ms-dhu-at-aboriginal-death-in-custody-inquest/news-story/078c5855077b5593a730a9fb4546dcb9|archivedate=6 March 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of the inquest by State Coroner [[Rosalinda Fogliani]] were delivered on 16 December 2016.&lt;ref name=coroner/&gt; Fogliani found that police had subjected Dhu to "unprofessional and inhumane" treatment that was "well below the standards that should ordinarily be expected".&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; She stated Dhu's treatment at her second hospital visit was "deficient", that both police and hospital staff had been influenced by preconceived ideas about Aboriginals,&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; and that the decision to handcuff Dhu when she was nearly unconscious was "shameful".&lt;ref name=klip/&gt; While the inquest was still open, Fogliani declined requests to release the footage of Dhu in custody, saying that Dhu's privacy outweighed the public interest. The refusal resulted in a backlash from Dhu's family and Aboriginal rights groups, who argued the refusal amounted to a "cover up" of racism. A social media campaign, using the [[Hashtag activism|hashtag]] #releasethecctv, called for the footage to be released.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=klip/&gt; Upon delivering the inquest's findings, Fogliani ordered that the footage be made public, with the exception of her third hospital visit.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; Fogliani did not recommend any criminal prosecutions against police or hospital staff,&lt;ref name=klip/&gt; though did recommend the cessation of the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines and the introduction of a mandatory CNS.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt;

===Reaction===
Dhu's family were unhappy with the result as the inquest did not hold any person accountable for her death, and told media they intended to pursue further legal action. WA Police Commissioner [[Karl O'Callaghan]] said he accepted that the police force had failed to provide for Dhu's safety, welfare and dignity. Dennis Eggington, the chief executive of the [[Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia]] (ALSWA), said the coroner's recommendations were "fine" but they had come too late.&lt;ref name=inhumane/&gt; Upon receiving a copy of the inquest, Premier Barnett indicated that he would not be implementing either of its recommendations.&lt;ref name=klip&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Klippmark |first1=Pauline |last2=Crawley |first2=Karen |title=Justice for Ms Dhu: Accounting for Indigenous Deaths in Custody in Australia |journal=[[Social &amp; Legal Studies]] |date=16 October 2017 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1177/0964663917734415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the release of the inquest, singer [[Felix Riebl]] composed a tribute song titled "Ms Dhu", and released an accompanying music video criticising the police and the government over her death.&lt;ref name=klip/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-10/the-cat-empire-member-new-song-about-ms-dhu-death-in-custody/8172040 |title=Ms Dhu's death in custody case focus of new song by The Cat Empire's Felix Riebl |last=Day |first=Lauren |date=10 January 2017 |work= |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180613134925/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-10/the-cat-empire-member-new-song-about-ms-dhu-death-in-custody/8172040 |archivedate=13 June 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=13 June 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Images of Dhu and footage of her treatment by police has circulated online in association with the [[Black Lives Matter]], [[SayHerName]] and [[Idle No More]] movements, which was credited with creating solidarity between Aboriginal campaigns for justice and North American and global movements.&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;&lt;ref name=klip/&gt;

An article in the journal ''[[Social &amp; Legal Studies]]'' argued that Dhu's death was inherently linked to "gendered, institutional and structural racism" endemic to Australia, and that the coroner showed little consideration for this and instead attributed the death to a series of "individual failures". The article noted the inquest's finding that the only person who treated Dhu with dignity was the most inexperienced officer involved, and argued that this was because that officer had had the least amount of exposure to the culture of the WA police force.&lt;ref name=klip/&gt; An article in the journal ''[[Settler Colonial Studies]]'' reached similar conclusions, arguing that the inquest was "a performative attempt in the maintenance of [Australia's colonial] conquest", which was "incapable of addressing the foundations of Ms. Dhu's suffering: colonial patriarchy and dispossession, in the form of the settler carceral state".&lt;ref name=blue/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In June 2015, in direct response to Dhu's death, the WA state government announced that police detention would be made safer and that efforts would be made to keep some low-level offenders and youth offenders out of custody. It did not clarify whether this would include people who had unpaid fines. ALSWA welcomed the announcement but said it needed to be backed up with action. Dhu's grandmother said the proposed changes did not address all of her concerns, though they were a good start. [[Joe Francis (politician)|Joe Francis]], then [[Minister for Corrective Services (Western Australia)|Minister for Corrective Services]], opposed any plans to end jailing people for unpaid fines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-24/safer-wa-lock-ups-and-fewer-jail-sentences-after-miss-dhu-death/6570478 |title=Safer lock-ups, fewer jail terms for minor offenders after Ms Dhu death: WA Government |last=Perpitch |first=Nicolas |date=25 June 2015 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180408120342/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-24/safer-wa-lock-ups-and-fewer-jail-sentences-after-miss-dhu-death/6570478 |archivedate=8 April 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=8 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier that year he had called for even harsher penalties for fine defaulters, including longer prison sentences.&lt;ref name=hilde&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/wa/wa-welfare-recipients-who-avoid-paying-fines-face-longer-jail-time-ng-6b76fcb2b1edf52ca76b4b4261ab646e |title=WA welfare recipients who avoid paying fines face longer jail time |date=13 January 2015 |work=Perth Now |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180620145614/https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/wa/wa-welfare-recipients-who-avoid-paying-fines-face-longer-jail-time-ng-6b76fcb2b1edf52ca76b4b4261ab646e |archivedate=20 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Newhouse, chairman of the DICWC WA, said Francis' proposal made government promises to reduce the incarceration rate for Aboriginals "look like a lie",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/13/wa-crackdown-on-fine-defaulters-a-broken-promise-says-indigenous-group |title=WA crackdown on fine defaulters a broken promise, says Indigenous group |last=Wahlquist |first=Calla |date=13 January 2015 |work=[[Guardian Australia]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180527071353/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jan/13/wa-crackdown-on-fine-defaulters-a-broken-promise-says-indigenous-group |archivedate=27 May 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=27 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and University of Western Australia criminologist Dr Hilde Tubex said such a proposal would negatively impact on indigenous people, women and those affected by poverty.&lt;ref name=hilde/&gt;

In May 2016, a report by Neil Morgan, Inspector of Custodial Services, recommended that WA stop jailing people for unpaid fines. His report mentioned the Dhu case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-20/jailing-fine-defaulters-wa-prison-overcrowding-report/7433028 |title=Scrapping jail for fine defaulters will not tackle WA prison overcrowding, report finds |last=Turner |first=Rebecca |date=20 May 2016 |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180408115903/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-20/jailing-fine-defaulters-wa-prison-overcrowding-report/7433028 |archivedate=8 April 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=1 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2016 [[Nigel Scullion]], the federal [[Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Indigenous Affairs]], offered to fund the first three years of implementation for any state that legislated a CNS. The WA state government rejected the offer.&lt;ref name=ex/&gt; In March 2017, just prior to [[Western Australian state election, 2017|the 2017 state election]], Dhu's family criticised both of the major political parties in WA for not supporting such a scheme. The incumbent [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] voiced their opposition to the program while the [[Australian Labor Party (Western Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] said they would consider the scheme but made no commitments. The Labor Party voiced its support for the end of the jailing of people for unpaid fines.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;

In September 2017, Dhu's family were awarded $1.1 million [[ex gratia]] and received a formal apology from the WA state government. The payment does not prevent Dhu's family from taking further legal action, and was separate from a civil suit lodged in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] in July 2017 by them. Dhu's grandmother said she was surprised by the payment and apology, though she would have rather seen people held accountable for Dhu's death. [[Attorney-General of Western Australia]] [[John Quigley (politician)|John Quigley]], who announced the payment, also reaffirmed his intention to implement a mandatory CNS.&lt;ref name=ex&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/ms-dhus-family-gets-11m-payment-and-state-apology-over-death-in-custody |title=Ms Dhu's family gets $1.1m payment and state apology over death in custody |last=Wahlquist |first=Calla |date=20 September 2017 |work=[[Guardian Australia]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180408111853/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/ms-dhus-family-gets-11m-payment-and-state-apology-over-death-in-custody |archivedate=8 April 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=8 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2017, the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] was reported to be urging the other states and territories to implement a CNS. John Quigley supported such a program, saying "I think it [is] life-saving legislation. I'm sure if they took the late Ms Dhu into custody&amp;nbsp;... if the Aboriginal Legal Service [had] been contacted on day one it would have been a very different outcome".&lt;ref name=cns/&gt; An online petition calling for the scheme was signed by almost 20,000 people in less than one week.&lt;ref name=cns/&gt;

On 7 May 2018, Dhu's cousin Alira Kelly-Ryder was informed a warrant for her arrest for unpaid fines totaling $3,744 had been issued.&lt;ref name=exclusive/&gt; Kelly-Ryder had been making regular repayments on the fines but was unable to continue doing so after she became unemployed when her work contract as a [[liaison officer]] at [[Banksia Hill Juvenile Detention Centre]] was not renewed. After her story was aired on [[National Indigenous Television]], a [[crowdsourcing]] campaign raised the money to pay the fines. Kelly-Ryder telephoned the Western Australian Fines Enforcement Agency later that week and offered to pay the debt, and was informed the warrant had been withdrawn. Kelly-Ryder believed the publicity surrounding her case caused the withdrawal, though she asked "what about everybody else in my position; are you going to withdraw their [arrest warrants]?".&lt;ref name=cousin/&gt; At the time, a reform proposal to end jailing people for unpaid fines was expected to be introduced in the WA state parliament later in 2018.&lt;ref name=exclusive&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2018/05/09/exclusive-warrant-out-arrest-ms-dhus-cousin-over-unpaid-fines |title=EXCLUSIVE: Warrant out for arrest of Ms Dhu's cousin over unpaid fines |last=Hayman-Reber |first=Madeline |date=9 May 2018 |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180511090908/https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2018/05/09/exclusive-warrant-out-arrest-ms-dhus-cousin-over-unpaid-fines |archivedate=11 May 2018 |deadurl=no |access-date=11 May 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''František Palacký''' ({{IPA-cs|ˈfraɲciʃɛk ˈpalatskiː}}; 14 June 1798 – 26 May 1876) was a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[historian]] and politician, the most influential person of the [[Czech National Revival]], called "Father of the Nation".&lt;ref&gt;Baar, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
František Palacký was born in the northeastern [[Moravia]]n village of [[Hodslavice]], now part of the [[Moravian-Silesian Region]] of the [[Czech Republic]]. His ancestors had been members of the community of the [[Bohemian Brethren]], and had clandestinely maintained their [[Protestant]] belief throughout the period of religious persecution, eventually giving their adherence to the [[Augsburg confession]] as approximate to their original faith. Palacký's father was a schoolmaster and a man of some learning. The son was sent in 1812 to the Evangelic [[Lutheran]] Lyceum at then-[[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] city of [[Bratislava]], where he came in contact with the [[philologist]] [[Pavel Josef Safarik|Pavel J. Šafařík]] and became a zealous student of [[Slavonic languages]] (he mastered 11 languages and became familiar with a few others).

After some years spent in private teaching, Palacký settled in 1823 at [[Prague]]. Here he found a warm friend in [[Josef Dobrovský]], whose good relations with the Austrian authorities shielded him from the hostility shown by the government to students of Slav subjects. Dobrovský introduced him to Count Sternberg and his brother Francis, both of whom took an enthusiastic interest in Bohemian history. Count Francis was the principal founder of the Society of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Bohemian Museum]], devoted to the collection of documents bearing on Bohemian history, with the object of reawakening national sentiment by the study of the national records.

===Joining of Czech national movement===
Public interest in the movement was stimulated in 1825 by the new ''Časopis Českého musea'' ("Journal of the Bohemian Museum"), of which Palacký was the first editor. The journal was at first published in Czech and German, and the Czech edition survived to become the most important literary organ of Bohemia. Palacký had received a modest appointment as archivist to Count Sternberg and in 1829 the Bohemian estates sought to confer on him the title of historiographer of Bohemia, with a small salary, but it was ten years before the consent of the Viennese authorities was obtained.

Meanwhile, the estates, with the tardy assent of Vienna, had undertaken to pay the expenses of publishing Palacký's capital work, ''Dějiny národu českého v Čechách a v Moravě'' ("The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia"). This book, which comes down to the year 1526 and the extinction of Czech independence (Palacký admitted that in writing about the national history since 1526, he "would have to lie"), was founded on laborious research in the local archives of Bohemia and in the libraries of the chief cities of Europe, and remains the standard authority. The first volume was printed in German in 1836, and subsequently translated into Czech. The publication of the work was hindered by the police-censorship, which was especially active in criticizing his account of the [[Hussite]] movement.

Palacký, though entirely national and Protestant in his sympathies, was careful to avoid an uncritical approbation of the Reformers' methods, but his statements were held by the authorities to be dangerous to the [[Catholic]] faith. He was compelled to cut out parts of his narrative and to accept as integral parts of his work passages interpolated by the censors. After the abolition of the police-censorship in 1848 he published a new edition, completed in 1876, restoring the original form of the work. The fairest and most considerable of Palacký's antagonists in the controversy aroused by his narrative of the early reformation in Bohemia was Baron Helfert, who received a brief from Vienna to write his ''Huss und Hieronymus'' (1853) to counteract the impression made by Palacký's ''History''. [[K. A. K. Höfler]], a German professor of history at Prague, edited the historical authorities for the period in a similar sense in his ''Geschichte der hussitischen Bewegung'' in Bohmen. Palacký replied in his ''Geschichte des Hussitenthumes und Professor Löffler'' (Prague, 1868) and ''Zur böhmischen Geschichtschreibung'' (Prague, 1871).

===Political activism===
[[File:PalackyLitho.jpg|thumb|upright|František Palacký (lithography, 1855)]]
The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas|Revolution of 1848]] forced the historian into practical politics. In his famous ''Psaní do Frankfurtu'' ("A Letter to Frankfurt") he refused to take part in the preliminary parliament consisting of 500 former deputies to the all-German Diet, which met at [[Frankfurt]], on the grounds that as a Czech he had no interest in German affairs.
In early June oversaw the [[Prague Slavic Congress, 1848|Slavonic Congress at Prague]] as its president. Later that year he was deputed to the Reichstag which sat at town of [[Kroměříž]] (Kremsier) between October 1848 and March 1849. He was at this time in favour of a strong Austrian empire, which should consist of a federation of the southern German and the Slavonic states, allowing the retention of their individual rights. This movement was called [[Austroslavism]]. Its views met with some degree of consideration at Vienna, and Palacký was even offered a portfolio in the [[Baron Franz von Pillersdorf|Pillersdorf]] cabinet. The collapse of the federal idea and the definite triumph of the party of reaction in 1852 led to his retirement from politics.

After the liberal concessions of 1860 and 1861, however, he became a life member of the Austrian senate. His views met with small support from the assembly, and with the exception of a short period after the decree of September 1871, by which the emperor raised hopes for Bohemian self-government, he ceased to appear in the senate from 1861 onwards. In the [[Bohemian Diet]] (''zemský sněm'') he became the acknowledged leader of the nationalist-federal party (''staročeši''). He sought the establishment of a Czech kingdom that should include [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]] and [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]], and in his zeal for Czech autonomy he even entered into an alliance with the Conservative nobility and with the extreme Catholics. He attended the Panslavist congress in Moscow in 1867. He died in Prague on 26 May 1876.

==Legacy==
[[File:1000CZK obverse.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Palacký on a [[Czech koruna]] banknote]]
Palacký is considered as one of the three [[Pater Patriae|Fathers of the nation]] – the first being the King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]], the second is František Palacký and the third is President of Czechoslovakia [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]. Various individuals like to emphasize one over the other. As to historians, none have surpassed his history of Bohemia except when they have focused on a narrower time period.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Even these have been directly or indirectly influenced by his work.

'''Gbalefa Peninsula''' is an area of land located south of [[Abeokuta]] and north of [[Lagos|Lagos city]]. Gbalefa Peninsula was named after Akindele Gbalefa, the outstanding [[Owu kingdom|Owu]] warrior who led the [[Owu kingdom|Owu]]/[[Egba people|Egba]] war against {{ILL|Ilobi|sv}}, [[Ado-Odo/Ota|Ado-Odo]] and [[Dahomey]].

==About Gbalefa Peninsula==
The [[Owu Kingdom|Owu army]] contingent fought side by side with the Egbas in the [[Makun]], Ilobi and [[Ado-Odo]] wars in 1842-45. The Owu/Egba contingent defeated the Ilobi and Ado-Odo at [[Itori]], [[Yobo, Nigeria|Yobo]], [[Ifo]], [[Atan, Nigeria|Atan]] and [[Ota, Nigeria|Ota]]. From these conquered territories the Owu and Egba forces fought against the fierce [[Dahomey Amazons]]. There were two major attacks on the Owu/Egba nation by the Dahomeans.

The first, on Monday, March 3, 1851, under the notorious king [[Ghezo]] the invading Dahomean army numbered some 15,000 warriors, estimated Eugene Stock (1836-1928), Secretary of the [[Church Missionary Society]]. The Owu/Egba forces fiercely defended Abeokuta town within and outside the city walls and won the battle. Had king [[Ghezo]] prevailed in his attempt to destroy Abeokuta, historians{{who|date=November 2016}} believe he would have adorned his palace with the polished skulls of Abeokuta kings and influential leaders, just as he had done with kings of every territory he destroyed.

In a bid to avenge [[Ghezo]]'s defeat, his son and successor, [[Glele]], launched what was supposed to be a surprise attack against [[Abeokuta]] in 1863. Owu/Egba allied army intelligence however foretold the impending attack and so the army laid ambushes for the Dahomeans on the outskirts of Abeokuta in the Gbalefa Peninsula. When the Dahomean army marched towards Abeokuta, they were surrounded by the Owu/Egba allied army and defeated in the battle that ensued. The number of casualties, estimated at over 5,000, were described as the worst in the history of West African warfare at the time. The Dahomeans suffered heavy casualties, and Glele's family, horse, coral and golden treasures were also captured by the Owu/Egba allied army.

Lapeleke, Majeogbe and Akinwale were three brothers who fought in the [[Dahomey]] war. Lapeleke, a sector commander of the Owu [[militia]] in the [[Egba Allied Forces]] that checkmated the Dahomean Amazons and other [[interlopers]] marauding Abeokuta and the [[Egba Federation]] between 1836 and 1843, made [[Akinale]] a military base where the militia settled to strategize, hence the footprints of other Owu heroes such as [[Awaye Sonlu]] and [[Akindele Gbalefa]], among others, on ground.

In 1937, the colonial government merged [[Ota, Nigeria|Ota]] and Gbalefa Peninsula under the [[Egba Native Administration]] in present day [[Ogun State]], [[Nigeria]].

To underline that Gbelefa Peninsula does not belong to the [[Aworis]]/[[Ottas]], a meeting was held on Wednesday, 10 April 1935 at the [[Olota's Palace]] between the District Officer from Abeokuta (Representing the resident of Abeokuta Province) and the indigenes of Otta as represented by the [[Olota]] of Ota, his chiefs, and the representatives of [[Ota, Nigeria|Ota]] [[Bales]].

The meeting had been called as a result of a publication in the [[Akede Eko]] March 30, 1935, on page 7 Col.2, claiming that Gbelefa Peninsula belonged to the [[Aworis]]. The meeting was called by the Resident of Abeokuta Province to ascertain the veracity of the claim from the Aworis living in Otta.

==Land disputes==
Since early 80s, there has been contention about the ownership of [[Ilobi]] and [[Ado-Odo]] area. While the Egba claim that [[Ota people]] were tenants accommodated by their forebears, having successfully displaced the Ilobi and Ado-Odo during Egba/Dahomey war, the Otta/Awori communities see themselves as original settlers in the area. This ownership disagreement has led to litigants to present their cases before [[High Court]] judges in Nigeria.

==Historical evidences==
Historical records show that the Owu/Egba conquered the contested areas during the [[Ilobi]], [[Ado-Odo]] and Dahomey wars of 1836 to 1853. It was documented that [[Henry Townsend (missionary)|Henry Townsend]], a British missionary, was present at the ceremonial takeover of the territory by Akindele Gbalefa, the Owu Warrior and head of the Egba allied forces. The Southern part of Gbalefa forest, as it was then called, formerly belonged to the Ados, while the Northern part belonged to the Ilobis. The forest was uninhabited at the time it was conquered.

Historical records also show that it was the Owu/Egba community who allocated farming lands to Ota natives. The Owu/Egba argued that the contested area originally belonged to Ado and Ilobi, and not to [[Ota, Nigeria|Ota]], before the conquest. And in a letter written to the then-[[Resident (title)|resident officer]] of the Abeokuta District by the District Officer of Egba Division entitled "Reorganisation of Ota District", and signed by F.V.O Aribusola in 1937, the District Officer stated that:

{{Quote|In accordance with your instructions ED/321/106, I proceed to Ota where I met representatives of the Egbas in the District-the heir at law. They were apprised of the new reorganizations which will merge their areas-Gbalefa peninsula and Ota together under the Egba Native Administration. I explained the difficulties being experienced by the officials in the administration of the areas at the moment.}}

==Court judgement==

===High Court===
*On 18 November 2005 at the [[High Court of Justice]], in the Ota Judicial Division, [[Ogun State]] under Justice. H. O. Solanke, the Owu/Egba community was awarded [[Nigerian naira|N]]50,000 and the defendants restrained from committing any further acts of [[trespass]] on the said land.
*In April 2010, the Abeokuta High Court dismissed the ownership claim by the Ota community.

===Appeals Court===
*In the 1993 Appeal Court judgment at [[Ibadan]] delivered by Hon. Justice Owolabi Kolawole in the appeal suit CA/1/129/90. The panel of [[Jury|jurors]] submitted that "The motion to file and argue additional grounds of appeal can therefore, not be tied to nothing. The motion is dismissed and the appeal is also dismissed as being incomplete with N400 cost to the 1st to 4th respondents."
*In April 2010, the latest in the series of legal crossfire in between the two claimants is the subsisting Appeal Court judgment which dismissed the ownership claim by the Ota community. This followed the earlier ruling on the same matter by the Abeokuta High Court.

In March 2006, [[Olowu of Owu Kingdom|The Olowu of Owu]], Oba (King) Dr. [[Olusanya Adegboyega Dosunmu II]] ([[Amuroro]] ruling house) started the appointment of 16 [[coronet]]s within Owu Kingdom. The appointment/installation of the coronets was met with strong opposition from the [[Olota of Ota]], Oba Alani Osanyintola Oyede who claimed that Oba Olowu of [[Owu]] illegally encroached on his territory. The following are the names of the coronet Obas (kings) and their domain:

* Oba Rasheed Adeosun – The Alaga of Aga Olowo
* Oba L.K. Ogunseye – The Onijoko of Ijoko
* Oba Olatunji Oluyomi – The Alatan of Atan-Gbalefa Land
* Oba Edward Fasina – The Alabalabi of Abalabi
* Oba Olufemi Ogunleye – The Towulade of Akinade
* Oba Salisu Abiodun – The Olojodu of Ojodu
* Oba Semiu Sodipo – The Onijagunna of Jagunna
* Oba Isaac Ojelade – The Onibogun of Ibogunlan
* Oba O.O. Akinyemi – The Onifo of Ifo
* Oba B. Osuntogun – The Oniwasinmi of Wasinmi
* Oba Oluwagboun Adebayo – The Onisango of Sango
* Oba Yunusa A. Akinmade – The Olu of Onigbedu
* Oba Fatai Oladipo – The Onilepa of Ilepa
* Oba Alao O. Tepede – The Onikoka of Coker
* Oba Oluwagbemileke A. Babajide – The Alaigbajo of Arigbajo
* Oba Jimoh Famuyiwa – The Onipapa of Papalanto

==Community violence==
Besides the continued engagement of Owu/Egba community in [[litigations]] by the Ota community, there has been reports of unprovoked attacks by people on both sides on their opponents. Lives and livelihoods have been lost. Judgments rendered by the courts have not decreased the incidence of violence in the area.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==In the press==
July 6, 2010. According to News Star news publication the Olori Igbimo of Owu Kingdom, High Chief Olufemi Sodeinde said the Awori community in Ota have continued to attack the Gbalefa community in an attempt to subdue its people.  "What we expect them to do is to go back to court, if they know they have genuine claim to the land. But they will not. What they want to do is to precipitate a crisis."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4852">'''Georges Bernard Depping''' (11 May 1784{{snd}}5 September 1853), also known as '''Georg Bernhard Depping''', was a [[German peoples|German]]-[[French people|French]] [[historian]] and writer.

==Biography==
He born in [[Münster]], [[Westphalia]], and went to [[Paris]] in 1803, where he lived as teacher and writer. He wrote books on a variety of subjects and prepared articles for various periodicals and encyclopedias.

==Works==

===''History of the Jews during the Middle Ages''===
Depping wrote ''Les Juifs dans le moyen âge, essai historique sur leur état civil, commercial et littéraire'' (Paris, 1834; 2d ed., 1844; German transl., Stuttgart, 1834). He was especially attracted to the [[Jews in the Middle Ages|history of the Jews in Europe during the Middle Ages]] by “its wealth of instruction for us; one can see from this history how fanaticism has been able to root out kindness and neighborly love, . . . and what misfortunes met those exiles who in barbaric times wished to preserve their national customs and a religion offensive to those among whom they lived.”

The book owed its origin to the offer of a prize, in 1821, by the [[Royal Academy]] for a work describing the condition of the Jews in France during the medieval period. Depping's work was given honorable mention, but did not win the prize.

He later enlarged the work, extending its scope to the general history of the Jews in Europe. The medieval Christian sources—documents, letters, chronicles, and histories, especially those dealing with the history of the Jews in France—were studied by Depping with great diligence and not without critical acumen. This fact gives importance to the book.

It is to be regretted that those rabbinical sources which were not accessible in the form of translations were but seldom consulted. As a consequence the few passages relating to the literature of the Jews are of no value (compare, especially on Rashi, pp.&amp;nbsp;113 et seq.; Zunz, “Z. G.” pp.&amp;nbsp;151, 446). The introduction (pp. v.-xxiv.) contains a short but valueless review of the history of the Jews up to their appearance in Europe. Depping's style is pleasing.

[[File:Sir Glanmor Wiliams.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Glanmor Williams]]
'''Sir Glanmor Williams''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FBA}} (5 May 1920 &amp;ndash; 24 February 2005) was one of [[Wales]]'s most eminent historians.

Sir Glanmor was born in [[Dowlais]], into a working-class family, and was educated at [[Cyfarthfa High School|Cyfarthfa Grammar School]]. He studied at [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|Aberystwyth]] alongside [[Alun Lewis (poet)|Alun Lewis]] and [[Emyr Humphreys]], becoming a specialist in the early modern period of Welsh history. His long academic career included 37 years at the [[Swansea University|University of Wales, Swansea]], between 1945 and 1982, and ten as vice-president of the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth|University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]].

He joined Swansea University in 1945 and was Professor of History at [[Swansea University]] from 1957 to 1982, his research interests focused on the Protestant Reformation and its impact on Welsh life and culture. His exceptional study of the Welsh Church after 1282, ''The Welsh Church from Conquest to Reformation'' was published in 1962. In subsequent works, such as ''Owen Glendower'' (1966), ''Recovery, Reorientation and Reformation'' (1987), and ''Owain Glyndwr'' (1993) Williams documented how English subjugation of Wales was strengthened by the Tudor Acts of Union, and yet still offered scope for the growth and development of Welsh culture.

In ''Religion, Language and Nationality in Wales'' (1979) he described the origins of Welsh cultural and political nationalism. He wrote equally fluently in Welsh, with his best known works including: ''Dadeni, Diwygiad a Diwylliant Cymru'' (''The Renaissance, the Reformation and the Culture of Wales'', 1964), ''Grym Tafodau Tân'' (''The Power of Fiery Tongues'', 1984) and ''Cymru a'r Gorffennol: côr o leisiau'' (''Wales and the Past: a choir of voices'', 2000).
 
Williams was Vice-Principal of [[Swansea University]] from 1975 to 1978, and was also appointed to many committees in Wales and England. He served as President of the Baptist Union of Wales, National Governor of BBC Wales and Chairman of the [[Broadcasting Council for Wales]] (1965–71), on the board of the [[British Library]] and its Advisory Council. Furthermore, he was actively involved in the [[Board of Celtic Studies]], the [[Pantyfedwen Trust]] and [[Cadw]]. He became a Fellow of the Society of Arts in 1979 and was appointed a CBE in 1981.
 
After his retirement from Swansea, he served as Chairman of the Ancient Monuments Board (Wales) from 1983 to 1995, Chairman of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]] (1986 to 90), and Vice-President of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth (1986 to 1996). He became a Fellow of the British Academy in 1986 and was knighted in 1995. His autobiography ''Glanmor Williams: A Life'' was published in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Glanmore Williams, ''Glanmor Williams: A Life'', [[University of Wales Press]] (2002) {{ISBN|0708317456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking after Williams' death in Swansea in 2005, the vice-chancellor, Richard B Davies, said: "his influence on the study of Wales is incalculable. Just to meet him was a privilege."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swansea.ac.uk/momentum/great-minds/williams/&lt;/ref&gt;

L'abbé '''Jean-Jacques-Henri Boudet''' (16 November 1837&amp;nbsp;– 30 March 1915), is best known for being the French Catholic parish priest of [[Rennes-les-Bains]] between 1872 and 1914 and for being the author of the book ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'', first published in 1886 (since 1967, when he became associated with the alleged mystery of [[Rennes-le-Château]]&lt;ref&gt;The alleged mystery of Rennes-le-Château has been challenged for as long as it has been promoted.

On 1 November 1866, Boudet was appointed parish priest of [[Festes-et-Saint-André]], next to the town of [[Limoux]]. In 1872, Boudet was  transferred to [[Rennes-les-Bains]] (succeeding L'abbé Jean Vié who had died a short time earlier) until 1914 when he was discharged from his duty by the [[Bishop]] of Carcassonne, Mgr Paul-Félix Beuvain de Beauséjour (1839–1930), due to serious illness. Boudet lived in Rennes-les-Bains with his mother and sister Jeanne, both died the same year in 1896.

Henri Boudet spent the rest of his days in Axat{{refn|group="note"|Living with Edmund's widow, Marguerite-Marie-Céleste née Labat (1850-1931).

The two Boudet brothers are buried in the same grave. It features two [[epitaph]] inscriptions, engraved horizontally and on the lower part of the [[gravestone]], a small rectangular shaped figure on its surface, engraved vertically with the following inscription ''[[Ichthys|ΙΧΟΥΣ]]'' which stand for ''Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour''.

The name of Henri Boudet's successor was published in the regional Catholic periodical ''Semaine Religieuse de Carcassonne'' of 2 May 1914. Abbé Joseph Rescanières died suddenly at the age of 37 on 1 February 1915 from a suspected heart attack.

A final tribute to Boudet's character was published in the same periodical mentioned above on 10 April 1915.

===Boudet's interests and ''La Vraie langue celtique''===

Beside his priestly responsibilities, Boudet's interests extended to the fields of local history, archaeology, toponymy, linguistics and photography. He was made a member of the following [[Learned society|learned societies]], the ''Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne'' (1888)&lt;ref&gt;http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k4865901/f6.item.r=boudet&lt;/ref&gt; and of the ''[[Société de Linguistique de Paris]]'' (1897{{refn|group="note"|On 4 December 1897, Boudet was [[Co-option|co-opted]] as one the members of the Société de Linguistique de Paris on the recommendation of A.

On the session of 5 février 1898, Duvau made a short presentation of Boudet's works on the Languedocien dialect to the Société de Linguistique de Paris followed by remarks by some of the attending members. Duvau was the [[Copy editing|copy editor]] of the [[Revue Celtique]] from 1897 to 1901 and a former student of [[Henri Gaidoz]].}}).

In the preface to his 1886 book, ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'', Boudet stated that his "cromleck" was "intimately linked to the resurrection" (''trouve intimement lié à la résurrection'') and in turn cognate to the revival of the Celtic language (''ou, si l'on veut, au réveil inattendu de la langue celtique'') and therefore to his  [[etymological]] arguments.&lt;ref&gt;"C'est ainsi que le Cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains se trouve intimement lié à la résurrection, ou, si l'on veut, au réveil inattendu de la langue celtique" ("Thus the Cromleck of Rennes-les-Bains is intimately linked to the resurrection, or, if you will, the unexpected revival of the Celtic language"). Avant-Propos, ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'', 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; The first five of the eight chapters in Boudet's 1886 book consists of an argument that ancient languages such as [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are derived from a more ancient [[Proto language|mother language]] that was identical to [[Modern English]]. For example, when Boudet referred to the location known as ''The Realsès'' (today called "la Realsesse") he claimed it was derived from two English words: ''real'' (i.e., effective), and ''cess'' (tax),&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Wood, page 234.&lt;/ref&gt; when commenting how "The Realsès runs in a valley whose fertile earth enables the inhabitants to pay their taxes and where the Celts till their ground for easy produce".&lt;ref&gt;Boudet, ''La Vraie langue celtique'', page 227.&lt;/ref&gt; The search for a mother language from which all other languages were derived was nothing new and Henri Boudet was not the first author to make such a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Umberto Eco]], ''The Search for the Perfect Language'' (Oxford: Blackwell's, UK; Cambridge, Mass., USA, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The French Catholic esoterist Paul Le Cour (1871–1954) gave a potted history of the search for a primitive language in his article ''The French Revolution and the searchers for Atlantis'' (reprinted in ''Atlantis'' Number 356, pages 109-130, Winter 1989), where he cited as examples [[Charles de Brosses]], ''Traité de la formation mecanique des langues et des principes physiques de l'etymologie'' (1765) and [[Antoine Court de Gébelin]], ''Monde primitif'' (9 volumes, 1773). The article was originally entitled ''The 18th Century and The Primitive World'' and was published in ''Atlantis'' Number 46, March–April 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The book by [[Godfrey Higgins]], ''[[Anacalypsis]]'', was posthumously published in 1836, part of which read: "the megalithic remains scattered across the world had been the works of a great nation unknown to history, which had discovered religion and writing" (cited by [[Ronald Hutton]], in ''[[The Triumph of the Moon]]'', page 18, Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Philippe Schrauben, in his introduction to the 1984 re-published edition of Boudet's book, commented: "...we notice that ''La Vraie langue celtique''... is a huge mosaic of extracts of 19th-century works carefully chosen to make them more or less coherent. There are not only detailed quotations but whole pages transcribed word for word and put end to end." Schrauben considered that to understand Boudet's book one would have to research his sources and read them in the context of their time.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Schrauben introduction in, Henri Boudet, ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'' (Éditions Belisane, Cazilhac, 1984; {{ISBN|2-902296-48-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, ''Rennes-le-Château: A Mystery Solved'', page 237 (2005 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article: ''La Vraie Lanque Celtique'', pages 649-650, in, Patrick Berlier, Daniel Dugès, Christian Doumergue, etc, editors, ''L'ABC de RLC: l'Encyclopédie de Rennes-le-Château'' (Arqa éditions, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudet also made historical claims, like for example that the [[Volcae#Volcae Tectosages|Tectosages]] (mainly known about from [[Strabo]], that he called "Volkes Tectosages"), were early inhabitants of the Aude and the ancestors of the [[Saxons]] and [[the Franks]], therefore of the English and the French.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Boudet, ''La Vraie langue celtique'', pages 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters six to eight of Boudet's book consisted of an analysis and mapping of the [[Geology|geological]] structures surrounding Rennes-les-Bains, whereby he confused isolated large [[Rock (geology)|stone]] blocks, put in place by nature (some marked with naturally-formed Greek crosses, caused by water erosion, as testified by Gibert and Rancoule in 1969 and by others&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Urbain Gibert and Guy Rancoule, "...even if the descriptions of the sites given by Abbé BOUDET are accurate and precise, the conclusions he reaches as an expert on the Celtic languages (insofar as he would have been regarded as such a hundred years ago) unfortunately show signs of an over-active imagination, as can readily be confirmed by perusing his work. His attributions to prehistoric or protohistoric civilisations of 'menhirs, dolmens and cromlechs' which he describes and plots on a map that is otherwise geographically exact, are not based on solid evidence. We have established that, in every case, he was dealing with mere erosion-phenomena on a naturally rock ridge. The same can be said of the numerous crosses and cup shapes which we have seen and which can be ascribed to the same causes" in, ''Rennes-les-Bains: note sur un tête sculptée'' (Bulletin de la Société Scientifiques de l’Aude, page 147, Tome LXIX, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...pure speculation on the part of the Abbé, as the megaliths discussed are all, without exception, part of the natural rock-formations": Article: ''Henri Boudet'', in, Patrick Berlier, Daniel Dugès, Christian Doumergue, etc, editors, ''L'ABC de RLC: l'Encyclopédie de Rennes-le-Château,'' page 79 (Arqa éditions, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;), with [[menhir]]s and listed them as part of his vast [[Dolmen|cromlech]] (Boudet intended to call his tour of the mountain ridges in the area of Rennes-les-Bains with this word), with the inclusion of a secondary stone circle,&lt;ref&gt;Henri Boudet, ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'', (Imprimerie, François Pomiès, 1886)&lt;/ref&gt; that was ridiculed by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Quoting Germain Sicard, "on page 245 [in Boudet's book], after the description of an alleged 'dolmen' which is actually the accidental product of a rockfall the author tells us that, immediately above this 'dolmen', is a rock located on the ridge and that this rock has a Greek Cross carved into it (that scholars consider to be naturally formed). Boudet says that it is the largest of all the crosses of this kind known to him. By bringing these facts to the attention of our learned colleagues in Rennes-les-Bains it will be possible for them to check the accuracy of the statements in Boudet’s book, and to perhaps identify certain errors attributable to the author’s vivid imagination and to his lack of knowledge of modern prehistorical research", in ''Note sur les Croix Rupestres des Corbières'' (Bulletin de la Société Scientifiques de l’Aude, page 372, Tome XXXVII, 1928). Sicard was a founder member of the ''Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l’Aude'' and vice-president of ''la Société Française d'Archéologie''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boudet's 'cromleck': a tour===

Boudet described his "cromleck" in chapter seven of his book, which in essence was a circular tour of the mountain ridges around Rennes-les-Bains: the area in question is illustrated by a map that was drawn by his brother, Edmond (who also did the drawings in the book). It was claimed that this tour, the ''cromleck'', marked out a ''drunemeton'', a central meeting point of the Tectosages. According to Boudet, the word ''dru-neme-ton'' was derived from the now obsolete English word ''trow'' (meaning to think or believe), and ''name''. Boudet claimed this represented the place in society where ancient sages gathered together (that Boudet called the ''Neimheid'') to think up names for the places they lived in, "to carry out their scientific functions and make up the particular or general nomenclature".&lt;ref&gt;Boudet, ''La vraie langue celtique'', pages 225-226.&lt;/ref&gt; Bill Putnam summarized Boudet's central argument: the ''drunemeton'' was a "special place where the tribal dignitaries came together to invent these incredible names based on words from a language that had not yet come into existence."&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Wood, page 234 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to ''La Vraie langue celtique''===

The book, written with [[Apologetics]] intention, didn't go unnoticed at the time of its first publication. An enthusiastic article on his book was published in the French regional [[Newspaper]] ''Le Courrier de l'Aude'' of 18 December 1866,&lt;ref&gt;[https://culture.cr-languedocroussillon.fr/in/faces/imageReader.xhtml?id=h::OAI_FRB110696201_7150_frb110696201_7150_1886_3994&amp;highlight=Le Courrier de l'Aude 18 decembre 1886 ], page 3 (33me Année, N° 3994).&lt;/ref&gt; praising his ''pioneer work'', followed shortly afterwards by a severely negative review, given by lawyer and historian Gaston Jourdanne (1858–1905){{refn|group="note"|[[Radical Party (France)|Radical]] Mayor of Carcassonne from October 1887 to March 1888, Joudanne was also one of the founding members (1886) of the literary magazine, ''Revue de L'Aude'' and of the (Félibrige) Aude literary society ''l’Escolo audenco'' (1892) and a life member (majoral, 1894) of the literary association, [[Félibrige]].}}, published in the French Newspaper ''Le Radical du Midi'' of 26 May 1887 that questioned the seriousness of Boudet's self-satisfied book.

The same year, Boudet's book was among the ten works&lt;ref&gt;''Revue critique d'histoire et de littérature'', Academie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, séance du 14 janvier 1887, p 76, Paris, 1887&lt;/ref&gt; selected for the ''prix Gobert'', a prestigious prize (awarded to the most learning and detailed research concerning French history), distributed by the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] but the prize was awarded to French historian and essayist Alphonse de Ruble&lt;ref&gt;''Annuaire-bulletin de la Société de l'histoire de France'', Tome XXIV, p 164, Paris, 1887&lt;/ref&gt; (1834-1898) for his works entitled ''Le Mariage de Jeanne d'Albret'' and ''Antoine de Bourbon et Jeanne d'Albret''. Boudet made an unsuccessful attempt to have his book honoured by the award of the ''médaille d'or'', a prize (the awardee received a sum of money) distributed by the ''Académie des sciences, inscriptions et belles-lettres de Toulouse''.&lt;ref&gt;http://academie-sciences-lettres-toulouse.fr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5746710f/f701.image&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Mémoires de l'Académie des sciences, inscriptions et belles-lettres de Toulouse", p.648, Huitième série-Tome IX, Imprimerie Douloudure-Privat, Toulouse, (1887). Also cited in Pierre Jarnac, ''Histoire du trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', pages 284-285 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; M. Eugène Lapierre (1834-1923), speaking on behalf of the ''l'Académie des Sciences'', commented about Boudet's book on 5 June 1887: "We cannot enter into a detailed criticism of this book in order to discuss all its whimsical assumptions and assertions, which are as gratuitous as they are audacious, and which seem to suggest that the author has a very fertile imagination. Adopting an exclusively religious viewpoint, the author has made unceasing use of authorities which have nothing to do with linguistics as it is nowadays constituted, such as the Bible, Latin authors, de Maistre, Chateaubriand, Figuier etc. We were not unsurprised to learn that the [[Punic language]], which was spoken before Babel, was actually modern English, and was preserved by the Tectosages. This is what Monsieur Boudet has tried to prove to us by extraordinarily ingenious etymological feats. The Academy, while recognizing that an amount of work has gone into this volume which does deserve some respect, does not believe that it has a duty to set its seal of approval, by awarding a prize, on a system of historical reconstruction that is as bold as it is novel'."

A brief notice on Boudet's book, written by French prehistorian specialist [[Émile Cartailhac]], a member of the ''Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude'' and of the ''Société archéologique du Midi de la France''{{refn|group="note"|President from 1914 to 1921. In 1879, Cartaillac was put in charge by the [[Monument historique|commission des monuments historiques]] to do an inventory of the [[megalith]]s of France.}} was published in 1892 in the ''Revue des Pyrenées''.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Cartailhac, ''Bibliographie Pyrénéenne et Méridionale: Bulletin de la commission archéologique et littéraire de l'arrondissement de Narbonne'', pages 167-168 (Revue des Pyrenées et de la France méridionale, tome IV, premier fascicule, Toulouse, 1892)[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5744282k/f6.item.zoom]&lt;/ref&gt; Unsympathetic to Boudet's works, Cartailhac asked the local archeologists to be cautious about the claims of a gullible priest, author he said of the ridiculous book ''La Vrai langue celtique''. In 1893, Cartailhac's notice was used by Gaston Jourdanne for his introduction&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Jourdanne, ''De quelques étymologies celtiques'', "Bulletin de la Société d'études scientifiques de l'Aude", quatriéme année, tome IV, p.LVI and pp.145-47, Carcassonne (1893). [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=30000062833292&amp;M=pagination]&lt;/ref&gt; of Boudet's book to the ''Société d'Etudes Scientifiques de l'Aude''. Citing various renowned authorities, including a work by his friend, a well known Celtic expert, [[Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville]], Jourdanne demonstrated the errors of Boudet's researches and conclusions. Jourdanne's harsh criticism went so far as to say that Boudet's study was worthy at most of publication in the British satirical magazine [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]].

Jourdanne's criticism of Boudet's book represented only one out of many.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac gave a list of criticisms of Boudet's book in his ''Histoire du Trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', pages 278-296. (L’Association pour le développement de la lecture, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

Boudet's ''Celtic theory'' was utilized on at least one occasion. One of his colleagues, Abbé Raymond Ancé of [[Greffeil]], Aude, who was also interested in archaeology and who was unhappy with the etymology of "Greffeil" derived from the Latin word, ''Agrifolium'' (meaning [[Holly]]), asked Boudet for his personal view on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;M. Charles Dat de St-Foulc, ''Une Excursion A Greffeil Dans les Corbières'', page 121 (Bulletin de la Société d'Études Scientifiques de l'Aude, Tome II, 1891).&lt;/ref&gt; Boudet claimed that the etymology of "Greffeil" was derived from ''Grev-fill'', meaning ''Full'' (plenty) and ''Grev'' (grave) translated as a place full of graves. Abbé Ancé then conducted an excavation in a part of his town and discovered some ancient graves possibly dating back to [[Neolithic]] times, as well as some artifacts (that were donated to the Museum of Carcassonne). Ancé's archeological discoveries were published in the French newspaper, ''Le Courrier de l'Aude'' and drew the attention of none other than Charles Dat de St-Foulc, the Honorary President of the ''Société d'Études Scientifiques de l'Aude''. St-Foulc with the archaeologist Germain Sicard went to Greffeil to see Ancé's discoveries for themselves. A report about Abbé Ancé's archaeological discoveries by Charles Dat de St-Foulc entitled ''Une excursion à Greffeil dans les Corbières'' was published in 1891 in the ''Bulletin de la Société d'Études Scientifiques de l'Aude''.&lt;ref&gt;pages 115-122.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that in 1875 &lt;ref&gt;M. Charles Dat de St-Foulc, ''Une Excursion A Greffeil Dans les Corbières'', pages 116-117 (Bulletin de la Société d'Études Scientifiques de l'Aude, Tome II, 1891).&lt;/ref&gt; one of Greffeil's inhabitants, Mr Barthe, unearthed an old tomb dating back to either [[Celtic Gaul]] or [[Roman Gaul]] periods; whether Boudet was aware of this discovery and used it to pen the etymology of "Greffeil" is open to debate.

Boudet autographed&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ageorges, "Une famille française au XIXe siècle (les Pagès et les Bordes-Pagès), contribution à l'étude des moeurs bourgeoises" page 296, Tourcoing, J. Duvivier Editeur&lt;/ref&gt; a copy of his book to the French doctor, author and politician Jacques-Auguste Bordes-Pagès (1815–1897). Bordes-Pagès made some additions of his own to Boudets's ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains''.

Other recipients of Boudet's book included [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil]]. The [[Letter of thanks|acknowledging letters]], respectively dated March 20, 1889 and September 8, 1891 have survived. The first letter sent from [[Biarritz]] and written by Sir [[Henry Ponsonby]] reads as follows: "Sir Henry Ponsonby presents his compliments to Monsieur Cailhol and is commanded by The Queen Victoria to request him to thank the Reverend Pere Boudet for the interesting book on Languedoc and English which he has had the kindness to present to Her Majesty."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Histoire du trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', page 281 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

The second letter with similar sentiments was sent from [[Vichy]] and written by the Count of Aljezur, [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] to the Emperor. It reads as follows: "His Majesty the Emperor Don Pedro d'Alcantara instructs me to thank you most cordially for the compliment and gift that you have kindly sent to His Majesty of your scientific work that He has just received along with your letter. My noble lord is very interested in linguistic and ethnographic studies and highly appreciates the information that you have sent him, and will be happy to know the outcome of your future researches and discoveries".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Histoire du trésor de Rennes-le-Château'', pp. 280, 284, 282 (1985); Chaumeil and Rivière, ''L'alphabet solaire'', p.248, Éditions du Borrego, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Boudet's copies of ''La Vraie langue celtique'' bears a signed dedication&lt;ref&gt;André Goudonnet, ''Henri Boudet, abbé de Rennes-les-Bains: 100e anniversaire'', illustrated section p.89, collection Didier Hericart de Thury-Franck Daffos, (Arqa éditions, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; to the Bishop of Carcassonne, Mgr Paul-Félix Arsène Billard, that reads "A sa grandeur Monseigneur L'Évêque de Carcassonne. Hommage respectueux et filial de l'auteur. H. Boudet" (''To his eminence, Monseigneur the Bishop of Carcassonne. Respectul and filial reverence from the author. H. Boudet'').

Another of Boudet's copies of ''La Vraie langue celtique'' bears a signed dedication to the French [[Western esotericism|esoterist]]  [[Claude Sosthène Grasset d'Orcet|Grasset d'Orcet]], that reads "À G. d'Orcet, mon indéfectible amitié. H. Boudet" (''To G. d'Orcet, my constant friend'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renneslechateau.com/francais/dubois1.htm Nouvelle Lumières sur la Vraie Langue Celtique]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbé Joseph-Théodore Lasserre's historical study of the pilgrimage to the basilica church of Notre-Dame-Marceille, by [[Limoux]] (''Histoire du pèlerinage de Notre-Dame de Marceille près de Limoux sur Aude'') published in 1891, contains references to Boudet's book.

French officer Claude Dervieu, a member of the ''Académie des Arts, Sciences et Belles-lettres de [[Mâcon]]'' used Boudet's book as one of his sources when he compiled his study on [[Gaul|Gallo-Celtic]] France (''Les Origines gallo-celtiques de la Nation Française'', 1907).&lt;ref&gt;Ct Claude Dervieu, "Les Origines Gallo-Celtiques de la Nation Française", Extrait des Annales de l'Académie de Mâcon, (3e série-Tome XII), 1907, Macon, Protat frères, Imprimeurs&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909, Dervieu's study was favourably reviewed by the committee of the ''Société historique et archéologique de [[Château-Thierry]]''.

Boudet donated a copy of ''La vraie langue celtique'' to the [[Cambridge University Library]], the book is still in the [[University of Cambridge]]'s possession as late as 2015, in a letter written and signed by Boudet to the [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|rector]] of the University of Cambridge, established the date of the donation on 11 December 1886. The [[manuscript]] of ''La vraie langue celtique'' was deposited in 1887 in the Manuscript Division of the ''Archives départementales, communales et hospitalières de l'Aude''.&lt;ref&gt;''Département de l'Aude, rapport du préfet au Conseil général'', session d'aout 1887, M. F. Masclet, Préfet, p 213, Carcassonne, 1887&lt;/ref&gt; Boudet donated another copy of his book to the ''Bibliothèque de la Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne'' in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;''Mémoires de la Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne'', Tome VII, catalogue de la Bibliothèque de la Société des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne, item number 82, page XXI, 1894 (following the article by J.

The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] once held an original copy of the ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'' but it went missing at some unknown date, its disappearance was reported during an inventory.[http://catalogue.bnf.fr/servlet/RechercheEquation?TexteCollection=HGARSTUVWXYZ1DIECBMJNQLOKP&amp;TexteTypeDoc=DESNFPIBTMCJOV&amp;Equation=IDP%3Dcb30138984f&amp;host=catalogue ] The ''Bibliothèque de Narbonne'' had also received a copy of Boudet's book in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin de la Commission Archéologique et Littérraire de l'Arrondissement de Narbonne'', page 97, 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Boudet's ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'' and ''Remarques sur la phonétique du Dialecte Languedocien'' were listed  in the Literature (generalities) and in the [[Provençal dialect]] (Aude dialects) sections of the Aude bibliography edited by the ''Bulletin de la Commission archéologique de Narbonne''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bulletin de la Commission archéologique de Narbonne", ''La Vrai langue celtique'', entry 3800, page 78; ''Remarques sur la phonétique'', entry 3936, page 92 (tome XIII, premier fascicule, Narbonne, 1914)[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6255620f/f7.image]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boudet's discoveries===

Boudet was credited with the discovery of a water-container embossed with a Christian cross in around 1886&lt;ref&gt;Paul Courrent, "Notice Historique sur les Bains de Rennes connus anciennement sous le nom de Bains de Montferrand", plate between pages 244-245 in, ''Bulletin de la Société d'études scientifiques de l'Aude'', Tome XXXVIII, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; and of a statue of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] in around 1900 in the maison Chaluleau in Rennes-les-Bains (the statue was sold in America).&lt;ref&gt;Urbain Gibert, "Notes Historiques sur les Bains de Montferrand devenues les Bains de Rennes, Actuellement Rennes-les-Bains", page 226, footnote 14, ''Bulletin de la Société d’Ètudes Scientifiques de l’Aude'', Tome LXXIII, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commemorative plaque===

A commemorative plaque marking the centenary of Henri Boudet's death was placed in the church porch in Rennes-les-Bains on 6 June 2015. It was unveiled by the village mayor André Authier in the presence of the deputy mayor Marcelle Delmas.

==Association with Saunière and Rennes-le-Château==

There are no first-hand{{refn|group="note"|Except second-hand accounts like the references in Saunière's private papers regarding occasional requests for Mass intentions send to Boudet, the acknowledgement of the not often exchange of letters including the receipt of Edmund Boudet's death announcement (13 May 1907), the next day, Saunière wrote a reply to Boudet offering his [[Condolences]] and a photograph (Henri Boudet's personal property) of Saunière at the ''Rocher tremblant'' (Pla de la Coste, Rennes-les-Bains), allegedly taken by Boudet, circa 1886.&lt;ref&gt;Chaumeil and Rivière, "L'alphabet solaire", picture facing p.47, collection Jean-Claude Cathary, Éditions du Borrego, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;}} accounts available of Boudet and [[Bérenger Saunière|Saunière]] being close acquaintances, nor did  Boudet ever undertake any historical researches in the village of Rennes-le-Château. The only connection that is certain is Boudet and Saunière were assigned to the same [[Diocese]] and their respective towns who lies at a short distance from each other, shared the same name.

Some Rennes-le-Château researchers are inclined to identify the ''BS'' monogram inscribed on the statue of the Devil supporting the Holy Water Stoup, located at the entrance to the church of Rennes-le-Château, with the surname initials of Boudet and Saunière or the names of two local rivers, the Blanque and the Sals (as first envisaged by [[Gérard de Sède]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;''L'Or de Rennes'', pages 166-167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Jarnac, ''Histoire du Trésor de Rennes-le-Château'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;), but there is no concrete evidence as to what the inscription actually means and remains undeciphered. Saunière referred to himself as ''B.S.'' in an early draft of his [[Will and testament]] written a short time after the death of his brother Alfred.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Corbu, Antoine Captier, "L'Héritage de l'Abbé Saunière", facsimile of a draft of an early version of Saunière's will, circa 1906-1907, page 20, (Editions Bélisane, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conspiracy theories==

Because Henri Boudet was Abbé of Rennes-les-Bains at the same period of time that Bérenger Saunière was incumbent at Rennes-le-Château, also for being the author of ''La Vraie langue celtique'', he has become a central character in modern conspiracy theories.

Gérard de Sède, in collaboration with [[Pierre Plantard]], offered a romantic interpretation of ''La Vraie Langue Celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'' in his 1967 book ''L’Or de Rennes'',&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''L'Or de Rennes'', pages 116-122 (René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that Boudet wrote his book in a cryptic style that represented a code. De Sède interpreted the Church of Rennes-les-Bains and its churchyard also as part of a secret code, that led to and involved Rennes-le-Château.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard de Sède, ''L'Or de Rennes'', pages 123-135, (René Julliard, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

As de Sède’s 1967 book became an immediate success, renewed interest increased in ''La Vraie Langue Celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'', a book that only a few people had heard about previously.

Boudet’s book was re-edited in two different editions in 1978: a [[facsimile]] edition by ''Pierre Belfond'', Paris, part of ''les classiques de l’occultisme'', containing a foreword by Pierre Plantard and the second one, in a limited edition of 1,000 copies by ''La demeure Philosophale'', Paris, with a foreword by Gérard de Sède (this edition did not respect the original pagination of Boudet's book).

Pierre Plantard, without providing any reliable sources in his 1978 foreword to Boudet's ''La Vraie langue celtique'', claimed the book was published as a [[Limited edition books|limited-edition]] of 500 copies that cost 5,382 francs: consisting of 98 copies sold in 28 years between 1886 and 1914; 100 free copies given to [[Public library|Public libraries]], embassies and charities; 200 free copies available to visitors and patients who took the waters at the [[spa|spa resort]] at Rennes-les-Bains interested in linguistics (or to any priests likely to be interested)&amp;nbsp;– and the remaining 102 copies, according to Plantard, destroyed in 1914.

In fact, Boudet's book ''La Vraie Langue Celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'' was available directly from the printer, Victor Bonnafous in Carcassonne, at the retail price of 3,50 francs and by mail order at the price of 3,75 francs,&lt;ref&gt;André Goudonnet, ''Henri Boudet, abbé de Rennes-les-Bains: 100e anniversaire'', illustrated section p.96, (Arqa éditions, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; or 3,90 francs,  as advertised in ''Le Courrier de l'Aude'' of 27 January 1887 (page 3).&lt;ref&gt;[https://culture.cr-languedocroussillon.fr/in/faces/imageReader.xhtml?id=h::OAI_FRB110696201_7150_frb110696201_7150_1887_4025&amp;highlight=Le Courrier de l'Aude 27 janvier 1887 ], page 3 (33me Année, N° 4025).&lt;/ref&gt; If the 3,50 francs is applied to the 500 copies said  to have been printed as Plantard claimed, this totalled 1,750 francs, well below the said sum of 5,382 francs the book is reputed to have cost.

In his preface, Plantard also claimed that "someone from Axat" found Boudet's account books on a rubbish tip and these revealed that between 1887 and 1891 Boudet gave 3,679,431 francs to Marie Denarnaud (Saunière's housekeeper); and that between 1894 and 1903 had given her 837,260 francs (in the same period, Boudet had given 7,665,250 francs to the Bishop of Carcassonne, Mgr Billard).

Plantard's claims attracted the following criticisms: There is no evidence that Boudet was wealthy enough to give donations involving tens of millions of francs; Boudet's account books have never been seen and Plantard did not disclose the name of the person who had found them; there is no evidence in Saunière's papers that Boudet was involved with the refurbishment of the church of Rennes-le-Château.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, ''Rennes-le-Château: A Mystery Solved'', page 236 (2005 edition).&lt;/ref&gt; But some of Saunière's account books are available, spanning from July, 1895 to November 1915 showing that Saunière received small amounts of money from Boudet on an irregular basis, dating from March 1896, March and October 1897, January and November 1898, March 1899 and March 1900, amounting to a grand total of 290 francs.

In his 1988 book entitled, ''Rennes-le-Château; Le dossier, les impostures, les phantasmes, les hypothèses'', de Sède affirmed once again that Boudet wrote ''La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains'' in a cryptic fashion, adding to his 1967 analysis that Boudet used [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''A Discourse to Prove the Antiquity of the English Tongue, Showing from various instances, that Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were derived from the English'' (1712) &lt;ref&gt;Chapter contained in Jonathan Swift's 1712 book, ''A Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English Tongue''. Quoting from ''A discourse to prove the antiquity of the English tongue'': "Thus I have manifestly proved, that the Greeks, the Romans and the Jews spoke the language we now do in England; which is an honour to our country that I thought proper to set in a true light, and yet hath not been done, as I have heard, by any other writer."&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''Ars Punica, sive flos lingarum; The Art of Punning or the flower of languages in 79 rules'' (1719) as a method of encryption. De Sède also added that "la Vraie langue celtique" and its associated subject matter, "le cromlech de Rennes-les-Bains" are not the real theme of Boudet's book but in fact, a treatise on secret geography.

'''Heritage Preservation''' is an [[United States|American]] [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1973. Its mission is to preserve the nation’s heritage for future generations through innovative leadership, education, and programs.

==History==
[[List of dates in the history of art conservation|In 1973]], the National Conservation Advisory Council was organized in November, funded by the National Museum Act of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The NCAC surveyed national needs and became the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property in 1982, and changed its name again to Heritage Preservation in 1997.&lt;ref name="AIC Bulletin 1974"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Edward R.|title=National Conservation Advisory Council|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=14|series=Papers Presented at the Second Annual Meeting. American Institute for the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, Inc.|issue=2|pages=154–159|jstor=3179333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Secretary of Interior Journal - Spring 1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berry|first=Betty|title=Writer-Editor, National Register Division|journal=11593 - Information Related to the Responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior|year=1978|volume=Special Energy Issue|issue=Spring|pages=1–3|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/11593/Special-Energy-Issue.pdf|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of its first major projects was called [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] (SOS!). Initiated in 1989, the project is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor [[sculpture]] in the United States. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource.  The [[Smithsonian Museum of American Art]] has become an active partner in the SOS! Project.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian American Art Museum website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Programs|url=http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/sos/|work=Smithsonian American Art Museum Website|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or “crowd-sourced” social media-driven initiatives.

A second major project was a report produced in 2005 called the Heritage Health Index, which included data from more than 3,000 institutions, among them museums, historical societies, government archives, libraries, scientific organizations and universities.&lt;ref name="New York Times Art Section"&gt;{{cite news|last=Clemetson|first=Lynette|title=History Is Slipping Away as Collections Deteriorate, Report Says|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10710FD38550C758CDDAB0994DD404482|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This report was funded by the [[Institute of Museum and Library Services]].&lt;ref name="IMLS Partners Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners and Contributors |url=http://www.imls.gov/collections/partners__contributors.aspx |work=IMLS website |publisher=IMLS (Institute of Museum and Library Services |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021155110/http://www.imls.gov/collections/partners__contributors.aspx |archivedate=21 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The survey found that some 612 million artifacts - from photographs and paintings to nature specimens and pottery - are at risk of deterioration because they are not cared for properly.&lt;ref name="NPR HHI Story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Baskas|first=Harriet|title=U.S. Museum Collections in Dire Condition|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5049523|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=National Public Radio|date=December 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roman Empires 476AD.svg|thumb|The [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] Roman Empires by 476 CE]]

The causes and mechanisms of the '''Fall of the Western Roman Empire''' are a historical theme that was introduced by historian [[Edward Gibbon]] in his 1776 book ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]''. He started an ongoing [[historiography|historiographical]] discussion about what caused the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], and the reduced power of the remaining Eastern Empire, in the 4th–5th centuries. Gibbon was not the first to speculate on why the Empire collapsed, but he was the first to give a well-researched and well-referenced account.  Many theories of causality have been explored. In 1984, [[Alexander Demandt]] enumerated 210 different theories on why Rome fell, and new theories emerged thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://crookedtimber.org/2003/08/25/decline-and-fall | first=Alexander | last=Demandt | title= 210 Theories | work=[[Crooked Timber]] weblog entry | date=August 25, 2003 | accessdate=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html Alexander Demandt: 210 Theories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316232650/http://www.utexas.edu/courses/rome/210reasons.html |date=2015-03-16 }}, Source: A. Demandt, ''Der Fall Roms'' (1984) 695. See also: Karl Galinsky in ''Classical and Modern Interactions'' (1992) 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibbon himself explored ideas of internal decline (the disintegration of political, economic, military, and other social institutions, civil wars) and of [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. "From the eighteenth century onward," historian [[Glen Bowersock]] wrote, "we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears."&lt;ref&gt;Bowersock, "The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome" ''Bulletin of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' (1996) 49#8 pp 29-43 at p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of historiography==
[[Historiography|Historiographically]], the primary issue historians have looked at when analyzing any theory is the continued existence of the Eastern Empire or Byzantine Empire, which lasted almost a thousand years after the fall of the West. For example, Gibbon implicates Christianity in the fall of the Western Empire, yet the eastern half of the Empire, which was even more Christian than the west in geographic extent, fervor, penetration and vast numbers continued on for a thousand years afterwards (although Gibbon did not consider the Eastern Empire to be much of a success). As another example, environmental or weather changes affected the east as much as the west, yet the east did not "fall."

Theories will sometimes reflect the particular concerns that historians might have on cultural, political, or economic trends in their own times. Gibbon's criticism of Christianity reflects the values of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]; his ideas on the decline in martial vigor could have been interpreted by some as a warning to the growing [[British Empire]]. In the 19th century [[socialism|socialist]] and anti-socialist theorists tended to blame [[decadence]] and other political problems. More recently, [[natural environment|environment]]al concerns have become popular, with [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]] proposed as major factors, and destabilizing population decreases due to [[epidemic]]s such as early cases of bubonic plague and [[malaria]] also cited. Global [[climate changes of 535–536]], perhaps caused by the possible eruption of [[Krakatoa]] in 535, as mentioned by [[David Keys (author)|David Keys]] and others,&lt;ref name="Krakatoa"&gt;{{cite book |last=Winchester |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Winchester |title=[[Krakatoa: The Day the World Exploded, August 27, 1883]] |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2003 |isbn=0-06-621285-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another example. Ideas about transformation with no distinct fall mirror the rise of the [[postmodern]] tradition, which rejects [[periodization]] concepts (see [[metanarrative]]). What is not new are attempts to diagnose Rome's particular problems, with [[Satire X]], written by Juvenal in the early 2nd century at the height of Roman power, criticizing the peoples' obsession with "[[bread and circuses]]" and rulers seeking only to gratify these obsessions.

One of the primary reasons for the vast number of theories is the notable lack of surviving evidence from the 4th and 5th centuries. For example, there are so few records of an economic nature it is difficult to arrive at even a generalization of the economic conditions. Thus, historians must quickly depart from available evidence and comment based on how things ought to have worked, or based on evidence from previous and later periods, on [[inductive reasoning]]. As in any field where available evidence is sparse, the historian's ability to imagine the 4th and 5th centuries will play as important a part in shaping our understanding as the available evidence, and thus be open for endless interpretation.

The end of the Western Roman Empire traditionally has been seen by historians to mark the end of the [[Ancient Era]] and beginning of the Middle Ages. More recent schools of history, such as [[Late Antiquity]], offer a more nuanced view from the traditional historical narrative.

There is no consensus on a date for the start of the Decline. Gibbon started his account in 98.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The year 376 is taken as pivotal by many modern historians.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In that year there was an unmanageable influx of [[Goths]] and other [[Barbarians]] into the Balkan provinces, and the situation of the Western Empire generally worsened thereafter, with recoveries being incomplete and temporary. Significant events include the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the [[crossing of the Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], the execution of [[Stilicho]] in 408, the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] in 410, the death of [[Constantius III]] in 421, the death of [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]] in 454, and the [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]] in 455, with the death of [[Majorian]] in 461 marking the end of the last opportunity for recovery.

Gibbon took September 4, 476 as a convenient marker for the [[final dissolution of the Western Roman Empire]], when [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], was deposed by [[Odoacer]], a Germanic chieftain. Some modern historians question the significance of the year 476 for its end.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaldo Momigliano, echoing the trope of the sound a tree falling in the forest, titled an article in 1973, "La caduta senza rumore di un impero nel 476 d.C." ("The noiseless fall of an empire in 476 AD").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Nepos]], the Western emperor recognized by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], continued to rule in [[Dalmatia]], until he was assassinated in 480. The [[Ostrogoth]]ic rulers of [[Italia]] considered themselves upholders of the direct line of Roman tradition, and the Eastern emperors considered themselves the sole rightful Roman rulers of a united empire.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Roman cultural traditions continued throughout the territory of the Western Empire, and a recent school of interpretation argues that the great political changes can more accurately be described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures, Volume A: To 1500|author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R.

==Overview of events==
{{See also|Late Antiquity|Migration Period|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
[[File:RomulusAugustus.jpg|thumb|right|206px|[[Romulus Augustus]] was deposed as [[Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Emperor]] in 476 while still young. However, [[Julius Nepos]] continued to claim the title of Western Emperor after his deposition.]]

The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] is one of the traditional markers of the end of [[Classical Antiquity]] and the beginning of the European [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the 5th century, the Empire's territories in western Europe and northwestern Africa, including Italy, fell to various invading or indigenous peoples in what is sometimes called the [[Migration period]]. Although the eastern half still survived with borders essentially intact for several centuries (until the [[Muslim conquests]]), the Empire as a whole had initiated major cultural and political transformations since the [[Crisis of the Third Century]], with the shift towards a more openly [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and ritualized form of government, the adoption of [[Christianity]] as the [[state religion]], and a general rejection of the traditions and values of Classical Antiquity. While traditional historiography emphasized this break with Antiquity by using the term "[[Byzantine Empire]]" instead of Roman Empire, recent schools of history offer a more nuanced view, seeing mostly continuity rather than a sharp break. The Empire of [[Late Antiquity]] already looked very different from [[Ancient Rome|classical Rome]].

The Roman Empire emerged from the [[Roman Republic]] when [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus Caesar]] transformed it from a republic into a monarchy. Rome reached its zenith in the 2nd century, then fortunes slowly declined (with many revivals and restorations along the way). The reasons for the decline of the Empire are still debated today, and are likely multiple. Historians infer that the population appears to have diminished in many provinces—especially western Europe—from the diminishing size of fortifications built to protect the cities from [[barbarian]] incursions from the 3rd century on. Some historians even have suggested that parts of the periphery were no longer inhabited because these fortifications were restricted to the center of the city only. Tree rings suggest "distinct drying" beginning in 250.&lt;ref name=treerings&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12186245 | title = Roman rise and fall 'recorded in trees' | last = Kinver | first = Mark |date = 14 January 2011 | work =[[BBC]] | accessdate = 24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 3rd century, the city of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] no longer served as an effective capital for the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and various cities were used as new administrative capitals. Successive emperors, starting with [[Constantine I|Constantine]], privileged the eastern city of [[Byzantium]], which he had entirely rebuilt after a siege. Later renamed [[Constantinople]], and protected by formidable walls in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, it was to become the largest and most powerful city of Christian [[Europe]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. Since the Crisis of the Third Century, the Empire was intermittently ruled by more than one emperor at once (usually two), presiding over different regions. At first a haphazard form of power sharing, this eventually settled on an East-West administrative division between the [[Western Roman Empire]] (centered on Rome, but now usually presided from other seats of power such as [[Trier]], [[Mediolanum|Milan]], and especially [[Ravenna]]), and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (with its capital initially in [[Nicomedia]], and later Constantinople). The [[Latin]]-speaking west, under dreadful demographic crisis, and the wealthier{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking east, also began to diverge politically and culturally. Although this was a gradual process, still incomplete when Italy came under the rule of barbarian chieftains in the last quarter of the 5th century, it deepened further afterward, and had lasting consequences for the medieval history of Europe.

Throughout the 5th century, Western emperors were usually figureheads, while the Eastern emperors maintained more independence. For most of the time, the actual rulers in the West were military strongmen who took the titles of ''[[magister militum]]'', [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], or both, such as [[Stilicho]], [[Flavius Aetius|Aetius]], and [[Ricimer]]. Although Rome was no longer the capital in the West, it remained the West's largest city and its economic center. But the city was [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacked by rebellious Visigoths in 410]] and [[Sack of Rome (455)|by the Vandals in 455]], events that shocked contemporaries and signaled the disintegration of Roman authority. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] wrote ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' partly as an answer to critics who blamed the sack of Rome by the Visigoths on the abandonment of the traditional [[paganism|pagan]] religions.

In June 474, [[Julius Nepos]] became Western Emperor but in the next year the ''magister militum'' [[Orestes (Roman soldier)|Orestes]] revolted and made his son [[Romulus Augustus]] emperor. Romulus, however, was not recognized by the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and so was technically an usurper, Nepos still being the legal Western Emperor. Nevertheless, Romulus Augustus is often known as the last Western Roman Emperor. In 476, after being refused lands in Italy, Orestes' Germanic mercenaries under the leadership of the chieftain [[Odoacer]] captured and executed Orestes and took [[Ravenna]], the Western Roman capital at the time, deposing Romulus Augustus. The whole of Italy was quickly conquered, and Odoacer was granted the title of patrician by Zeno, effectively recognizing his rule in the name of the Eastern Empire. Odoacer returned the Imperial insignia to Constantinople and ruled as King in Italy. Following Nepos' death [[Theodoric the Great]], King of the [[Ostrogoths]], conquered Italy with Zeno's approval.

Meanwhile, much of the rest of the Western provinces were conquered by [[Migration Period|waves of Germanic invasions]], most of them being disconnected politically from the East altogether and continuing a slow decline. Although Roman political authority in the West was lost, Roman culture would last in most parts of the former Western provinces into the 6th century and beyond.

The first invasions disrupted the West to some degree, but it was the [[Gothic War (535–552)|Gothic War]] launched by the Eastern Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] in the 6th century, and meant to reunite the Empire, that eventually caused the most damage to Italy, as well as straining the Eastern Empire militarily. Following these wars, Rome and other Italian cities would fall into severe decline (Rome itself was almost completely abandoned). Another blow came with the [[Roman-Persian Wars#Climax|Persian invasion of the East]] in the 7th century, immediately followed by the [[Muslim conquests]], especially of [[History of Roman Egypt|Egypt]], which curtailed much of the key trade in the Mediterranean on which Europe depended.

The Empire was to live on in the East for many centuries, and enjoy periods of recovery and cultural brilliance, but its size would remain a fraction of what it had been in classical times. It became an essentially regional power, centered on [[Greece]] and [[Anatolia]]. Modern historians tend to prefer the term ''Byzantine Empire'' for the eastern, medieval stage of the Roman Empire.

===Highlights===
{{See also|Fall of the Western Roman Empire}}
The decline of the Western Roman Empire was a process spanning many centuries; there is no consensus when it might have begun but many dates and time lines have been proposed by historians.
;3rd century:
* The [[Crisis of the Third Century]] (234–284), a period of political instability.
* The reign of Emperor [[Diocletian]] (284–305), who attempted substantial political and economic reforms, many of which would remain in force in the following centuries.

;4th century:
* The reign of [[Constantine I]] (306–337), who built the new eastern capital of [[Constantinople]] and converted to [[Christianity]], legalizing and even favoring to some extent this religion. All Roman emperors after Constantine, except for [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], would be Christians.
* The [[Gothic War (376-382)|first war]] with the [[Visigoths]] (376–382), culminating in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] (August 9, 378), in which a large Roman army was defeated by the Visigoths, and Emperor [[Valens]] was killed. The Visigoths, fleeing a migration of the [[Huns]], had been allowed to settle within the borders of the Empire by Valens, but were mistreated by the local Roman administrators, and rebelled.
* The reign of [[Theodosius I]] (379–395), last emperor to reunite under his authority the western and eastern halves of the Empire. Theodosius continued and intensified the policies against [[paganism]] of his predecessors, eventually outlawing it, and making [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaean]] Christianity the [[state religion]].

;5th century:
* The [[Crossing of the Rhine]]: on December 31, 406 (or 405, according to some historians), a mixed band of [[Vandals]], [[Suebi]] and [[Alans]] crossed the frozen river [[Rhine]] at Moguntiacum (modern [[Mainz]]), and began to ravage [[Gaul]]. Some moved on to the regions of [[Hispania]] and [[Africa Province|Africa]]. The Empire would never regain control over most of these lands.
* The second war with the Visigoths, led by king [[Alaric I|Alaric]], in which they raided Greece, and then invaded Italy, culminating in the [[Sack of Rome (410)|sack of Rome]] (410). The Visigoths eventually left Italy and founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in southern Gaul and Hispania.
* The rise of the [[Hunnic Empire]] under [[Attila the Hun|Attila]] and [[Bleda]] (434–453), who raided the [[Balkans]], Gaul, and Italy, threatening both Constantinople and Rome.
* The [[Sack of Rome (455)|second sack of Rome]], this time by the Vandals (455).
* Failed counterstrikes against the Vandals (461–468). The Western Emperor [[Majorian]] planned a naval campaign against the Vandals to reconquer northern Africa in 461, but word of the preparations got out to the Vandals, who took the Roman fleet by surprise and destroyed it. A [[Basiliscus#Disastrous expedition against the Vandals|second naval expedition against the Vandals]], sent by Emperors [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] and [[Anthemius]], was defeated at [[Battle of Cape Bon (468)|Cape Bon]] in 468.
[[File:476eur.jpg|thumb|center|500px|{{center|Europe in 476, from ''Muir's Historical Atlas'' (1911)}}]]
* Deposition of the last Western Emperors, [[Julius Nepos]] and [[Romulus Augustus]] (475–480). Julius Nepos, who had been nominated by the Eastern Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], was deposed by the rebelled ''magister militum'' [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]], who installed his own son Romulus in the imperial throne. Both Zeno and his rival [[Basiliscus]], in the East, continued to regard Julius Nepos, who fled to [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], as the legitimate Western Emperor, and Romulus as an usurper. Shortly after, [[Odoacer]], ''magister militum'' appointed by Julius, invaded Italy, defeated Orestes, and deposed Romulus Augustus on September 4, 476. Odoacer then proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and asked the Eastern Emperor Zeno to become formal Emperor of both empires, and in so doing legalize Odoacer's own position as Imperial viceroy of Italy. Zeno did so, setting aside the claims of Nepos, who was murdered by his own soldiers in 480.
* Foundation of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy (493). Concerned with the success and popularity of Odoacer, Zeno started a campaign against him, at first with words, then by inciting the [[Ostrogoths]] to take back Italy from him. They did as much, but then founded an independent kingdom of their own, under the rule of king [[Theodoric the Great|Theodoric]]. Italy and the entire West were lost to the Empire.

==Theories and explanations of a fall==
The various theories and explanations for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West may be very broadly classified into four schools of thought, although the classification is not without overlap:

* [[#Decay owing to general malaise|Decay owing to general malaise]]
* [[#Monocausal decay|Monocausal decay]]
* [[#Catastrophic collapse|Catastrophic collapse]]
* [[#Transformation|Transformation]]

The tradition positing general malaise goes back to [[Edward Gibbon]] who argued that the edifice of the Roman Empire had been built on unsound foundations to begin with. According to Gibbon, the fall was - in the final analysis - inevitable. On the other hand, Gibbon had assigned a major portion of the responsibility for the decay to the influence of Christianity, and is often, though perhaps unjustly, seen as the founding father of the school of monocausal explanation.

On the other hand, the school of catastrophic collapse holds that the fall of the Empire had not been a pre-determined event and need not be taken for granted. Rather, it was due to the combined effect of a number of adverse processes, many of them set in motion by the [[Migration Period|Migration of the Peoples]], that together applied too much stress to the Empire's basically sound structure.

Finally, the transformation school challenges the whole notion of the 'fall' of the Empire, asking to distinguish between the fall into disuse of a particular political dispensation, anyway unworkable towards its end, and the fate of the Roman civilisation which under-girded the Empire. According to this school, drawing its basic premise from the [[#Henri Pirenne|Pirenne thesis]], the Roman world underwent a gradual (though often violent) series of transformations, morphing into the medieval world. The historians belonging to this school often prefer to speak of [[Late Antiquity]] instead of the Fall of the Roman Empire.

===Decay owing to general malaise===

====Edward Gibbon====
In ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776–88), [[Edward Gibbon]] famously placed the blame on a loss of [[civic virtue]] among the Roman citizens. They gradually entrusted the role of defending the Empire to [[Barbarian#Modern academia|barbarian]] [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] who eventually turned on them. Gibbon held that [[Christianity]] contributed to this shift by making the populace less interested in the worldly ''here-and-now'' because it was willing to wait for the rewards of [[heaven]].

{{quote|The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight.}}

{{quote|In discussing Barbarism and Christianity I have actually been discussing the Fall of Rome.}}

====Vegetius on military decline====
Writing in the 5th century, the Roman historian [[Vegetius]] pleaded for reform of what must have been a greatly weakened army. The historian [[Arther Ferrill]] has suggested that the Roman Empire – particularly the military – declined largely as a result of an influx of Germanic mercenaries into the ranks of the legions. This "Germanization" and the resultant cultural dilution or "barbarization" led not only to a decline in the standard of drill and overall military preparedness within the Empire, but also to a decline of loyalty to the Roman government in favor of loyalty to commanders. Ferrill agrees with other Roman historians such as A.H.M. Jones:
{{quote|...the decay of trade and industry was not a cause of Rome’s fall. There was a decline in agriculture and land was withdrawn from cultivation, in some cases on a very large scale, sometimes as a direct result of barbarian invasions. However, the chief cause of the agricultural decline was high taxation on the marginal land, driving it out of cultivation. Jones is surely right in saying that taxation was spurred by the huge military budget and was thus ‘indirectly’ the result of the barbarian invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Arther Ferrill, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire: The Military Explanation'' (New York: Thames and Hudson Ltd., 1986),&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Arnold J. Toynbee and James Burke====
In contrast with the declining empire theories, historians such as [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] and [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] argue that the Roman Empire itself was a rotten system from its inception, and that the entire Imperial era was one of steady decay of institutions founded in [[Roman Republic|Republican]] times. In their view, the Empire could never have lasted longer than it did without radical reforms that no Emperor could implement. The Romans had no budgetary system and thus wasted whatever resources they had available. The economy of the Empire was a [[Raubwirtschaft]] or plunder economy based on [[looting]] existing resources rather than producing anything new. The Empire relied on riches from conquered territories (this source of revenue ending, of course, with the end of Roman territorial expansion) or on a pattern of tax collection that drove small-scale farmers into destitution (and onto a [[welfare (financial aid)|dole]] that required even more exactions upon those who could not escape taxation), or into dependency upon a landed élite exempt from taxation. With the cessation of tribute from conquered territories, the full cost of their military machine had to be borne by the citizenry.

An economy based upon slave labor precluded a middle class with buying power. The Roman Empire produced few exportable goods. Material innovation, whether through entrepreneurialism or technological advancement, all but ended long before the final dissolution of the Empire. Meanwhile, the costs of military defense and the pomp of Emperors continued. Financial needs continued to increase, but the means of meeting them steadily eroded. In the end, due to economic failure, even the armor and weaponry of soldiers became so obsolete that the enemies of the Empire had better armor and weapons as well as larger forces. The decrepit social order offered so little to its subjects that many saw the barbarian invasion as liberation from onerous obligations to the ruling class.

By the late 5th century the barbarian conqueror [[Odoacer]] had no use for the formality of an Empire upon deposing [[Romulus Augustus]] and chose neither to assume the title of Emperor himself nor to select a puppet, although legally he kept the lands as a commander of the Eastern Empire and maintained the Roman institutions such as the [[consulship]]. The formal end of the Roman Empire on the West in AD 476 thus corresponds with the time in which the Empire and the title Emperor no longer had value.

====Michael Rostovtzeff, Ludwig von Mises, and Bruce Bartlett====
Historian [[Michael Rostovtzeff]] and economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] both argued that unsound economic policies played a key role in the impoverishment and decay of the Roman Empire. According to them, by the 2nd century AD, the Roman Empire had developed a complex [[market economy]] in which trade was relatively free. [[Tariff]]s were low and laws controlling the prices of foodstuffs and other commodities had little impact because they did not fix the prices significantly below their market levels. After the 3rd century, however, [[debasement]] of the currency (i.e., the minting of coins with diminishing content of [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[bronze]]) led to [[inflation]]. The [[Incomes policy|price control]] laws then resulted in prices that were significantly below their free-market equilibrium levels. It should, however, be noted that [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] initiated a successful [[Constantine the Great#Monetary reforms|reform of the currency]] which was completed before the barbarian invasions of the 4th century, and that thereafter the currency remained sound everywhere that remained within the empire until at least the 11th century - at any rate for gold coins.

According to Rostovtzeff and Mises, artificially low prices led to the scarcity of foodstuffs, particularly in [[city|cities]], whose inhabitants depended on trade to obtain them. Despite laws passed to prevent migration from the cities to the countryside, urban areas gradually became depopulated and many Roman citizens abandoned their specialized trades to practice [[subsistence agriculture]]. This, coupled with increasingly oppressive and arbitrary [[tax]]ation, led to a severe net decrease in trade, [[technology|technical]] innovation, and the overall wealth of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cjv14n2-7.html "How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome"], by [[Bruce Bartlett]], and [http://www.capitalismmagazine.com/economics/classics/3015-politics-ideas-the-rise-and-decline-of-civilization-lecture-6-part-3-of-4.html "The Rise and Decline of Civilization"], by [[Ludwig von Mises]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruce Bartlett]] traces the beginning of debasement to the reign of [[Nero]]. He claims that the emperors increasingly relied on the army as the sole source of their power, and therefore their economic policy was driven more and more by a desire to increase military funding in order to buy the army's loyalty. By the 3rd century, according to Bartlett, the monetary economy had collapsed. But the imperial government was now in a position where it had to satisfy the demands of the army at all costs. Failure to do so would result in the army forcibly deposing the emperor and installing a new one. Therefore, being unable to increase monetary taxes, the Roman Empire had to resort to direct requisitioning of physical goods anywhere it could find them - for example taking food and cattle from farmers. The result, in Bartlett's view, was social chaos, and this led to different responses from the authorities and from the common people. The authorities tried to restore order by requiring free people (i.e. non-slaves) to remain in the same occupation or even at the same place of employment. Eventually, this practice was extended to force children to follow the same occupation as their parents. So, for instance, farmers were tied to the land, and the sons of soldiers had to become soldiers themselves. Many common people reacted by moving to the countryside, sometimes joining the estates of the wealthy, and in general trying to be self-sufficient and interact as little as possible with the imperial authorities. Thus, according to Bartlett, Roman society began to dissolve into a number of separate estates that operated as closed systems, provided for all their own needs and did not engage in trade at all. These were the beginnings of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cjv14n2-7.html "How Excessive Government Killed Ancient Rome"], by [[Bruce Bartlett]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Joseph Tainter====
In his 1988 book ''The Collapse of Complex Societies'', American anthropologist [[Joseph Tainter|Tainter]] presents the view that for given technological levels there are implicit declining returns to complexity, in which systems deplete their resource base beyond levels that are ultimately sustainable. Tainter argues that societies become more complex as they try to solve problems. Social complexity can include differentiated [[social]] and [[economic]] roles, reliance on [[symbol]]ic and [[abstraction|abstract]] [[communication]], and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial "energy" subsidy (meaning [[Natural resource|resources]], or other forms of [[wealth]]). When a society confronts a "problem", such as a shortage of or difficulty in gaining access to [[energy]], it tends to create new layers of [[bureaucracy]], [[infrastructure]], or [[social class]] to address the challenge.

For example, as Roman [[agricultural productivity|agricultural output]] slowly declined and population increased, per-capita energy availability dropped. The Romans solved this problem in the short term by conquering their neighbours to appropriate their energy surpluses (metals, grain, slaves, etc.). However, this solution merely exacerbated the issue over the long term; as the Empire grew, the cost of maintaining communications, garrisons, civil government, etc., increased. Eventually, this cost grew so great that any new challenges such as invasions and crop failures could not be solved by the acquisition of more territory. At that point, the Empire fragmented into smaller units.

We often assume that the collapse of the Roman Empire was a catastrophe for everyone involved. Tainter points out that it can be seen as a very rational preference of individuals at the time, many of whom were better off (all but the elite, presumably.) Archeological evidence from human bones indicates that average nutrition improved after the collapse in many parts of the former Roman Empire. Average individuals may have benefited because they no longer had to invest in the burdensome complexity of empire.

In Tainter's view, while [[invasions]], [[famine|crop failures]], [[disease]] or [[environmental degradation]] may be the ''apparent'' causes of [[societal collapse]], the ultimate cause is ''diminishing returns on investments in social [[complexity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, Joseph (1988) "The Collapse of Complex Societies" (Princeton Uni Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adrian Goldsworthy====
In ''The Complete Roman Army'' (2003) [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], a British military historian, sees the causes of the collapse of the Roman Empire not in any 'decadence' in the make-up of the Roman legions, but in a combination of endless civil wars between factions of the Roman Army fighting for control of the Empire. This inevitably weakened the army and the society upon which it depended, making it less able to defend itself against the growing numbers of Rome's enemies. The army still remained a superior fighting instrument to its opponents, both civilized and barbarian; this is shown in the victories over Germanic tribes at the [[Battle of Strasbourg]] (357) and in its ability to hold the line against the Sassanid Persians throughout the 4th century. But, says Goldsworthy, "Weakening central authority, social and economic problems and, most of all, the continuing grind of civil wars eroded the political capacity to maintain the army at this level."&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Roman Army'' (2003) p. 214 [[Adrian Goldsworthy]]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldsworthy set out in greater detail his theory that recurring civil wars during the late fourth and early fifth centuries contributed to the fall of the West Roman Empire (395-476), in his book ''The Fall of the West: The Slow Death of the Roman Superpower'' (2009).

===Monocausal decay===

====Disease====
[[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]], a [[World History|world historian]], noted in chapter three of his book ''Plagues and Peoples'' (1976) that the Roman Empire suffered the severe and protracted [[Antonine Plague]] starting around 165 AD. For about twenty years, waves of one or more diseases, possibly the first epidemics of [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], swept through the Empire, ultimately killing about half the population. Similar [[Pandemic|epidemics]], such as the [[Plague of Cyprian]], also occurred in the 3rd century. McNeill argues that the severe fall in population left the state apparatus and army too large for the population to support, leading to further economic and social decline that eventually killed the [[Western Empire]]. The Eastern half survived due to its larger population, which even after the plagues was sufficient for an effective state apparatus.

Archaeology has revealed that from the 2nd century onward, the inhabited area in most Roman towns and cities grew smaller and smaller. Imperial laws concerning "agri deserti", or deserted lands, became increasingly common and desperate. The economic collapse of the 3rd century may also be evidence of a shrinking population as Rome’s tax base was also shrinking and could no longer support the Roman Army and other Roman institutions.

Rome's success had led to increased contact with Asia though trade, especially in a sea route through the Red Sea that Rome cleared of pirates shortly after conquering Egypt. Wars also increased contact with Asia, particularly wars with the Persian Empire. With increased contact with Asia came increased transmission of disease into the Mediterranean from Asia. Romans used public fountains, public latrines, public baths, and supported many brothels all of which were conducive to the spread of pathogens. Romans crowded into walled cities and the poor and the slaves lived in very close quarters with each other. Epidemics began sweeping though the Empire.

The culture of the German barbarians living just across the Rhine and Danube rivers was not so conducive to the spread of pathogens. Germans lived in small scattered villages that did not support the same level of trade as did Roman settlements. Germans lived in single-family detached houses. Germans did not have public baths nor as many brothels and drank ale made with boiled water. The barbarian population seemed to be on the rise. The demographics of Europe were changing.

Economically, depopulation led to the impoverishment of East and West as economic ties among different parts of the empire weakened. Increasing raids by barbarians further strained the economy and further reduced the population, mostly in the West. In areas near the Rhine and Danube frontiers, raids by barbarians killed Romans and disrupted commerce. Raids also forced Romans into walled towns and cities furthering the spread of pathogens and increasing the rate of depopulation in the West. A low population and weak economy forced Rome to use barbarians in the Roman Army to defend against other barbarians.

====Environmental degradation====
{{further|Deforestation during the Roman period}}

Another theory is that gradual environmental degradation caused population and economic decline. [[Deforestation]] and excessive grazing led to [[erosion]] of meadows and cropland. Increased irrigation without suitable drainage caused [[Soil salinity|salinization]], especially in North Africa. These human activities resulted in fertile land becoming nonproductive and eventually increased desertification in some regions. Many animal species become extinct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humecol.lu.se/woshglec/papers/hughes.doc Lunds universitet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701014145/http://www.humecol.lu.se/woshglec/papers/hughes.doc |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent research of Tainter stated that "deforestation did not cause the Roman collapse",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tainter |first=Joseph |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.35.081705.123136 |title=Archeology of Overshoot and Collapse |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |year=2006 |volume=35 |issue= |pages=59–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although it could be a minor contributing factor.

Also, high taxes and heavy slavery are another reason for decline as they forced small farmers out of business and into the cities, which became overpopulated. Roman cities were only designed to hold a certain number of people, and once they passed that, disease, water shortage and food shortage became common.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Lead poisoning====
{{See also|Lead poisoning}}

Publishing several articles in the 1960s, the sociologist [[S. Colum Gilfillan|Seabury Colum Gilfillan]] advanced the argument that lead poisoning was a significant factor in the decline of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S. Colum |title=The Inventive Lag in Classical Mediterranean Society |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=85–87 |date=Winter 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1965jan-00131 |title=Roman Culture and Dysgenic Lead Poisoning |journal=The Mankind Quarterly |volume=5 |pages=131–148 |date=1965 |accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 3"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |title=Lead Poisoning and the Fall of Rome |journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=53–60|date=1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a posthumously published book elaborated on Gilfillan's work on this topic.&lt;ref name="Gilfillan 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilfillan |first=S.C. |title=Rome's Ruin by Lead Poison |publisher=Wenzel Press |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that "lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire." His work centred on the level to which the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], who had few sweeteners besides [[honey]], would boil [[must]] in lead pots to produce a reduced sugar syrup called ''[[defrutum]]'', concentrated again into ''[[sapa (sweetener)|sapa]]''. This syrup was used to some degree to sweeten wine and food.&lt;ref name="Lessler"&gt;{{cite web |title=Lead and Lead Poisoning from Antiquity to Modern Times |url=https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/1811/23252/1/V088N3_078.pdf |accessdate=11 Jan 2009 |author=Milton A. Lessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; If acidic must is boiled within lead vessels the sweet syrup it yields will contain a quantity of [[Lead(II) acetate|Pb(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or lead(II) acetate]].&lt;ref name="Lessler"/&gt; Lead was also leached from the glazes on [[amphora]]e and other pottery, from pewter drinking vessels and cookware, and from lead piping used for municipal water supplies and baths.&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nriagu JO |title=Saturnine gout among Roman aristocrats. Did lead poisoning contribute to the fall of the Empire? |journal=[[N. Engl. J. Med.]] |volume=308|issue=11|pages=660–3|date=March 1983|pmid=6338384 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198303173081123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main culinary use of ''defrutum'' was to sweeten wine, but it was also added to fruit and meat dishes as a sweetening and souring agent and even given to food animals such as suckling pig and duck to improve the taste of their flesh. ''Defrutum'' was mixed with ''[[garum]]'' to make the popular condiment ''[[oenogarum]]'' and as such was one of Rome's most popular condiments. Quince and melon were preserved in ''defrutum'' and honey through the winter, and some Roman women used ''defrutum'' or ''sapa'' as a cosmetic. ''Defrutum'' was often used as a food preservative in provisions for Roman troops.&lt;ref name="Brighton"&gt;{{cite video|title=Tales of the Living Dead: Poisoned Roman Babies|publisher=Brighton TV for National Geographic|people=Director: Chris Warren|medium=television|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nriagu produced a table showing his estimated consumption of lead by various classes within the Roman Empire. However, to produce the table Nriagu assumes all of the ''defrutum''/''sapa'' consumed to have been made in lead vessels:&lt;ref name="pmid6338384"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/r8/ceh/2007/Anderson.pdf|accessdate=11 Jan 2009|title=Children’s Environmental Health: Tribal Nations CEH Summit|author=Mark E.

Lead is not removed quickly from the body.

However, the lead content revealed in many other ancient Roman remains have been shown to have been less than half that of modern Europeans&lt;ref&gt;Drasch
1982:199–231&lt;/ref&gt; which have concentrations between 20-50ppm.&lt;ref name="CLUE"/&gt;

=====Criticism of lead poisoning theory=====
The role and importance of lead poisoning in contributing to the fall of the Roman Empire is the subject of controversy and its importance and validity is discounted by many historians.&lt;ref name="Lessler"/&gt; John Scarborough, a pharmacologist and classicist, criticized Nriagu's book as "so full of false evidence, miscitations, typographical errors, and a blatant flippancy regarding primary sources that the reader cannot trust the basic arguments."&lt;ref&gt;Scarborough, John (1984). ''The Myth of Lead Poisoning Among the Romans: An Essay Review''&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that ancient authorities were well aware of lead poisoning and that it was not [[endemic (epedemiology)|endemic]] in the Roman empire nor did it cause its fall.

Although ''defrutum'' and ''sapa'' prepared in leaden containers would indubitably have contained toxic levels of lead, the use of leaden containers, though popular, was not the standard and copper was used far more generally. The exact amount of ''sapa'' added to wine was also not standardised and there is no indication how often ''sapa'' was added or in what quantity.

Additionally, Roman authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]]&lt;ref&gt;Historia Naturalis1 xxxiv.50.167&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vitruvius]] recognised the toxicity of lead. Vitruvius, who flourished during [[Augustus]]' time, writes that the Romans knew very well of the dangers.
{{quote|Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead; indeed that conveyed in lead must be injurious, because from it white lead [cerussa, lead carbonate, PbCO3] is obtained, and this is said to be injurious to the human system. This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour; water should therefore on no account be conducted in leaden pipes if we are desirous that it should be wholesome.|VIII.6.10–11}}

Nevertheless, recent research supports the idea that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in the pipes to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.
{{quote|Thirty years ago, Jerome Nriagu argued in a milestone paper that Roman civilization collapsed as a result of lead poisoning. [[Clair Patterson]], the scientist who convinced governments to ban lead from gasoline, enthusiastically endorsed this idea, which nevertheless triggered a volley of publications aimed at refuting it. Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome's demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue. By measuring Pb isotope compositions of sediments from the Tiber River and the Trajanic Harbor, the present work shows that "tap water" from ancient Rome had 100 times more lead than local spring waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/16/1400097111 Hugo Delile – Lead in ancient Rome's city waters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/apr/21/ancient-rome-tap-water-contaminated-lead-researchers Ancient Rome's tap water heavily contaminated with lead, researchers say] – ''The Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/04/21/ancient-romes-water-100-times-lead-local-spring-water/ Lead in Ancient Rome’s Water Was 100 Times Natural Levels] – Discover&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Catastrophic collapse===

====J. B. Bury====
[[J. B. Bury]]'s ''History of the Later Roman Empire'' (1889/1923) challenged the prevailing "theory of moral decay" established by Gibbon as well as the classic "clash of Christianity vs. paganism" theory, citing the relative success of the Eastern Empire, which was resolutely Christian. He held that Gibbon's grand history, though epoch-making in its research and detail, was too monocausal. His main difference from Gibbon lay in his interpretation of facts, rather than disputing any facts. He made it clear that he felt that Gibbon's thesis concerning "moral decay" was viable—but incomplete. Bury's judgment was that:&lt;ref name=bury&gt;Bury, J.B. [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/BURLAT/9*.html#7 History of the Later Roman Empire • Vol. I Chap. IX]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The gradual collapse of the Roman power ... was the consequence of a series of contingent events. No general causes can be assigned that made it inevitable.}}

Bury held that a number of crises arose simultaneously: economic decline, Germanic expansion, depopulation of Italy, dependency on Germanic ''foederati'' for the military, the disastrous (though Bury believed unknowing) treason of [[Stilicho]], loss of martial vigor, [[Flavius Aëtius|Aetius]]' murder, the lack of any leader to replace Aetius—a series of misfortunes which, in combination, proved catastrophic:
{{quote|The Empire had come to depend on the enrollment of barbarians, in large numbers, in the army, and ... it was necessary to render the service attractive to them by the prospect of power and wealth. This was, of course, a consequence of the decline in military spirit, and of depopulation, in the old civilised Mediterranean countries. The Germans in high command had been useful, but the dangers involved in the policy had been shown in the cases of [[Merobaudes (general)|Merobaudes]] and [[Arbogastes]]. Yet this policy need not have led to the dismemberment of the Empire, and but for that series of chances its western provinces would not have been converted, as and when they were, into German kingdoms. It may be said that a German penetration of western Europe must ultimately have come about. But even if that were certain, it might have happened in another way, at a later time, more gradually, and with less violence.

The point of the present contention is that Rome's loss of her provinces in the fifth century was not an "inevitable effect of any of those features which have been rightly or wrongly described as causes or consequences of her general 'decline'". The central fact that Rome could not dispense with the help of barbarians for her wars (''gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus'') may be held to be the cause of her calamities, but it was a weakness which might have continued to be far short of fatal but for the sequence of contingencies pointed out above.&lt;ref name=bury/&gt;}}

====Peter Heather====
[[Peter Heather]], in his ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'' (2005), maintains the Roman imperial system with its sometimes violent imperial transitions and problematic communications notwithstanding, was in fairly good shape during the first, second, and part of the 3rd centuries AD. According to Heather, the first real indication of trouble was the emergence in Iran of the [[Sassanid]] Persian empire (226–651). As reviewed by one writer on Heather's writing,
{{quote|The Sassanids were sufficiently powerful and internally cohesive to push back [[Roman legions]] from the Euphrates and from much of Armenia and southeast Turkey. Much as modern readers tend to think of the "Huns" as the nemesis of the Roman Empire, for the entire period under discussion it was the Persians who held the attention and concern of Rome and Constantinople. Indeed, 20–25% of the military might of the [[Roman Army]] was addressing the Persian threat from the late third century onward ... and upwards of 40% of the troops under the Eastern Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000350.html Albion's Seedlings: Heather - The Fall of the Roman Empire]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Heather goes on to state—in the tradition of Gibbon and Bury—that it took the Roman Empire about half a century to cope with the Sassanid threat, which it did by stripping the western provincial towns and cities of their regional taxation income. The resulting expansion of military forces in the [[Middle East]] was finally successful in stabilizing the frontiers with the Sassanids, but the reduction of real income in the provinces of the Empire led to two trends which, Heather says, had a negative long-term impact. First, the incentive for local officials to spend their time and money in the development of local infrastructure disappeared. Public buildings from the 4th century onward tended to be much more modest and funded from central budgets, as the regional taxes had dried up. Second, Heather says "the landowning provincial literati now shifted their attention to where the money was ... away from provincial and local politics to the imperial bureaucracies." Having set the scene of an Empire stretched militarily by the Sassanid threat, Heather then suggests, using archaeological evidence, that the Germanic tribes on the Empire's northern border had altered in nature since the 1st century. Contact with the Empire had increased their material wealth, and that in turn had led to disparities of wealth sufficient to create a ruling class capable of maintaining control over far larger groupings than had previously been possible. Essentially they had become significantly more formidable foes.

Heather then posits what amounts to a domino theory—namely that pressure on peoples very far away from the Empire could result in sufficient pressure on peoples on the Empire's borders to make them contemplate the risk of full scale immigration to the empire. Thus he links the [[Goths|Gothic]] invasion of 376 directly to [[Huns|Hunnic]] movements around the Black Sea in the decade before. In the same way he sees the invasions across the Rhine in 406 as a direct consequence of further Hunnic incursions in [[Germania]]; as such he sees the Huns as deeply significant in the fall of the Western Empire long before they themselves became a military threat to the Empire. He postulates that the Hunnic expansion caused unprecedented immigration in 376 and 406 by barbarian groupings who had become significantly more politically and militarily capable than in previous eras. This impacted an empire already at maximum stretch due to the Sassanid pressure. Essentially he argues that the external pressures of 376–470 could have brought the Western Empire down at any point in its history.

He disputes Gibbon's contention that [[Christianity]] and moral decay led to the decline. He also rejects the political infighting of the Empire as a reason, considering it was a systemic recurring factor throughout the Empire's history which, while it might have contributed to an inability to respond to the circumstances of the 5th century, it consequently cannot be blamed for them. Instead he places its origin squarely on outside military factors, starting with the Sassanids. Like Bury, he does not believe the fall was inevitable, but rather a series of events which came together to shatter the Empire. He differs from Bury, however, in placing the onset of those events far earlier in the Empire's timeline, with the Sassanid rise.

====Bryan Ward-Perkins====
[[Bryan Ward-Perkins]]'s ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'' (2005) takes a traditional view tempered by modern discoveries, arguing that the empire's demise was caused by a vicious circle of political instability, foreign invasion, and reduced tax revenue. Essentially, invasions caused long-term damage to the provincial tax base, which lessened the Empire's medium- to long-term ability to pay and equip the legions, with predictable results. Likewise, constant invasions encouraged provincial rebellion as self-help, further depleting Imperial resources. Contrary to the trend among some historians of the "there was no fall" school, who view the fall of Rome as not necessarily a "bad thing" for the people involved, Ward-Perkins argues that in many parts of the former Empire the archaeological record indicates that the collapse was truly a disaster.

Ward-Perkins' theory, much like Bury's, and Heather's, identifies a series of cyclic events that came together to cause a definite decline and fall.

===Transformation===

==== Henri Pirenne ====
In the second half of the 19th century, some historians focused on the continuities between the Roman Empire and the post-Roman Germanic kingdoms rather than the rupture. In ''Histoire des institutions politiques de l'ancienne France'' (1875–89), [[Fustel de Coulanges]] argued that the barbarians simply contributed to an ongoing process of transforming Roman institutions.

[[Henri Pirenne]] continued this idea with the "Pirenne Thesis", published in the 1920s, which remains influential to this day. It holds that even after the barbarian invasions, the Roman way of doing things did not immediately change; barbarians came to Rome not to destroy it, but to take part in its benefits, and thus they tried to preserve the Roman way of life. The Pirenne Thesis regards the rise of the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish realm in Europe]] as a continuation of the Roman Empire, and thus validates the crowning of [[Charlemagne]] as the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as a successor of the Roman Emperors. According to Pirenne, the real break in Roman history occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries as a result of Arab expansion. Islamic conquest of the area of today's south-eastern Turkey, Syria, Palestine, North Africa, Spain and Portugal ruptured economic ties to western Europe, cutting the region off from trade and turning it into a stagnant backwater, with wealth flowing out in the form of raw resources and nothing coming back. This began a steady decline and impoverishment so that by the time of Charlemagne western Europe had become almost entirely agrarian at a subsistence level, with no long-distance trade. Pirenne's view on the continuity of the Roman Empire before and after the Germanic invasion has been supported by recent historians such as François Masai, [[Karl Ferdinand Werner]], and [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]].

Some modern critics have argued that the "Pirenne Thesis" erred on two counts: by treating the [[Carolingian]] realm as a Roman state and by overemphasizing the effect of the Islamic conquests on the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. Other critics have argued that while Pirenne was correct in arguing for the continuity of the Empire beyond the sack of Rome, the Arab conquests in the 7th century may not have disrupted [[Mediterranean]] trade routes to the degree that Pirenne argued. Michael McCormick in particular has argued that some recently unearthed sources, such as collective biographies, describe new trade routes. Moreover, other records and coins document the movement of Islamic currency into the Carolingian Empire. McCormick has concluded that if money was coming in, some type of goods must have been going out – including slaves, timber, weapons, honey, amber, and furs.

==== Lucien Musset and the clash of civilizations ====
In the spirit of "Pirenne thesis", a school of thought pictured a clash of civilizations between the Roman and the Germanic world, a process taking place roughly between 3rd and 8th century.

The French historian [[Lucien Musset]], studying the [[Barbarian invasions]], argues the civilization of [[Medieval]] [[Europe]] emerged from a synthesis between the [[Graeco-Roman]] world and the [[List of Germanic peoples|Germanic]] civilizations penetrating the Roman Empire. The Roman Empire did not fall, did not decline, it just transformed but so did the Germanic populations which invaded it. To support this conclusion, beside the narrative of the events, he offers [[linguistics|linguistic]] surveys of [[toponymy]] and [[anthroponymy]], analyzes archaeological records, studies the urban and rural society, the institutions, the religion, the art, the technology.

==== Late Antiquity ====
Historians of Late Antiquity, a field pioneered by Peter Brown, have turned away from the idea that the Roman Empire fell at all – refocusing instead on Pirenne's thesis. They see a transformation occurring over centuries, with the roots of Medieval culture contained in Roman culture and focus on the continuities between the classical and Medieval worlds. Thus, it was a gradual process with no clear break. Brown argues in his book that:

{{quote|Factors we would regard as natural in a 'crisis'—''malaise'' caused by urbanization, public disasters, the intrusion of alien religious ideas, and a consequent heightening of religious hopes and fears—may not have bulked as large in the minds of the men of the late second and third centuries as we suppose... The towns of the Mediterranean were small towns. For all their isolation from the way of life of the villagers, they were fragile excrescences in a spreading countryside."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, ''The Making of Late Antiquity'' (Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1978), pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This article describes the [[history of Sweden]] from the late 1960s until 1991.

==Rise of the far left==
During the mid-sixties, there was a strong wave of [[radical leftism]] in Sweden, sometimes precipitating heavily publicized events like the [[Båstad riots]] and the occupation of the student union building at [[Stockholm University]] - though never causing actual fatalities, in either street fighting or domestic political terror acts, it did in [[Western Germany]] and Italy during these years.

"Solidarity" and "awareness" became watchwords, first in literary and student circles, then in the socialist/[[syndicalist]] underground, and finally, in the media and the government. By the early seventies, people and government, led by Prime Minister [[Olof Palme]] [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|(s)]], rose in protest against oppression and war in countries as distant as [[South Africa]] and [[Vietnam]] (at the end of 1972, Palme famously indicted the American shock bombings of Hanoi and compared them to Nazi war crimes such as the destructions of [[Lidice massacre|Lidice]] and [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|Oradour]]; the USA responded by calling home her ambassador).&lt;ref&gt;[[Leif Leifland]], ''Frostens år'' (in Swedish) (1997), {{ISBN|91-648-0109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swedish support for the [[African National Congress|ANC]] in and outside of [[South Africa]] and [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|FNL]] and the Hanoi government in the [[Vietnam war]] were steady not only in words, popular support and help to enter the diplomatic arena, but also in economic (though not military) state subsidies. After Vietnam was reunited in 1975, for instance, Sweden supported the construction of a modern pulp plant at [[Bai Bang]].

In 1973, journalists [[Jan Guillou]] and [[Peter Bratt]] exposed [[Informationsbyrån]], a secret agency operating with some assistance of military personnel, but not a part of the [[military intelligence]] and not formally run by the military. One of its aims was to gather intelligence on [[communist]]s and other people regarded as dangerous to national security. While the existence of such a thing, and in particular of its implied links to the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic]] party structure, was fiercely denied, the question continued to surface in a number of political scandals over the years, until it became the subject of serious historical discussion, a few state-issued retrospective [[white paper]]s and political recant. Although some details are a bit hazy (including when and how it began) this "internal spying" outside of the ordinary state intelligence services, is now considered an established fact. IB in the form unraveled by Guillou and Bratt did not operate, it seems, beyond the mid-seventies.

The [[constitution of Sweden|constitutional]] practice was changed several times during this decade. In 1971 the Riksdag became unicameral. By the new constitution of 1974 the [[king of Sweden|monarch]] was divorced from all power of political intervention on their own, the end-point of an evolution that had been going on ever since the early years of the century. There have been no real attempts to abolish formal monarchy, though.

===Environmentalism and nuclear power===
{{Main|Nuclear power in Sweden}}
{{Update|type=section|date=February 2011}}
The 1970s and '80s saw a rise in [[environmentalism]] – the ambiguous result of a [[Swedish referendums|referendum]] in 1980 advised government to phase out [[Swedish nuclear power]] by the year of 2010. The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986 caused considerable [[radioactive fallout]] over Sweden. With only the [[Barsebäck nuclear power plant]] permanently closed, and ten out of twelve reactors still running (as of 2007), this schedule was no longer regarded as realistic, and in the 2006 elections the liberal (Folkpartiet) and the [[Moderate Party]] supported not only reversing the decision but building a few fresh nuclear plants. [[Green Party (Sweden)|The Green Party]] was founded in 1981, entered the Riksdag in 1988 and supported [[Göran Persson]]'s Social Democratic government from 1998 to 2006.

==Right-wing intermission==
The 1976 parliamentary elections brought a liberal/right-wing coalition to power after almost half a century of social democrat leadership, and Mr Palme gave way to [[Thorbjörn Fälldin]] (of the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]], a former farmers/landowners party which had incorporated social liberal ideas as well as the burgeoning environmental debate). Over the next six years, four governments ruled and fell, composed by all or some of the parties that had won in 1976, and the questions of energy and of battling the economic recession came to the fore like never before. The fourth liberal government in these years, again with Fälldin at the helm, seemed somewhat baffled by these problems and had neither the support of a firm majority in the parliament, nor a clear mandate from the non-socialist part of the Swedish electorate. Predictably it came under fire both from the Social Democrats and trade unions, and from the [[Moderate Party]], now heading in an increasingly [[Milton Friedman|Friedman]]-inspired and market liberal direction, and it was defeated in the elections of 1982, with Mr. Palme returning to the PM's seat.

During the 1980s there were several incidents of foreign, probably Soviet, [[submarine]]s violating the Swedish territorial borders. In late 1981 the Soviet submarine [[Soviet submarine S-363|''U 137'']] ran ashore inside a restricted zone off the [[Karlskrona]] naval base, and became headline news. Though the particular fact was kept secret at the time, nuclear activity, probably from [[torpedo]] warheads was detected on board and reported to PM Fälldin while the vessel was still stuck in the firth. The incident marked a turning-point both in Soviet-Swedish relations and in the discussion in Sweden about defence, the Soviet Union and ultimately the place of Sweden in the arena of the [[Cold War]]&lt;!--(see article on [[Baltic submarine intrusions and submarine hunting in the 1980s]] (article nonexistent as of february 2011)--&gt;.

==Assassination of Olof Palme==
{{Main|Assassination of Olof Palme}}
On February 28, 1986, Prime Minister Palme was murdered as he was walking the streets of Stockholm with his wife. The crime came as a shock—indeed it is sometimes referred to as a [[national trauma]], or an event by which Sweden "lost her innocence". The main suspect [[Christer Pettersson]] was convicted of the murder, but the conviction was reversed on appeal because the gun was never found.  Pettersson died in 2004.

Palme was succeeded by his deputy [[Ingvar Carlsson]].

'''Husino rebellion''' ({{lang-sh|Husinska buna}}, Хусинска буна){{Cref2|a}} was a short-lived miners strike and armed rebellion against industrial slavery in the newly established [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. 7,000 miners from [[Tuzla]], [[Breza, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Breza]] and [[Zenica]] in central [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], participated in the strike in the village of Husino in Tuzla. When the local government tried to force the miners back to work, they resisted with firearms and the uprising was put down with great violence. Seven workers were killed and four-hundred arrested. The uprising was put down, but its memory was preserved as part of Tuzla’s anti-authoritarian legacy.

The rebellion has been called one of the most important historical events in Yugoslavia and has remained an example of class struggle against injustice and oppression.

==Event==
A miners' strike began on 21 December 1920 in Husino when the miners requested a rise of wages of 30-45% to counter the gallop inflation which had paralyzed the economy of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (+60% between August and December 1920). Even with threats in the event of refusal of the authorities, the miners began a general strike. This very badly accommodated by the authorities who took radical measures to counter it. On the night of 27–28 December 1920, they sent a troop of 19 [[gendarmerie]] and police officers, who were ordered to evacuate the houses of the strikers in order to capture them and to counterbalance them, to Husino, which was then regarded as general headquarter of the strike movement.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The main actors of the strike were Jure Kerošević (Guja), Osman Đulović (Topčo), Mujo Đulović (Mujko), Karlo Železnik, Ivan Brcun, Franjo Marić, Marko Fidler, Bozo Mrkić, Simo Topalović, Mijo Tomić.

The 7,000 miners, armed with simple stones and pickaxes, quickly decimated the gendarmes and police officers, which caused the anger of the authorities who sent two battalions of the army as well as heavy artillery and 50 gendarmes that same evening. Vis-à-vis the army, the miners had only one choice: to surrender and give up their requirements. The rebellion was choked in blood by the Yugoslav government and the miners and their families' homes were confiscated, women were raped, over 400 people were arrested and some were [[Expatriate|expatriated]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Thirteen months later, the revolt got an epilogue in a trial conducted in Tuzla in January–February 1922. The indictment charged the {{circa|350}} miners, including the leader of the uprising, Juro Kerošević, who was originally sentenced to death by hanging for allegedly killing [[gendarmerie]] officers. However, under pressure from domestic and international publicity the penalty was commuted to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/zaboravljene-vrijednosti-dan-rudara-i-husinska-buna/24805508.html|title=Zaboravljene vrijednosti: Dan rudara i Husinska buna|publisher=Slobodna Evropa|date=21 December 2012|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novovrijeme.ba/husinska-buna-u-vremenu-tranzicije/|title=Husinska buna u vremenu tranzicije|publisher=Novo vrijeme|date=2 February 2013|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 32 miners were sentenced to death and 10 other miners were penalized with prison time ranging from 1–15 months.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Aftermath and legacy==
The rebellion has been called one of the most important historical events in the [[former Yugoslavia]] and has remained an example of class struggle against injustice and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abrasmedia.info/content/husinska-buna-dan-rudara-bosne-i-hercegovine-video|title=Husinska buna - Dan rudara Bosne i Hercegovine|publisher=Abras Media||accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfQEAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|title=Bosnian Muslims in the Second World War|p=125|publisher=|date=1 February 2014|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[steles]] of the victims installed in the municipal park of Husino testify still today to that dark time in the recent history of the village. A monument to memorialize the Husino miners was erected in 1956, showing a miner dropping his pick for a rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/world/europe/roots-of-bosnian-protests-lie-in-peace-accords-of-1995.html?hpw&amp;rref=world|title=Roots of Bosnian Protests Lie in Peace Accords of 1995|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=14 February 2014|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[SFR Yugoslavia]], 21 December was celebrated as ''Miners' Day'' throughout the country, because of the Husino Uprising. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhreporter.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4561:foto-21-decembar-dan-rudara&amp;catid=30:bh&amp;Itemid=168|title=21. decembar - Dan rudara|publisher=BH Reporter|date=21 December 2013|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslon.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16654:rudari-bih-danas-slave-svoj-dan&amp;catid=1:vijesti&amp;Itemid=5|title=Rudari BiH danas slave svoj dan|publisher=RTV Slon|date=21 December 2013|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depo.ba/vijest/26947|title=Sjećanje na Husinsku bunu, najveću pobunu bosanskih rudara|publisher=depo|date=21 December 2010|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Bosnian War]] (1992–95), a boot camp in Tuzla was named ''Husinska buna''.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In February 2014, multiple Bosnian newspapers including ''[[Oslobođenje]]'' called the [[2014 unrest in Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the "new Husino Uprising".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/bosansko-proljece-pocela-je-nova-husinska-buna |title=Bosansko proljeće: Počela je nova Husinska buna |publisher=Oslobođenje |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=15 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223011529/http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/bosansko-proljece-pocela-je-nova-husinska-buna |archivedate=23 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1172334|title=Tuzlanska «nova Husinjska buna»|publisher=Vreme|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/info/komentari.php?nav_id=809277|title=Mediji u BiH: Nova Husinska buna|publisher=b92|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/svijet/314276/Pocela-je-nova-Husinska-buna.html|title='Počela je nova Husinska buna'|publisher=TPortal|date=7 February 2014|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A folk song called ''Konjuh planinom'' (''[[Konjuh (mountain)|Konjuh]] Mountain'') was inspired by the uprising in the Husino village. It was first sung by Pejo Marković, who was killed in 1944 during World War II. Televizija Sarajevo produced a television film about the Husino Uprising called ''Husinska buna'' (''Husino Rebellion'', 1980).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10588">'''Judith Ronnie Goodstein''' (née Koral, born 1939){{r|interview}} is an American [[history of science|historian of science]], [[history of mathematics|historian of mathematics]], [[archivist]], and book author. She worked for many years at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), where she is University Archivist Emeritus.{{r|caltech}}

==Education and career==
Goodstein was born on July 8, 1939, in [[Brooklyn]];{{r|gale}}
both of her parents were college-educated children of Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe, and worked for the city.
She went to [[Erasmus Hall High School]] in Brooklyn,
but left at age 16 to escape its cliquish and competitive atmosphere,
and graduated from [[Brooklyn College]] in 1960
with a bachelor's degree in history.
Her interest in the history of science began at this time, with a graduate-level class she took from [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], as the only undergraduate in the class. Another faculty mentor at Brooklyn College was [[John Hope Franklin]].{{r|interview}}

She became a junior high school teacher in [[Borough Park, Brooklyn]] before
applying with her fiancé, [[David Goodstein]], to graduate schools (she in history, he in physics). On the suggestion of Boyer, she went to the [[University of Washington]], where [[Harry Woolf (historian)|Harry Woolf]] was at the time. She was not admitted with financial aid, but Woolf hired her as an assistant. However, he soon moved to another university.
She worked with a succession of other professors there, including one who promised to block her graduation because she refused to babysit his children,
and successfully defended her Ph.D. in 1968. Her dissertation, ''Chemical Theory and the Nature of Matter'', concerned chemist [[Humphry Davy]], a topic suggested by Satish Kapoor, who also left Washington before she could finish. Her eventual [[doctoral advisor]] was Thomas Hankins.{{r|interview}}

She and her husband moved to Caltech in 1966, where she worked as a teacher again while completing her dissertation, with a year in Rome for her husband's postdoctorate.
She was hired as Institute Archivist by [[Daniel Kevles]] in 1968,{{r|interview}}
also teaching the history of science at [[California State University, Dominguez Hills]] from 1969 to 1973 and later at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].{{r|interview|archivist}}
She became University Archivist in 1995, and retired as University Archivist Emeritus in 2009. She has also worked at Caltech as a faculty associate and lecturer, and was [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] from 1989 to 2003.{{r|caltech}}

The institute was founded in 1998 as Maastricht McLuhan Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/external/maastricht-mcluhan-institute |title=Maastricht McLuhan Institute |publisher=[dcc.ac.uk Digital Curation Centre] |access-date=2015-09-07 |language=en | format=text/html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and renamed to 2004.

The institute explores the "historical effects of new media on the trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (geometry, astronomy, arithmetic and music) - or the arts and sciences - and implications for those effects on knowledge and culture then and today. VMMI proposes to continue these explorations, with a new focus: Knowledge Organization and Cultural Computing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sumscorp.com/ |title=Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute (VMMI) |publisher=Virtual Maastricht McLuhan Institute |access-date=2015-09-07 |language=en | format=text/html}}

{{Historical Christian theology}}
{{Protestantism}}
'''Liberal Christianity''',  also known as '''liberal theology''', covers diverse philosophically and biblically informed religious movements and ideas within [[Christianity]] from the late [[Christianity in the 18th century|18th century]] onward. ''Liberal'' does not refer to [[progressive Christianity]] or to [[liberalism|political liberalism]] but to the philosophical and religious thought that developed and grew as a consequence of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

Liberal Christianity, broadly speaking, is a method of biblical [[hermeneutics]], an undogmatic method of understanding [[God in Christianity|God]] through the use of scripture by applying the same modern hermeneutics used to understand any ancient writings, symbols and scriptures. Liberal Christianity did not originate as a belief structure, and as such was not dependent upon any [[Christian Church|Church]] [[dogma]] or [[creed]]al doctrine. Unlike [[Conservative Christianity (disambiguation)|conservative varieties of Christianity]], liberalism has no unified set of propositional beliefs. Instead, "Liberalism" from the start embraced the methodologies of Enlightenment science, including empirical evidence and the use of reason, as the basis for interpreting the Bible, life, faith and theology.

The word ''liberal'' in liberal Christianity originally denoted a characteristic willingness to interpret scripture according to modern philosophic perspectives (hence the parallel term [[modernism]]){{clarify|date=August 2018}} and modern scientific assumptions, while attempting to achieve the Enlightenment ideal of objective point of view, without preconceived notions of the authority of scripture or the correctness of Church dogma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09212a.htm| title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Liberalism|accessdate=2007-01-27|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal Christians may hold certain beliefs in common with [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], or even [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist Protestantism]].

==Liberal Christian exegesis==
The theology of liberal Christianity was prominent in the [[Biblical criticism]] of the 19th and 20th centuries. The style of [[Bible|Scriptural]] [[hermeneutics]] (interpretation of the Bible) within liberal theology is often characterized as non-propositional. This means that the Bible is not considered a collection of factual statements, but instead an anthology that documents the human authors' beliefs and feelings about God at the time of its writing, authors influenced by their own historical and cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, John Warwick. ''In Defense of Martin Luther.'' Milwaukee: Northwestern, 1970, p. 57. “Luther’s Hermeneutic vs. the New Hermeneutic.” Quoted in http://www.wlsessays.net/authors/W/WestphalConfession/WestphalConfession.PDF  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616163446/http://www.wlsessays.net/authors/W/WestphalConfession/WestphalConfession.PDF |date=June 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, liberal Christian theologians have an [[allegorical interpretation of the Bible]] which emphasizes the moral or other spiritual lessons which can be learned from its stories.

Liberal Christianity was still hard to separate from political liberalism in the last third of the 19th century. Thus, an Irish bishop was sent by papal authority to Quebec in the 1870s to sort out the two. Several ''curés'' had threatened to withhold the sacraments from parishioners who cast votes for [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]]s, and others had preached that to vote for Liberal candidates was a mortal sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Collins|title=The Age of Innocence 1870/1880|publisher=Jack McClelland|isbn=0-919644-19-8|pages=87–88|year=1977|series=Canada's Illustrated Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, self-identified liberal Christians sought to elevate Jesus' [[humanism|humane teachings]] as a standard for a world [[civilization]] freed from [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic traditions]] and traces of [[Hellenistic polytheism|"pagan" belief]] in the [[supernatural]].&lt;ref&gt;Burton L. Mack, ''The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian Origins'' (HarperCollins, 1993), p. 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=mBQNEEJvexcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=%22the+problem+of+miracle+and+myth%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, liberal Christians placed less emphasis on miraculous events associated with the life of Jesus than on his teachings. The effort to remove "[[superstition#Superstition and religion|superstitious]]" elements from Christian faith dates to intellectually reforming Renaissance Christians such as [[Erasmus]] (who compiled the first modern [[Textus Receptus|Greek New Testament]]) in the late 15th and early-to-mid 16th centuries, and, later, the natural-religion view of the [[Deists]], which disavowed any revealed religion or interaction between the Creator and the creation, in the 17–18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Woodhead, "Christianity," in ''Religions in the Modern World'' (Routledge, 2002), pp. 186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=4bUrlnqS4X8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA186-IA4&amp;dq=miracles+%22liberal+christians%22+jesus+OR+christ&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online] and 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate over whether a belief in miracles was mere superstition or essential to accepting the [[Christology|divinity of Christ]] constituted a crisis within the 19th-century church, for which theological compromises were sought.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Imagining Progressive Religion 1805–1900'', edited by Gary J. Dorrien (Westminster John Knox Press, 2001), ''passim'', search [https://books.google.com/books?id=L50mveyi6WoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=miracles+%22liberal+christians%22+jesus+OR+christ&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 miracles.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to account for miracles through scientific or rational explanation were mocked even at the turn of the 19th–20th century.&lt;ref&gt;F.J. Ryan, ''Protestant Miracles: High Orthodox and Evangelical Authority for the Belief in Divine Interposition in Human Affairs'' (Stockton, California, 1899), p. 78 [https://books.google.com/books?id=N5A-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22liberal+Christians%22+intitle:Protestant+intitle:Miracles&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.] Full text [https://books.google.com/books?id=N5A-AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:Protestant+intitle:Miracles&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES downloadable.]&lt;/ref&gt; A belief in the authenticity of miracles was one of five tests established in 1910 by the [[Presbyterian Church]] to distinguish true [[belief|believers]] from false [[creed|professors of faith]] such as "'liberal' Christians."&lt;ref&gt;Dan P. McAdams, ''The Redemptive Self: Stories Americans Live By'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 164 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKsMZxwux7wC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=miracles+%22liberal+christians%22+jesus+OR+christ&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many liberals prefer to read Jesus' miracles as [[metaphor]]ical narratives for understanding the power of God.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Marie Brandom, "The Role of Language in Religious Education," in ''Learning to Teach Religious Education in the Secondary School: A Companion to School Experience'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 76 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2RDl15wDdYYC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22liberal+Christians+who+view+the+miracles+as+purely+symbolic+a+metaphor%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Not all theologians with liberal inclinations reject the possibility of miracles, but many reject the [[polemic]]ism that denial or affirmation entails.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity, 1900-1950'', edited by Gary J. Dorrien (Westminster John Knox Press, 2003), ''passim'', search [https://books.google.com/books?id=rfV6FmMFzdoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=miracles+intitle:the+intitle:making+intitle:of+intitle:American+intitle:liberal+intitle:theology&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0 miracles], especially p. 413; on Ames, p. 233 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rfV6FmMFzdoC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;dq=miracles+intitle:the+intitle:making+intitle:of+intitle:American+intitle:liberal+intitle:theology&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA233,M1 online]; on Niebuhr, p. 436 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rfV6FmMFzdoC&amp;pg=PA423&amp;dq=miracles+intitle:the+intitle:making+intitle:of+intitle:American+intitle:liberal+intitle:theology&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA436,M1 online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, liberal Christian theologians often reject traditional Christian teaching on subjects such as the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, and the authority of Scripture.

==Influence in the United States==
Liberal Christianity was most influential with [[Mainline Protestant]] churches in the early 20th century, when proponents believed the changes it would bring would be the future of the Christian church. Its greatest and most influential manifestation was the Christian [[Social Gospel]], whose most influential spokesman was the American Baptist [[Walter Rauschenbusch]]. Rauschenbusch identified four institutionalized spiritual evils in American culture (which he identified as traits of "supra-personal entities", organizations capable of having moral agency): these were [[individualism]], [[capitalism]], [[nationalism]] and [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenbusch, ''A Theology for the Social Gospel'', 1917.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other subsequent theological movements within the U.S. Protestant mainline included political [[liberation theology]], philosophical forms of [[postmodern Christianity]], and such diverse theological influences as [[Christian existentialism]] (originating with [[Søren Kierkegaard]]&lt;ref&gt;"Concluding Unscientific Postscript", authored [[pseudonym]]ously as Johannes Climacus, 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; and including other theologians and scholars such as [[Rudolf Bultmann]]&lt;ref&gt;''History of Synoptic Tradition''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Tillich]] &lt;ref&gt;''The Courage to Be''.&lt;/ref&gt;) and even conservative movements such as [[neo-evangelicalism]], [[neo-orthodoxy]], and [[paleo-orthodoxy]]. [[Dean M. Kelley]], a liberal sociologist, was commissioned in the early 1970s to study the problem, and he identified a potential reason for the decline of the liberal churches: what was seen by some as excessive politicization of the Gospel, and especially their apparent tying of the Gospel with Left-Democrat/progressive political causes.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Dean M. (1972) ''Why Conservative Churches are Growing''&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s and 2000s saw a resurgence of non-doctrinal, theological work on biblical [[exegesis]] and theology, exemplified by figures such as [[Marcus Borg]], [[John Dominic Crossan]], [[John Shelby Spong]],&lt;ref&gt;Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Armstrong]] and [[Scotty McLennan]].

===Anglican and Protestant===
*[[Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher]] (1768&amp;ndash;1834), often called the "father of [[liberal theology]]," he claimed that religious experience was [[introspection|introspective]], and that the most true understanding of God consisted of "a sense of absolute dependence".&lt;ref&gt;Alister McGrath. ''Christian Theology: An Introduction''. 5th rev. ed. Wiley, 2011. Look in the index for "Schleiermacher" or "absolute dependence" and see them nearly always juxtaposed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bultmann then states the thesis of his lecture: “The object [&lt;em&gt;Gegenstand&lt;/em&gt;] of theology is God, and the charge against liberal theology is that it has dealt not with God but with human beings.” We see in this piece the maturation of the claim stated in his Eisenach lecture of 1920, namely, that liberal theology fails to reflect on the specific content of Christian faith. In that earlier writing he contrasts the spiritual content of genuine religion with the liberal emphasis on a particular moralistic form.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bultmann was more of an existentialist than a "liberal", as his defense of Jesus' healings in his "History of Synoptic Tradition" makes clear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5752">'''Luis Suárez Fernández''' (born 25 June 1924 in [[Gijón]]) is a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] historian, originally a [[medievalist]], who has extended his studies to include modern and recent history. He belongs to a line of Spanish historians that are in full agreement with [[Francoism]]&lt;ref name="Marcos30052011"/&gt; and by some is named a [[Revisionism (Spain)|revisionist]].&lt;ref&gt;
Terexa Constenla, ''Historiadores contra revisionistas'', [in:] ''El País'' 07.04.12, available [https://elpais.com/cultura/2012/04/07/actualidad/1333817885_831167.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Suárez studied philosophy and literature at the universities of [[University of Oviedo|Oviedo]] and [[University of Valladolid|Valladolid]], receiving his doctorate in history on 16 June 1947 from the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]. In 1955 he obtained a professorship of Pre- and Universal History of Antiquity and the Middle Ages and General Cultural History (''Prehistoria e Historia Universal de las Edades Antigua y Media y de Historia General de la Cultura'') at Valladolid, where he rose to the posts of dean (1963) and rector (1965). As rector he founded the first chair in [[theatre]] at the university. In 1972 the government made him Director General of Universities and Investigation (''Universidades e Investigación'').

In 1975 Suárez took up the chair of medieval history at the recently inaugurated [[Autonomous University of Madrid]]. That same year he became director of the [[Escuela Española en Roma de Arqueología e Historia]] of [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]], a Spanish cultural society in Rome. He had been chief of the medieval studies section since 1956; he was overall director until 1978. Today, Suárez is a [[professor emeritus]] of medieval history in the department of Ancient and Medieval History, Paleography, and Diplomatics (''Historia Antigua, Medieval, Paleografía y Diplomática'') at the Autonomous University.

Politically right-wing in orientation, Suárez has connexions with the ''[[Fundación Francisco Franco]]'', who are alleged to have funded the publication of ''Francisco Franco y su tiempo'' (1984). Suárez is also the current president of the [[Valle de los Caídos|Hermandad del Valle de los Caídos]]. These ties to Francoism have garnered the denunciation of fellow historian [[Javier Tusell]], among others. He authored the entry for Francisco Franco in the 2011 ''[[Diccionario Biográfico Español]]'', published by the [[Real Academia de la Historia]], which has been denounced by historians as being [[Francoist]] propaganda.&lt;ref name="Marcos30052011"&gt;Marcos, J. M. and CORROTO, P. and JAÉN, B. GARCÍA [http://www.publico.es/culturas/379058/los-historiadores-se-alarman-ante-la-hagiografia-de-franco ''Los historiadores se alarman ante la hagiografía de Franco''] in ''Publico'', 30/05/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernández is also an active [[Roman Catholic]] and a member of [[Opus Dei]].

He was elected to ''medalla nº 4'' of the [[Real Academia de la Historia]] on 7 May 1993, he took up his seat on 23 January 1994.&lt;ref name=rah&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rah.es/laAcademia/academicos/luisSuarez.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180407/http://www.rah.es/laAcademia/academicos/luisSuarez.htm |title=D.

{{Redirect|Masonic Hall}}
{{Freemasonry}}
A '''Masonic Temple''' or '''Masonic Hall''' is, within [[Freemasonry]], the room or edifice where a [[Masonic Lodge]] meets. Masonic Temple may also refer to an abstract spiritual goal and the conceptual ritualistic space of a meeting.

==Development and history==
[[File:Goose and Gridiron.jpg|thumb|220px|Goose and Gridiron tavern, where the [[United Grand Lodge of England]] was founded in 1717]]
In the early years of Freemasonry, from the 17th through the 18th centuries, it was most common for Masonic Lodges to form their Masonic Temples either in private homes or in the private rooms of public taverns or halls which could be regularly rented out for Masonic purposes. This was less than ideal, however; meeting in public spaces required the transportation, set-up and dismantling of increasingly elaborate paraphernalia every time the lodge met.  Lodges began to look for permanent facilities, dedicated purely to Masonic use.

== First Temples ==
The first Masonic Hall was built in 1765 in [[Marseille]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, G: ''Use and Abuse of Freemasonry'', page 165., 1783.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later in May, 1775, the cornerstone of what would come to be known as [[Freemasons' Hall, London|Freemasons' Hall]], London, was laid in solemn ceremonial form spurring a trend that would continue to present day.&lt;ref name="Mackey, A page 314"&gt;Mackey, A: ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: And Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the Whole Range of Arts, Sciences and Literature As Connected With the Institution'', page 314. Moss &amp; Co., 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most lodges, however, could not afford to build their own facilities and instead rented rooms above commercial establishments (hotels, banks and opera houses were the most common landlords).&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Masonic Temples'', pp.121–123&lt;/ref&gt;  With permanent facilities, the term "Masonic Temple" began to be applied not just to the symbolic formation of the Temple, but also to the physical place in which this took place.  It began to be applied to the lodge rooms themselves. (A similar transfer took place with the term ''Masonic Lodge'', which in ritual terms refers to the people assembled and not to the place of assemblage.  In common usage, however, it began to be applied to the place as well as the people.)

[[File:Belleville Masonic Temple.JPG|thumb|The Belleville Masonic Temple, [[Belleville, Michigan]]. An example of a smaller Masonic Temple]]
In the latter half of the nineteenth century, as the popularity of Freemasonry grew, more and more lodges began to have the financial wherewithal to own their own premises.  In many locations this was spurred by changing tax laws that allowed fraternal and benevolent societies to own property and lease space without being taxed as commercial landlords.  In larger towns and cities, where there were many lodges, it became economical for groups of lodges to band together and either purchase or build their own buildings with both commercial space and lodge rooms in the same building.  The rents from the commercial space going to the upkeep of the lodge rooms.  This was especially true in cities where the Grand Lodge met.&lt;ref&gt;Moore; ''Masonic Temples''; pp 124–129&lt;/ref&gt; These buildings, too, began to be referred to as "Masonic Temples", "Masonic Halls", or "Masonic Lodges".&lt;ref name="Mackey, A page 314"/&gt;

In smaller towns the trend was different.  Here, instead of building large impressive buildings in the hopes of attracting multiple commercial tenants, the local lodges tended to build more modest structures, with space for a single tenant, a small meeting hall for public rental, or no rental space at all.  In addition, especially in the United States, lodges founded in established communities would purchase buildings that had historic value as lodge members wanted their new lodge to be associated with the history of their local community like their older counterparts.  Thus they looked to purchase old churches, schools and the homes of community founders, which they would convert into lodge meeting space.  These too began to be known as "Masonic Temples".&lt;ref&gt;Moore; Masonic Temples; pp.129 – 131&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heyday and decline==
[[File:Detroit Masonic Temple - Detroit Michigan.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Detroit Masonic Temple]], [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The world's largest Masonic Temple.]]
[[File:Santacruzmasontemple03.jpg|thumb|[[Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] ([[Spain]]).]]
The 1920s marked a [[Golden age of fraternalism|heyday]] for Freemasonry, especially in the United States.  By 1930, over 12% of the adult male population of the United States were members of the fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbert, Mark A.; ''American Freemasons, Three Centuries of Building Communities''; New York University Press, New York, 2005. p.168&lt;/ref&gt;  The dues generated by such numbers allowed state Grand Lodges to build on truly monumental scales.  Typical of the era are the [[Dayton Masonic Center]] and [[Detroit Masonic Temple]] (the largest Masonic Temple in the world).

The [[Great Depression]] hit Freemasonry as hard as it hit the rest of the world, and both local Lodges and Grand Lodges turned away from erecting buildings and towards helping those in need. [[World War II]] saw resources focused on supporting the War effort. While there was something of a resurgence in the 1950s, the anti-establishment attitudes of the 1960s and 1970s affected membership numbers even further. Lodges began to close and merge, with those that could no longer afford to maintain their buildings selling these to developers. Many Masonic Temples and Halls were converted to non-masonic uses including completely commercial spaces, hotels, night clubs, and even condominiums.  Many lodges have returned to renting rooms, and there is even a small movement calling for Freemasonry to return to its roots and open their Masonic Temples in taverns.

==Naming conventions==
When Freemasons first began building dedicated structures the more frequently used term for a Masonic Temple was Masonic Hall. This began to change in the mid 19th Century when the larger Masonic Halls most often found in major cities began to be named with the term Masonic Temple. As time went on more and more American buildings began using the name Masonic Temple regardless of their size or location.&lt;ref name="Mackey, A page 314"/&gt; In US Freemasonry today the term Masonic Hall is experiencing a revival motivated in part by the public misconception that Masons conduct a form of religious worship in their Temples.&lt;ref name="Hodapp, Christopher 2005. p.95"&gt;Hodapp, Christopher. Freemasons for Dummies. Indianapolis: Wiley, 2005. p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Though Masonic Temples in their most basic definition serve as a home to a Masonic Lodge they can also serve many other purposes as well. Smaller Masonic Temples will often consist of nothing more than a meeting room with a kitchen/dining area attached.  Larger Masonic Temples can contain multiple meeting rooms, concert halls, libraries, and museums as well as non-masonic commercial and office space.&lt;ref&gt;Lundberg, Alex and Greg Kowalski (2006). Detroit's Masonic Temple. Arcadia Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7385-4034-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:WashDCMasonic2007.jpg|thumb|The Masonic [[House of the Temple]] of the Scottish Rite, Washington, DC, [[John Russell Pope]], architect, 1911–15, another scholarly version.]]
Since their inception the proper design of a Masonic Temple has been a serious subject debate among Masonic scholars. And because of that ongoing debate a number of different standards have been proposed throughout time.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, A: ''Encyclopedia of Freemasonry: And Its Kindred Sciences Comprising the Whole Range of Arts, Sciences and Literature As Connected With the Institution'', page 315. Moss &amp; Co., 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite attempts at standardization, Masonic Temples often vary widely in design.  Even the layout of the lodge room will differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

== Authorship ==
The first historian to mention Movses' work was medieval Armenian legal scholar [[Mkhitar Gosh]], referring to him as "Movses Daskhurantsi."&lt;ref name=Hacikyan&gt;{{cite book

A later historian, [[Kirakos Gandzaketsi]], author of the ''History of Armenia'', referred to a statement in the ''History'' itself, to attribute the name of the author as ''Movses Kaghankatvatsi''.  The statement in question (Book II, ch. 11) says:
{{cquote|When the enemy became aware of what had happened, they pursued them and overtook a group of them at the foot of the mountain opposite the large village of Kaghankatuik, which is in the same province of Uti where I too am from.}}

Movses narrates the [[Khazar invasion of Transcaucasia]] and other events up to the seventh century in Book I and II of ''History''. 
Book III of his ''History'' differs from the previous ones in style of writing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and date. It deals with the [[Caspian expeditions of the Rus]] and their conquest of [[Partav]] in the tenth century.
Because of such time lapse and difference in style, attribution of the work to a single author seems doubtful. For this reason it has been common to assume two consecutive authors or editors, 
''Kaghankatvatsi'' (7th century) as the author of Books I and II, and ''Daskhurantsi'' (tenth century) as the editors of Kaghankatvatsi's text and the author of Book III.&lt;ref name="Hacikyan"/&gt;

{{Campaignbox Nigerian Civil War}}

The '''Nigerian Civil War''', commonly known as the '''Biafran War''' (6 July 1967&amp;nbsp;– 15 January 1970), was a war fought between the government of Nigeria and the [[Secession|secessionist state]] of [[Biafra]]. Biafra represented nationalist aspirations of the [[Igbo people]], whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the Northern-dominated federal government. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of [[Nigeria]] from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|a military coup]], [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|a counter-coup]] and [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|persecution of Igbo]] living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|oil production]] in the [[Niger Delta]] played a vital strategic role.

Within a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, capturing coastal oil facilities and the city of [[Port Harcourt]]. The blockade imposed during the ensuing stalemate led to severe famine. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/ice/BIAFRA.HTM|title=ICE Case Studies: The Biafran War|last=|first=|date=1997|website=American University: ICE Case Studies|publisher=American University|access-date=6 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214103207/http://www1.american.edu/ted/ice/biafra.htm|archivedate=14 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1968, images of malnourished and starving Biafran children saturated the mass media of [[Western countries]]. The plight of the starving Biafrans became a ''[[cause célèbre]]'' in foreign countries, enabling a significant rise in the funding and prominence of international [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs). Britain and the [[Soviet Union]] were the main supporters of the Nigerian government in [[Lagos]], while [[France]], [[Israel]] and some other countries supported Biafra. France and Israel provided weapons to both combatants.

== Background ==

=== Ethnic division ===
The civil war can be connected to the British colonial amalgamation in 1914 of [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern Nigeria]]. Intended for better administration due to the close proximity of these protectorates, the change did not account for the great difference in the cultures and religions of the peoples in each area. After the amalgamation, oil was discovered in Eastern Nigeria (now Southern Nigeria). Competition for its associated wealth led to the struggle for control amongst the regions. As southern Nigeria was not as united as the north, it was disadvantaged in the power struggle.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chibuike|first1=Uche|title=Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=49|pages=111–135|jstor=40206616|doi=10.1017/S0021853708003393|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1966 Northern officers staged a counter-coup to revenge on the easterners for the targeting their own political leaders in the first coup; Lt. Col. [[Yakubu Gowon]] emerged as the head of state. During his tenure, killing of Easterners in the north continued; several retaliatory actions took place, eventually resulting in the Biafran war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ATOFARATI|first1=ABUBAKAR .A.|title=The Nigerian Civil War: Causes, Strategies, And Lessons Learnt|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1992/AAA.htm|website=Global Security|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nigeria gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1960, but remained in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], composed of 53 former UK colonies. In 1960, Nigeria had a population of 60 million people, made up of more than 300 differing ethnic and cultural groups. More than fifty years earlier, the United Kingdom had carved an area out of West Africa containing hundreds of different ethnic groups and unified it, calling it Nigeria. The three predominant groups were the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], which formed between 60–70% of the population in the southeast; the [[Hausa-Fulani]], which formed about 65% of the population in the northern part of the territory; and the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], which formed about 75% of the population in the southwestern part. Although these groups have their own homelands, by the 1960s, the people were dispersed across Nigeria, with all three ethnic groups represented substantially in major cities. When the war broke out in 1967, there were still 5,000 Igbos in Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria–Biafra Conflict'' (1971), pp. 32–33. "The Ibo like the Hausa and Yoruba, are found in hundreds in all towns and cities throughout the Federation. Even at the period of the Civil War, they numbered more than five thousand in Lagos alone."&lt;/ref&gt;

The semi-[[feudal]] and [[Islamic]] Hausa-Fulani in the North were traditionally ruled by a feudal, conservative Islamic hierarchy consisting of [[Emir]]s who, in turn, owed their allegiance to a supreme [[Sultan]]. This Sultan was regarded as the source of all political power and religious authority.

The Yoruba political system in the southwest, like that of the Hausa-Fulani, also consisted of a series of monarchs, the [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]. The Yoruba monarchs, however, were less [[autocratic]] than those in the North. The political and social system of the Yoruba accordingly allowed for greater [[upward mobility]], based on acquired rather than inherited wealth and title.

In contrast to the two other groups, the Igbo in the southeast lived mostly in autonomous, democratically organised communities, although there were ''eze'' or monarchs in many of the ancient cities, such as the [[Kingdom of Nri]]. In its zenith the Kingdom controlled most of Igbo land, including influence on the [[Anioma people]], [[Arochukwu]] (which controlled [[slavery]] in Igbo), and [[Onitsha]] land. Unlike the other two regions, decisions within the Igbo communities were made by a general assembly in which men and women participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |id=Zm7sWUbDWakC |page=25 |title=Ijeaku, Nnamdi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing political systems among these three peoples reflected and produced divergent customs and values. The Hausa-Fulani commoners, having contact with the political system only through a village head designated by the Emir or one of his subordinates, did not view political leaders as amenable to influence. Political decisions were to be submitted to. As with all other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] religious and political systems, leadership positions were given to persons willing to be subservient and loyal to superiors. A chief function of this political system in this context was to maintain conservative values, which caused many Hausa-Fulani to view economic and social innovation as subversive or sacrilegious.

In contrast to the Hausa-Fulani, the Igbo often participated directly in the decisions which affected their lives. They had a lively awareness of the political system and regarded it as an instrument for achieving their personal goals. Status was acquired through the ability to arbitrate disputes that might arise in the village, and through acquiring rather than inheriting wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria–Biafra Conflict'' (1971), pp. 34–35. "In principle, authority in the local community was formerly exercised by a body of elders which met in council presided over by the head of the senior lineage and included heads of other lineage and sub-lineage. Councils were concerned mainly with offences, religion and public issues likely to break up the solidarity of the group, village or town. Men of influence, particularly men of wealth, who held titles, and members of local Ozo and Eze lodges, frequently dominated the lineage heads, but there was no formal concentration of authority in a single individual. Among the Ibo, even where there was no title taking, a man of wealth could attain considerable political power, apart from any authority derived from his place in a kinship system. […] New laws which affected the community required the consent of the community concerned as expressed at a public meeting."&lt;/ref&gt; The Igbo had been substantially victimized in the Atlantic slave trade; in the year 1790 it was reported that of 20,000 people sold each year from [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], 16,000 were Igbo.&lt;ref&gt;Olawoyin, ''Historical Analysis of Nigeria–Biafra Conflict'' (1971), p. 30. "Bonny, which became one of the principal slave markets on the coast, was largely peopled by Ibo. In 1790, according to Adams, 16,000 out of the 20,000 slaves sold there annually were Ibos. The last British slaver sailed from Bonny in 1808, though the trade continued until 1841."&lt;/ref&gt; With their emphasis upon social achievement and political participation, the Igbo adapted to and challenged colonial rule in innovative ways.

These tradition-derived differences were perpetuated and perhaps enhanced by the [[Colonial Nigeria|British system of colonial rule in Nigeria]]. In the North, the British found it convenient to [[indirect rule|rule indirectly]] through the Emirs, thus perpetuating rather than changing the indigenous authoritarian political system. Christian [[missionaries]] were excluded from the North, and the area thus remained virtually closed to European [[cultural imperialism]]. By contrast the richest of the Igbo often sent their sons to British universities, thinking to prepare them to work with the British. During the ensuing years, the Northern Emirs maintained their traditional political and religious institutions, while reinforcing their social structure. At the time of independence in 1960, the North was by far the most underdeveloped area in Nigeria. It had an English literacy rate of 2%, as compared to 19.2% in the East (literacy in Ajami (local languages in Arabic script), learned in connection with religious education, was much higher). The West also enjoyed a much higher literacy level, as it was the first part of the country to have contact with western education, and established a free primary education program under the pre-independence Western Regional Government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Biafra Story'', Frederick Forsyth, Leo Cooper, 2001 {{ISBN|0-85052-854-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, ''A New Entry into the World Oil Market'' (2013), p. 108. "The North had developed very differently from the rest of the country, for it lagged far behind the South in terms of European-educated population. Hence, Northerners feared that incorporation into an independent and unitary Nigerian State molded according to European standards would cause their cultural and political submission to the South."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South, the missionaries rapidly introduced Western forms of education. Consequently, the Yoruba were the first group in Nigeria to adopt Western bureaucratic social norms. They made up the first classes of African civil servants, doctors, lawyers, and other technicians and professionals.

In Igbo areas, missionaries were introduced at a later date because of British [[Anglo-Aro War|difficulty in establishing firm control]] over the highly autonomous Igbo communities.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Chapman, "Civil War in Nigeria," ''Midstream'', Feb 1968&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Igbo people actively took to Western education, and they overwhelmingly came to adopt Christianity. Population pressure in the Igbo homeland, combined with aspirations for monetary wages, drove thousands of Igbos to other parts of Nigeria in search of work. By the 1960s, Igbo political culture was more unified and the region relatively prosperous, with tradesmen and literate elites active not just in the traditionally Igbo South, but throughout Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver, Roland and Atmore, Anthony. ''Africa Since 1800''. 1994, page 270&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, the ethnic and religious differences between Northerners and the Igbo had combined with additional stratification by virtue of education and economic class.&lt;ref name=Jeyifo2013 /&gt;

=== Politics and economics of federalism ===

The British colonial ideology that divided Nigeria into three regions—North, West and East—exacerbated the already well-developed economic, political, and social differences among Nigeria's different ethnic groups. The country was divided in such a way that the North had a slightly higher population than the other two regions combined. On this basis the Northern Region was allocated a majority of the seats in the Federal Legislature established by the colonial authorities. Within each of the three regions the dominant ethnic groups, the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, respectively formed political parties that were largely regional and based on ethnic allegiances: the [[Northern People's Congress]] (NPC) in the North; the [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] in the West (AG); and the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) in the East. These parties were not exclusively homogeneous in terms of their ethnic or regional make-up; the disintegration of Nigeria resulted largely from the fact that these parties were primarily based in one region and one tribe. To simplify matters, we will refer to them here as the Hausa, Yoruba, and Ibo-based; or Northern, Western and Eastern parties.

The basis of modern Nigeria formed in 1914, when Britain amalgamated the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] protectorates. Beginning with the Northern Protectorate, the British implemented a system of [[indirect rule]] of which they exerted influence through alliances with local forces. This system worked so well, Colonial Governor [[Frederick Lugard]] successfully lobbied to extend it to the Southern Protectorate through amalgamation. In this way, a foreign and hierarchical system of governance was imposed on the Igbos (along with many other smaller groups in the South.)&lt;ref name=Ejiogu2013&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. C. |last=Ejiogu |title=Chinua Achebe on Biafra: An Elaborate Deconstruction |journal=[[Journal of Asian and African Studies]] |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=653–670 |year=2013 |doi=10.1177/0021909613506457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectuals began to agitate for greater rights and independence.&lt;ref&gt;Olawoyin, "Historical Analysis of Nigeria–Biafra Conflict" (1971), pp. 53–73. "[…] there was a tendency for British officials to build social barriers between themselves and Westernised Nigerians which, on the one hand, gave strength to nationalistic paroxysms. The Westernised Nigerian was an isolated individual, possibly because he was seen as a potential rival. He thus became a creature left to seek his own salvation. All that was left for him then was to seek expression in nationalistic organisations."&lt;/ref&gt; The size of this intellectual class increased significantly in the 1950s, with the massive expansion of the national education program.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s and 1950s the Igbo and Yoruba parties were in the forefront of the fight for independence from Britain. They also wanted an independent Nigeria to be organized into several small states so that the conservative North would not dominate the country. Northern leaders, fearful that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more Westernized elites in the South, preferred the perpetuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority. Igbo and Yoruba leaders, anxious to obtain an independent country at all costs, accepted the Northern demands.

However, it would be wrong to state that the two Southern regions were politically or philosophically aligned and there was already discordance between the two Southern political parties.
Firstly, the AG favoured a loose confederacy of regions in the emergent Nigerian nation whereby each region would be in total control of its own distinct territory. The status of Lagos was a sore point for the AG which did not want Lagos, a Yoruba town which was at that time the Federal Capital and seat of national government to be designated as the Capital of Nigeria if it meant loss of Yoruba Suzerainty. The AG insisted that Lagos, a Yoruba city situated in Western Nigeria must be completely recognised as a Yoruba town without any loss of identity, control or autonomy by the Yoruba. Contrary to this position, the NCNC was anxious to declare Lagos, by virtue of it being the "Federal Capital Territory" as "no man's land" - a declaration which as could be expected angered the AG which offered to help fund the development of other territory in Nigeria as "Federal Capital Territory" and then threatened secession from Nigeria if it didn't get its way. The threat of secession by the AG was tabled, documented and recorded in numerous constitutional conferences, including the constitutional conference held in London in 1954 with the demand that a right of secession be enshrined in the constitution of the emerging Nigerian nation to allow any part of the emergent nation to opt out of Nigeria, should the need arise.(Author(s): Tekena N. TamunoSource: The Journal of Modern African Studies, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Dec., 1970), pp.&amp;nbsp;563–584 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Separatist Agitations in Nigeria since 1914|first=Tekena N.|last=Tamuno|publisher=|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=8|issue=4|pages=563–584|doi=10.1017/s0022278x00023909|jstor=159090|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) This proposal for inclusion of right of secession by the regions in independent Nigeria by the AG was rejected and resisted by NCNC which vehemently argued for a tightly bound united/unitary structured nation because it viewed the provision of a secession clause as detrimental to the formation of a Unitary Nigerian state. In the face of sustained opposition by the NCNC delegates, later joined by the NPC and backed by threats to view maintenance of the inclusion of secession by the AG as treasonable by the British, the AG was forced to renounce its position of inclusion of the right of secession a part of the Nigerian constitution. It should be noted that, had such a provision been made in the Nigerian constitution, later events which led to the Nigerian/Biafran civil war would have been avoided. The pre-independence alliance between the NCNC and the NPC against the aspirations of the AG would later set the tone for political governance of independent Nigeria by the NCNC/NPC and lead to disaster in later years in Nigeria.

&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 3. "On 31st March 1953, Anthony Enaharo of the Action Group (AG) tabled a motion in the House of Representatives in Lagos which called for independence in 1956. The National Congress of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), which had earlier committed itself to a 1956 independence date, during its annual party convention held in Kano in August 1951, supported the Enahoro motion, while the Northern People's Congress (NPC) rejected it out of hand. Instead, the NPC sought an amendment to the motion and advocated independence 'as soon as practicable.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Northern–Southern tension manifested on 1 May 1953, as [[Kano riot of 1953|fighting in the Northern city of Kano]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk-Greene, ''The Genesis of the Nigerian Civil War'' (1975), p. 9. "It slipped several more notches after the vulgarity of the Lagos mob - &lt;u&gt;con mutunci&lt;/u&gt;, personal humiliation through public abuse, is to the Hausa a worse offense than physical assault – and the Kano riots. If 1953 was to become one of the Biafran points of no return because of the slaughter of Ibos in Kano, it had never been anything less in the NPC demonology of the South because of their treatment by politicians and proletariat alike in Lagos."&lt;/ref&gt; The political parties tended to focus on building power in their own regions, resulting in an incoherent and disunified dynamic in the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk-Greene, ''The Genesis of the Nigerian Civil War'' (1975), p. 12. "Once (a) the principle of federalism (b) the quality of Nigerian federalism (loose and lopsided, the very negation of classic Whearism) had been agreed on by the Nigerian leaders, the direction from 1954 onwards was progressively towards the construction of impregnable bases of power within each Region. Nearly every move can be analysed in terms of increasing the rigidity of the Regional cores and inhibiting the effective extension of the central authority."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the British [[Federalism in Nigeria|divided]] the Southern Region into the [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] and the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]]. Each government was entitled to collect royalties from resources extracted within its area. This changed in 1956 when Shell-BP found large petroleum deposits in the Eastern region. A Commission led by Jeremy Raisman and [[Ronald Tress]] determined that resource royalties would now enter a "Distributable Pools Account" with the money split between different parts of government (50% to region of origin, 20% to federal government, 30% to other regions).&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure continuing influence, the British promoted unity in the Northern bloc and discord among and within the two Southern regions, as well as the creation of a new [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Mid-Western Region]] in an area with oil potential.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), pp. 116–117. "In the struggle over the national wealth, control depended on who dominated the government at the centre. With Southern Nigeria virtually split into two, the North, which was now by far the largest region, had the upper hand. British Colonial Officers also encouraged it to promote the philosophy of one North in order to maintain its political control. […] In an attempt to weaken the opposition the ruling coalition (NPC and NCNC) sponsored a crisis within the Western Region parliament culminating in the declaration of a State of Emergency in the Region in 1962. In 1963, the Western Region was further split into two. This effectively separated the core Yoruba group from the minorities. Interestingly, the new Mid-Western Region, dominated by minorities also had prospects for oil exploration."&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution of 1946 also proclaimed that "The entire property in and control of all mineral oils, in, under, or upon any lands, in Nigeria, and of all rivers, streams, and watercourses throughout Nigeria, is and shall be vested in, the Crown."&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain profited significantly from a fivefold rise in Nigerian exports amidst the postwar economic boom.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20. "But Nigeria was still a British colony, with a political economy that existed principally to serve British interests."&lt;/ref&gt;

== First Republic ==
Nigeria's [[First Nigerian Republic|First Republic]] came into being on 1 October 1960. The first prime minister of Nigeria, [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]], was a northerner and co-founder of the Northern People's Congress. He formed an alliance with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons party, and its popular nationalist leader [[Nnamdi Azikiwe|Nnamdi "Zik" Azikiwe]], who became [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor General]] and then President. The Yoruba-aligned Action Group, the third major party, played the opposition role.&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, "A New Entry into the World Oil Market" (2013), pp. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers became increasingly aggrieved by low wages and bad conditions, especially when they compared their lot to the lifestyles of politicians in Lagos. Most wage earners lived in the Lagos area, and many lived in overcrowded dangerous housing. Labour activity including strikes intensified in 1963, culminating in a nationwide general strike in June 1964. Strikers disobeyed an ultimatum to return to work and at one point were dispersed by riot police. Eventually, they did win wage increases. The strike included people from all ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, ''Class, Ethnicity and Democracy in Nigeria'' (1988), chapter 6: "The 1964 General Strike" (pp. 162–189).&lt;/ref&gt; Retired Brigadier General H. M. Njoku later wrote that the general strike heavily exacerbated tensions between the Army and ordinary civilians, and put pressure on the Army to take action against a government which was widely perceived as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Nkoku, ''A Tragedy Without Heroes'' (1987), p. 4. "The general resentment against a corrupt and stagnant regime continued. The Army as part of the population was not sympathetic to the government. Workers were urging the soldiers, whom they saw guarding the strategic places, to overthrow the government. Some angry workers spat on the troops. / Markets close to Army barracks purposely raised prices of foodstuffs in order to infuriate the troops. […] It was feared that the workers would overthrow the government. They could have very easily done it had they realised their strength and remained united. At the height of the strike, only one platoon – thirty men – was the Army reserve, and it had no transports and no wireless sets. The army was in a state of near mutiny."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nigerian parliamentary election, 1964|1964 elections]], which involved heavy campaigning all year, brought ethnic and regional divisions into focus. Resentment of politicians ran high and many campaigners feared for their safety while touring the country. The Army repeatedly deployed to [[Benué State|Tiv Division]], killing hundreds and arresting thousands of [[Tiv people]] agitating for self-determination.&lt;ref name=Diamond1988chapter7&gt;Diamond, ''Class, Ethnicity and Democracy in Nigeria'' (1988), chapter 7: "The 1964 Federal Election Crisis" (pp. 190–247).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 36. "In the middle belt, the Tiv were in open revolt against the NPC government in Kaduna. Well-organised groups of the opposition UMBC attacked opponents, and easily identifiable state officials and institutions, especially those associated with law and order. Scores of police, members of the judiciary and tax officials were killed, while several police posts, courthouses and local government establishments were destroyed during the campaign. Altogether hundreds of civilians died during the emergency, many of whom had been killed by the police during a scorched earth counter-insurgency operation. While the deployment of the military ultimately suppressed the uprising, the political demands for Tiv self-government went unheeded."&lt;/ref&gt;

Widespread reports of fraud tarnished the election's legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Diamond1988chapter7 /&gt; Westerners especially resented the political domination of the Northern People's Congress, many of whose candidates ran unopposed in the election. Violence spread throughout the country and some began to flee the North and West, some to [[Benin|Dahomey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 36–40. "A virtual state of civil war prevailed as rival political groups attacked each other, killing, maiming and burning. Thousands of people fled to the neighboring Benin Republic (then called Dahomey) into exile."&lt;/ref&gt; The apparent domination of the political system by the North, and the chaos breaking out across the country, motivated elements within the military to consider decisive action.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 40. "There was now a popular and mass opposition to a regime which the majority of the west's electorate felt had been imposed on them by the NPC. / There were also rumblings in the military over the violence in the west, and most importantly the Balwea government's inability to deal with the situation. For quite a while, but particularly since the December 1964 bogus elections, sections of the middle-ranking officer corps had been extremely incensed by the larceny and absolutism of the NPC rule, some of whose features had also affected the military itself in various fundamental ways. The fact that Nigeria appeared to be stuck indefinitely in an NPC, north-dominated political quagmire provided the impetus for the military coup d'état that occurred in the country in January 1966."&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain maintained its economic hold on the country, through continued alliance and reinforcement of the Northern bloc. In addition to Shell-BP, the British reaped profits from mining and commerce. The British-owned [[United Africa Company of Nigeria|United Africa Company]] alone controlled 41.3% of all Nigeria's foreign trade.&lt;ref&gt;"Thus northern privilege and political hegemony became the dual ''internal'' lever with which Britain used in reinforcing its control of Nigeria's economy in the early years of independence. On the eve of the coup, Britain's success story was phenomenal. Apart from South Africa, Nigeria was the site of Britain's highest economic and industrial investment in Africa with a total worth of £1.5 billion. The British government controlled a near-50 per cent shares in Shell-BP (the predominant oil prospecting company in Nigeria) and 60 per cent shares in the Amalgamated Tin Mining (Nigeria) Ltd., a major prospecting tin, cobalt and iron ore mining company. In the non-mining sector of the economy, John Holt and Company, Ltd., owned by a British family, was one of the two largest in the country, with branches located in the principal towns and cities. The United Africa Company (UAC), another British enterprise, accounted for about 41.3 per cent of Nigeria's entire import and export trade."&lt;/ref&gt; At 516,000 barrels per day, Nigeria had become the tenth biggest oil exporter in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, "A New Entry into the World Oil Market" (2013), pp. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military coups ===

On 15 January 1966, Major [[Emmanuel Ifeajuna]] and other junior Army officers (mostly majors and captains) attempted [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|a coup d'état]]. The two major political leaders of the north, the prime Minister, Sir [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] and the Premier of the northern region, Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]] were executed by Major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Sir Ahmadu Bello's wife and officers of Northern extraction. Meanwhile, the President, Sir [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]], an Igbo, was on an extended vacation in the West Indies. He did not return until days after the coup. There was widespread suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters had tipped him and other Igbo leaders off regarding the impending coup. In addition to the killings of the Northern political leaders, the Premier of the Western region, Ladoke Akintola and Yoruba senior military officers were also killed.
The coup, also referred to as "The Coup of the Five Majors", has been described in some quarters as Nigeria's only revolutionary coup.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Madiebo (1980) ''The Nigerian Revolution and the Nigerian Civil War''; Fourth Dimension Publishers, Enugu.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria's nascent second democracy. Claims of electoral fraud were one of the reasons given by the coup plotters.

This coup was however seen not as a revolutionary coup by other sections of Nigerians, especially in the Northern and Western sections and latter revisioninsts of Nigerian coups, mostly from Eastern part of Nigeria have belatedly maintained to widespread disbelief amongst Western and Southern Nigerians that the majors sought to spring Action Group leader [[Obafemi Awolowo]] out of jail and make him head of the new government. From there, they would dismantle the Northern-dominated power structure. However, their efforts to take power were thwarted by [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], an Igbo and loyalist head of the [[Nigerian Army]], who suppressed coup operations in the South. The majors surrendered, and Aguiyi-Ironsi was declared head of state on 16 January.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 52–55. "In the end though, the majors were not in the position to embark on this political goal. While their 15th January coup succeeded in seizing political control in the north, it failed in the south, especially in the Lagos-Ibadan-Abeokuta military district where loyalist troops led by army commander Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi succeeded in crushing the revolt. Apart from Ifeajuna who fled the country after the collapse of their coup, the other two January Majors, and the rest of the military officers involved in the revolt, later surrendered to the loyalist High Command and were subsequently detained as a federal investigation of the event began."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nigerian Civil War''; Fourth Dimension Publishers, Enugu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aguyi-Ironsi suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament. He then abolished the regional confederated form of government and pursued unitary like policies heitheto favoured by the NCNC, having apparently been influenced by some NCNC political philosophy. He, however, appointed Colonel [[Hassan Katsina]], son of [[Katsina]] emir [[Usman Nagogo]], to govern the Northern Region, indicating some willingness to maintain cooperation with this bloc.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 55. "But perhaps, most importantly, Aguyi-Ironsi's choice of Colonel Hassan Usman Katsina, the son of the powerful emir of Katsina as the governor of the north, was the clearest signal to the north, and the rest of the country, that his government would not undermine the north's two decades of political hegemony in the federation. Aguyi-Ironsi had already said as much in a number of contacts he made with northern leaders, including the Sultan of Sokoto, soon after the failed majors' coup. Although he had no qualms regarding ignoring the West and leaving in jail the leader of the AG (Obafemi Awolowo), he was anxious to reassure the north of the good intentions of his regime, especially in the light of the deaths of Bello and Balewa during the coup attempt."&lt;/ref&gt; He also preferentially released northern politicians from jail (enabling them to plan his forthcoming overthrow).&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 55–56. "In fact to underscore Ironsi's goodwill to the north, the new head of state ordered the release of most northern politicians from detention by February (1966), without a reciprocal gesture to their southern counterparts. The released northerners took up positions in the various local government administration in the emirats and, ironically, had ample opportunity to plan and execute the massacre of Igbo civilians living in the north, first in May, 1966, and later in July 1966, which were coupled with the overthrow and murder of Aguyi-Ironsi himself (ironically enough, soon after Aguyi-Ironsi completed a conference with northern emirs), and scores of Igbo military personnel, and the September–October 1966 phase of the pogrom which brought the grisly tally of Igbo killed to 80,000 – 100,000 and the expulsion of 2 million others from the north and elsewhere in the federation."&lt;/ref&gt; Aguyi-Ironsi rejected a British offer of military support but promised to protect British interests; however … Britain participated in overthrow?&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), p. 56. "Britain had offered to send in troops to support Aguyi-Ironsi and his loyalist forces, after Nzeogwu threatened (on January 16) to march on Lagos and the south, from his Kaduna base, to enforce the control of the January Majors nationwide. While Aguyi-Ironsi discreetly turned down the British offer, he however informed London that its interests in Nigeria, the primary British pre-occupation, would be preserved by his government. This meant that the radical reforms of the Nigerian economy envisaged by the revolting majors, now known by Aguyi-Ironsi and in diplomatic circles in Lagos, would not be implemented. But for the British, the very presence of the Aguyi-Ironsi administration, the fastidious circumstances of its origins notwithstanding, had already breached a cardinal tenet of the post-colonial political order in Nigeria which they had worked so assiduously between 1952–1960 to construct: that political leadership within the country to oversee these enormous British interests should come from the north."&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironsi fatally did not bring the failed plotters to trial as required by then-military law and as advised by most northern and western officers, rather, coup plotters were maintained in the military on full pay and some were even promoted while apparently awaiting trial. The coup, despite its failure and since no repercussion was meted out to coup plotters and since no significant Igbo political leaders were affected was widely perceived as having benefited mostly the Igbo. Most of the known coup plotters were Igbo and the military and political leadership of Western and Northern regions had been largely bloodily eliminated while Eastern military/political leadership was largely untouched. However Ironsi, himself an Igbo, was thought to have made numerous attempts to please Northerners. The other event that also fuelled the so-called "Igbo conspiracy" was the killing of Northern leaders, and the killing of the Brigader Ademulegun's pregnant wife by the coup executioners. Despite the overwhelming contradictions of the coup being executed by mostly Northern soldiers (such as John Atom Kpera, later military governor of [[Benue State]]), the killing of Igbo soldier Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Unegbe by coup executioners, and Ironsi's termination of an Igbo-led coup, the ease by which Ironsi stopped the coup led to suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters planned all along to pave the way for Ironsi to take the reins of power in Nigeria.

&lt;!-- Apparently, Ironsi did succeed in quieting the Western Region, and in the first part of 1966 there were a few months of relatively less violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ekwe-Ekwe, ''The Biafra War'' (1990), pp. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting this out for now pending verification in another source. --&gt;
Colonel [[Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu|Odumegwu Ojukwu]] became military governor of the Eastern Region at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, "A New Entry into the World Oil Market" (2013), pp. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 1966, the military government issued Unification Decree #34, which would have replaced the federation with a more centralised system. The Northern bloc found this decree intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, "A New Entry into the World Oil Market" (2013), pp. 115.  "Instead, many Northerners were alarmed that the military era would lead to an Igbo domination, especially when on May 24, 1966, the government issued Unification Decree No. 34, through which the federation was abolished and replaced with a unitary system. To Northerners this meant nothing but Igbo domination, facing the prospect of being occupied and ruled by Southern military and civil servants and lacking the safeguard of being involved in the government according to ethnic group divisions."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of provocation from the Eastern media which repeatedly showed humiliating posters and cartoons of the slain northern politicians, on the night of 29 July 1966, northern soldiers at Abeokuta barracks mutinied, thus precipitating [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup|a counter-coup]], which have already been in the planning stages. The counter-coup led to the installation of Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon as Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Gowon was chosen as a compromise candidate. He was a Northerner, a Christian, from a minority tribe, and had a good reputation within the army.

It seems that Gowon immediately faced not only a potential standoff with the East, but secession threats from the Northern and even the Western region.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, "Capitol Gains" (2014), pp. 318–319.&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-coup plotters had considered using the opportunity to withdraw from the federation themselves. Ambassadors from Britain and the United States, however, urged Gowon to maintain control over the whole country. Gowon followed this plan, repealing the Unification Decree, announcing a return to the federal system.&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, "A New Entry into the World Oil Market" (2013), pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persecution of Igbo ===

From June through October 1966, [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|pogroms in the North]] killed an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Igbo, half of them children, and caused more than a million to two million to flee to the Eastern Region.&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, ''The Nigeria–Biafra War'' (2014), p. 173. "Repeated outbursts of violence between June and October 1966 peaked in massacres against Igbos living in the ''Sabon Gari'', the 'foreigners' quarters' of northern Nigerian towns. According to estimates, these riots claimed the lives of tens of thousands. This violence drove a stream of more than a million refugees to the Eastern Region, the 'homeland' of the Igbos' diasporic community."&lt;/ref&gt; 29 September 1966, was considered the worst day; because of massacres, it was called 'Black Thursday'.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra Civil War" (2014), pp. 266. "Between May and September 1966, northerners murdered between 80,000 and 100,000 Igbos and other easterners resident in the Northern Region. The violence reached a climax with the massacres of 29 September 1966 ('Black Thursday'). Ojukwu had to deal with an influx to the east of between 700,000 and two million refugees. He responded by expelling thousands of non-easterners from the Eastern Region."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinua Achebe. ''There Was a Country'' (2012). New York: The Penguin Press. pp. 80–83, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomusicologist Charles Keil, who was visiting Nigeria in 1966, recounted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The pogroms I witnessed in Makurdi, Nigeria (late Sept. 1966) were foreshadowed by months of intensive anti-Ibo and anti-Eastern conversations among Tiv, Idoma, Hausa and other Northerners resident in Makurdi, and, fitting a pattern replicated in city after city, the massacres were led by the Nigerian army. Before, during and after the slaughter, Col. Gowon could be heard over the radio issuing 'guarantees of safety' to all Easterners, all citizens of Nigeria, but the intent of the soldiers, the only power that counts in Nigeria now or then, was painfully clear. After counting the disemboweled bodies along the Makurdi road I was escorted back to the city by soldiers who apologised for the stench and explained politely that they were doing me and the world a great favor by eliminating Ibos.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Federal Military Government also laid the groundwork for the blockade of the Eastern Region which went into full effect in 1967.&lt;ref name=Stevenson2014pages314to315&gt;Stevenson, ''Capitol Gains'' (2014), pp. 314–315. "In fact, the Federation's '''first response to Biafran secession''' was to deepen the blockade to include 'a blockade of the East's air and sea ports, a ban on foreign currency transactions, and a halt to all incoming post and telecommunications.' The Federation implemented its blockade so quickly during the war because it was a continuation of the policy from the year before."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breakaway ==
On 27 May 1967, Gowon proclaimed the division of Nigeria into twelve states. This decree carved the Eastern Region in three parts: [[South Eastern State]], [[Rivers State]], and [[East Central State]]. Now the Igbos, concentrated in the East Central State, would lose control over most of the petroleum, located in the other two areas.&lt;ref name=Uche2008page123&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), p. 123. "The oil revenue issue, however, came to a head when Gowon, on 27 May 1967, divided the country into twelve states. The Eastern Region was split into three states: South Eastern State, Rivers State and East Central State. This effectively excised the main oil-producing areas from the core Ibo state (East Central State). On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu declared independence and renamed the entire Eastern Region 'the Republic of Biafra'. As part of the effort to get the Biafran leadership to change its mind, the Federal government placed a shipping embargo on the territory."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk-Greene, ''The Genesis of the Nigerian Civil War'' (1975), p. 6. "The final high water, and the greatest of flood tides, of this phase of Gowon's leadership came in May 1967 with his Decree – and only a no-nonsense, no-referendum military government could have effected overnight such a fundamental reversal of half a century of Nigeria's political history and administrative thinking – to replace the four Regions by twelve States. Whether Decree No. 14 was designed to forestall secession (would-be Biafra was now to consist of 3 states instead of the Eastern Region, two of them mischievously emphasising the East's long-contained minorities problem of Ibibio/Efik discontent and Calabar-Ogoja-Rivers separatism, and the third a landlocked, oil-less, overpopulated Ibo enclave) or whether it pushed Ojukwu into the final defiance of declaring a secessionist Republic remains a matter of argument. What remains unchallenged is the unequalled point of no return in Nigeria's history that the States Decree constitutes."&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu declared independence of the [[Biafra|Republic of Biafra]].

The Federal Military Government immediately placed an embargo on all shipping to and from Biafra—but not on oil tankers.&lt;ref name=Stevenson2014pages314to315 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Uche2008page123 /&gt; Biafra quickly moved to collect oil royalties from oil companies doing business within its borders.&lt;ref name=Uche2008page123 /&gt; When Shell-BP acquiesced to this request at the end of June, the Federal Government extended its blockade to include oil.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages120to124 /&gt; The blockade, which most foreign actors accepted, played a decisive role in putting Biafra at a disadvantage from the beginning of the war.&lt;ref name=HeertenMoses2014page174&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 174. "The FMG's major strategic advantage was not its military force, but its diplomatic status: internationally recognised statehood. That the FMG could argue that it was a sovereign government facing an 'insurgency' was decisive. […] Nigeria's secured diplomatic status was also crucial for the most significant development in the war's early stages: the FMG's decision to blockade the secessionist state. To cut off Biafra's lines of communication with the outside world, air and sea ports were blockaded, foreign currency transactions banned, incoming mail and telecommunication blocked and international business obstructed. Even with its limited resources, Nigeria was able to organise a successful blockade without gaping holes or long interruptions--mostly because other governments or companies were ready to acquiesce to Lagos' handling of the matter."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the very young nation had a chronic shortage of weapons to go to war, it was determined to defend itself. Although there was much sympathy in Europe and elsewhere, only five countries (Tanzania, Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire, Zambia, and Haiti) officially recognised the new republic. Britain supplied amounts of heavy weapons and ammunition to the Nigerian side because of its desire to preserve the country it had created. The Biafra side received arms and ammunition from France even though French government denied sponsoring Biafra. An article in ''[[Paris Match]]'' of 20 November 1968 claimed that French arms were reaching Biafra through neighbouring countries such as Gabon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chibuike|first1=Uche|title=Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2008|volume=49|pages=111–135|jstor=40206616|doi=10.1017/s0021853708003393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy supply of weapons by Britain was the biggest factor in determining the outcome of the war.

Several peace accords were held, with the most notable one held at [[Aburi]], Ghana (the [[Aburi Accord]]),. There were different accounts on what took place in Aburi. Ojukwu accused the federal government of going back on their promises while the federal government accused Ojukwu of distortion and half-truths.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ATOFARATI|first1=ABUBAKAR .A.|title=The Nigerian Civil War: Causes, Strategies, And Lessons Learnt|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1992/AAA.htm|website=Global Security|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ojukwu gained agreement to a [[confederation]] for Nigeria, rather than a federation. He was warned by his advisers that this reflected a failure of Gowon to understand the difference and, that being the case, predicted that it would be reneged upon.

When this happened, Ojukwu regarded it as both a failure by Gowon to keep to the spirit of the Aburi agreement, and lack of integrity on the side of the Nigerian Military Government in the negotiations toward a united Nigeria. Gowon's advisers, to the contrary, felt that he had enacted as much as was politically feasible in fulfillment of the spirit of Aburi.&lt;ref name="NUA"&gt;Ntieyong U. Akpan, ''The Struggle for Secession, 1966–1970: A Personal Account of the Nigerian Civil War''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Eastern Region was very ill equipped for war, outmanned and outgunned by the Nigerians. Their advantages included fighting in their homeland, support of most Easterners, determination, and use of limited resources.

The UK-which still maintained the highest level of influence over Nigeria's highly valued oil industry through [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]]-[[BP]] &lt;ref name="shellbpinflu"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Awoyokun | first = Damola | title = BIAFRA: The Untold Story of Nigeria's civil war | publisher = P.M. News | date = 19 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Soviet Union]] supported the Nigerian government, especially by military supplies.

== War ==
Shortly after extending its blockade to include oil, the Nigerian government launched a "[[police action]]" to retake the secessionist territory.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk-Greene, ''The Genesis of the Nigerian Civil War'' (1975), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The war began on the early hours of 6 July 1967 when Nigerian Federal troops advanced in two columns into Biafra. The Biafra strategy had succeeded. The federal government had started the war, and the East was defending itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Akpan|first1=Ntieyoung U.|title=The Struggle for Secession, 1966–1970: A Personal Account of the Nigerian Civil War.|publisher=Routledge|location=online|isbn=9781317792314|pages=89–106|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ISrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Ntieyong+U.+Akpan,+The+Struggle+for+Secession,+1966–1970:+A+Personal+Account+of+the+Nigerian+Civil+War.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IZweXHmr0G&amp;sig=yjz2mrk6OJLlyEITZpzXHinPJWw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQhPO-hqzQAhWEMGMKHcMAAigQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ntieyong%20U.%20Akpan%2C%20The%20Struggle%20for%20Secession%2C%201966–1970%3A%20A%20Personal%20Account%20of%20the%20Nigerian%20Civil%20War.&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nigerian Army]] offensive was through the north of Biafra led by Colonel [[Mohammed Shuwa]] and the local military units were formed as the [[1st Division (Nigeria)|1st Infantry Division]]. The division was led mostly by northern officers. After facing unexpectedly fierce resistance and high casualties, the right-hand Nigerian column advanced on the town of [[Nsukka]], which fell on 14 July, while the left-hand column made for Garkem, which was captured on 12 July.

=== Biafran offensive ===

The Biafrans responded with an offensive of their own when, on 9 August, the Biafran forces moved west into the Mid-Western Nigerian region across the Niger river, passing through [[Benin City]], until they were stopped at Ore (in present day [[Ondo State]]) just over the state boundary on 21 August, just 130 miles east of the Nigerian capital of [[Lagos]]. The Biafran attack was led by Lt. Col. Banjo, a Yoruba, with the Biafran rank of brigadier. The attack met little resistance and the Mid-West was easily taken over. [[File:Flag of the Republic of Benin.svg|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Republic of Benin (Nigeria)|Republic of Benin]]]] This was due to the pre-secession arrangement that all soldiers should return to their regions to stop the spate of killings, in which Igbo soldiers had been major victims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria'', by Godfrey Mwakikagile, Nova Publishers, 2001.{{ISBN|1560729678}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian soldiers who were supposed to defend the Mid-West state were mostly Mid-West Igbo and, while some were in touch with their eastern counterparts, others resisted. General Gowon responded by asking Colonel [[Murtala Mohammed]] (who later became head of state in 1975) to form another division (the 2nd Infantry Division) to expel the Biafrans from the Mid-West, as well as to defend the West side and attack Biafra from the West as well. As Nigerian forces retook the Mid-West, the Biafran military administrator declared the [[Republic of Benin (1967)|Republic of Benin]] on 19 September, though it ceased to exist the next day. (The present country of [[Benin]], west of Nigeria, was still named [[Republic of Dahomey|Dahomey]] at that time.)

Although Benin City was retaken by the Nigerians on 22 September, the Biafrans succeeded in their primary objective by tying down as many Nigerian Federal troops as they could. Gen. Gowon also launched an [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] into Biafra south from the [[Niger Delta]] to the riverine area, using the bulk of the Lagos Garrison command under Colonel [[Benjamin Adekunle]] (called the Black Scorpion) to form the 3rd Infantry Division (which was later renamed as the 3rd Marine Commando). As the war continued, the Nigerian Army recruited amongst a wider area, including the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], Itshekiri, Urhobo, Edo, Ijaw, etc.

=== Nigerian offensive ===

The command was divided into two brigades with three battalions each. 1st brigade advanced 1 Brigade advanced on the axis Ogugu - Ogunga - Nsukka road while 2nd Brigade advanced on axis Gakem -Obudu - Ogoja road. By 10 July 1967, it had conquered all its assigned territories. By 12 July the 2nd brigade had captured Gakem, Ogudu, Ogoja.[[File:Lynn Garrison in cockpit 1966.jpg|thumb|[[Lynn Garrison]] in cockpit of his F4U-7 Corsair  1966]] Enugu became the hub of secession and rebellion, and the Nigerian government believed that once Enugu was captured, the drive for secession would end. The plans to conquer Enugu began on 12 September 1967 and by 4 October 1967 the Nigerian Army had captured Enugu.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Nigerian soldiers under Murtala Mohammed carried out [[Asaba massacre|a mass killing]] of 700 civilians when they captured [[Asaba, Nigeria|Asaba]] on the [[River Niger]]. The Nigerians were repulsed three times as they attempted to cross the River Niger during October, resulting in the loss of thousands of troops, dozens of tanks and equipment. The first attempt by the 2nd Infantry Division on 12 October to cross the Niger from the town of Asaba to the Biafran city of Onitsha cost the Nigerian Federal Army over 5,000 soldiers killed, wounded, captured or missing. [[Operation Tiger Claw]] (17–20 October 1967) was a military conflict between Nigerian and Biafran military forces. On 17 October 1967 Nigerians invaded Calabar led by the "Black Scorpion", Benjamin Adekunle, while the Biafrans were led by Col. Ogbu Ogi, who was responsible for controlling the area between Calabar and Opobo, and Lynn Garrison, a foreign mercenary. The Biafrans came under immediate fire from the water and the air. For the next two days Biafran stations and military supplies were bombarded by the Nigerian air force. That same day Lynn Garrison reached Calabar but came under immediate fire by federal troops. By 20 October, Garrison's forces withdrew from the battle while Col. Ogi officially surrendered to Gen. Adekunle. On 19 May 1968 Portharcourt was captured. With the capture of Enugu, Bonny, Calabar and Portharcourt, the outside world was left in no doubt of the Federal supremacy in the war.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Control over oil production ===
[[File:Nigerdelta NASA.jpg|307px|thumb|Control over petroleum in the [[Niger Delta]] was a paramount military objective during the war.]]

Oil exploration in Nigeria was pioneered by Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company in 1937. In a bid to control the oil in the eastern region, the Federal government placed a shipping embargo on the territory. This embargo did not involve oil tankers. The leadership of Biafra wrote to Shell-BP demanding royalties for the oil that was being explored in their region. After much deliberation, Shell-BP decided to pay Biafra the sum of 250,000 pounds. The news of this payment reached the Federal government, which immediately extended the shipping embargo to oil tankers The Nigerian government also made it clear to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay all outstanding oil royalty immediately. With the stalling on the payment for Biafra government ask Shell-BP to stop operations in Biafra and took over from the company.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Towards the end of July 1967, Nigerian federal troops and marines captured [[Bonny Island]] in the Niger Delta, thereby taking control of vital Shell-BP facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, ''Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War'' (2008), p. 131. "Within a month of full military conflict, the Nigerian government captured the important Island of Bonny from the Biafrans. The British High Commissioner articulated the importance of this capture at the time: 'This not only tightens the grip on the blockade and gives the Federal Government a first footing in the Rivers Province; it places in their hands the most valuable part of Shell-BP installations, for the storage tanks, the pumping station and the tanker terminal are all at Bonny.' At the time of the capture, the Nigerian government claimed that the Island was taken 'without any damage' to Shell-BP's installations there."&lt;/ref&gt; Operations began again in May 1968, when Nigeria captured [[Port Harcourt]]. Its facilities had been damaged and needed repair.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), p. 132. "Despite the return of Gray, and the interest of Shell-BP and the British government in getting the oil machines pumping again, the state of war and its attendant hazards ensured that this could not happen immediately. It was not until May 1968, when Nigerian marines captured Port Harcourt, that it was adjudged safe by Shell-BP to send an advance team to both Bonny and Port Harcourt to assess the state of their production facilities."&lt;/ref&gt; Oil production and export continued, but at a lower level. The completion in 1969 of a new terminal at [[Forçados]] brought production up from 142,000 barrels/day in 1958 to 540,000 barrels/day in 1969. In 1970, this figure doubled to 1,080,000 barrels/day. The royalties enabled Nigeria to buy more weapons, hire mercenaries, etc. Biafra proved unable to compete on this economic level.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), pp. 133–134. "The problem was that the oil had to be shipped through Bonny, which at the time was not safe. Furthermore, silting of the approaches to the Bonny terminal during the early parts of the war reduced its unit tanker capacity from 70,000 tons to about 40,000 tons. Even with the use of smaller tankers, the short haul from Nigeria to Britain was still more profitable than the Cape route used for Gulf oil. Despite the prospects for Eastern Region oil, the civil war made the source unreliable. Luckily for Shell-BP, prior to the war, it had planned a second terminal off Forcados, which was in Federal territory. Construction of the terminal and the pipelines, which started during the war, took 18 months and was completed in the middle of 1969."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atrocities against ethnic minorities in Biafra===

Minorities in Biafra suffered atrocities at the hands of those fighting for both sides of the conflict. The pogroms in the North in 1966 were indiscriminately directed against people from Eastern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Elechi Amadi, author of ''The Concubine'' and ''The Great Ponds'', recalls in his memoir ''Sunset in Biafra'' his time in a Biafran detention cam. He and other ethnic minorities were imprisoned and tortured for their real or perceived support for the Federal Side.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite a seemingly natural alliance among these victims of the pogroms in the north, tensions rose as minorities, who had always harbored an interest in having their own state within the Nigerian federation, were suspected of collaborating with Federal troops to undermine Biafra.&lt;ref name="Saro-Wiwa, Ken 1992"&gt;Saro-Wiwa, Ken, ''Genocide in Nigeria: The Ogoni Tragedy'', Saros International Publishers, Port Harcourt, 1992, {{ISBN|1-870716-22-1}}, "Port Harcourt was the last place whose fall led the inhabitants being treated as saboteurs, and so cruelly treated.  I went to Igrita shortly after the fall of Port Harcourt and was terribly shocked by the number of bodies being carted into mass graves—bodies of person killed not by bullets but by cruel handling, and not by soldier but by frenzied and ill-motivated civilians," quoting ''The Struggle for Succession, 1966-1970: A Personal Account of the Nigerian Civil War,'' Routledge (14 January 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal troops were equally culpable of this crime. In the Rivers area, ethnic minorities sympathetic to Biafra were killed in the hundreds by federal troops. In Calabar, some 2000 Efiks were also killed by Federal troops.&lt;ref name="encompass.eku.edu"&gt;''The Forgotten Victims: Ethnic Minorities in the Nigeria-Biafra War, 1967-1970'', African Tree Press (18 February 2007) 978-1592320134 http://encompass.eku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=jora "The Nigerian Air Force left their own mark in the minorities’ areas. They were accused of indiscriminate bombing of civilian occupied areas. William Norris of the ''London Sunday Times'' in an article titled, “Nightmare in Biafra,” reported how the high-flying Russian Ilyushin jets dropped bombs in civilian centers in Biafra. He stated that, 'Slowly, but effectively, a reign of terror has been created'."&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the Biafra, atrocities were recorded against the resident of Asaba in present-day Delta State by both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;"The Biafran Crisis and the Midwest", ''African Affairs'', Vol. 86, No. 344 (Jul., 1987), pp. 367-383; Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal African Society. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/722748. "Similarly, on 20 September 1967, 'there was a mass killing of non-Ibo MidWesterners at Boji-Boji Agbor', and on 23 September, 'non-Ibo speaking MidWesterners were apprehended by rebel soldiers at Asaba, Ibusa and Agbor and taken [in two lorries] to a rubber plantation along Uromi-Agbor road and massacred."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanguardngr.com"&gt;http://www.vanguardngr.com/2016/10/revisiting-1967-asaba-massacre/&lt;/ref&gt;

== International involvement ==

=== Britain ===
The British planned to maintain and expand their supply of cheap high-quality oil from Nigeria. Therefore they placed a high priority on maintenance of oil extraction and refining operations. They backed the Federal Government but, when the war broke out, cautioned them not to damage British oil installations in the East. These oilworks, under the control of Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company (jointly owned by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] and [[British Petroleum]]), controlled 84% of Nigeria's 580,000 barrels per day. Two-thirds of this oil came from the Eastern region, and another third from the newly created Mid-West region. Two-fifths of all Nigerian oil ended up in Britain.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages120to124&gt;Uche, ''Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War'' (2008), pp. 120–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shell-BP therefore considered carefully a request by the Federal Government that it refuse to pay the royalties demanded by Biafra. Its lawyers advised that payment to Biafra would be appropriate if this government did in fact maintain law and order in the region in question. The British government advised that paying Biafra could undermine the goodwill of the Federal Government. Shell-BP made the payment, and the government established a blockade on oil exports.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages120to124 /&gt; Forced to choose a side, Shell-BP and the British government threw in their lot with the Federal Government in Lagos, apparently calculating that this side would be more likely to win the war.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages125to127&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), pp. 125–127. "The Nigerian government subsequently made it explicit to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay the outstanding oil royalty immediately. Once the oil flow stopped, sitting on a fence ceased to be an option for the British government. Britain subsequently decided to back Nigeria, partly because it was advised that, in the event of war, the odds were 'slightly in favour of the Federal Military Government'. Perhaps more importantly, the British government calculated that supporting Nigeria was its safest option if it were to preserve its oil interests in th ecountry, largely because the Cold War and the rivalry among some Western European states made it likely that other foreign powers would wade into the conflict."&lt;/ref&gt; As the British High Commissioner in Lagos wrote to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs on 27 July 1967:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ojukwu, even victorious, will not be in a strong position. He will require all the international help and recognition he can get. The Federal Government would be much better placed both internationally and internally. They would have a cast iron case for the severest treatment of a company which has subsidised a rebel, and I feel fairly convinced they would press their case to the lengths of cancelling the Company's concessions and nationalising their installations. I conclude, therefore, if the company does change its mind and asks the British Government for advice, the best that could be given is for it to clamber hastily back on the Lagos side of the fence with cheque book at the ready."&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages125to127 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shell-BP took this advice.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages125to127 /&gt; It continued to quietly support Nigeria through the rest of the war, in one case advancing a royalty of £5.5 million to fund the purchase of more British weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), p. 132. "Given Shell-BP's interest in Nigeria taking over the major oilfields still in Biafran hands, it was not surprising that they overtly supported the Nigerian military cause.99 A case in point was in December 1967 when the Nigerian government, frustrated by the slow pace of progress in the war, requested that Shell-BP pay its royalty of £5.5 million in advance, in order to enable it to purchase arms from Britain. Shell-BP promptly complied."&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, Britain covertly supplied Nigeria with weapons and military intelligence and may have also helped it to hire mercenaries.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), p. 130. "In reality, however, the British government supplied many more arms than it was publicly prepared to admit. Apart from direct arms supplies, it provided military intelligence to the Nigerian government and may have helped it to access sophisticated arms and mercenaries through third parties."&lt;/ref&gt; After the decision was made to back Nigeria, the BBC oriented its reporting to favour this side.&lt;ref&gt;Uche, "Oil, British Interests and the Nigerian Civil War" (2008), p. 131. "Furthermore, once the war broke out and the British government decided to back the Nigerian side, the BBC swiftly shifted its reporting on the conflict, in Nigeria's favour. This was noticed and thankfully acknowledged by the Nigerian government."&lt;/ref&gt; Supplies provided to the Federal Military Government included two vessels and 60 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), pp. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, the humanitarian campaign around Biafra began on 12 June 1968, with media coverage on ITV and in The Sun. The charities [[Oxfam]] and [[Save the Children Fund]] were soon deployed, with large sums of money at their disposal.&lt;ref name=OSullivan2014page302&gt;O'Sullivan, "Humanitarian Encounters" (2014), p. 302. "It took time, however, for popular attention to focus on the crisis. In Britain that occurred only after 12 June 1968, when a film broadcast on ITV and a press campaign led by the ''Sun'' newspaper sparked the humanitarian response into life."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===

France provided weapons, mercenary fighters, and other assistance to Biafra and promoted its cause internationally, describing the situation as a genocide. [[Charles de Gaulle]] referred to "Biafra's just and noble cause".&lt;ref name=Olawoyin1971pages137to139&gt;Olawoyin, "Historical Analysis of Nigeria–Biafra Conflict" (1971), pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt; However, France did not recognise Biafra diplomatically.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), pp. 114–115. "France, however, categorically refused to officially recognise Biafra, a possibility President Charles de Gaulle ruled out as early as 14 December 1967. At the same time it was well known that France was supporting Biafran leader General Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu with covert military aid throughout the war, including mercenaries and weapons."&lt;/ref&gt; Through Pierre Laureys, France had apparently provided two B-26s, Alouette helicopters, and pilots.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 119. Foccart says de Gaulle's decision to send military assistance to Biafra was made on 27 September 1967, when the General met personally with Houphouët-Boigny, who was Biafra's most important African ally throughout the war. On 26 September, the Biafran capital, Enugu, was shelled for the first time by Federal Nigerian forces. The problem with this date is that it appears that France had already supplied Biafra with two B-26 aircraft, Alouette helicopters and pilots in summer 1967 via the French arms dealer Pierre Laureys. In 1971, however, Ralph Uwechue, Biafra's envoy to France, wrote that "the helicopters had been purchases made by the Eastern Nigerian Regional Government from France for civilian purposes well before the war."&lt;/ref&gt; France supplied Biafra with captured German and Italian weapons from World War II, sans serial numbers, delivered as part of regular shipments to [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 122. "De Gaulle made the decision to begin regular French arms shipments to Biafra on 17 or 18 October 1967. De Gaulle was very reluctant to send weapons from French stocks, and only agreed when Foccart suggested sending captured German and Italian weapons from World War II with the serial number scratched off. The weapons would not be sent directly to Ojukwu, but would go through Houphouët-Boigny, so that it looked like France was replenishing the Ivory Coast's stocks as stipulated in the normal bilateral military assistance agreements."&lt;/ref&gt; France also sold [[Panhard]] armoured vehicles to the Nigerian federal government.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), pp. 179. "France, too, pursued contradictory policies, selling Nigeria Panhard light armoured cars and halting all arms transfers to Lagos only later that year, by which time it was supplying the Biafrans via the Ivory Coast and Gabon. Clapham notes that France's military aid to Biafra prolonged the war for about eighteen months."&lt;/ref&gt;

French involvement in the war can be viewed in the context of its geopolitical strategy (''[[Françafrique]]'') and competition with the English in West Africa. Nigeria represented a base of British influence in the predominantly French-aligned area. France and Portugal used nearby countries in their sphere of influence, especially Côte d'Ivoire under President [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]], as waystations for shipments to Biafra.&lt;ref name=Olawoyin1971pages137to139 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; To some extent, also, France repeated its earlier policy from the [[Congo Crisis]], when it supported the secession of the southern mining province [[State of Katanga|Katanga]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), pp. 116– 117. "The Katanga secession (1960–1963) was in many ways a precursor to the Biafran War for France. French mercenaries went to Katanga to support the Belgian intervention. The Belgians were helping Tshombé fight Congolese forces loyal to Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, who was supported by the Soviet Union. […] The Katangan secession was ultimately unsuccessful, and thus it is a surprise that de Gaulle's government would support another secession in Biafra four years later. A number of other countries also drew a link between the two conflicts, and Ojukwu released a statement on 11 January 1969 called 'Biafra: the antithesis of Katanga', to reassure foreign powers. […] Katanga gave France experience in using mercenaries to fight a war in which the consequences of failure were minimal."&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, France gained incentives through oil drilling contracts for the ''Société Anonyme Française de Recherches et d'Exploitation de Pétrolières'' (SAFRAP), apparently arranged with Eastern Nigeria in advance of its secession from the Nigerian Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, ''French Military Policy in the Nigerian Civil War'' (2015), p. 118. "Nigeria, however, was very important for France due to its size as well as the oil in the Niger River Delta. France had no diplomatic relations with Nigeria after 1960, as Nigeria expelled the French ambassador, Raymond Offroy, following the third French nuclear test in Algeria on 27 December. The severing of diplomatic relations did not halt commercial relations between the two countries, and in 1964, the French national oil company, SAFRAP, was given the rights to search for oil in parts of Eastern Nigeria that would later declare independence under the name of Biafra."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olawoyin1971pages135to136&gt;Olawoyin, "Historical Analysis of Nigeria–Biafra Conflict" (1971), pp. 135–136. "The French policy may be described as anti-British, anti-Nigerian and pr-Biafra. SAFRAP (a French oil company) is exploring for oil in Biafra as well as in Nigeria. Although France has leaned toward Biafra, SAFRAP has vast exploration rights in the Northern Region; this might have prevented France giving Biafra political recognition. […] The highlight of increasing world sympathy for Ojukwu was also motivated by the declaration by the French government that it endorsed the principle of Biafra's right to self-determination. Before the start of the Civil War, France had strengthened her economic ties with Biafra. On August 8th, F.G. showed some documents (photostat copies) to the foreign press showing that Biafra had sold oil concessions to France."&lt;/ref&gt; SAFRAP laid claim to 7% of the Nigerian petroleum supply.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages120to124 /&gt; In the assessment of a CIA analyst in 1970, France's "support was actually given to a handful of Biafran bourgeoisie in return for the oil."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve05p1/d160 Telegram from the Central Intelligence Agency to the White House Situation Room]," CIA, 20262, TDCS DB – 315/00173-70 (ADVANCE), 14 January 1970, in FRUS, Vol. E-5, 2005 (160); as cited in Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Biafra, for its part, openly appreciated its relationship with France. Ojukwu suggested on 10 August 1967, that Biafra introduce compulsory French classes in secondary, technical and teacher training schools, in order to "benefit from the rich culture of the French-speaking world".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

France led the way, internationally, for political support of Biafra.&lt;ref name=Olawoyin1971pages135to136 /&gt; [[Portugal]] also sent weapons. These transactions were arranged through the "Biafran Historical Research Centre" in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 122. "The most important dimension of French military assistance was the shipment of weapons to Biafra, which had severe shortages of not only heavy weapons, but also small arms and ammunition. Portugal also provided weapons to Biafra, as did Czechoslovakia, until the Soviet invasion in 1968. The Biafrans set up an office in Paris called the 'Biafran Historical Research Centre', which was Ojukwu's contact point with Mauricheau-Beupré, Falques and Denard. The Centre allowed Ojukwu to purchase arms directly from European arms dealers. Denard would purhcase arms from Czechoslovakia and ship them by sea to Biafra via Libreville. Starting in October 1967, there were also direct Czech arms flights, by a network of pilots led by Jack Malloch, a Rhodesian in contact with Houphouët-Boigny and Mauricheau-Beupré."&lt;/ref&gt; French-aligned [[Gabon]] and [[Côte d'Ivoire]] recognised Biafra in May 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 May 1968, De Gaulle personally contributed 30,000 francs to medicine purchases for the French Red Cross mission. [[May 1968 events in France|Fairly widespread student-worker unrest]] diverted the government's attention only temporarily. The government declared an arms embargo but maintained arms shipments to Biafra under cover of humanitarian aid.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 124. "In May and early June 1968, protests and general strikes in France prevented de Gaulle, Foccart or any other French official from following the situation in Biafra. On 12 June, after the riots had subsided, a French ministerial council decided to impose an official arms embargo on both Nigeria and Biafra, and to start providing direct humanitarian aid to Ojukwu. Robert explains that the humanitarian aid provided a very effective cover for the secret French arms shipments, which began to increase."&lt;/ref&gt; In July the government redoubled its efforts to involve the public in a humanitarian approach to the conflict. Images of starving children and accusations of genocide filled French newspapers and television programs. Amidst this press blitz, on 31 July 1968, De Gaulle made an official statement in support of Biafra.&lt;ref name=Griffin2015page124&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 124–125. "The 31 July 1938 statement in favour of Biafra was preceded by a concerted campaign in the French press during the month of July to inform the French public about events in Biafra. […] The French government's next step after the 31 July statement was to launch a major campaign to gain public funding for humanitarian operations in Biafra. The campaign was coordinated at the highest levels of government, and the French Foreign Ministry files make it clear that the French television service and the French Red Cross were required to get governmental approval to ask for funds. The French public eventually contributed 12,600,000 francs. The French press continued a concerted campaign throughout August 1968 to alert the public to the humanitarian situation."&lt;/ref&gt; Maurice Robert, head of ''[[Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage]]'' (SDECE, the French foreign intelligence service) African operations, wrote in 2004 that his agency supplied the press with details about the war and told them to use the word "genocide" in their reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), p. 124. "Robert, in a surprising admission, stated that it was the SDECE that instructed the media to use the term 'genocide' in 1968. He says that the SDECE gave the French press precise information about Biafran casualties and civilian losses, and that ''Le Monde'' was the first to pick up the story. Rony Braumann wrote in 2006 that the SDECE paid the Biafran press service Markpress, located in Geneva, to introduce the theme of genocide to the general public."&lt;/ref&gt;

France declared "Biafra Week" on 11–17 March 1969, centred on a 2-franc raffle held by the French Red Cross. Soon after, de Gaulle terminated arms shipments, then resigned on 27 April 1969. Interim president [[Alain Poher]] fired General [[Jacques Foccart]], the lead coordinator of France's Africa policy. [[Georges Pompidou]] re-hired Foccart and resumed support for Biafra, including cooperation with the South African secret service to import more weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, "French military policy in the Nigerian Civil War" (2015), pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America ===
The United States officially declared neutrality, with US Secretary of State Dean Rusk stating that "America is not in a position to take action as Nigeria is an area under British influence.",&lt;ref name="shellbpinflu" /&gt; Formally, the United States was neutral in the civil war. Strategically, its interests aligned with the Federal Military Government. The US also saw value in its alliance with Lagos, and sought to protect $800 million (in the assessment of the State Department) worth of private investment.&lt;ref&gt;Pierri, "A New Entry into the World Oil Market" (2013), pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1968, United States [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential candidate]] Richard Nixon stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Until now, efforts to relieve the Biafra people have been thwarted by the desire of central government of Nigeria to pursue total and unconditional victory and by the fear of the Ibo people that surrender means wholesale atrocities and genocide. But genocide is what is taking place right now – and starvation is the grim reaper.&lt;ref name=Olawoyin1971pages137to139 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When Nixon became President in 1969, he found there was little he could do to change the established stance aside from call for another round of peace talks. Despite this, he continued to personally support Biafra.&lt;ref&gt;https://notevenpast.org/foreign-policy-from-candidate-to-president-richard-nixon-and-the-lesson-of-biafra/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gulf Oil]] Nigeria, the third major player in Nigerian oil, was producing 9% of the oil coming out of Nigeria before the war began.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages120to124 /&gt; Its operations were all located offshore of the federally controlled Mid-Western territory; therefore it continued to pay royalties to the federal government and its operations were mostly undisrupted.&lt;ref name=Uche2008pages125to127 /&gt;

=== Soviet Union ===

The [[Soviet Union]] strongly backed the Nigerian government, emphasising the similarity with the Congo situation. It consistently supplied Nigeria with weapons, with the diplomatic disclaimer that these were "strictly for cash on a commercial basis". In 1968, the USSR agreed to finance the [[Kainji Dam]] on the Niger (somewhat upriver from the Delta). Soviet media outlets initially accused the British of cynically supporting the Biafran secession, then had to adjust these claims later when it turned out that Britain was in fact supporting the Federal Government.&lt;ref name=Stent1973&gt;Angela Stent, "The Soviet Union and the Nigerian Civil War: A Triumph of Realism", ''Issue: A Journal of Opinion'' 3.2, Summer 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

One explanation for Soviet sympathy with the Federal Military Government was a shared opposition to internal secessionist movements. Before the war, the Soviets had seemed sympathetic to the Igbos. But Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin stated to their chagrin in October 1967 that "the Soviet people fully understand" Nigeria's motives and its need "to prevent the country from being dismembered."&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), p. 273. "From 1967 to 1970, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland sold Nigeria twelve L-29 Delfin training aircraft, forty-seven MiG-15 and MiG-17 fighter jets, and five Ilyushin-28 bombers, two of which Egypt transferred to Lagos. This constituted a virtual about-face in Soviet policy, because, until the secession, Moscow had evinced both admiration of the Igbos and sympathy for their plight. The Soviet Union chose pragmatism, in the form of alignment with federal Nigeria, over the ideological (if not idealist) alternative of support for Biafra."&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, the war substantially improved Soviet-Nigerian diplomatic and trade relations, and [[Moskvitch]] cars began to make appearances around Lagos. The USSR became a competitive importer of Nigerian cacao.&lt;ref name=Stent1973 /&gt;

Nigeria received support from the Soviet Union in form of aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Aurelia Gitelson, "The Linkage Between External and Domestic Policies: Israel's Experience with Ghana and Nigeria", ''Jewish Social Studies'' 42.2, Spring 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
From early on, Israel perceived that Nigeria would be an important player in West African politics, and saw good relations with Lagos as an important foreign policy objective. Nigeria and Israel established a linkage in 1957. In 1960 Britain allowed the creation of an Israeli diplomatic mission in Lagos, and Israel made a $10 million loan to the Nigerian government. Israel also developed a cultural relation with the Igbos based on possible shared traditions. These moves represented a significant diplomatic success given the Muslim orientation of the northern-dominated government. Some northern leaders disapproved of contact with Israel and banned Israelis from [[Maiduguri]] and [[Sokoto]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), pp. 264–265. "Israel was certain that Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent (fifty- five million in 1960) and rich in oil, would have a great influence on African poli- tics. The Israeli foreign ministry was determined to establish full diplomatic relations upon that colony's receipt of independence (1 October 1960). Ehud Avriel, ambassador to Ghana and a close confidant of both Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir, cautioned that were Israel to fail to establish ties with Nigeria, ‘all of our work in West Africa will have come to naught’."&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel did not begin arms sales to Nigeria until after Aguyi-Ironsi came to power in January 1966. This was considered an opportune time to develop this relationship with the federal government. Ram Nirgad became Israeli ambassador to Nigeria in January. Thirty tons of mortar rounds were delivered in April.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eastern Region began seeking assistance from Israel in September 1966. Israel apparently turned down their requests repeatedly, although they may have put the Biafran representatives in contact with another arms dealer.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), p. 267. "By September 1966, an open arms race had developed between the East and the Federal Government. In mid August, Ojukwu sent two representatives from the Eastern Region on a clandestine visit to Israel in a bid to purchase military hardware. Biafran attention to Israel was a highly astute move, primarily because the secessionists knew well what associations the massacres evoked for the Israelis."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Israel began supplying the Federal Military Government with arms—about $500,000 worth, according to the US State Department.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as elsewhere, the situation in Biafra became publicised as a genocide. The Knesset publicly debated this issue on 17 and 22 July 1968, winning applause from the press for its sensitivity. Right-wing and left-wing political groups, and student activists, spoke for Biafra.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), pp. 270–271. "Uri Avneri of ''HaOlam HaZeh—Koach Hadash'' ('This World—New Force', a far left-wing faction) called for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Biafra, while Aryeh Ben-Eliezer, of the right-wing herut party, lambasted Egyptian and Soviet support of Nigeria. The Israeli press praised the Knesset's attention to Biafra, pointing out that Israel's parliament was the first in the world both to devote a session to the issue and to declare its intention to help the victims."&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1968, the Israeli air force overtly sent twelve tons of food aid to a nearby site outside of Nigerian (Biafran) air space. Covertly, Mossad provided Biafra with $100,000 (through Zurich) and attempted an arms shipment. Soon after, Israel arranged to make clandestine weapons shipments to Biafra using Côte d'Ivoire transport planes.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), pp. 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other countries ===

Biafra appealed unsuccessfully for support from the Organisation of African Unity, which member states generally did not want to support internal secessionist movements,&lt;ref name=HeertenMoses2014page175&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), pp. 174–175. "Realising their slim chances on the battlefield, the Biafran leadership moved the conflict into the propaganda domain. The situation did not look promising for Biafra's propagandists in the international sphere, either. Governments of the global south were particularly hesitant. As many of them faced separatist movements at home, they were adamantly opposed to what they understood as illegitimate secession rather than the legitimate exercise of the Biafran's right to self-determination."&lt;/ref&gt; although they received the support of African countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, Gabon and Côte d’Ivoire. Many African countries who were against separatism like Ethiopia and Egypt supported the Nigerian government in order to prevent inspiring revolts in their own countries.

== Biafra surrounded ==
[[File:Makeshift airport in Calabar, Nigeria, probably 1968.png|thumb|A makeshift airport in Calabar, Nigeria, where relief efforts to aid famine victims were deployed by helicopter teams]]
From 1968 onward, the war fell into a form of stalemate, with Nigerian forces unable to make significant advances into the remaining areas of Biafran control due to stiff resistance and major defeats in [[Abagana]], [[Arochukwu]], [[Oguta]], [[Umuahia]] ([[Operation OAU]]), [[Onne]], [[Ikot Ekpene]], etc.&lt;ref name="NCWF"&gt;{{cite web|work=Dawodu|title= Nigerian Civil War File |author=Nowa Omoigui|date=3 October 2007|accessdate=27 October 2007|url=http://www.dawodu.com/omoigui24.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; But another Nigerian offensive from April to June 1968 began to close the ring around the Biafrans with further advances on the two northern fronts and the capture of [[Port Harcourt]] on 19 May 1968. The blockade of the surrounded Biafrans led to a humanitarian disaster when it emerged that there was widespread civilian hunger and starvation in the besieged Igbo areas.&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), pp. 175–176. "In early May 1968, Biafra's principal port town and remaining access to the sea, Port Harcourt, fell to federal forces. The secessionist state was turned into a landlocked enclave. With federal forces tightening the noose around the secessionist territory, the shrinking Biafran enclave soon encompassed only the heart of Igboland. At the same time, this territory had to absorb increasing numbers of people fleeing federal offensives. After a year of fighting, the rump state was overpopulated, its people impoverished, lacking supplies, food and medicine."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biafran government reported that Nigeria was using hunger and genocide to win the war, and sought aid from the outside world. Private groups in the US, led by Senator Ted Kennedy, responded. No one was ever held responsible for these killings.

In September 1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the "final offensive." Initially the final offensive was neutralised by Biafran troops by the end of the year after several Nigerian troops were routed in Biafran ambushes. In the latter stages, a Southern FMG offensive managed to break through. However in 1969, the Biafrans launched several offensives against the Nigerians in their attempts to keep the Nigerians off-balance starting in March when the 14th Division of the Biafran army recaptured [[Owerri]] and moved towards Port Harcourt, but were halted just north of the city. In May 1969, Biafran commandos recaptured oil wells in Kwale. In July 1969, Biafran forces launched a major land offensive supported by foreign [[mercenary]] pilots continuing to fly in food, medical supplies and weapons. Most notable of the mercenaries was Swedish Count [[Carl Gustav von Rosen]] who led air attacks with five [[Malmö MFI-9]] MiniCOIN small piston-engined aircraft, armed with rocket pods and machine guns. His Biafran Air Force consisted of three Swedes: von Rosen, Gunnar Haglund and Martin Lang. The other two pilots were Biafrans: Willy Murray-Bruce and Augustus Opke. From 22 May to 8 July 1969 von Rosen's small force attacked Nigerian military airfields in Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin City and Ughelli, destroying or damaging a number of Nigerian Air Force jets used to attack relief flights, including a few Mig-17's and three of Nigeria's six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers that were used to bomb Biafran villages and farms on a daily basis. Although the Biafran offensives of 1969 were a tactical success, the Nigerians soon recovered. The Biafran air attacks did disrupt the combat operations of the Nigerian Air Force, but only for a few months.[[File:Malmö MFI-9 Biafra Baby two-view silhouette.svg|thumb|Malmö MFI-9 Biafra Baby two-view silhouette]]

In response to the Nigerian government using foreigners to lead some advances, the Biafran government also began hiring foreign [[mercenary|mercenaries]] to extend the war.&lt;ref name="Mercs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercenary-wars.net/biafra/|title=The Biafran conflict in 1966.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only German born [[Rolf Steiner]] a Lt.

=== Humanitarian crisis ===
{{further|Biafran airlift}}

[[File:Starved girl.jpg|200px|left|thumb|A child suffering the effects of severe hunger and malnutrition as a result of the blockade. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide. It was regarded in the Western press as the genocide of 2 million people, half of them children and fund raising for relief was carried out at the time, with the help of Senator Ted Kennedy.]]

The September massacres and subsequent Igbo withdrawal from northern Nigeria was the basis for the initial human rights petition to the UN to end genocide and provided a historical link to Biafran claims of genocide during the Nigerian civil war.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McNeil|first1=Brian|title=‘And starvation is the grim reaper’: the American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive and the genocide question during the Nigerian civil war, 1968–70|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|date=July 2014|volume=16|pages=317–336|doi=10.1080/14623528.2014.936723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awareness of a mounting crisis rose in 1968. Information spread especially through religious networks, beginning with alerts from missionaries. It did not escape the notice of worldwide Christian organisations that the Biafrans were Christian and the northern Nigerians controlling the federal government were Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 175. "In the first half of 1968, ever more religious groups and humanitarian organisations were alerted to the event, due in large measure to the presence of western missionaries. These religious ties were conduits for the transnational networks through which the conflict would be turned into an object of international humanitarian concern. For many Christian clerics and laypeople, the war seemed to be a cosmic drama fought between a vulnerable Christian Biafra and a northern Muslim-dominated federal Nigeria."&lt;/ref&gt; The famine was as a result of the blockade that the Nigerian government had imposed on the Eastern region in the months leading up to secession.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; [[Frederick Forsyth]], then a journalist in Nigeria and later a successful novelist, observed that the main problem was [[Kwashiorkor]], a protein deficiency. Prior to the civil war, the main source of dietary protein was [[stockfish|dried fish]] imported from [[Norway]], which was supplemented by local hogs, chicken and eggs. The blockade prevented imports, and local protein supplies were quickly depleted: "The national diet was now almost 100% [[starch]]."&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, Frederick. The Outsider: My Life in Intrigue. NY: Putnam, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Many volunteer bodies organised the [[Biafran airlift]] which provided blockade-breaking relief flights into Biafra, carrying food, medicines, and sometimes (according to some claims) weapons.&lt;ref name="Shadows"&gt;''Shadows : Airlift and Airwar in Biafra and Nigeria 1967–1970'', by Michael I. Draper ({{ISBN|1-902109-63-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; More common was the claim that the arms-carrying aircraft would closely shadow aid aircraft, making it more difficult to distinguish between aid aircraft and military supply aircraft.&lt;ref name="Shadows" /&gt;

The American Community to Keep Biafra Alive stood apart from other organizations by quickly creating a broad strategy for pressuring the American government into taking a more active role in facilitating relief. Former Peace Corps volunteers who had recently returned from Nigeria and college students founded the American Committee in July 1968. The Peace Corps volunteers stationed in the Eastern Region ‘developed strong friendships and identified as Igbo which was prompted them to help the eastern region.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

One of the characters assisting Count Carl Gustav von Rosen was [[Lynn Garrison]], an ex-[[RCAF]] fighter pilot. He introduced the Count to a Canadian method of dropping bagged supplies to remote areas in Canada without losing the contents. He showed how one sack of food could be placed inside a larger sack before the supply drop. When the package hit the ground the inner sack would rupture while the outer one kept the contents intact. With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation.

[[Bernard Kouchner]] was one of a number of French doctors who volunteered with the [[French Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. The Red Cross required volunteers to sign an agreement, which was seen by some (like Kouchner and his supporters) as being similar to a [[gag order]], that was designed to maintain the organisation's neutrality, whatever the circumstances. Kouchner and the other French doctors signed this agreement.

After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims. They formed le ''Comité de Lutte contre le Génocide au Biafra'' which in 1971 became ''[[Médecins Sans Frontières]]'' (''Doctors Without Borders'').&lt;ref name="hih"&gt;Bortolotti, Dan (2004). ''Hope in Hell: Inside the World of Doctors Without Borders'', Firefly Books. {{ISBN|1-55297-865-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis brought about a large increase in prominence and funding of [[non-governmental organisations]] (NGOs).&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 177. "The Biafran crisis was also connected to wider changes in the relief sector. In particular, it resulted in a massive spending increase through state funds and public donations, leading to the growth and proliferation of NGOs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, "Humanitarian Encounters" (2014), p. 299. "The Biafran humanitarian crisis holds a critical place in the history of non-government organisations (NGOs). It prompted the creation of new agencies, like Africa Concern, and thrust existing ones, like Oxfam, into a spotlight they have left only rarely since. As part of a wider 'NGO moment', it focused public and official attention on the role of non-state actors and accelerated the emergency of an internationalised, professionalised aid industry that took centre stage in the mid 1980s."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media and public opinion ===

Media and public relations played a central role in the war, due to their influence on morale at home and the dynamics of international involvement. Both sides relied heavily on external support.&lt;ref name=HeertenMoses2014page174 /&gt;&lt;ref name=HeertenMoses2014page175 /&gt;

Media campaigns focused on the plight of the Biafrans intensified internationally in the summer of 1968.&lt;ref name=OSullivan2014page302 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffin2015page124 /&gt; By the Biafran leadership and then around the world, the pogroms and famine were classified as [[genocide]] and compared to the [[Holocaust]]; [[Igbo Jews|hypothetical Judaic origins of the Igbos]] were used to bolster comparisons with Jews in Germany. In the international press, Igbo refugee camps were compared to Nazi extermination camps.&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), pp. 178–179. "Further elevating the genocide reproaches, the eastern (later the Biafran) leadership frequently made comparisons to the Holocaust to draw attention to their cause. This analogy originated in ethnological genealogies that cast the Igbos as the 'Jews of Africa', even as one of Israel's 'lost tribes'. The Biafran leadership drew on this representation that many eastern Nigerians had adopted as their self-perception. This analogy, combined with the genocide charge, was used by the leadership to secure the support of the population, and to build loyalty to Biafra by emphasising the threat from a common enemy. The 'Jews of Africa' envisioned their state like an 'African Israel', a new nation born of genocidal violence. / Soon, the growing cast of Biafra's supporters around the globe adopted this rhetoric, further elaborating it in the process. After the publication of images of starving Biafran children in the western media, analogies and comparisons with the Holocaust abounded internationally."&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanitarian appeals differed somewhat from place to place. In Britain, humanitarian aid used familiar discourses of imperial responsibility; in Ireland, advertisements appealed to shared Catholicism and experiences of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, "Humanitarian Encounters" (2014), pp. 304–305. "In Britain humanitarianism became a vessel through which society could construct a new sense of national purpose; it amounted, in essence, to a benign re-imagining of imperial compassion for a postcolonial world. When the Biafran crisis erupted, it offered an opportunity to renew this emphasis on the country's responsibilities […] On the surface, the Irish response to Biafra was built on something very different to the British: a shared religion (Catholicism), a common colonial experience and a narrative of humanitarian disaster. At the launch of the JBFA in June 1968, one speaker reminded the assembled that Ireland and Nigeria were united in their knowledge of 'the horror of famine and civil war'."&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these appeals channeled older cultural values into support for the new model of international NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, "Humanitarian Encounters" (2014), pp. 305. "Yet the dominance of the decolonisation paradigm suggests that the experiences of the British and Irish NGOs were much closer than they might at first appear. From different starting points, and with differing goals, NGOs in both states assumed the mantel of organised reactions and re-imaginings of their countries' roles for the postcolonial era. Where the British public used humanitarianism to negotiate the shift from formal empire to responsible power, the changing role of Irish Catholic missionaries reflected the need to re-articulate the Irish 'spiritual empire' for this new world."&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, the Holocaust comparison was promoted, as was the theme of threat from hostile Muslim neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, "Israel, Nigeria and the Biafra civil war" (2014), p. 270. "Michal Givoni points out that after June 1967, Israelis viewed the Biafrans as a people threatened in a manner similar to Israel during the crisis period that pre- ceded the war.60 She also notes that Israel's daily newspapers reported frequently and prominently on what they termed the ‘genocide’ taking place in Nigeria. The general public in Israel, in the wake of that intense press coverage, expressed revulsion at the world's feckless response and the helplessness of the Biafran victims, which, for Israelis, recalled their own catastrophe."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Biafran war bombarded Western culture with the trope of the starving African child. The Biafran famine took media coverage of disaster to a new level, enabled by the proliferation of television sets.&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The televised disaster and the rising NGOs mutually enhanced each other; NGOs maintained their own communications networks and played a significant role in shaping news coverage.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, "Humanitarian Encounters" (2014), pp. 303–304. "As NGOs moved to centre stage in translating humanitarian concern into humanitarian action, they took on an equally important role in mediating between the lives of donors and life 'on the ground' in the Third World. Their advertisements, images and stories dominated the public narrative. In some cases, they did so in quite a direct fashion—Africa Concern, for example, established its own telex service to send up-to-date reports to the major Irish media outlets straight from west Africa, and in so doing had a considerable influence on the news agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

Biafran elites studied Western [[propaganda]] techniques and released carefully constructed public communications in an intentional fashion. Biafran propagandists had the dual task of appealing to international public opinion, and maintaining morale and nationalist spirit domestically. [[Political cartoon]]s were a preferred medium for publicising simple interpretations of the war. Biafra also used [[push poll]]ing to insinuate messages about Nigeria's inherent bloodthirstiness.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Doron, "Marketing genocide: Biafran propaganda strategies during the Nigerian civil war, 1967–70", ''Journal of Genocide Research'' 16.2–3, August 2014. "In order to organise a coherent policy, and to create a strategy to circumvent the obstacles of creating effective propaganda during wartime, the Biafrans created a series of plans, of which only one, 'Guide lines [sic] for effective propaganda' (also called Plan #4), remains. The plan's first part details the general purpose, aims, techniques, and strategies of the campaign. The second part explains how the Biafran 'propaganda man' was to deal with the unique challenges of operating in a war so close to home and a home front that was increasingly under siege, blockaded and teeming with refugees. / The authors of the guidelines studied propaganda techniques very carefully, and incorporated the lessons of Allied and Axis propaganda during World War II with strategies used in the advertising world. Thus, when the Biafrans discussed hate appeals as an effective propaganda tactic, they invoked Josef Goebbels' words, 'we are enemies of the Jews, because we are fighting for the freed of the German' alongside catchy advertising slogans such as 'Fresh up with Seven-up!'"&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Chinua Achebe]] became a committed propagandist for Biafra, and one of its leading international advocates.&lt;ref name=Jeyifo2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeyifo | first1 = Biodun | title = First, There Was A Country; Then There Wasn't: Reflections on Achebe's New Book | url = | journal = Journal of Asian and African Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 6| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 1969, Bruce Mayrock, a student at Columbia University, set himself ablaze at the premises of the [[United Nations Headquarters]] in New York, to protest the [[genocide]] against the nation and people of Biafra.&lt;ref name="El Paso Herald Post-1969"&gt;{{cite news|title=Student Dies Following Self Burning|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/69591865/|accessdate=19 June 2014|agency=El Paso Herald-Post|date=30 May 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Achebe-2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Achebe|first1=Chinua|title=There was a country : a personal history of Biafra|date=2012|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-576-6|chapter=Blood, Blood Everywhere}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia Spectator 1969"&gt;{{cite news|title=GS Student, 20, Immolates Himself In Front of U.N.|url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19690603-01.2.8&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN------|accessdate=2 June 2014|date=3 June 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ebiem-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ebiem|first1=Osita|title=30 May Biafra Independence &amp; Bruce Mayrock Story|url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2014/05/30-may-biafra-independence-bruce.html|accessdate=2 June 2014|date=26 May 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of his injuries the following day.&lt;ref name=Achebe-2012 /&gt;

== Kwale oilfield incident ==
In May 1969 a company of Biafran commandos raided an oil field in [[Kwale (Nigeria)|Kwale]] and killed 11 [[Saipem]] workers and [[Agip]] technicians. They captured three Europeans unhurt and then at a nearby [[Okpai]] Field Development Biafran commandos surrounded and captured 15 more expatriate personnel. The captives included 14 [[Italy|Italians]], 3 [[West Germany|West Germans]] and one [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]. It was claimed that the foreigners were captured fighting alongside Nigerians against Biafran troops and that they assisted Nigerians in constructing roads to aid them in their operations against Biafra. They were tried by a Biafran court and sentenced to death.

This incident caused an international uproar. In the month that followed [[Pope Paul VI]], the governments of Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America mounted concerted pressure on Biafra. On 4 June 1969, after receiving a personal direct mail from the Pope, Ojukwu pardoned the foreigners. They were released to the special envoys sent by the governments of [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Gabon]] and left Biafra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalmirroronline.net/new/the-kwale-oilfi-eld-incident-nigeria-biafra-war-2/|title=The Kwale oilfield incident: Nigeria –Biafra War (2)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423060946/http://nationalmirroronline.net/new/the-kwale-oilfi-eld-incident-nigeria-biafra-war-2/|archivedate=23 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segun.bizland.com/ojukwu.htm|title=Ojukwu on the Kwale Incident|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== End of the war ==
With increased British support, the Nigerian federal forces launched their final offensive against the Biafrans once again on 23 December 1969, with a major thrust by the [[3 Commando Brigade|3rd Marine Commando Division]]. The division was commanded by Col. [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] (who later became president twice), which succeeded in splitting the Biafran enclave into two by the end of the year. The final Nigerian offensive, named "Operation Tail-Wind", was launched on 7 January 1970 with the 3rd Marine Commando Division attacking, and supported by the 1st Infantry division to the north and the 2nd Infantry division to the south. The Biafran towns of [[Owerri]] fell on 9 January, and Uli on 11 January. Only a few days earlier, Ojukwu fled into exile by plane to the [[Ivory Coast]], leaving his deputy [[Philip Effiong]] to handle the details of the surrender to General [[Yakubu Gowon]] of the Federal Army on 13 January 1970. The surrender paper was signed on 14 January 1970 in Lagos and thus came the end of the civil war and renunciation of secession.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The war finally ended a few days later, with the Nigerian forces advancing into the remaining Biafran-held territories, which was met with little resistance.

After the war, Gowon said, "The tragic chapter of violence is just ended. We are at the dawn of national reconciliation. Once again we have an opportunity to build a new nation. My dear compatriots, we must pay homage to the fallen, to the heroes who have made the supreme sacrifice that we may be able to build a nation, great in justice, fair trade, and industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title|title=Apollo 13 - 1970 Year in Review - Audio - UPI.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atrocities against Igbo===

The war cost the Igbos a great deal in terms of lives, money and infrastructure. It has been estimated that up to three million people may have died due to the conflict, most from hunger and disease caused by Nigerian forces.&lt;ref name="ThreeMil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/genocide-encyclopedia/biafra-nigeria |publisher=eNotes.com|title=Biafra/Nigeria|accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nigerian Civil War|url=http://www.war-memorial.net/Nigerian-Civil-War--3.140|work=Polynational War Memorial|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Biafra: Thirty years on|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/596712.stm|work=Africa|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 January 2014|quote=Ethnic split: At independence, Nigeria had a federal constitution comprising three regions defined by the principal ethnic groups in the country – the Hausa and Fulani in the north, Yoruba in the south-west, and Ibo in the south-east.  Crowd The fighting led to famine and chaos but as the military took over in the mid-1960s, and the economic situation worsened, ethnic tensions broke out.

Lack of medicine also contributed. Thousands of people starved to death every day as the war progressed.&lt;ref name=Block&gt;Stevenson, "Capitol Gains" (2014), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; (The International Committee of the Red Cross in September 1968 estimated 8,000–10,000 deaths from starvation each day.)&lt;ref name=Korieh2013 /&gt; The leader of a Nigerian peace conference delegation said in 1968 that "starvation is a legitimate weapon of war and we have every intention of using it against the rebels".

=== Ethnic minorities in Biafra ===
Ethnic minorities (Ibibio, Ijaw, Ikwerre, Ogoni and others) made up approximately 40% of the Biafran population in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Omaka, Arua Oko. "The Forgotten Victims: Ethnic Minorities in the Nigeria-Biafra War, 1967-1970." Journal of Retracing Africa: Vol. 1, Issue 1 (2014): 25-40. http://encompass.eku.edu/jora/vol1/iss1/2, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The attitude of ethnic minorities in Biafra towards the conflict were initially divided early in the war, having suffered the same fate as Igbos in the North held the same fear and dread as Igbos.&lt;ref&gt;Akpan, Ntieyong U. The Struggle for Secession, 1966–1970: A Personal Account of the Nigerian Civil War. (2nd ed.). online: Routledge. p.152, {{ISBN|0714629499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, actions by Biafra authorities suggesting they favored the Igbo majority turned these attitudes negative.&lt;ref&gt;Akpan, Ntieyong U. The Struggle for Secession, 1966–1970: A Personal Account of the Nigerian Civil War. (2nd ed.). online: Routledge. p.152, "The first evidence came when the East started to recruit young men into the army. Thousands from all over the Region turned up daily for recruitment. While the Ibo candidates were regularly selected, scarcely any from non-Ibo areas were recruited." {{ISBN|0714629499}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Great suspicion was directed towards ethnic minorities and opponents of Biafra, with 'combing' exercises conducted to sift these communities for saboteurs, or 'sabo,' as they were commonly branded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Omaka |first=Arua Oko |title=The Forgotten Victims: Ethnic Minorities in the Nigeria-Biafra War, 1967–1970 |journal=Journal of Retracing Africa |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2014 |pages=25–40 |url=http://encompass.eku.edu/jora/vol1/iss1/2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This brand was widely feared, as it generally resulted in death by the Biafran forces or even mobs.&lt;ref&gt;"William Norris of the ''London Times'' who visited Biafra, also reported an eyewitness account in which some of the great men of Ibibio ethnic origin were beaten to death at Umuahia on April 2, 1968. These Ibibios who included old men and young men were apparently suspected of collaborating with advancing Nigerian troops. They were reportedly frog-marched across an open space while the local people attacked them with sticks and clubs."&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations subjected entire communities to violence in the form of killings, rapes, kidnapping and internments in camps by Biafran forces.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Douglas, Ojukwu’s Rebellion, p. 17. "Some six thousand Rivers people were sent to different refugee camps in the Igbo hinterland."&lt;/ref&gt; Biafran Organization of Freedom Fighter (BOFF) was a paramilitary organization set up by the civil defense group with instructions to suppress the enemy, and engaged in "combing" exercises in minority communities.&lt;ref&gt;The Forgotten Victims: Ethnic Minorities in the Nigeria-Biafra War, 1967-1970, African Tree Press (18 February 2007) 978-1592320134 http://encompass.eku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=jora&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Forgotten Victims: Ethnic Minorities in the Nigeria-Biafra War, 1967-1970, http://encompass.eku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&amp;context=jora "The sabotage accusation was not limited to the non-Igbo. The Onitsha people who were indisputably Igbo also suffered the same intimidation and humiliation. Many of their prominent leaders were said to have been detained by the Ojukwu-led government for allegedly contributing to the fall of Onitsha and Enugu"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atrocities against ethnic minorities in Biafra===

Minorities in Biafra suffered atrocities at the hands of those fighting for both sides of the conflict. The pogroms in the North in 1966 were indiscriminately directed against people from Eastern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
 
Despite a seemingly natural alliance between these victims of the pogroms in the north, tensions rose as minorities, who had always harbored an interest in having their own state within the Nigerian federation, were suspected of collaborating with Federal troops to undermine Biafra.&lt;ref name="Saro-Wiwa, Ken 1992"/&gt;

The Federal troops were equally culpable of this crime. In the Rivers area, ethnic minorities sympathetic to Biafra were killed in the hundreds by federal troops. In Calabar, some 2000 Efiks were also killed by Federal troops.&lt;ref name="encompass.eku.edu"/&gt; Outside of the Biafra, atrocities were recorded against the resident of Asaba in present-day Delta State by both sides of the conflict.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vanguardngr.com"/&gt;

====Genocide question====
Most continue to argue that the Biafran war was a genocide, for which no perpetrators have been held accountable.&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 187. "The prolific independent scholar Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe is perhaps the most outspoken articulator of this paradigm, which also depicts the Nigerian state as a prison house of nations, especially for the Igbo."&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of this position suggest that Igbo leaders had some responsibility, but acknowledge that starvation policies were pursued deliberately and that accountability has not been sought for the 1966 pogroms.&lt;ref name=Njoku2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), p. 188. "Ekwe-Ekwe's critics admit that the perpetrators of the 1966 massacres were never brought to justice, and that the 'federal forces did indeed try to starve the Igbos into submission, a cruel weapon' (Caplan), yet they do not draw any consequences from these facts."&lt;/ref&gt;  Biafra made a formal complaint of genocide against Igbos to the International Committee on the Investigation of Crimes of Genocide, which concluded that British colonial administrators were complicit in the process of fomenting ethnic hatred and violence, dating back to the Kano riots of 1953. With special reference to the Asaba Massacre, Emma Okocha described the killings as "the first black-on-black genocide".&lt;ref name=Korieh2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Korieh | first1 = Chima J | title = Biafra and the discourse on the Igbo Genocide | url = | journal = Journal of Asian and African Studies | volume = 46 | issue = 6| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ekwe-Ekwe places significant blame on the British.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe, "The Achebean Restoration", ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 48.6, 2013. "Britain was a central operative, along with the Nigerian state, in the planning and execution of the Igbo genocide right from its outset in 1966 to its concluding phases in 1969/1970. It was Britain's 'punishment' of the Igbo for its audacious lead of the struggle for the freeing of Nigeria from British occupation that began in the 1930s. Twice during that struggle, the occupation regime had casually watched two organised pogroms against the Igbo in north Nigeria – in 1945 and 1953. These murders, which also included the looting and destruction of tens of thousands of pounds worth of Igbo property and businesses, were carried out by pro-British political forces in the region who were opposed to the restoration of African independence but who Britain would hand over supreme political power of the country to on the eve of its so-called departure from Nigeria in 1960. The pogroms were clearly dress rehearsals for subsequent genocide. / Without British complicity, it was highly unlikely that the Igbo genocide would have been embarked on in its initial phase by the Nigerian state with such unrelenting stretch and consequences between May and October 1966. Without the massive arms support that Nigeria received from Britain especially, it was highly improbably the Nigeria would have been in the military position to pursue its second phase of the genocide–namely, the invasion of Igboland – between July 1967 and January 1970. Harold Wilson, the British prime minister at the time, was adamant, as the slaughtering worsened, that he 'would accept' the death of 'a half a million' Igbo 'if that was what it took' the Nigerian genocidists on the ground to accomplish their ghastly mission (Morris, 1977:122)." See also: Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe, "[http://www.pambazuka.net/en/category.php/comment/88468 Britain and the Igbo genocide: Now for the pertinent questions]", ''Pambazuka News'', 30 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reference to the war's consideration as a Genocide would be to Bruce Mayrock.&lt;ref name="Columbia University Libraries1969"&gt;GS Student immolates self in front of U.N. Building, Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume CXIII, Number 118, 3 June 1969&lt;/ref&gt; In the report, Mayrock, a 20-year-old Student at Columbia University, set himself on fire in protest of the killings in Biafra and how they were being overlooked. He died as a result of the burns. While at Columbia, Mayrock worked as a photographer for the Spectator sports department. Members of the youth's family stated Friday that he had worked' actively to protest the war in Biafra, writing letters about the war to the President and leading government figures. However, according to one rabbi, who said he was close to the family, the student believed that "no one was listening." "He was an idealistic young man deeply upset by the events in Biafra," the rabbi said. "People were being killed and he felt no one was doing anything. That's why he did what he did."&lt;ref&gt;Student immolates self in front of U.N. Building, Columbia Daily Spectator, Volume CXIII, Number 118, 3 June 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
Reconstruction, helped by the oil money, was swift; however, the old ethnic and religious tensions remained a constant feature of Nigerian politics. Accusations were made of Nigerian government officials diverting resources meant for reconstruction in the former Biafran areas to their ethnic areas. Military government continued in power in Nigeria for many years, and people in the oil-producing areas claimed they were being denied a fair share of oil revenues.&lt;ref&gt;With reason. The pre-1966 tax-sharing agreements on mineral wealth were changed to okay favour the Federal government at the expense of the state. This agreement has, in the 1980s, been modified to further favour the Federal government.&lt;/ref&gt; Laws were passed mandating that political parties could not be ethnically or tribally based; however, it has been hard to make this work in practice.

Igbos who ran for their lives during the pogroms and war returned to find their positions had been taken over; and when the war was over the government did not feel any need to re-instate them, preferring to regard them as having resigned. This reasoning was also extended to Igbo-owned properties and houses. People from other regions were quick to take over any house owned by an Igbo, especially in the Port Harcourt area. The Nigerian Government justified this by terming such properties abandoned. This, however, has led to a feeling of an injustice as the Nigerian government policies were seen as further economically disabling the Igbos even long after the war. Further feelings of injustice were caused by Nigeria changing its currency, so that Biafran supplies of pre-war Nigerian currency were no longer honoured. At the end of the war, only N£20 was given to any easterner regardless of the amount of money he or she had had in the bank. This was applied irrespective of their banking in pre-war Nigerian currency or Biafran currency. This was seen as a deliberate policy to hold back the Igbo middle class, leaving them with little wealth to expand their business interests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], ''On a darkling plain''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Biafra===
On 29 May 2000, ''[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]]'' reported that President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] commuted to retirement the dismissal of all military persons who fought for the breakaway state of Biafra during the Nigerian civil war. In a national broadcast, he said that the decision was based on the principle that "justice must at all times be tempered with mercy."

Biafra was more or less wiped off the map until its resurrection by the contemporary [[Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra]].&lt;ref&gt;Heerten &amp; Moses, "The Nigeria–Biafra War" (2014), pp. 189–190. "By contrast, 'Biafra' as an Igbo project of collective assertion and liberation was destroyed in 1970 and has been a taboo subject ever sense—at least until MASSOB placed it back on the agenda."&lt;/ref&gt; Chinua Achebe's last book, ''There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra'', has also rekindled discussion of the war.&lt;ref name=Jeyifo2013 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4997">&lt;!-- Note: this list is far from exhaustive. Please add and classify any additional cultures you are familiar with. This chart was based on Ed Lanning's work in the 1960s w/some cultures discovered since added --&gt;
{{no footnotes|date=July 2016}}
This is a chart of '''cultural periods of [[Peru]]  and the Andean Region''' developed by Edward Lanning and used by some archaeologists studying the area. An alternative dating system was developed by Luis Lumbreras and provides different dates for some archaeological finds.

Most of the cultures of the '''Late Horizon''' and some of the cultures of the Late Intermediate joined the [[Inca Empire]] by 1493, but the period ends in 1532 because that marks the fall of the Inca empire after the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish conquest]]. Most of the cut-off years mark either an end of a severe drought or the beginning of one. These marked a shift of the most productive farming to or from the mountains, and tended to mark the end of one culture and the rise of another.

The more recent findings concerning the [[Norte Chico civilization]] are not included on this list, as it was compiled before the site at Caral was investigated in detail.

'''Pierre Demargne''' ({{IPA-fr|dəmaʁɲ|lang}}) was born on 8 February 1903 and died on 13 December 2000. He was most notable for his work as a French historian and archaeologist.

== Biography ==
Pierre Demargne went to school at [[École Normale Supérieure|''l'École normale supérieure'']], where he took and passed the [[Agrégation|''agrégation de lettres'']] exam. He conducted his first research in [[Anatolia]], more specifically in the south coast of Turkey. In 1951, he initiated a series of archaeological excavations (financed by the French [[Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France)|Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs]]) at the ancient capital of [[Lycia]], [[Xanthos]], which was occupied from the 7th century BCE by the [[Lycia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and [[Byzantium|Byzantines]] for more than a thousand years. His discoveries from Xanthos, including monumental and funeral architecture and inscriptions, were a decisive step in our understanding of ancient Lycian civilization today.

Pierre Demargne continued his research and publications into old age: from 1926, he was a member of the [[French School at Athens]]; and from 1969 to his death, he was a member of the ''[[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]]''.

Overall, Pierre Demargne was a man of letters; however, he was also a fieldworker and renowned scientific expert, who was respected by the scientific community around the world. The majority of his career took place during a pivotal period in archaeological methods: from traditional archaeology, which was inspired from ancient texts and the hopes of finding treasure; to the more literary and artistic approaches of archaeology of the 17th and 18th centuries, which was inherited from the [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]; the archaeology of Pierre Demargne’s time was changing to ever-increasing modern methodologies and tools and also (as budgets decreased) to more systematic and rigorous field methods.

==Early life==
Randor Guy's original name was Rangadorai, but his pen name later became official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrasmusings.com/vol-26-no-17/randor-guy-remembers-it-all/|title=Randor Guy  remembers it all « Madras Musings - We Care for Madras that is Chennai|author=|date=|website=www.madrasmusings.com|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] and [[Bachelor of Law|B.

In 1976, he resigned to devote all his time to writing.

==Work as a film historian==
Guy has been writing books on history and films since 1967. He became popular when his article on [[Frank Capra]] was purchased by the [[United States Information Agency]] for use as a reference work.&lt;ref name="randor_guy_sify" /&gt; As of 2008, he remains the only non-American whose work has been acquired as reference material by the [[Federal government of the United States|Government of the United States of America]].&lt;ref name="randor_guy_sify" /&gt;

Guy is a regular columnist for such newspapers as the ''Mylapore Times'', ''[[The Hindu]]'' and ''[[The Indian Express]]''. He also writes for the film magazine, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]''. He writes on a variety of topics though he is mainly popular as a film historian and critic.

==Films==
Guy has written the screenplays for a few short documentaries and feature films. He has also produced a few advertisement films.&lt;ref name="randorguy_fernandezp164" /&gt; In 1999, he scripted a 100-minute feature film in English titled ''[[Tales of The Kama Sutra: The Perfumed Garden]]'' for a Hollywood film company, directed by [[Jag Mundhra]].&lt;ref name="randor_guy_sify" /&gt; It was subsequently dubbed into [[Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''Brahmachari''.&lt;ref name="indian_express_profile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="randor_guy_sify" /&gt; He later worked with the film's cinematographer, [[Ashok Kumar (cinematographer)|Ashok Kumar]], on his trilingual production, ''[[Kaama]]'' (1999). He has written a [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] film called ''Paradise Peak'' based on a best-selling crime novel written by him.&lt;ref name="randor_guy_sify" /&gt; His recent works include ''Kamasutra Nights: Maya'' starring actress [[Namitha]].&lt;ref name="maya_namitha"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://in.movies.yahoo.com/news-detail/19266/Sensuous-Namitha-sizzles-in-Maya.html|title=Sensuous Namitha sizzles in Maya|accessdate=25 July 2008|publisher=yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maya'' is Namitha's first film in English.&lt;ref name="maya_namitha" /&gt;

==Awards and felicitations==

==Summary==

The Revised Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money’’ includes high resolution colour images of notes from Semi-Government and Presidency Banks, which functioned until 1861.  The Government of India ([[British Raj]]) then undertook the issue of banknotes in 1861, and that is when all Early, Private, and Presidency Banks’ currency issues ceased.  The Government of India issued banknotes in 1861 which were [[uniface (numismatics)|uniface]] with a  portrait of [[Queen Victoria]], and underprinting was introduced to the portrait in the series beginning 1867.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

Vignettes in the book include the history of Indian bank notes dating back to 1770, when the Bank of Hindostan, a private bank located in [[Calcutta]] issued its first banknotes.  However, the earliest banknote to still survive is dated 1810, by the [[Bank of Bengal]].  The book includes a comprehensive listing of all Indian banknotes since 1770.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;  Early on, all paper currency of India was printed by the Bank of England and shipped to India for distribution.  The British India banknotes of King George V were also printed in England.  In 1928, the India Security Press at Nasik became functional and took over from the [[Bank of England]] Press  the printing of notes.  In 1935, the [[Reserve Bank of India]] was established, and since then it has been the only currency-issuing authority and monetary agency for India.  The King George VI Portrait Series were in circulation from 1936 till 1947. The series of King [[George V]] and King [[George VI]] were also overprinted for use in [[Burma]].  The overprinted banknotes of King George VI were also used in [[Pakistan]] until 1948.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

The book also deals with banknotes since Indian independence, up to the current series of banknotes with the portrait of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. These include the special-issue notes intended for use in the Persian Gulf for the Trucial States, as well as money used by the [[Hajj]] [[pilgrimage|pilgrims]].&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

The Osmania [[banknotes of Hyderabad]] of 1919-1953 also form a part of this book.  Also listed are the issue of banknotes by [[Jammu and Kashmir]] and the Hawala notes of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. The scope of this book includes the issues of Indo-Portuguese notes for Goa and Indo-French territories at Pondicherry.  The cash coupons of [[Indian Princely States]] that were printed on paper were issued to counteract the shortage of metal during [[World War II]].  The Prisoner of War coupons used as money by the interned prisoners of the Anglo-Boer War of 1899-1902, World War II, and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] are also illustrated.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

The book has an entire chapter on Essays, Patterns, Proofs and Trials, which displays many of the best Indian banknotes that were designed but never made it into circulation.&lt;ref name=Hindu /&gt;

The book illustrates the watermarks and explains the minute features of the notes in detail.

==Authors==

The book has been primarily authored by Rezwan Razack, the joint managing director of Prestige Groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City builders bag awards|url=http://www.hindu.com/pp/2005/11/26/stories/2005112601050200.htm|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in association with Kishore Jhunjhunwalla, the sole author of the original ‘’The Standard Reference Guide to Indian Paper Money’’.  The authors of the book also acknowledged the roles of Rekha Chandrabhanu, Bazil Shaikh, Murali Thantry, Sanjay Mittal, Mahalingeshwar Athani and Amarbir Singh, an expert on the banknotes and coins of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=IBN LIVE|title=Show me the money|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/show-me-the-money/221483-60-119.html|publisher=CNN -IBN|accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hyderabad notes are also known as [[Fath Jang, Nawab, Sir. Mir Osman Ali Khan Asif Jah VII|Osmania]] Sicca notes. The authors have dedicated a website [http://www.indianbanknotes.com indianbanknotes.com] to keep the scholars and collectors up to date on Indian Banknote research.

'''Trondheim''' ({{IPA-no|ˈtrɔnhæɪm}}; historically '''Kaupangen''', '''[[Nidaros]]''' and '''Trondhjem''') is a city and [[List of municipalities of Norway|municipality]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]]. It has a population of 193,501 (4th quarter 2017), and is the third-most populous municipality in Norway, although the [[List of continuously built-up areas in Norway by population|fourth largest]] [[urban area]]. It is the third largest city in the country, with a population (2013) of 169,972 inhabitants within the city borders.&lt;ref name="ssb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Urban settlements. Population and area, by municipality.|url=https://www.ssb.no/186162/urban-settlements.population-and-area-by-municipality.1-january-2013|date=1 January 2013|authorlink=Statistics Norway|author=Statistisk sentralbyrå}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trondheim lies on the south shore of [[Trondheim Fjord]] at the mouth of the River [[Nidelva]]. The city is dominated by the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research ([[SINTEF]]), [[St. Olavs University Hospital]] and other technology-oriented institutions.

The settlement was founded in 997 as a trading post, and it served as the capital of Norway during the [[Viking Age]] until 1217. From 1152 to 1537, the city was the seat of the Catholic [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]]; since then, it has remained the seat of the Lutheran [[Diocese of Nidaros]] and the [[Nidaros Cathedral]]. It was incorporated in 1838. The current municipality dates from 1964, when Trondheim merged with [[Byneset]], [[Leinstrand]], [[Strinda]] and [[Tiller, Norway|Tiller]].

The city functions as the seat of the County Mayor of [[Trøndelag]] county, but not as the administrative centre, which is [[Steinkjer]]. This is to make the county more efficient and not too [[centralized]], as Trøndelag is the second largest county in Norway.

{{see also|Names of Trondheim in different languages}}
The city was originally given the name by [[Olav Tryggvason]]. It was for a long time called ''{{lang|no|Nidaros}}'' ({{lang-en|Mouth of the river Nid}}), or ''{{lang|non|Niðaróss}}'' in the [[Old Norse]] spelling. But it was also just called ''{{lang|non|kaupangr}}'' ("city") or, more specifically, ''{{lang|non|kaupangr í Þróndheimi}}'' ("the city in the district {{lang|non|Þróndheimr}}", i.e. [[Trøndelag]]). In the late [[Middle Ages]] people started to call the city just ''{{lang|non|Þróndheimr}}''. In the [[Dano-Norwegian]] period, during the years as a provincial town in the united kingdoms of [[Denmark–Norway]], the city name was spelled ''{{lang|da|Trondhjem}}''.

Following the example set by the [[Tigerstaden|renaming]] of the capital ''{{lang|da|Kristiania}}'' to ''[[Oslo]]'', ''{{lang|no|Nidaros}}'' was reintroduced as the official name of the city for a brief period from 1 January 1930 until 6 March 1931. The name was restored in order to reaffirm the city's link with its glorious past, despite the fact that a 1928 [[referendum]] on the name of the city had resulted in 17,163 votes in favour of ''{{lang|da|Trondhjem}}'' and only 1,508 votes in favour of Nidaros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Terje T. V. |last=Bratberg |title=Striden om bynavnet |work=[[Arbeideravisa]] |location=Trondheim |page=27 |date=10 January 2008 |language=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Public outrage later in the same year, even taking the form of [[riot]]s, forced the [[Storting]] to settle for the medieval city name ''Trondheim''. The name of the diocese was, however, changed from ''{{lang|no|Trondhjem stift}}'' to ''{{lang|no|Nidaros bispedømme}}'' ({{lang-en|[[Diocese of Nidaros]]}}) in 1918.

Trondheim was briefly named ''{{lang|de|Drontheim}}'' during the [[Second World War]], as a [[German exonyms|German exonym]].

Historically, ''{{lang|no|Trondheimen}}'' indicates the area around [[Trondheim Fjord]]. The spelling ''Trondhjem'' was officially rejected, but many still prefer that spelling of the city's name.

== History ==
[[File:TrondheimBridge-modf.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Town Bridge]] of Trondheim]]
:''For the ecclesiastical history, see [[Archiepiscopate of Nidaros]]''

Trondheim was named Kaupangen ({{lang-en|market place or trading place}}) by [[Viking]] [[King of Norway|King]] [[Olav Tryggvason]] in 997. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Shortly thereafter it came to be called ''[[Nidaros]]''. In the beginning it was frequently used as a military retainer ([[Old Norse]]: "hird"-man) of King Olav I. It was frequently used as the seat of the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|king]], and was the capital of Norway until 1217.

People have been living in the region for thousands of years as evidenced by the [[Rock carvings in Central Norway|rock carvings in central Norway]], the [[Nøstvet and Lihult cultures]] and the [[Corded Ware culture]]. In ancient times, the [[List of Norwegian monarchs|Kings of Norway]] were hailed at [[Øretinget]] in Trondheim, the place for the assembly of all free men by the mouth of the River [[Nidelva]]. [[Harald Fairhair]] (865–933) was hailed as the king here, as was his son, [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon I]], called 'the Good'. The battle of ''[[Kalvskinnet]]'' took place in Trondheim in 1179: King [[Sverre Sigurdsson]] and his ''[[Birkebeiner]]'' warriors were victorious against [[Erling Skakke]] (a rival to the throne). Some scholars believe that the famous [[Lewis chessmen]], 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory found in the [[Hebrides]] and now at the [[British Museum]], may have been made in Trondheim. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Trondheim was the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nidaros|Archbishop of Nidaros]] for Norway from 1152, who operated from the [[Archbishop's Palace, Trondheim|Archbishop's Palace]]. Due to the introduction of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestantism in 1537, the last Archbishop, [[Olav Engelbrektsson]], had to flee from the city to the [[Seventeen Provinces|Netherlands]], where he died in present-day [[Lier, Belgium]].

The city has experienced several major fires. Since much of the city was made of wooden buildings, many of the fires caused severe damage. Great fires ravaged the city in 1598, 1651, 1681, 1708, twice in 1717, 1742, 1788, 1841 and 1842; however, these were only the worst cases and there have been several smaller fires in the city. The 1651 fire destroyed 90% of all buildings within the city limits. The fire in 1681 (the "[[1681 Trondheim fire|Horneman Fire]]") led to an almost total reconstruction of the city, overseen by General [[Johan Caspar von Cicignon]], originally from [[Luxembourg]]. Broad avenues like ''Munkegaten'' were created, with no regard for property rights, in order to stop the next fire. At the time, the city had a population of roughly 8000 inhabitants. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] on 26 February 1658, Trondheim and the rest of [[Trøndelag]], became Swedish territory for a brief period, but the area was reconquered 10 months later. The conflict was finally settled by the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]] on 27 May 1660.
[[File:Trondheim map 1898.jpg|thumb|right|City Map of Trondheim in 1898, Norwegian edition]]

During the [[Second World War]], Trondheim was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from 9 April 1940, the first day of the [[Operation Weserübung|invasion of Norway]], until the end of the war in Europe, [[VE Day|8 May 1945]]. The German invasion force consisted of the [[German cruiser Admiral Hipper]], 4 destroyers and 1700 Austrian Mountain troops. Other than a coastal battery opening fire, there was no resistance to the invasion on 9 April at 5 AM.  On 14 and 17 April, British and French forces landed near Trondheim in a failed attempt to liberate Trondheim as part of the [[Namsos Campaign]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} During the occupation, Trondheim was the home of the notorious Norwegian Gestapo agent, [[Henry Rinnan]], who operated from a nearby villa and infiltrated Norwegian Resistance groups. The city and its citizens were also subject to harsh treatment by the occupying powers, including imposition of [[Martial law in Trondheim in 1942|martial law]] in October 1942. During this time the Germans turned the city and its environs into a major base for submarines (which included building the large submarine base and bunker [[Dora I|DORA I]]), and also contemplated a scheme to build a new city for 300,000 inhabitants, ''[[Nordstern (city)|Nordstern]]'' ("Northern Star"), centred {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=off}} southwest of Trondheim, near the wetlands of [[Øysand]] in the outskirts of [[Melhus]] municipality. This new metropolis was to be accompanied by a massively expanded version of the already existing naval base, which was intended to become the primary future stronghold of the German [[Kriegsmarine]]. Today, there are few physical remains of this enormous construction project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article712500.ece Hitlers drøm om Trondheim] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Municipal history===
The city of Trondheim was established on 1 January 1838 (see [[formannskapsdistrikt]]). On 1 January 1864, part of [[Strinda]] (population: 1,229) was amalgamated with Trondheim. Then, on 1 January 1893, another part of [[Strinda]] (population: 4,097) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1952, the [[Lade, Trondheim|Lade]] area of Strinda (population: 2,230) was transferred to Trondheim. On 1 January 1964, a major municipal merger took place: the neighbouring municipalities of [[Leinstrand]] (population: 4,193), [[Byneset]] (population: 2,049), [[Strinda]] (population: 44,600), and [[Tiller, Norway|Tiller]] (population: 3,595) were all merged with the city of Trondheim (population: 56,982), which nearly doubled the population of the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dag|last=Jukvam|publisher=[[Statistics Norway|Statistisk sentralbyrå]]|title=Historisk oversikt over endringer i kommune- og fylkesinndelingen|year=1999|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/90/rapp_9913/rapp_9913.pdf|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; A transfer of [[Klæbu]] (population: 6,050) to Trondheim is planned for 1 January 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ja til sammenslåing av Klæbu og Trondheim|url=https://www.trondheim.kommune.no/content/1117754484/Ja-til-sammenslaing-av-Klabu-og-Trondheim|date=17 June 2016|author=Trondheim Kommune|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coat-of-arms and seal===
{{See also|Flag of Trondheim}}
The [[coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] dates back to the 13th century. To the left, there is an [[archbishop]] with his staff and [[mitre]] in a church archway. On the right, a crowned king holding scales in a castle archway. These two pictures rest on a base which forms an arch. Underneath that arch, are three male heads which symbolise the city's rank as Norway's first capital and the archbishop's place of residence. The scales symbolise justice and the [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] is based on the political philosophy of the 13th century, where the balance of power between king and church was an important issue. The three heads at the bottom may symbolise the city council. The motif is unique in Norwegian municipal heraldry, but similar motifs are found in bishopric cities on the continent. The design of the coat-of-arms that was adopted in 1897, and is still used today, was made by Håkon Thorsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trondheim.no/content.ap?thisId=519505|title=Trondheim's coat of arms and seal|accessdate=29 October 2008|publisher=Trondheim kommune|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208055210/http://www.trondheim.no/content.ap?thisId=519505|archive-date=8 December 2008|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish history===
{{See also|Trondheim Synagogue}}
[[Jews]] began to settle in Trondheim in 1880, after the change of the Norwegian constitution in 1851, granting Jews permission to settle in Norway.&lt;ref name="dmt.trondheim.no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmt.trondheim.no/index.php/historie |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912050905/http://www.dmt.trondheim.no/index.php/historie |archivedate=12 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first [[synagogue]] in Trondheim was established in 1899, and a newer one came into use by 1925. By 1900, 119 Jews were living in Trondheim, reaching 260 by 1940. The Nazi regime confiscated the [[synagogue]] in 1941, and used it for military uses. In January 1942, the town Jews' identification cards were stamped with the letter "J", and confiscations started to be more and more common. Shortly after, Jews from Trondheim began to emigrate to [[Sweden]]. The rest were sent to [[Auschwitz]] in October 1942. In 1945, after the end of the war, around 80 [[Jews]] returned to the city. Out of the 135 individuals sent to [[Auschwitz]], only five remained in Norway. It is unclear how many others, if any, survived. The [[synagogue]] was repaired in 1947. In May 1997, a [[Jews|Jewish]] museum was opened in Trondheim. At the turn of the 21st century, 120 Jews were living in Trondheim.&lt;ref name="dmt.trondheim.no"/&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Nidelva-Trondheim-foliage.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn [[foliage]] along Nidelva; October 2009]]
Trondheim is situated where the River Nidelva meets [[Trondheim Fjord]] with an excellent harbour and sheltered condition. The river used to be deep enough for most boats in the Middle Ages. An avalanche of mud and stones made it less navigable and partly ruined the harbour in the mid-17th century.
The municipality's top elevation is the [[Storheia]] hill, {{convert|565|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. At the summer [[solstice]], the sun rises at 03:00 and sets at 23:40, but stays just below the horizon–there is no darkness (no need for artificial lighting outdoors) from 23 May to 19 July under cloud-free conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/trondheim.html|title=Trondheim, Norway – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times for the whole year – Gaisma |publisher=Gaisma.com |date= |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the winter solstice, the sun rises at 10:01, stays very low above the horizon (at midday its altitude is slightly more than 3 degrees over the horizon), and sets at 14:31.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Winter-boreal-forest-Trondheim.jpg|thumb|left|Early winter in the hills near the city. Trondheim municipality covers large areas outside the city itself.]]
Trondheim city has an [[Oceanic climate]]. The part of the municipality further away from the fjord has colder winters. The part close to the fjord, such as the city centre, has milder winters. Trondheim is mostly sheltered from the strong south and southwesterly winds which can occur along the outer seaboard. Trondheim experiences moderate snowfall from November to March,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://senorge.no/mapPage.aspx
|title = See Norway's snow, weather, water and climate anytime anywhere|accessdate=29 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mixed with mild weather and rainfall. Based on the 1971–2000 average recorded at the airport, there are 14 days each winter with at least {{convert|25|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snow cover on the ground and 22 days with a daily minimum temperature of {{convert|-10|°C|0|abbr=on}} or less. There is often more snow and later snowmelt in suburban areas at somewhat higher elevation, such as [[Byåsen]] and [[Heimdal]], with good skiing conditions in [[Bymarka]]. Spring often sees much sunshine, but nights can be chilly. Temperatures have tended to be warmer in recent years. The [[Trøndelag]] area has seen average temperatures increase by almost {{convert|2|C-change}} in the last 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://met.no/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2007/11november/speilsalen.html|publisher=met.no|title=Nyhet fra Meteorologisk institutt|date=27 November 2007|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210081218/http://www.met.no/aktuelt/nyhetsarkiv/2007/11november/speilsalen.html|archivedate=10 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All the monthly record lows are from 1955 or older, with half of them from before 1920. The all-time high was recorded 22 July 1901, and the all-time low in February 1899. The most exceptional record is the May record low {{convert|-9.6|°C|0|abbr=on}} from 1900, 3.7&amp;nbsp;°C colder than the second coldest May night. The earliest weather stations were located closer to the city centre (Trondheim, 58 m), but from 1945 the only weather station has been located further form the centre and at a higher elevation (Voll, 127 m and Tyholt, 113 m) thus at a colder location. The lapse rate is approximately {{convert|0.6|C-change|1}} per {{convert|100|m|0|abbr=on}}, so the city centre will be about {{convert|0.6|C-change|1}} warmer than Voll, while higher altitudes than Voll will be accordingly colder.
Three of the monthly record highs are from after 2000. From 1982 - 1993 the city had weather station at Tyholt (113 m) while Voll was not operational. 
Temperatures have warmed in recent decades. The last overnight frost in June was in 1958, and the coldest night in May after year 2000 had low -2.7&amp;nbsp;°C.
A new sunrecorder was established by met.no in the city at [[Gløshaugen]] in late 2015, and recorded 1,592 sunhours in 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arstadposten.no/2017/02/10/1600-soltimer-bergen-fjor-trass-elendig-vaer-skoleferien/|publisher=årstadposten|title=Over 1600 soltimer i Bergen|date=25 June 2017|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,576 sunhours in 2017. Earlier sunrecorders had blocking issues due to terrain.

===Fauna===
The city has various wetland [[habitat]]s. among which there is the ''Gaulosen.'' The observation tower accommodates for birdwatching and providing information about birdlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trondheim.esn.no/content/trondheim|title=Trondheim|date=2014-03-02|work=ESN Trondheim|access-date=2017-07-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Trondheim being Norway's third largest city, wild animals can be seen. [[Otter]]s and [[beaver]]s thrive in Nidelva and Bymarka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article347991.ece |title = Bymarkbeveren skal holdes i sjakk|accessdate=3 August 2007|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Badger]]s and [[fox]]es are not uncommon sights. [[Moose]] and [[deer]] are common in the hills surrounding the city, and might wander into the city, especially in May when the one-year-olds are chased away by their mothers, or in late winter when food grows scarce in the snow-covered higher regions. From 2002 until 2017, a [[wolverine]] lived in Bymarka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.adressa.no/nyheter/dokument/article1077747.ece|title=Jerven som flyktet til byen|accessdate=9 May 2008|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/dyrene/norges-eldste-jerv-18-er-doed/a/24129695/|title=Norges eldste jerv (18) er død|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cityscape and sites ==
[[File:Trondheim Panorama 2006.jpg|thumb|center|750px|The [[Nidelva]] flows through Trondheim with old storehouses flanking both sides of this river. The [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and [[Old Town Bridge]] can be seen on the left side of this panorama.]]
Most of Trondheim city centre is scattered with small speciality shops. However, the main shopping area is concentrated around the pedestrianised streets ''Nordre gate'' ({{lang-en|Northern street}}), ''Olav Tryggvasons gate'' and Thomas Angells gate even though the rest of the city centre is provided with everything from old, well-established companies to new, hip and trendy shops.
[[File:TrondheimFromRoofOfNidarosdomen-improved.jpg|thumb|right|Central Trondheim as seen from the tower of the Nidaros Cathedral looking towards [[Trondheim Fjord]] and [[Munkholmen]] Island]]
[[File:Trondheim plein in 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The city's central square (Torvet)]]
In the mid- to late 1990s, the area surrounding the old [[drydock]] and ship construction buildings of the defunct [[Trondhjems mekaniske Værksted]] shipbuilding company at the [[Nedre Elvehavn]] was renovated and old industrial buildings were torn down to make way for condominiums. A shopping centre was also built, known as Solsiden (The Sunny Side). This is a popular residential and shopping area, especially for young people.

[[DORA 1]] is a [[U-boat|German submarine]] base that housed the [[13th U-boat Flotilla]] during the Second World War occupation of Norway. Today the bunker houses various archives, among them the city archives, the university and state archives. More recently, DORA has been used as a concert venue.

[[Kristiansten Fortress]], built 1681–1684, is located on a hill east in Trondheim. It repelled the invading [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1718, but was decommissioned in 1816 by Crown Prince Regent [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles John]].

A [[Olav Tryggvason (statue)|statue of Olav Tryggvason]], the founder of Trondheim, is located in the city's central square, mounted on top of an obelisk. The statue base is also a [[sun dial]], but it is calibrated to UTC+1 so that the reading is inaccurate by one hour in the summer.

The islet Munkholmen is a popular tourist attraction and recreation site. The islet has served as a place of execution, a [[monastery]], a [[fortress]], [[prison]], and a Second World War [[anti-aircraft]] gun station.

[[Stiftsgården]] is the royal residence in Trondheim, originally constructed in 1774 by [[Cecilie Christine Schøller]]. At 140 rooms constituting {{convert|4000|m2|0}}, it is possibly the largest wooden building in [[Northern Europe]], and has been used by royals and their guests since 1800.

A statue of [[Leif Ericson]] is located at the seaside, close to the old Customs Building, the cruise ship facilities and the new swimming hall. The statue is a replica, the original being located at a Seattle [[marina]].

=== Nidaros Cathedral ===
[[File:Nidaros cathedral front.jpg|thumb|Nidaros Cathedral front]]
The [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and the Archbishop's Palace are located side by side in the middle of the city centre. The cathedral, built from 1070 on, is the most important [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] monument in Norway and was Northern Europe's most important Christian [[pilgrimage]] site during the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trondheim.com/content.ap?thisId=5510350|title=Pilgrim ways in Norway, background|accessdate=4 August 2007|publisher=Trondheim kommune|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823122445/http://www.trondheim.com/content.ap?thisId=5510350|archivedate=23 August 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with pilgrimage routes leading to it from [[Oslo]] in southern Norway and from the [[Jämtland]] and [[Värmland]] regions of [[Sweden]]. Today, it is the northernmost medieval cathedral in the world, and the second largest in [[Scandinavia]].

During the Middle Ages, and again after independence was restored in 1814, the Nidaros Cathedral was the [[coronation]] church of the Norwegian kings. [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] was the last monarch to be crowned there, in 1906. Starting with [[Olav V of Norway|King Olav V]] in 1957, coronation was replaced by [[consecration]]. In 1991, the present [[Harald V of Norway|King Harald V]] and [[Queen Sonja of Norway|Queen Sonja]] were consecrated in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c27283/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28740|title=The consecration of King Harald and Queen Sonja|accessdate=3 August 2007|publisher=The Norwegian Royal Family|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192757/http://www.kongehuset.no/c27283/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28740|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 May 2002, their daughter [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Princess Märtha Louise]] married the writer [[Ari Behn]] in the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kongehuset.no/c28617/artikkel/vis.html?tid=28747|title=The wedding of Princess Märtha Louise|accessdate=3 August 2007|publisher=The Norwegian Royal Family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pilgrim's Route]] (''Pilegrimsleden'') to the site of Saint Olufs's tomb at [[Nidaros]] Cathedral, has recently been re-instated. Also known as St. Olav's Way, (''Sankt Olavs vei''), the main route, which is approximately {{convert|640|km}} long, starts in [[Oslo]] and heads North, along Lake [[Mjøsa]], up the valley [[Gudbrandsdalen]], over the mountain range [[Dovrefjell]] and down the [[Oppdal]] valley to end at [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in Trondheim. There is a Pilgrim's Office in Oslo which gives advice to pilgrims and a Pilgrim Centre in Trondheim, under the [[aegis]] of the cathedral, which awards certificates to successful [[pilgrims]] upon the completion of their journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miljostatus.no/Tema/Kulturminner/Kulturmiljoer/Pilegrimsleden/|title=Pilegrimsleden (Miljøstatus i Norge)|language=Norwegian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317032509/http://www.miljostatus.no/Tema/Kulturminner/Kulturmiljoer/Pilegrimsleden/|archivedate=17 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raju|first=Alison|year=2010|title=The Pilgrim Road to Nidaros: St Olav's Way - Oslo to Trondheim|publisher=Cicerone Press Limited|isbn=978-1-85284-314-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student culture===
[[File:Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem, front.jpeg|thumb|right|The building of the [[Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem]]]]
With students comprising almost a fifth of the population, the city of Trondheim is heavily influenced by student culture. Most noticeable is [[Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem]], the city's student society. Its characteristic round, red building from 1929 sits at the head of the bridge crossing the river southwards from the city centre. As the largest university in Norway, the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU) is the host of some 36,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = NTNU blir størst
| website = Khrono
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Student culture in Trondheim is characterised by a long-standing tradition of volunteer work. The student society is for example run by more than 1,200 volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samfundet.no/informasjon/omsamfundet.php |title = About Studentersamfundet|accessdate =18 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109182411/http://www.samfundet.no/informasjon/omsamfundet.php |archivedate = 9 November 2007|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NTNUI]], Norway's largest sports club, is among the other volunteer organisations that dominate student culture in Trondheim. Students in Trondheim are also behind two major Norwegian culture festivals, [[UKA]] and [[Isfit|The International Student Festival in Trondheim]] (ISFiT). NTNU lists over 200 student organisations with registered web pages on its servers alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://org.ntnu.no/|title = NTNU Student Organisations (in Norwegian| accessdate=18 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
Trondheim culture is parodied on the [[Monty Python]] album ''[[Another Monty Python Record]]'' in the form of the fictitious Trondheim Hammer Dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madmusic.com/song_details.aspx?SongID=27618|title = Apologies/ Trondheim Hammer Dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trondheim is also a key location in the ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Tiberian Sun]]'' universe, as it is a critical battleground for both factions.

Trondheim was the name of a planet in the Hundred Worlds of the [[Ender's Game]] book series.

== Transportation ==

[[File:Costa Victoria in Trondheim.jpg|thumb|Costa Victoria in Trondheim]]
Trondheim has an international airport, [[Trondheim Airport, Værnes]], situated in [[Stjørdal]], which is Norway's fourth largest airport in terms of passenger traffic. Værnes has non-stop connections to cities such as [[London]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Berlin]], among others. The domestic route Trondheim - Oslo is among the busiest air routes in Europe with around 2 million passengers annually. [[List of busiest passenger air routes|Busiest air routes]] 

[[File:Trondheim tram 1.jpg|thumb|right|A tram in Trondheim]]
Major railway connections are the northbound [[Nordland Line]], the eastbound [[Meråker Line]] to [[Åre]] and [[Östersund]] in Sweden, and two southbound connections to Oslo, the [[Røros Line]] and [[Dovre Line]].

The Coastal Express ships ([[Hurtigruten]]: Covering the [[Bergen]]–[[Kirkenes]] stretch of the coast) call at Trondheim, as do many [[cruise ship]]s during the summer season. Since 1994 there is also a fast commuter boat service to [[Kristiansund]], the closest coastal city to the southwest. Every morning the Hurtigruten ships have one southbound and one northbound arrivals and departures in Trondheim.

A [[Flakk%E2%80%93R%C3%B8rvik Ferry|car ferry route]] from the port of Flakk in the northwest of the municipality, connects Trondheim with [[Fosen]]. Various bridge projects over the Trondheim Fjord to replace the ferry have been planned, but none have begun construction.

Trondheim also boasts the northernmost (since closure of [[Arkhangelsk]] tram in 2004) [[tram]]way line in the world: the [[Gråkallen Line]], the last remaining segment of the [[Trondheim Tramway]], is an {{convert|8.8|km}} route (which is mostly single-track outside the innermost parts of the city; except the stretch between Breidablikk and Nordre Hoem stations) which runs from the city centre, through the [[Byåsen]] district, and up to Lian, in the large recreation area [[Bymarka]]. Trondheim boasts the world's only bicycle lift, ''[[Trampe bicycle lift|Trampe]]''.

The bus network, operated by [[AtB]], runs throughout most of the city and its suburbs. In addition, the Nattbuss (Night Bus) service ensures cheap and effective transport for those enjoying nightlife in the city centre during the weekends. The Nattbus has other prices than ordinary buses. The [[European route E6]] highway passes through the city centre of Trondheim in addition to a motorway bypass along the eastern rim of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4222">'''Roger Vacarius''' (1120&amp;ndash;1200?) was an [[Italy|Italian]] authority in [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]], who became the first known teacher of [[Roman law]] in [[England]].

==Life==
Apparently educated in [[Bologna]], Vicarius was brought to [[Canterbury]], possibly by [[Thomas Becket]], to serve as counsel to the [[archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Theobald of Bec]], in a struggle with [[Henry of Blois]], [[Bishop of Winchester]]. The case ended favorably for Theobald in 1146. Vacarius next surfaces in 1149, when he taught to crowds of those wealthy and those not. For the latter, he prepared a nine-volume compendium of the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex Justinianus]]''. The book was reputed to resolve all of the legal questions commonly debated in the schools, and became a leading textbook in the emerging university. Often described as the ''Liber pauperum'', the book gave rise to the nickname ''pauperistae'' for students of law in Oxford. Nearly complete manuscripts of this work survive in the cathedral libraries at [[Worcester]] and [[Prague]], and in the town library at [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruges, Public Library (Openbare Bibliotheek), manuscript 375&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments can be found in Oxford's [[Bodleian Library]] and in several of the college libraries at Oxford.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Despite its popularity, the new legal texts were not without opposition. King [[Stephen of England]] (who was not only king, but also a brother of Henry of Blois) silenced Vacarius, and ordered the destruction of the books of civil and canon law that Theobald had brought over from Italy with Vacarius. This royal edict seems to have been abandoned, however, after Stephen's death in 1154, and evidence suggests that civil law was soon again a favorite subject at Oxford. By 1190, two students from [[Friesland]] divided the evening between them to make a copy of the ''Liber pauperum''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

It remains unknown whether Vacarius resumed his lectures after their interruption. In the same year that Stephen died, Vacarius's old friend [[Roger de Pont L'Evêque]] was promoted to the position of [[archbishop of York]]. Roger had invited Vicarius to join him in the north as legal adviser and ecclesiastical judge, and his name appears frequently in both papal letters and the chronicles of the period, indicating that he served in this capacity. For his services, he was rewarded with a [[prebend]] in the collegiate church of secular canons at [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]]. In 1191, he was allowed to cede half to his nephew Reginald. Vacarius is last heard of in 1198, when he and the prior of [[Thurgarton]] were commissioned by [[Pope Innocent III]] to fulfill a letter referring to [[crusade]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In addition to his legal work, surviving manuscripts attest to Vacarius' deliberations on other matters as well, likely in the latter half of his life. One of these, the ''Summa de assumpto homine'', deals with the humanity of Christ, while the other, ''Summa de matrimonio'', is a legal argument about the nature of [[marriage]], in which he disputes both [[Gratian]] and [[Peter Lombard]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

It is to Vacarius that we owe most of the information that has come down to us about [[Speroni (heretic)|Speroni]], a heretic from [[Piacenza]].&lt;ref name=Heresy86&gt;Lambert ''Medieval Heresy'' 3rd Edition p. 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vita Ansgari''''' is the biography of [[Ansgar]], written by [[Rimbert]], his successor as archbishop in [[Hamburg-Bremen]]. Written in about 875 CE, the ''Vita'' is an important source in not only detailing Ansgar's missionary work in Scandinavia but in its descriptions of the everyday lives of people during the [[Viking Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Jesch |first=Judith |authorlink= |title=Women in the Viking Age |publisher=Boydell Press |year=1991 |location= |pages=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xpNRpI9zFoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |doi=  |isbn=978-0-85115-360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of English Affairs==

William's major work was '''''Historia rerum Anglicarum''''' or '''''Historia de rebus anglicis''''' ("'''History of English Affairs'''"), a history of England from 1066 to 1198, written in Latin. The work is valued by historians for detailing [[The Anarchy]] under [[Stephen of England]]. It is written in an engaging fashion and still readable to this day, containing many fascinating stories and glimpses into 12th-century life. He is a major source for stories of [[medieval revenants]], animated corpses that returned from their graves, with close parallels to [[vampire]] beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Monsters'', by [[Daniel Cohen (children's writer)|Daniel Cohen]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the only source for the bishop-pirate [[Wimund]].

The 19th-century historian [[Edward Augustus Freeman]] expressed the now outdated opinion that William was "the father of historical criticism."&lt;ref name="r11"/&gt; Indeed, he was very critical of King [[John of England|John]], who he describes as "nature's enemy",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGlynn |first=Sean |title=King John and the French invasion of England, BBC History magazine| publisher=Bristol Magazines |issn=1469-8552 |date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in general his discussion of English kings is "loyal but critical and cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Partner |first=Nancy F.|title=Serious Entertainments: The Writings of History in Twelfth-Century England |year=1977 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0226647633|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William saw his own work as being based on reliable sources, unlike [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', of which Newburgh was critical, saying "only a person ignorant of ancient history would have any doubt about how shamelessly and impudently he lies in almost everything."&lt;ref name="r22"/&gt; He criticised Geoffrey for writing a history that conflicted with the accounts found in the writings of [[Bede]].

Because belief in souls returning from the dead was common in the 12th century, William's ''Historia'' briefly recounts stories he heard about revenants, as does the work of [[Walter Map]], his southern contemporary. Although they form a minor part in each work, these folklore accounts have attracted attention within [[occultism]].&lt;ref name="r33"/&gt; He also described the arrival of [[green children of Woolpit|green children]] from "St. Martin's Land" and other mysterious, wondrous occurrences.  While he says that these have an apparent signification, he does not explain what that meaning might be: "he offers these prodigious events to his readers with questions, hesitations, and doubt&amp;nbsp;– with, in short, all the confessions of a critical and honest mind".&lt;ref&gt;Partner 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

William also composed a lengthy [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] exposition on the [[Song of Songs]] and three sermons on liturgical texts and [[Saint Alban]].

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and parameters of the field==

Jerry H. Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G. Walsh, ''Livy: His Historical Aims and Methods'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius (c.200-c.118 BC) aspired to combine the logical rigor of Thucydides with the scope of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Regna Darnell and Frederic Gleach argue that, in the Soviet Union, the Marxian theory of history was the only accepted orthodoxy, and stifled research into other schools of thought on history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Regna Darnell|author2=Frederic Gleach|title=Histories of Anthropology Annual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8jBlLIznIAC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2007|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=56|isbn=978-0803266636}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, adherents of Marx's theories argue that [[Stalinism|Stalin distorted]] [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalaffairs.net/how-stalin-distorted-marxism-2/]&lt;/ref&gt;
