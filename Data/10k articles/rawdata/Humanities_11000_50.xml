The '''Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science''' is awarded every two years by [[UNESCO]] and rewards individuals and groups in the field of [[ethics]] in [[science]].

The aim of the award is to promote ethical reflection on issues raised by advances in science and technology, and to raise global awareness of the importance of ethics in science. The prize was named after the 11th century [[Persian people|Persian]] physician and philosopher [[Avicenna]] (980-1038).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msrt.ir/en/news/46/avicenna-prize-for-ethics-in-science|title=Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science - Ministry of Science Research and Technology|website=Ministry of Science Research and Technology|language=en|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prize consists of a gold medal, a certificate, USD$10,000, and a one-week academic visit to the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]].

Since it was founded, the award has been given to four individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="201211">The '''American Civil War bibliography''' comprises books that deal in large part with the [[American Civil War]]. There are over 60,000 books on the war, with more appearing each month.&lt;ref&gt;In 2001, Jonathan Sarna estimated that over 50,000 books had already appeared, with 1,500 more appearing annually. ''American Jewish History'' 89.3 (2001) 335–337.&lt;/ref&gt; James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier stated in 2012, "No event in American history has been so thoroughly studied, not merely by historians, but by tens of thousands of other Americans who have made the war their hobby. Perhaps a hundred thousand books have been published about the Civil War."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|author1=James Lincoln Collier|author2=Christopher Collier|title=Slavery and the Coming of the Civil War: 1831 - 1861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Mt47-uzDH0C&amp;pg=PT9|year=2012|publisher=Blackstone Publishing|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There is no complete bibliography to the war; the largest guide to books is over 40 years old and lists over 6,000 of the most valuable titles as evaluated by three leading scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins, Bell Irvin Wiley, and James I. Robertson, ''Civil War Books: A Critical Bibliography'' (2 vol, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many specialized topics such as Abraham Lincoln,&lt;ref&gt;Burkhimer, Michael. ''100 Essential Lincoln Books'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; women,&lt;ref&gt;McDevitt, Theresa. ''Women and the American Civil War: An Annotated Bibliography'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and medicine&lt;ref&gt;Freemon, Frank R. ''Microbes and Minie Balls'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; have their own lengthy bibliographies. The books on major campaigns typically contain their own specialized guides to the sources and literature. The most comprehensive guide to the historiography annotates over a thousand major titles, with an emphasis on military topics.&lt;ref&gt;Woodworth, Steven; et al., eds. ''The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research'' (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;  The most recent guide to literary and non-military topics is ''A History of American Civil War Literature'' (2016) edited by Coleman Hutchison.   It emphasizes cultural studies, memory, diaries, southern literary writings, and famous novelists.&lt;ref&gt; See [https://books.google.com/books?id=ovYTCwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:A+intitle:History+intitle:of+intitle:American+intitle:Civil+intitle:War+intitle:Literature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwig7Kq54MXWAhUU3WMKHTVgA6oQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online edition at Google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chocolá''' is a [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] Southern [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site whose developmental emphasis was from [[circa|ca.]] 1000 BC to AD 200. The site lies within the [[Southern Maya area]].

Chocolá is in the [[San Pablo Jocopilas]] municipality in the southern [[Suchitepéquez]] department of [[Guatemala]]. A modern village lies on top of and within the ancient site.

==Importance of the site==
Lying on a plateau below volcanic mountain ridges to the north and east, and at a height of 500–1000 meters, the site consists of three general groupings extending over ca. 6 by 2 kilometers, oriented north-to-south. To the north, great platform mounds consisted of elite residences, with elaborate hydraulic networks of stone-lined canals bringing water in from underground springs.

[[image:Image 5 Chocola.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Excavation of Mound 5, Chocola]]

In these precincts, large palaces were built; from Structure 7-1, ca. 25 by 25 meters and 5 meters high, caches of fine complete vessels were recovered, likely [[votive deposit|dedicatory offerings]] placed during the construction of the edifice.

In the ancient central district further south, pyramidal mounds up to 25 meters held administrative structures.  [[Archaeoastronomy|Archaeoastronomical]] research has tentatively identified crucial alignments from structures in the administrative center of the city that reflect primordial measurements that underlay development of the [[Maya calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Green (2014); Kaplan and Love (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Still further south, flatter areas contained commoner houses and workshops. Thus far, hundreds of thousands of artifacts have been found, including many whole vessels, sculptured monuments and altars, and figurines, most dating to the Preclassic. Around the site are caves still sacred to local ritualists.

Researchers have hypothesized that one reason for the early development of such high complexity at Chocolá is the intensive cultivation of [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]] for long-distance trade.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Valdés (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on older as well as still accumulating evidence, scholars assume that innovative developments occurred in the southern Mesoamerican area during the Preclassic period (1500 BC – AD 200) that strongly influenced the later great Mesoamerican civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars lack a clear sense of even the broader events and processes that shaped southern Guatemala's history and gave it its peculiar and, as long assumed, seminal character. Investigations at [[Kaminaljuyu]], in the central Guatemalan highlands, and [[Takalik Abaj]], in southwestern Guatemala, over recent decades showed the strong relationship between these two regions.  These centers, along with other nearby sites, like Chocolá, participated in distinct political networks and shared ideologies, technologies, and economics.

Chocola also participated in the [[Potbelly sculpture]] tradition. One such monument was found there.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Guernsey, [https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=DAsgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 ''Sculpture and Social Dynamics in Preclassic Mesoamerica.''] - 2012 p50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological investigations==
[[Image:Stone Drain Chocola.jpg|thumb|Excavation of stone drains at Chocolá]]

A complex of more than 100 structures was discovered by Karl Sapper in the last years of the 19th century&lt;ref&gt;Sapper (1897)&lt;/ref&gt; and a few mounds were excavated by Robert Burkitt in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt (1930)&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery by Burkitt of Monument 1, a [[stela]] carved in the "Miraflores" style, sparked interest among scholars, suggestive as it was that Chocolá may have been an important polity early on with distinct political connections with Kaminaljuyu.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer (2005, p. 101)&lt;/ref&gt; This stela bears extraordinary similarities both in style and content to Kaminaljuyu Stela 10, a gigantic throne and the site's single largest monument.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (2000); Kaplan (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, long-term excavations were initiated by the Proyecto Arqueologico Chocola (PACH). These investigations are exploring the social and cultural developments that led to the rise of the Classic Maya, with sophisticated [[city-states]], [[hieroglyph]]ic literacy, exquisite ceramics, and the most advanced mathematics and astronomy in the New World.

Also in 2003 a large portion of work was focused on the division of Chocolá into three different sectors, a northern elite sector, a central administrative sector, and a southern commoner and agricultural sector. In succeeding field seasons, evidence from the first field season of subterranean water conduits was expanded to reveal an extensive water management system. Also, excavations of three structures in the north sector of the city of large, grouped edifices and platforms, included one very large elite palace structure. Excavations in the central, presumed administrative sector of particularly large pyramidal mounds revealed a very early (Middle Preclassic, or ca. 800 BC) earthen edifice. In the southern sector, excavation of a very large platform with a cobble wall recovered evidence suggesting agricultural management.

In 2017, cacao residues in ten vessels from the site, all Preclassic in style, were identified at the Hershey Company laboratory &lt;/ref&gt;(Kaplan et al. 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;, lending greater weight to the theory that cacao arboriculture existed at Chocolá early in the trajectory of Maya civilization. If Chocolá grew cacao intensively, it likely would have traded this commodity, so highly valued by the ancient Maya and other ancient Mesoamerican cultures. Given the long-standing accumulation of evidence of high or advanced hallmark traits of Maya civilization - writing, the stela-altar complex and "kingship," the Maya calendar - appearing first in the Southern Maya Region, PACH investigators have proposed a material basis for the emergence of at least some of these traits, based on the discovery of the sophisticated water management system and of possible cacao cultivation and trade.

==Water and chocolate==
[[Image:Structure 15 and associated stone drain.jpg|thumb|Chocolá Structure 15 and associated stone drain]]

Discovered between 2003 and 2005, networks of stone-lined or stone-enclosed drains and conduits, extending at least 1.5 kilometers, demonstrate sophisticated hydraulics. [[Radiocarbon dating]] situates the system in the Late Middle Preclassic period, or as early as 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan (in press)&lt;/ref&gt; Early and later Post-[[Spanish conquest of the Yucatan|Conquest]] ethnohistory attests that [[Soconusco]], [[Suchitepéquez]], and [[Escuintla]] were important centers for the production of cacao, a high water-demand plant. The same ethnohistory records very dense populations at the time of the Conquest and fierce fighting between various [[cacique]]s for control of cacao in an area where today one finds [[Mazatenango]], [[Cuyotenango]], [[San Francisco Zapotitlán|Zapotitlán]], [[San Antonio Suchitepéquez|San Antonio]], and [[Samayac]], all indicated by ethnohistory to have been significant centers of cacao production and trade, and all clustered closely around the Chocolá site.  While such ethnohistoric information cannot be relied on as direct evidence to characterize events and processes from millennia earlier, it seems reasonable to use these data as a guide for what one could look for, including evidence of large-scale exchange, perhaps most plausibly, of obsidian for cacao. If, indeed, archaeological evidence can be found to support intensive cacao cultivation at and around Chocolá, a yet stronger case will be made for the Southern Maya area as crucial to the rise of Maya civilization.

'''Christoph Hartknoch''' (1644–1687) was a [[Prussia (region)|Prussian]] [[historian]] and [[educator]].

== Biography ==

Hartknoch was born in [[Jabłonka, Szczytno County|Jablonken (Jabłonka)]] near [[Szczytno|Ortelsburg (Szczytno)]] in the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1650 the family moved to [[Pasym|Passenheim (Pasym)]]&lt;ref&gt;Z. A. Janczewski, in: Mitteilungsblatt der deutschen Minderheit im Bezirk Ermland-Masuren, 2002 {{cite web |url=http://www.republika.pl/agdm/mit_inh_63_4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060303044610/http://www.republika.pl/agdm/mit_inh_63_4.htm |archivedate=2006-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and there witnessed the brutality and horrors of the [[Tatar]] attacks, fighting for the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], in southern Prussia. His life was saved by his teacher, who shoved him out the window. Numerous villages in the region were destroyed, but Hartknoch made it to the ducal capital of [[Königsberg]].

In Königsberg Hartknoch started studying theology at a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] institute. Soon after his parents died and he had to take on jobs. He became a private teacher in [[Kaunas]] and then a rector in the Protestant school in [[Vilnius]]. He soon returned to Königsberg where books and records interested him in history.

[[Image:Torun Hartknoch.jpg|right|500px|thumb|Hartknoch features his last residence, the city of Thorn (Toruń), in his book ''Old and New Prussia'']]

In 1679 Hartknoch published a book about Prussian history, ''Old and New Prussia'', first in [[Latin]] and then in [[German language|German]], as well as a history of the church in Prussia. The works are accompanied by descriptions and illustrations of people, history, and culture, as well as copper etching illustrations of towns. He received ethnographical information from the priest [[Matthäus Prätorius]].

Hartknoch's work in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], Kaunas, and Vilnius awoke his interest in their history. He wrote a comprehensive work on the Commonwealth spanning 300 years, the first of its kind.

In 1677 the city of [[Toruń]] (Thorn) invited Hartknoch to become director at its [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], where he worked for ten years. Wearied by poverty, Hartknoch died and was buried there in 1687 at the age of 43.

Hartknoch's extensive scientific body of works contributed greatly to knowledge of Prussia, [[Pomerania]], [[Samogitia]], [[Courland]], and [[Poland]].

==Nicolaus Copernicus portrait==
In his book covering the history of Prussia, Hartknoch features an illustration of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. Hartknoch wrote: ''About the cities and castles. The famous mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus''. The book was written later in Hartknoch's life, when he was director at the {{illm|Gymnasium of Thorn|de|Thorner Gymnasium}}.

A '''citizenship test''' is an examination, written or oral, required to achieve [[citizenship]] in a country.

==Debate==
The requirements of a citizenship test is a method to control [[immigration]].

==Examples==
* [[American citizenship test]]
* [[Australian citizenship test]]
* [[Canadian Citizenship Test]]
* [[Integration law for immigrants to the Netherlands]]
* [[Life in the United Kingdom test]]
* [[Immigration to Germany#Naturalization]] ([[Citizenship Examination]])

'''Climate change and gender''' is concerned with [[gender]] differences in the context of [[climate change]] and the complex and [[intersectionality|intersecting]] power relations arising from it.&lt;ref name="Olsson"&gt;Olsson, Lennart et al. [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap13_FINAL.pdf "Livelihoods and Poverty."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C. B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 793–832. Web.(accessed October 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; By altering the [[ecosystems]] of the planet, climate change, and more specifically [[global warming]], directly impacts the human race. These effects vary for different segments of the [[population]], specifically for people of different genders.&lt;ref name="Olsson"/&gt; In many cases, women are more [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] to the negative effects of climate change because of their lower social status in most countries. Many impoverished women, especially those in the developing world, are farmers and depend on the natural environment for subsistence and income. By further limiting their already constrained access to physical, social, political, and fiscal resources, climate change often burdens women more than men.&lt;ref name="Olsson"/&gt;

Locally and globally, both governments and [[non-governmental organizations]] respond to climate change. Some of these efforts focus on mitigating the effects of climate change while others aid societies in adapting their lifestyles to changes in their environment. Most policy responses in the late 20th and early 21st century either did not focus on the social effects of climate change or did not consider gender in these efforts.&lt;ref name="Roehr"&gt;Roehr, Ulrike. [http://www.unep.org/roa/Amcen/Projects_Programme/climate_change/PreCop15/Proceedings/Gender-and-climate-change/Roehr_Gender_climate.pdf "Gender , Climate Change and Adaptation. Introduction to the Gender Dimensions."] ''unpublished paper'' (2007): n. pag. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis of gender in climate change, however, not only means applying a binary male/female system of analysis on sets of quantitative data but also scrutinizing discursive constructions that shapes power relations connected to climate change.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"&gt;MacGregor, Sherilyn. [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1467-954X.2010.01889.x "A Stranger Silence Still: The Need for Feminist Social Research on Climate Change."] ''The Sociological Review'' 57 (2010): 124–140. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

==Gender differentiated vulnerability to climate change impacts==

Gender is the collective social differences between males and females, as determined by [[culture]].&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment"&gt;CARE. [http://www.careclimatechange.org/files/adaptation/CARE_Gender_Brief_Oct2010.pdf "Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment."] Care International Climate Change Brief. (2010). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Gender is one of many components of vulnerability to climatic change.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa"&gt;Adeniji, Grace. "Adapting to climate change in Africa." Jotoafrika. no. 6 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the climate affect genders differently, magnifying existing gender inequality.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change"&gt;Aboud, Georgina. "Gender and Climate Change." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change is not gender-neutral" /&gt; Both women and men are affected by and vulnerable to climate change and global warming, but women often bear more of the burden.&lt;ref name="The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3"&gt;United Nations Development Programme. [http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/30_UNDP_GEF_MDGi2.pdf "The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326164057/http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/30_UNDP_GEF_MDGi2.pdf |date=2014-03-26 }} Millennium Development Goals and Climate Change Adaptation. (2010). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This higher vulnerability is mostly not due to biological or physical differences, but is formed by the social, institutional and legal context. Subsequently, Vulnerability is less an intrinsic feature of women and girls but rather a product of their [[marginalization]].&lt;ref name="Birkmann"&gt;Birkmann, Joern et al.[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4-wg2-chapter19.pdf "Emergent Risks and Key Vulnerabilities."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability. Part A: Global and Sectoral Aspects. Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.'' Ed. C. B. Field et al. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 1039–1099. Web. (accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, a study by the [[London School of Economics]] found that, in natural disasters in 141 countries, gender differences in deaths correlated to women’s economic and social rights in those countries.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt; Due to their social standing, women in developing countries are not generally taught [[survival skills]] like swimming or climbing, meaning they are more likely to die in a natural disaster.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr Virginie Le Masson and Lara Langston, [http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/CDKN_Gender_DRR_PolicyBrief_Final_WEB.pdf Mind the gap: new disasters agreement must be more proactive on gender]&lt;/ref&gt; When women have fewer rights and less power in society, more of them die due to climate change, but when there are equal rights for all groups, death rates are more equally matched.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;

===Agriculture===
[[File:Projected impact of climate change on agricultural yields by the 2080s, compared to 2003 levels (Cline, 2007).png|thumb|Projected impact of climate change on agricultural yields by the 2080s, compared to 2003 levels (Cline, 2007)]]
The poor and impoverished are dependent on the environment and its natural resources for [[subsistence]] and income; poverty research reveals that many of the poor are women because, as a group, they have less social power.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;
Many women in [[developing countries]] are farmers, but women as a group have trouble obtaining education, income, land, livestock, and technology, meaning climate change may negatively impact female farmers more than male farmers by further limiting their resources.&lt;ref name="Women in Agriculture"&gt;FAO. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e.pdf "Women in Agriculture: Closing the gender gap for development."] The State of Food and Agriculture. (2011) (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, women produced between 60 and 80 percent of all food in the developing world, yet they owned ten percent of all agricultural land and approximately two percent of land rights.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

As the planet warms and access to water changes, the crop yields tend to decrease.&lt;ref name="Climate change and food supply"&gt;Rosenzweig, Cynthia, and Martin L. Parry. "Potential impact of climate change on world food supply." Nature 367, no. 6459 (1994): 133-138.&lt;/ref&gt; These effects are not uniform, and they have the largest impact on areas of the world where the economy depends on agriculture and the climate is sensitive to change.&lt;ref name="Climate change and food supply" /&gt; In developing countries, women are often in charge of obtaining water, firewood, and other resources for their families, but these resources are directly impacted by climate change, meaning women must travel further and work longer to access them during crisis.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; Climate change increases burdens placed on women by society and further limits their access to education and employment.&lt;ref name="The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3" /&gt;

===Sexual abuse and disease transmission===
Natural disasters disrupt daily routines and complicate gender and family roles, which can cause victims of natural disasters to feel powerless and frustrated.&lt;ref name="Abuse and natural disasters"&gt;Curtis, Thom, Brent C. Miller, and E. Helen Berry. "Changes in reports and incidence of child abuse following natural disasters." Child abuse &amp; neglect 24, no. 9 (2000): 1151-1162.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings often result in aggression against less powerful groups.&lt;ref name="Abuse and natural disasters" /&gt; Women and children in developed and developing countries are at higher risk of [[sexual abuse]] during and after natural disasters than before.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches"&gt;Lane, Ruth, and Rebecca McNaught. "Building gendered approaches to adaptation in the Pacific." Gender &amp; Development. 17. no. 1 (2009): 67 - 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Condom use during disasters is also lower than at other times, because of decreased access to condoms.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Combined with the accelerated spread of diseases and infections in developing countries, the breakdown of the social order and the malnourishment that sometimes accompanies climate change have led to higher rates of dengue fever, malaria, [[HIV]], and STI transmission, especially for women.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Elderly women are also particularly at risk during natural disasters and times of crisis because they are more susceptible to climatically-induced health risks like disease and because they are often isolated from social support to which men and some younger women have access.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

===Increased inequalities through climate change===
Not only the impacts of  The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] concludes that there is ‘robust evidence’ for an increase of gender inequalities as a result of weather events as well as for the perpetuation of differential vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name="Olsson" /&gt; The increase of inequalities due to climate change can have several reasons. For example, girls often face more serious risks than boys due to unequal distribution of scarce resources within the household. This effect is amplified by climate change induced resource scarcity.&lt;ref name="Demetriades"&gt;Demetriades, Justina, and Emily Esplen. [http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2008.tb00473.x "The Gender Dimensions of Poverty and Climate Change Adaptation."] ''IDS Bulletin'' 39.4 (2009): 24–31. Web.(accessed October 26, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, Climate change often results in an increase of out-migration of men. This leaves women with an increased work-load at home, resulting in a ''feminization of responsibilities''.&lt;ref name="Olsson" /&gt; Climate change is predicted to increase frequency and magnitude of natural hazards such as extreme heat.&lt;ref name="Birkmann" /&gt; During and after these hazards especially women are burdened with increased care work for children, the sick and old, adding furthermore to already significant amount of household duties.&lt;ref name="Olsson" /&gt;

==Climate change policy==
Some scholars believe that climate change policy that does not address gender is not effective.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; Much of the climate change policy created before the 21st century focused on economic rather than social effects of climatic change and global warming.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate change is not gender-neutral" /&gt; Climate change research and policy began to look at gender in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; The [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW), the [[Millennium Development Goals]], and the [[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Platform for Action]] are all gender-aware initiatives that may affect climate change policy.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; While women in rural areas depend on the environment heavily, they are not usually represented in climate change decision-making processes, whether those processes are adaptative or mitigative.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;

Some of the international responses to climate change that do not address gender or employ gender-sensitive approaches include Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the [[Bali Action Plan]], and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; As of 2009, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) is the only international climate change response to have incorporated gender dimensions.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

===Mitigation and adaptation efforts===
[[Climate change mitigation|Mitigative policy]] attempts to moderate the intensity of global warming’s effects through measures like reducing [[greenhouse gases]] and enhancing sinks.&lt;ref name="Annex I: glossary"&gt;Verbruggen, A. "Annex I: glossary." Climate Change (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; According to research, men and women use their knowledge of their environments to mitigate disasters, transferring this knowledge through informal education.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Some of this knowledge includes food preservation processes, methods of construction, and understanding of natural resources in the area.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt; Examples of mitigative efforts include [[carbon emissions trading]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt; Mitigative efforts largely ignore gender.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;

[[Adaptation to global warming|Adaptive policy]] involves spontaneous or planned efforts to tolerate the negative effects of climate change and take advantage of the beneficial effects.&lt;ref name="Glossary of climate change acronyms"&gt;United Nations. [http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php "Glossary of climate change acronyms."] United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. (2012). (accessed March 18, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Men and women respond differently to climate change&lt;ref name="Hardee"&gt;Hardee, Karen. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19923153 "Population, Gender, and Climate Change."] ''BMJ (Clinical research ed.)'' 339.7731 (2009): 1157-1158. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and  subsequently also to adaptation measures, which can affect men and women unequally, when the gender perspective is ignored in the policy.&lt;ref name="Roehr"/&gt; For example, the IPCC report AR5 points out that adaptation measures in agriculture can in some cases lead to increased gender inequalities.&lt;ref name="Cramer"&gt;Cramer, Wolfgang et al. [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap18_FINAL.pdf "Detection and Attribution of Observed Impacts."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 979–1037. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Women can be important players in climate change policy because they have gendered knowledge about things like managing water resources.&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change and Gender Justice"&gt;Terry, Geraldine. Climate Change and Gender Justice. Oxfam GB, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; CARE’s research shows that, when women are in control of the family income, it is more likely to be spent on human development.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt; Women are also generally more risk averse than men and make safer decisions.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt; Yet, in 2008, the EU Commission and Council on adaptation policy did not address gender at all.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; Furthermore, gender roles and subsequent institutional and social pressures can pose constraints to adaptive capacities.&lt;ref name="Klein"&gt;Klein, Richard J.T. et al.  [http://ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5/images/uploads/WGIIAR5-Chap16_FINAL.pdf "Adaptation Opportunities, Constraints, and Limits."] ''Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014. 899–943. Web.(accessed October 22, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; One research by Jabeen&lt;ref name="Jabeen"&gt;Jabeen, H.

This decreases the ability of women to make decisions and subsequently their adaptive capacity. Some feminist scholars therefore maintain that fundamental patriarchal structures are mainly responsible for the inability to adapt to and mitigate climate change.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Boyd, Emily. [https://archive.is/20141027174654/http://practicalaction.metapress.com/content/j61l8q/?genre=issue&amp;id=doi:10.3362/9781780440088 "The Noel Kempff Project in Bolivia: Gender, Power, and Decision-Making in Climate Mitigation."] ''Climate Change and Gender Justice.

===Policy recommendations===
Some scholars recommend incorporating gender dimensions into research and using human-rights approaches like the Millennium Development Goals and CEDAW as frameworks for climate change responses.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Terry"&gt;Terry, Geraldine. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13552070802696839 "No Climate Justice without Gender Justice: An Overview of the Issues."] ''Gender &amp; Development'' 17.1 (2009): 5–18. Web.(accessed October 23, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Several organizations believe that linking mitigation and adaptation approaches, equally funding both types of efforts, and integrating gender into mitigative and adaptive policies will better address the consequences of climate change.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change" /&gt;&lt;ref name="adapting to climate change in Africa" /&gt; The UNDP mandates [[gender mainstreaming]] in all adaptation measures, meaning adaptive responses to climate change must consider gender and gender equality from their inception and cannot incorporate a gender component late in their development or only in certain areas.&lt;ref name="The Contribution of UNDP-GEF Adaptation Initiatives Towards MDG3" /&gt; Others believe that imposing mainstreaming agendas on communities can make gender-sensitive policy less effective and may even be counter-productive, emphasizing gender differences and isolating gender issues from other areas affected by climate change.&lt;ref name="Building gendered approaches" /&gt;  Most scholars and organizations working to address climate change agree that policy-makers must work with both women and men and take them into consideration at all levels.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;

In 2009, a forest-protection mechanism called [[Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation]] (REDD) was agreed upon by attendees of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt; Many development organizations praise the REDD mechanism, but others criticize its function as a market-based instrument and its impact on local communities.&lt;ref name="Climate Change Adaptation from a Gender Perspective" /&gt;

Gender inequalities do not only emerge in context of climate change as a physical reality, but also within discourses of and negotiations over climate change.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuana"&gt;Tuana, Nancy. [https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-94-007-5518-5 "Gendering Climate Knowledge for Justice: Catalyzing a New Research Agenda."] ''Research, Action and Policy: Addressing the Gendered Impacts of Climate Change.'' Ed. Margaret Alston and Kerri Whittenbury. Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands, 2013. 17–31. Web.(accessed October 21, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the fact that men are dominant in all levels of climate change debate&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; – from the science to policy, from the local to the global level.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt; 
This has an effect on climate change policies. Roehr&lt;ref name="Roehr" /&gt; notes that, while the United Nations officially committed to gender mainstreaming, in practice gender equality is not reached in the context of climate change. Little data and research results in insufficient gender awareness in enacted gender policies.&lt;ref name="Roehr" /&gt;

===Gender Differentiated Contribution to and perception of climate change===
[[File:Wangari_Maathai_in_Nairobi.jpg|thumbnail|right|“Women hold the key to Climate’s Future” - Wangari Maathai]]
Contribution to climate change is correlated to gender.&lt;ref name="Boyd" /&gt; A study on car use in Sweden for example found that men are more likely to use the car more, for longer distances and alone compared to women, thereby exhausting more CO2 than women.&lt;ref name="Polk"&gt;Polk, Merritt. [http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361920902000342 "Are Women Potentially More Accommodating than Men to a Sustainable Transportation System in Sweden?"] ''Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment'' 8.2 (2003): 75–95. Web. (accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A study of young people in Finland shows that concern over climate change has a higher impact on climate friendly consumption in women compared to men.&lt;ref name="Korkala"&gt;orkala, Essi a E, Timo T Hugg, and Jouni J K Jaakkola. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=4019576&amp;tool=pmcentrez&amp;rendertype=abstract "Awareness of Climate Change and the Dietary Choices of Young Adults in Finland: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study."] ''PLoS ONE'' 9.5 (2014): 1-9. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be incidental to differences in perception of climate change.&lt;ref name="McCright2010"&gt;McCright, Aaron M. [https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11111-010-0113-1 "The Effects of Gender on Climate Change Knowledge and Concern in the American Public."] ''Population and Environment'' 32.1 (2010): 66–87. Web.(accessed October 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Women tend to agree with the scientific opinion that anthropogenic pollution is mainly responsible for climate change (m: 56%, f: 64%) and are more concerned about its effects: 29% of men and 35% of women in the US "worry about global warming a great deal".&lt;ref name="McCright2010" /&gt;
Women furthermore possess unique skills and knowledge, which are important in building equal and sustainable responses to climate change.&lt;ref name="Habtezion"&gt;Habtezion, Zerisenay. [http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/UNDP_Policy-Brief-Overview-of-linkages-between-gender-and-climate-change.pdf "Overview of Linkages between Gender and Climate Change."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106111318/http://www.gender-climate.org/Content/Docs/Publications/UNDP_Policy-Brief-Overview-of-linkages-between-gender-and-climate-change.pdf |date=2014-11-06 }} Ed.

===Gender in Climate Science===
According to a survey conducted IPCC WGI Co-Chairs and Technical Support Unit (TSU) on April 25, 2014, many of the polled authors stated that they saw the need for a better gender balance.&lt;ref name="WGI Questionnaire"&gt;IPCC. [http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/uploads/WG1Questionnaire_Synthesis.pdf "WGI Questionnaire for WGI AR5 Authors and Review Editors - Synthesis of Results."] Bern: N. p., 2014. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the gender balance of contributors to the fifth IPCC assessment report. Only 27% of contributors to Working Group II, concerned with impacts, adaptation and vulnerability&lt;ref name="Gender balance WGII"&gt;IPCC. [http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/AR5-tools/ar5.html "AR5 Contributors, WGII."] N. p., 2014. Web.(accessed October 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and 18,5% of contributors of Working Group I, concerned with the physical science basis, are female.&lt;ref name="Gender balance WGI"&gt;IPCC. [http://www.climatechange2013.org/contributors/ "AR5 Contributors, WGI."] N. p., 2014. Web.(accessed October 27, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies to other organisation, as for example only 7% of leadership positions in the offices of National Weather Services are women.&lt;ref name="Smyth"&gt;Smyth, Ines. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27752121 "Gender in Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction, Manila, October 2008."] ''Development in Practice'' 19.6 (2009): 799–802. Web.(accessed October 20, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, a study conducted by the University of Oxford in cooperation with the Nielsen Company found that 18 of the 22 ‘most influential spokespeople on climate change’ are male.&lt;ref name="Nielsen Company"&gt;Nielsen Company. [http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/publications/downloads/070709nielsen-celeb-report.pdf "Climate Change &amp; Influential Spokespeople Global - a Global Nielsen Online Survey."] ''The Nielsen Company and the Oxford University Environmental Change Institute'', 2007. Web.(accessed October 24, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Female spokespeople were neither politicians nor scientists and their direct connection to climate change is therefore doubtful.&lt;ref name="MacGregor" /&gt; A list of prominent women scientists is available at [[Women in climate change]].
Some feminist scholars hold that the debate on climate change is not only dominated by men but also primarily shaped in ‘masculine’ principles, which limits discussions about climate change to a perspective that focuses on technical solutions.&lt;ref name="Tuana" /&gt; This perception of climate change hides subjectivity and power relations that actually condition climate change policy and science, leading to a phenomenon that Tuana&lt;ref name="Tuana"/&gt; terms ‘epistemic injustice’.
Similarly, MacGregor&lt;ref name="MacGregor"/&gt; criticizes the scientific discourse from a less quantitative perspective but focusses on discursive aspects. She attests that by framing climate change as an issue of ‘hard’ natural scientific conduct and natural security, it is kept within the traditional domains of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name="MacGregor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt; 
Seager&lt;ref name="Seager"&gt;Seager, Joni.  [http://www.URL.pdf "Death by Degrees: Taking a Feminist Hard Look at the 2° Climate Policy."]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Kvinder, Køn &amp; Forskning'' 34 (2009): 11–21. Web.(accessed October 25, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; maintains that the 2&amp;nbsp;°C aim, which is a reoccurring topic in the climate change debate, is not, as often assumed, a safe goal for all people on the planet. Rather it will ensure the stability of a patriarchal capitalism and subsequently the continuity of power for those who are powerful today.&lt;ref name="Seager"/&gt;

===Bangladesh===

As climate change progresses, access to and [[Salinity|salinization]] of water sources are becoming problems in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; When there is a lack of drinking water, women are responsible for procuring it regardless of the distance they must travel or the terrain they must cover.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; During natural disasters, [[male unemployment]] rises.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; When men become unemployed, women's responsibilities increase because they must secure and manage income and resources on top of feeding the family and caring for children and the elderly.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; As the number of men at home without income or occupation rises, more women report mental and physical abuse by their male relatives.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; To cope with climatic change, women store matches, food for the family, fodder for the livestock, medicine, and fuel sources in safe places in case of disaster.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; They also teach their children skills such as swimming to prepare them for crisis.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; The global relief agency [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]] believes that climate-resilient jobs such as duck rearing can help increase Bangladeshi women’s resilience to climate change.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;

Since the disasters of 1991, Bangladeshi women are more involved in disaster response decision-making, through local committees and community organizations established by the government and NGOs.&lt;ref name="Adaptation, Gender, and Women's Empowerment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt; As part of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]'s National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA), Bangladesh published a Poverty Reduction Strategy paper in 2005 that incorporated gender mainstreaming into its climate change adaptation plan, but as of 2008 those goals and policies were not fully implemented.&lt;ref name="Climate Change in Bangladesh" /&gt;

===South Africa===
In 2010, [[South Africa]] was the region with the largest economy in [[Africa]], yet more than half of the population lived in poverty and many were unemployed.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study"&gt;Babugura, Agnes. [http://www.americalatinagenera.org/es/documentos/2010/cop16/cambio-climatico-sudafrica.pdf "Gender and Climate Change: South Africa Case Study."] Heinrich Böll Foundation. (2010). (accessed March 30, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Impoverished populations of South Africa depend heavily on agriculture and natural resources to live.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Coal and metal ore mining were also significant contributing sectors of the economy, but are decreasing in the 21st century due to climate change and [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In 2007, the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) predicted that Africa would warm due to climate change 1.5 times more than the rest of the world and that South Africa, specifically, would be 3 - 4&amp;nbsp;°C warmer by 2100.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Water, agriculture, mining, and forestry would all be affected by these changes in temperature and weather.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; The [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|Human Sciences Research Council]] found in 2004 that 57% of South Africa's poor were at risk for negative climate change effects because they depended on rain-fed agriculture and climate change in Africa was expected to cause longer and more intense periods of [[drought]] over time.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Many of the rural poor in South Africa are women who have only limited access to property, income, credit, resources, and social power.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt;

In South Africa, men traditionally look after the livestock while women look over the garden, but in extended periods of drought, many households lose their livestock.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response to this loss and to increasing unemployment, men are turning to alcohol to deal with the [[psychological stress]].&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Some are also increasing their number of sexual partners, increasing their risk of contracting or spreading HIV.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response to these changes, more women are entering the workforce, either formally or informally. Some are now working in traditionally male occupations like mining and construction. Others are making and selling goods locally.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Social grants from the South African government further support households affected by the changing climate.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; These grants include pensions, disability payments, and child support.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In some cases, when men are responsible for the distribution of social grants in the household instead of women, they use the money to purchase alcohol.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response, the government tends to give grant money to women, which can cause domestic disputes within households.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt;

Understanding of climate change in South Africa is based mainly on experience and local knowledge, which is communicated orally.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Women tend to hold more of this knowledge than men do because of their experience with farming and gardening.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; In response to drought, some women plant crops near [[wetlands]] or other water sources.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; They also preserve food for periods of drought or crop failure.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; Despite their knowledge of climate change, many responses in South Africa (like the South African Country Study on Climate Change Vulnerability &amp; Adaptation Assessment) do not address gender.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt; While women in South Africa are represented in the government on a provincial level, there are not many women in government at a municipal level.&lt;ref name="Gender and Climate Change South Africa Case Study" /&gt;

===India===
The [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] commissioned a film to be made on the impact of climate change women in India. Directed by Krishnendu Bose, the film looks at the way in which women, who make up two thirds of the farming workforce, are poorly represented in agricultural policy. It depicts the challenges faced by rural women working in agriculture where drought and flooding is harming their livelihoods and ability to farm vegetables and fish. It shows isolated stories of success where resourceful techniques are integrated into farming despite challenges from climate change and poverty, such as Rita Kamila, who feeds her chickens over her flooded fields in order to grow the number of fish that now live in her fields. She is able to earn money from the growing fish stock. The film calls upon policy makers to support local initiatives like Rita's to bolster the resilience to climate change and to enhance the work that the women are already doing to protect communities against its risks. Currently only land owning farmers are entitled to government schemes, but only 10% of land owning farmers are women, thus it is critical to scale up women's access to government schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdkn.org/resource/missing-the-forgotten-women-indias-climate-plans/?loclang=en_gb Missing: The forgotten women in India’s climate plans]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because there are many factors that can lead to '''corruption in [[local government]]''' it is hard to study [[corruption]] patterns empirically, but recently, improved research strategies and information sources have made such studies better.

==Types==
There are several types of political corruption that occur in local government. Some are more common than others, and some are more prevalent to local governments than to larger segments of government. Local governments may be more susceptible to corruption because interactions between private individuals and officials happen at greater levels of intimacy and with more frequency at more decentralized levels. Forms of corruption pertaining to money like [[bribery]], [[extortion]], [[embezzlement]], and [[political corruption|graft]] are found in local government systems. Other forms of political corruption are [[nepotism]] and [[patronage]] systems. One historical example was the [[Black Horse Cavalry]] a group of New York state legislators accused of blackmailing corporations.
 
* ''Bribery'' is the offering of something which is most often money but can also be goods or services in order to gain an unfair advantage. Common advantages can be to sway a person’s opinion, action, or decision, reduce amounts fees collected, speed up a government grants, or change outcomes of legal processes. 
* ''Extortion'' is threatening or inflicting harm to a person, their reputation, or their property in order to unjustly obtain money, actions, services, or other goods from that person. Blackmail is a form of extortion.
* ''Embezzlement'' is the illegal taking or appropriation of money or property that has been entrusted to a person but is actually owned by another. In political terms this is called graft which is when a political office holder unlawfully uses public funds for personal purposes.
* ''Nepotism'' is the practice or inclination to favor a group or person who is a relative when giving promotions, jobs, raises, and other benefits to employees. This is often based on the concept of familism which is believing that a person must always respect and favor family in all situations including those pertaining to politics and business. This leads some political officials to give privileges and positions of authority to relatives based on relationships and regardless of their actual abilities.
* ''Patronage systems'' consist of the granting favors, contracts, or appointments to positions by a local public office holder or candidate for a political office in return for political support. Many times patronage is used to gain support and votes in elections or in passing legislation. Patronage systems disregard the formal rules of a local government and use personal instead of formalized channels to gain an advantage.

==Demographic factors==

Socioeconomic characteristics and the size of the population of people that make up a municipality can be encouraging factors for local government officials to engage in corrupt practices.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} Patterns of political corruption can be found in places that have a similar demographic make-up.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} Demographic factors that have been known to lead to or increase the likelihood of corruption in a local government system are religion, race, class, size of the municipality, local economic conditions, education, political culture, and gender.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} Some factors are interrelated or can lead to other factors which may cause more corruption. {{Citation needed|reason=Data needed to verify claims|date=June 2017}}

===Size of a municipality===
Smaller municipalities tend to encourage corruption to take place within a local government. {{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}Smaller municipalities require more local officials to represent and run the local government. {{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}With more officials, it is harder to keep tabs on each one and establish a decent administration and to monitor their activities.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}Small municipalities may also have inadequate or insufficient policing and prosecution of corrupt local officials. {{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}This also encourages corruption to occur in local government because there is less likelihood of either getting caught or prosecuted, therefore, more officials may become dishonest or at least be tempted to.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}

===Condition of the local economy===
{{Original research|section|date=May 2014}}Low [[economic development]] has been found to be an encouraging factor for political corruption. Economic practices like dependence on raw material [[industries]] and [[illegal drug trade|drug trades]] are characteristic of poorer cities and areas with increased amounts of corruption. Economic dependence on certain industries will also lead to less stable governments and less money available to fund governments. Fragile economies lead to increased levels of [[poverty]] and less opportunities to get out of poverty. Poverty is a known factor that encourages corruption in local governments. Places with failing economies and poverty sometimes get loans or start aid programs to support the local economy and the people, and public officials are often able to unlawfully take the money or goods for private gain. With less money available, local officials are more likely to get lower wages, which is seen as another factor that leads to corruption. Officials who get lower [[wages]], which are not enough to provide for their necessities, will many times become corrupt and try something like embezzling money that may entrusted to them in the local treasury. Low wages can cause economic insecurity and encourage politicians to take advantage of current opportunities as public figures of authority. On the other hand, some researchers{{Who|date=May 2014}} argue that the more money a local government has to spend, the more tendency it will have to do so inefficiently, which can lead to suspicions of corruption. Overall, poorer municipalities are more often perceived to have corrupt local governments than rich ones.

===Education===
Lower levels of [[education]] which are often caused by poverty are seen as a factor which encourages corrupt government practices.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} Those with less education are not as informed as to how the government works or what rights they have under the government.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} It is easier for corrupt office-holders to conceal corrupt activities from a poorly educated public. Uneducated citizens are less likely to be aware of corruption in local governments or how to stop it, and therefore, corruption is able to remain and spread. Without some kind of political awareness, citizens will not know which candidates to elect that are honest or dishonest or other ways to prevent corruption from taking place in their local governments.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} This often leads municipalities to be continually governed by one or more corrupt local officials who use patronage or nepotistic practices to stay in office or keep influence in the government for long periods of time. When local political leaders are less educated, they will be less likely to find legitimate ways to make the municipality well-structured, productive, and successful.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}

===Political culture of municipality===
Many local governments have an established [[political culture]] with certain expectations and practices that often determine what is seen as acceptable and not acceptable in local politics. In municipalities with an undeveloped or underdeveloped political culture, [[accountability]] and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is usually low and principles of ethics in government are not established. This can encourage corruption to take hold in the local government because citizens do not know what is considered corrupt, and local officials are not afraid to be corrupt because of the low accountability.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}In some places the local governments have been corrupt for so long that the citizens think that is how it is supposed to work because that is all they have been exposed to.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}} Long periods of political instability will also lead to corruption in the government because people are unsure of how the government should operate, and thus do not know what practices are corrupt or how to stop them if they are corrupt.{{Citation needed|reason=Provide supporting data to verify claim|date=June 2017}}

'''Crown rabbi''' ({{lang-rus|казённый раввин|p=kɐˈzʲɵnːɨj rɐˈvʲːin|t=official rabbi}}) was a position in the [[Russian Empire]] given to a member of a [[Russian Jews|Jewish community]] appointed to act as an intermediary between his community and the Imperial government, to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, marriages, and divorces.  Because their main job qualification was fluency in [[Russian language|Russian]], crown rabbis were typically considered agents of the state by members of their own communities, not true [[rabbi]]s, and they often had no education in or knowledge of [[Jewish law]].

== History ==

The origins of the crown rabbinate in [[Imperial Russia]] date to the early 19th century and administrative requirements by the [[tsar]] that the Jewish community maintain and provide civil records to the Imperial government in the [[Russian language]].&lt;ref name="kehila"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/rabbonim.htm |title=Rabbonim, Rebbes, and Crown Rabbis of Lyakhovichi-An Original Publication of Lyakovichi Shtetl Website |last1=Glassman |first1=Deborah |date=December 2004 |website=jewishgen.org |publisher=Jewish Gen, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222181250/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/lyakhovichi/Rabbonim.htm |archivedate=2015-02-22 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as agent of the state===

The Russian government viewed all permissible religions as agents of the state.  [[Russian Orthodox]] priests, [[Mennonite]] ministers, [[Roman Catholic|Catholics]] as well as Jewish rabbis{{ndash}}were all required to perform certain civil duties such as registering births, deaths, and marriages, as well as other duties.  The Russians found this arrangement useful, and employed designated members of these religious communities at a tiny salary (which could be augmented by bribes by the ambitious) to perform these official functions.&lt;ref name="kehila" /&gt;

===Language requirements under Alexander I===

[[Ukase]]s by [[Tsar Alexander I]] (reigned 1801{{ndash}}1825) required the rabbis to maintain civil information in [[Russian language|Russian]] as well as Hebrew.  [[Rabbis]] in the Empire all spoke [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], but few could speak Russian or other languages considered useful by the Empire such as German and Polish.  For this reason, the Jewish communities chose an individual familiar with Russian and other required languages to perform this role, and put his name forward.  If approved by the governmental administration, they became "official" rabbis, in the sense that they acted as the intermediary between their community and the Imperial government for the required civil and other administrative duties the government required of them.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe |editor-last1=Kaplan Appel |editor-first1=Tamar |editor-link1= |title=Crown Rabbi |last1= |first1= |author-link1= |url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |date=3 August 2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |edition= |series= |volume= |isbn=9780300119039 |oclc=170203576 |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327120806/http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Crown_Rabbi |archivedate=2015-03-27 |accessdate=2015-05-31 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since rabbis most often did not speak Russian, the men put forth by the community typically were men who were not rabbis, and often they were not even particularly familiar with Jewish law.  Because of this, they were looked down upon by their communities as agents or puppets of the government, and not real rabbis, despite the title accorded them by the state.&lt;ref name="Berlin-2011"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion |editor-last1=Berlin |editor-first1=Adele |editor-link=Adele Berlin |last=Himelstein |first=Shmuel |title=Crown Rabbi |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKAaJXvUaUoC&amp;pg=PA195 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |volume= |isbn=978-0-19-973004-9 |language= |trans-title= |quote= }} p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

This new position became more formalized under [[Tsar Nicholas I]] (reigned 1825{{ndash}}1855). In 1835, new laws established these appointees as employees and officials of the Imperial government.  While continuing their record-keeping duties as before, they were also now given religious authority by the state and were also to maintain loyalty to the state among their community.  It was under these new regulations that those occupying these official posts came to be called "crown rabbis".&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===Choosing a crown rabbi===

A crown rabbi was either appointed, or elected by members of the Jewish community in which he resided.  In Kiev, shortly after Jewish residents were permitted to settle in the city in 1861, a crown rabbi was appointed.  But the local community objected, and wished to elect someone with the education and stature that they could respect, and elected their own man, Evsei Tsukkerman, instead.  He was then approved by the government, and took up the position of crown rabbi.&lt;ref name="Meir-2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meir |first=Natan M |date=2010 |orig-year= |title=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis: A History, 1859--1914 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Sc-UJsKq8gC&amp;dq |page=86  |location=[[Bloomington, IN]] |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |isbn=0253004330 |series=Kiev, Jewish Metropolis |doi=10.1080/09546545.2012.671454 |oclc=649479079 |access-date=2015-06-01 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State seminaries===

The crown rabbinate evolved, and by mid-century the government opened its own seminaries for training rabbis (supported by taxes on Jewish  communities) with a strong secular syllabus promoting the interests of the state.  The training was seven years undergraduate, followed by three years training in pedagogy or rabbinical studies.  Secular subjects were mandatory; the syllabus did include Rabbinic training ([[Talmud]], [[halakha]]) at the graduate level, but was optional and few graduates took it.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

The first graduates emerged in the 1850s, and by the following decade, new laws were passed obliging the Jewish communities to hire these graduates, although there was a lot of resistance to them as they were viewed as poorly or uneducated in Jewish matters important to the community, and a bad influence because of their years of secular indoctrination.  Few graduates found positions, and the number of them graduating went down to a trickle.  Finally, the government closed the schools down in 1873, realizing that the Jewish community regarded them as unfit for the honored position of rabbi.  The position of crown rabbi outlasted the schools, and while the government viewed the crown rabbis as being the only official rabbis, the communities continued to have rabbis schooled in the traditional ways, with the result that many communities had two rabbis, an "official" one for dealing with the Tsar, and a "spiritual" rabbi for dealing with all the traditional religious and family roles that rabbis usually dealt with.  The official rabbis were universally viewed as agents of the state by the Jewish communities.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

===The dual rabbinate===

The problem of the "dual rabbinate" continued until the 20th century and [[World War I]], with debates raging within the community itself about how to view and react to the situation.  The Orthodox accepted only their traditional spiritual rabbis as legitimate, while progressive Jews thought that rabbis should also play a role in secular concerns such as social, economic, and intellectual aspects of their communities.  Crown rabbis continued to perform their official duties all during this debate, and attended various Russian Rabbinic Congresses, such as the one in 1910.&lt;ref name="Kaplan2010" /&gt;

At the 1910 Rabinic conference the objective was to get rid of the Crown Rabbinate entirely, but this ran into problems because the Orthodox delegates by and large refused to encourage or require their (legitimate, spiritual, educated) rabbis to take on the administrative tasks fulfilled by the crown rabbis because that would require their learning Russian and to submit to the licensing authority of the Russian state which was far too much in the secular domain for an Orthodox rabbi to go.  This caused a split among the delegates among those who saw nothing wrong with learning Russian and even thought it would avoid much of the misery the Jews had undergone, however this resulted in a stalemate and no new decisions were taken about it.&lt;ref name="Wert-2004"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Jack Wertheimer |date=2004-03-20 |title=Jewish Religious Leadership: In Eastern Europe ; In Western and Central Europe ; In the United States ; In North Africa and Israel ; The representation of Jewish leadership |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvUlAQAAIAAJ |volume=II |page=431 |chapter=Reflections on the Russian Rabbinate |last=Stanislawski |first=Michael |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary |isbn=9780873340984 |doi= |oclc= |access-date=2015-06-02 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various men who became well known in the Jewish community initially served as a crown rabbi.

'''Falconry''' is  the hunting of wild animals in their natural state and habitat by means of a trained [[bird of prey]]. There are two traditional terms used to describe a person involved in falconry: a falconer flies a [[falcon]]; an austringer ([[German language|German]] origin) flies a [[hawk]] (''[[Accipiter]]'' and some [[buteo]]s and similar) or an [[eagle]] (''[[Aquila (genus)|Aquila]]'' or similar). In modern falconry, the [[red-tailed hawk]] (''Buteo jamaicensis''), the [[Harris's hawk]] (''Parabuteo unicinctus''), and the [[peregrine falcon]] (''Falco perigrinus'') are some of the more commonly used birds of prey. The practice of hunting with a conditioned falconry bird is also called "hawking" or "gamehawking", although the words "[[wikt:hawking|hawking]]" and "[[peddler|hawker]]" have become used so much to refer to petty traveling traders, that the terms "falconer" and "falconry" now apply to most use of trained birds of prey to catch game. Many contemporary practitioners still use these words in their original meaning, however.

In early English falconry literature, the word "[[falcon]]" referred to a female falcon only, while the word "[[hawk]]" or "hawke" referred to a female hawk.  A male hawk or falcon was referred to as a "tiercel" (sometimes spelled "tercel") as it was roughly one third less than the female in size.&lt;ref name="Bert, E 1619"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bert | first = E | year = 1619 | title = An Approved Treatise on Hawks and Hawking}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Latham, S 1633"&gt;{{Citation | last = Latham | first = S | year = 1633 | title = The Falcon's Lure and Cure}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maharaja Suraj Mal with a hawk.jpg|thumb|Indian king Maharaja Suraj Mal with a hawk]]
Evidence suggests that the art of falconry may have begun in [[Mesopotamia]], with the earliest accounts dating to approximately 2,000 BC.  There are also some raptor representations in the northern Altai, western Mongolia.&lt;ref name="Latham, S 1633" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iafor.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iafor.org/archives/offprints/acss2012-offprints/ACSS2012_0271.pdf|title=The Asian Conference on the Social Sciences (ACSS)|website=ACSS|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The falcon was a symbolic bird of ancient Mongol tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160701171441/http://www.mefrg.org/images/manp/educational%20resources/teachers%20notes%20-%20falconry%20in%20mongolia%20-%20english.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;  There is some disagreement about whether such early accounts document the practice of falconry (from [[The Epic of Gilgamesh]] and others) or are misinterpreted depictions of humans with birds of prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Epic of Gilgamesh}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =September 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Layard | first = A.

He is believed to have obtained firsthand knowledge of Arabic falconry during wars in the region (between June 1228 – June 1229). He obtained a copy of [[Moamyn]]'s manual on falconry and had it translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch. [[Frederick II, the Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] himself made corrections to the translation in 1241 resulting in ''De Scientia Venandi per Aves''.&lt;ref name=egerton&gt;{{Citation | last = Egerton | first = F | year = 2003 | title = A History of the Ecological Sciences : Part 8: Fredrick II of Hohenstaufen: Amateur Avian Ecologist and Behaviorist | publisher = Esa pubs | journal = Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America | volume = 84 | number = 1 | pages =40–44 | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://esapubs.org/bulletin/current/history_list/history_part8.pdf | doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2003)84[40:ahotes]2.0.co;2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Frederick II is most recognized for his falconry treatise, ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'' ("The Art of Hunting with Birds").  Written himself toward the end of his life, it is widely accepted as the first comprehensive book of falconry, but also notable in its contributions to [[ornithology]] and [[zoology]]. ''De arte venandi cum avibus'' incorporated a diversity of scholarly traditions from east to west, and is one of the earliest challenges to [[Aristotle]]'s explanations of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ferber | first = S | year = 1979 | title = Islam and The Medieval West}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =September 2013}}

Historically, falconry was a popular sport and status symbol among the [[nobility|nobles]] of [[medieval Europe]], the Middle East, and [[Mongolian Empire]]. Many historical illustrations left in Rashid al Din's "Compendium chronicles" book described falconry of the middle centuries with Mongol images.  Falconry was largely restricted to the noble classes due to the prerequisite commitment of time, money, and space.  In art and in other aspects of [[culture]] such as [[literature]], falconry remained a [[status symbol]] long after it was no longer popularly practiced.  The historical significance of falconry within lower social classes may be underrepresented in the [[archaeological record]], due to a lack of surviving evidence, especially from nonliterate [[nomad]]ic and non-[[agrarian societies]].  Within nomadic societies like the [[Bedouin]], falconry was not practiced for recreation by noblemen. Instead, falcons were trapped and hunted on small game during the winter months in order to supplement a very limited diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thesiger | first = W | year = 1959 | title = Arabian Sands | publisher = Penguin Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =September 2013}}

In the UK and parts of Europe, falconry probably reached its zenith in the 17th century,&lt;ref name="Bert, E 1619" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Latham, S 1633"/&gt; but soon faded, particularly in the late 18th and 19th centuries, as firearms became the tool of choice for hunting (this likely took place throughout Europe and Asia in differing degrees). Falconry in the UK had a resurgence in the late 19th and early 20th centuries during which time a number of falconry books were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Mitchell | first = EB | origyear = 1900 | title = The art &amp; practice of hawking | edition = 7th | year = 1971 | publisher = Charles T. Branford | place = Newton, [[Massachusetts|MA]]}}. 291 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes | date =September 2013}}  This revival led to the introduction of falconry in North America in the early 20th century.  Col R. Luff Meredith is recognized as the father of North American falconry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A brief history of North American Falconry | url = http://www.n-a-f-a.com/General_History.htm | publisher = NAFA | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150408144917/http://www.n-a-f-a.com/general_history.htm | archivedate = 2015-04-08 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century, modern veterinary practices and the advent of [[radio telemetry]] ([[transmitter]]s attached to free-flying birds) increased the average lifespan of falconry birds and allowed falconers to pursue quarry and styles of flight that had previously resulted in the loss of their hawk or falcon.

===Timeline===
* '''722–705 BC''' – An [[Assyria]]n [[bas-relief]] found in the ruins at [[Khorsabad]] during the excavation of the palace of [[Sargon II]] (Sargon II) has been claimed to depict falconry. In fact, it depicts an archer shooting at raptors and an attendant capturing a raptor. [[A. H. Layard]]'s statement in his 1853 book ''Discoveries in the Ruins of [[Nineveh]] and [[Babylon]]'' is "A falconer bearing a hawk on his wrist appeared to be represented in a bas-relief which I saw on my last visit to those ruins."
* '''680 BC''' – Chinese records describe falconry.
* '''355 AD''' – [[Nihon-shoki]], a largely mythical narrative, records hawking first arriving in Japan from [[Baekje]] as of the 16th emperor [[Nintoku]].
* '''2nd–4th century''' – the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe of the [[Goths]] learned falconry from the [[Sarmatians]].

===The Book of St Albans===
[[Image:Sibylle-Schreiner.jpg|thumb|A lady with [[peregrine falcon]] on horse]]
The often-quoted ''[[Book of St. Albans|Book of St Albans]]'' or ''Boke of St Albans'', first printed in 1486, often attributed to Dame [[Julia Berners]], provides this hierarchy of [[hawk]]s and the [[social rank]]s for which each bird was supposedly appropriate.
# [[Emperor]]:  [[Peregrine falcon]] and [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]]
# [[Monarch|King]]: [[gyrfalcon|Gyr falcon]] and the tercel of the [[gyrfalcon|gyr falcon]]
# [[Prince]]: Falcon gentle and the tercel gentle
# [[Duke]]: Falcon of the [[loch]]
# [[Earl]]: [[Eagle]]
# [[Baron]]: [[Bustard]]
# [[Knight]]: [[Saker falcon|Sacre]] and the [[Sakret|sacret]]
# [[Squire|Esquire]]: [[Lanner falcon|Lanere]] and the [[Lanneret|laneret]]
# [[Lady]]: [[Merlin (bird)|Marlyon]]
# Young man: [[Eurasian hobby|Hobby]]
# [[Yeoman]]: [[Goshawk]]
# Poor man: Tercel
# [[Priest]]: [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawk]]
# [[Asperges|Holy water clerk]]: [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Musket]]
# [[Domestic worker|Knave]] or [[servant (domestic)|servant]]: [[Common kestrel|Kestrel]]

This list, however, was mistaken in several respects.
* 6) The [[bustard]] is not a [[bird of prey]], but a [[game (food)|game]] species that was commonly hunted by falconers; this entry may have been a mistake for [[buzzard]], or for ''busard'' which is [[French language|French]] for "[[harrier (bird)|harrier]]"; but any of these would be a poor deal for [[baron]]s; some treat this entry as "bastard hawk", possibly meaning a hawk of unknown lineage, or a hawk that couldn't be identified.
* 7) Sakers were imported from abroad and very expensive, and ordinary knights and squires would be unlikely to have them.
* 8) There are contemporary records of [[Lanner falcon|lanners]] native to England.
* 10) 15) Hobbies and kestrels are historically considered to be of little use for serious falconry (the French name for the hobby is ''faucon hobereau'', ''hobereau'' meaning ''local/country [[squire]]''. That may be the source of the confusion), however King Edward I of England sent a falconer to catch hobbies for his use.  Kestrels are coming into their own as worthy hunting birds, as modern falconers dedicate more time to their specific style of hunting. While not suitable for catching game for the falconer's table, kestrels are certainly capable of catching enough quarry that they can be fed on surplus kills through the molt.
* 12) There is an opinion&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | page = 11 | issue = 36 | journal = Austringer | url = http://www.thewelshhawkingclub.com/ | title = The Welsh Hawking Club}}.&lt;/ref&gt; that, since the previous entry is the goshawk, this entry ("''Ther is a Tercell. And that is for the powere ''[= poor]'' man.''") means a male goshawk and that here "poor man" means not a labourer or beggar but someone at the bottom end of the scale of [[landowner]]s.

It can be seen that the relevance of the "Boke" to practical falconry past or present is extremely tenuous, and veteran British falconer Phillip Glasier dismissed it as "merely a formalised and rather fanciful listing of birds".

===Falconry in Britain in 1973===
A book about falconry published in 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Falconry, an illustrated introduction | first = Humphrey | last = Evans | year = 1973 | publisher = John Bartholomew &amp; Son | isbn = 0-85152-921-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; says:
* Most falconry birds used in Britain were taken from the wild, either in Britain, or taken abroad and then imported.
* Captive breeding was initiated. The book mentions a captive-bred [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]] and a brood of captive-bred [[Red-tailed hawk|redtails]]. It describes as a new and remarkable event captive breeding hybrid young in 1971 and 1972 from John Morris's female [[saker falcon|saker]] and Ronald Stevens's peregrine [[tiercel]].
* [[Peregrine falcon]]s were suffering from the post–World War II severe decline caused by [[pesticide]]s. Taking wild peregrines in Britain was only allowed to train them to keep birds off [[Royal Air Force]] airfields to prevent [[birdstrike]]s.
* The book does not mention [[telemetry#Falconry|telemetry]].
* [[Harris hawk]]s were known to falconers but unusual. For example, the book lists a falconry meet on four days in August 1971 at White Hill and Leafield in [[Dumfriesshire]] in Scotland; the hawks flown were 11 goshawks and one Harris hawk. The book felt it necessary to say what a Harris hawk is.
* The usual species for a beginner was a [[kestrel]].
* A few falconers used [[golden eagle]]s.
* Falcons in falconry would have bells on their legs so the hunters could find them.

==Birds used in contemporary falconry==
There are several [[Bird of prey|raptors]] used in falconry. They are typically classed as follows:
* "Broadwings": [[golden eagle]]s, [[buzzard]]s, [[Harris hawk]]
* "Longwings": [[peregrine falcon]]s, [[lanner falcon]], [[gyrfalcon]]
* "Shortwings": ''[[Accipiter]]''s ([[goshawk]]s)
Owls are also used, although they are far less common.

In determining whether a species can or should be used for falconry, the species' behavior in a captive environment, its responsiveness to training, and its typical prey and hunting habits are considered.To some degree, a species' reputation will determine whether it's used, although this factor is somewhat harder to objectively gauge.

===Harris's hawk (''Parabuteo unicinctus'')===
[[File:Harris' Hawk (falconry, Canada).jpg|thumb|Harris' Hawk used in falconry)]][[Image:Parabuteo unicinctus01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Falconer with [[Harris' hawk]] &lt;/center&gt;]]

''Parabuteo unicinctus'' is one of two representatives of this genus worldwide. The other is the [[white-rumped hawk]] (''Parabuteo leucorrhous''). Arguably the best rabbit or hare raptor available anywhere, the [[Harris' hawk]] is also adept at catching birds.  Often captive-bred, the Harris' hawk is remarkably popular because of its temperament and ability. The Harris hawk is found in the wild living in groups or packs and hunts cooperatively, with a social hierarchy similar to wolves.  This highly social behavior is not observed in any other bird of prey species and is very adaptable to falconry.  This genus is native to the [[Americas]] from southern Texas and Arizona to South America. The Harris hawk is often used in the modern technique of [[car hawking]] (a.k.a. drive-by falconry), where the raptor is launched from the window of a moving car at suitable prey.

===Soaring hawks and the common buzzard (''Buteo'')===
[[File:Red-tailed hawk, falconer's bird.jpg|thumb|A falconer's red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis)]]

The genus ''[[Buteo]]'', known as "hawks" in North America and not to be confused with [[vulture]]s, has worldwide distribution but is particularly well represented in North America. The [[red-tailed hawk]], [[ferruginous hawk]], and rarely, the [[red-shouldered hawk]] are all examples of species from this genus that are used in falconry today. The red-tailed hawk is hardy and versatile, taking rabbits, hares, and squirrels; given the right conditions it can catch [[geese]], [[duck]]s, [[pheasant]]s, and even [[wild turkey]]s. The red-tailed hawk is also considered a good bird for beginners. The Eurasian or [[common buzzard]] is also used, although this species requires more perseverance if [[rabbit]]s are to be hunted.

===True hawks (''Accipiter'')===
The genus ''[[Accipiter]]'' is also found worldwide. The hawk expert Mike McDermott once said, "The attack of the accipiters is extremely swift, rapid and violent in every way."  They are well known in falconry use both in Europe and North America. The [[northern goshawk]] has been trained for falconry for hundreds of years, taking a variety of birds and mammals.  Other popular ''Accipiter''s used in falconry include: the Cooper's hawk and sharp-shinned hawk in North America and the European sparrowhawk in Europe and Eurasia. New Zealand is likely to be one of the few countries to use a harrier species for falconry, there falconers successfully hunt with the [[Swamp harrier|Australasian harrier]] (''Circus approximans'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzfalconersassociation.com/falconry.html|title=Falconry|website=NZ Falconers Association|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Falconry001.JPG|thumb|right|A [[peregrine falcon]] with its lure]]

===Falcons (''Falco'')===
The genus ''[[Falcon|Falco]]'' is found worldwide and has occupied a central niche in ancient and modern falconry.  Most falcon species used in falconry are specialized predators, most adapted to capturing bird prey such as the [[peregrine falcon]] and [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]].  A notable exception is the use of desert falcons such the [[saker falcon]] in ancient and modern Middle Eastern and Asian falconry, where [[hare]]s were and are commonly taken. In North America, the [[prairie falcon]] and the [[gyrfalcon]] can capture small mammal prey (as well as gamebirds and waterfowl) in falconry, but this is rarely practiced.  Young falconers often begin practicing the art with [[American kestrel]]s, the smallest of the falcons in North America; there is debate on whether this practice should continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.americanfalconry.com/appKestrels.html | title = Should Apprentice Falconers be Allowed to Fly American Kestrels? |publisher=American falconry |date = 1992-04-14 | accessdate = 2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small species, such as [[kestrel]]s, [[Merlin (bird)|merlins]] and [[Hobby (bird)|hobbys]] can also be used for recreational bug hawking – that is, hunting large flying insects such as dragonflies and moths.

===Owls (''Strigidae'')===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017|small=y}}
[[File:Tyto alba - Cetrería - 01.jpg|thumb|A [[barn owl]] landing on a falconer's hand]]
[[Owl]]s are not closely related to hawks or falcons. There is little written in classic falconry that discusses the use of owls in falconry. However, there are at least two species that have successfully been used, the [[Eurasian eagle owl]] and the [[great horned owl]].
Successful training of owls is much different from the training of hawks and falcons, as they are hearing- rather than sight-oriented (owls can only see black and white, and are long-sighted). This often leads falconers to believe that they are less intelligent, as they are distracted easily by new or unnatural noises and they do not respond as readily to food cues. However, if trained successfully, owls show intelligence on the same level as that of hawks and falcons.

===Booted eagles (''Aquila'')===
[[File:KyrgyzEagleHuntsman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Golden eagle]] huntsman in Karakol, Kyrgyzstan]]
{{main|Hunting with eagles}}
The ''[[Aquila (genus)|Aquila]]'' (all have "booted" or feathered tarsus) genus has a nearly worldwide distribution. The more powerful types are used in falconry; for example [[golden eagle]]s have reportedly been used to hunt [[Gray wolf|wolves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The last Wolf Hawker: The Eagle Falconry of Friedrich Remmler | first = Martin | last = Hollinshead | url = http://business.virgin.net/fernhill.press/fernhill.htm | publisher = The Fernhill Press | year = 2006 | access-date = 2007-06-21 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928141630/http://business.virgin.net/fernhill.press/fernhill.htm | archive-date = 2011-09-28 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Kazakhstan]], and are now most widely used by the Altaic Kazakh eagle hunters in the western Mongolian province of [[Bayan-Ölgii Province|Bayan-Ölgii]] to hunt foxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijih.org/volumeMgr.ijih?cmd=volumeView&amp;volNo=7&amp;manuType=02|title=International Journal of Intangible Heritage|website=International Journal of Intangible Heritage|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.analytrics.org/Documents/HSS_Actes_Proceedings_2012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001924/http://www.analytrics.org/Documents/HSS_Actes_Proceedings_2012.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mefrg.org/images/falco/falco41.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084620/http://www.mefrg.org/images/falco/falco41.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="discover-bayanolgii.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discover-bayanolgii.com/eagle-hunters/|title=Eagle Hunters|date=28 December 2012|website=Discover-bayanolgii.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ijih.org/volumeMgr.ijih?cmd=volumeView&amp;volNo=9&amp;manuType=02|title=International Journal of Intangible Heritage|website=International Journal of Intangible Heritage|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other large prey, as they are in neighbouring [[Kyrgyzstan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Kyrgyzstan | first = Rowan | last = Stewart | page = 182 | publisher = Odyssey | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Most are primarily ground-oriented but will occasionally take birds. Eagles are not used as widely in falconry as other birds of prey, due to the lack of versatility in the larger species (they primarily hunt over large open ground), the greater potential danger to other people if hunted in a widely populated area, and the difficulty of training and managing an eagle. There are a little over 300 active falconers using eagles in Central Asia, with 250 in western [[Mongolia]], 50 in [[Kazakhstan]], and smaller numbers in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and western [[China]].&lt;ref name="discover-bayanolgii.com"/&gt;

===Sea eagles (''Haliaëtus'')===
Most species of genus ''[[Haliaëtus]]'' catch and eat fish, some almost exclusively. However, in countries where they are not protected, some have been effectively used in hunting for ground quarry.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Species for beginners===
In North America the capable [[red-tailed hawk]] is commonly flown by the beginner falconer during his/her apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernapprentice.com/redtail.htm|title=The Modern Apprentice - The Red-Tail Hawk|website=Themodernapprentice.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanfalconry.com/beginners.html|title=Beginners Circle|website=Americanfalconry.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinions differ on the usefulness of the kestrel for beginners due to its inherent fragility. In the UK, beginner falconers are often permitted to acquire a larger variety of birds, but the [[Harris hawk]] and [[red-tailed hawk]] remain the most commonly used for beginners and experienced falconers alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc12787/raptors/parabuteo.html |title=Harris' Hawk |publisher=Cyber city |place=[[Denmark|DK]] |accessdate=2013-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305133856/http://users.cybercity.dk/~ccc12787/raptors/parabuteo.html |archivedate=2013-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The red-tailed hawk is held in high regard in the UK due to the ease of breeding them in captivity, their inherent hardiness, and their capability hunting the rabbits and hares commonly found throughout the countryside in the UK. Many falconers in the UK and North America switch to accipiters or large falcons following their introduction with easier birds. In the USA accipiters, several types of buteos, and large falcons are only allowed to be owned by falconers who hold a general license. There are three kinds of falconry licenses in the United States, typically Apprentice class, General class, and Master class.

==Falconry around the world==
[[File:Falco berigora taranna.jpg|thumb|A [[brown falcon]] used for falconry in Tasmania]]

Falconry is currently practiced in many countries around the world.  The falconer's traditional choice of bird is the [[northern goshawk]] and [[peregrine falcon]]. In contemporary falconry in both North America and the UK they remain popular, although the [[Harris hawk]] and [[red-tailed hawk]] are likely more widely used.  The northern goshawk and the [[golden eagle]] are more commonly used in Eastern Europe than elsewhere.  In the Middle East, the [[saker falcon]] is the most traditional species flown against the [[houbara bustard]], [[sandgrouse]], [[stone-curlew]], other birds and [[hare]]s. Peregrines and other captively bred imported falcons are also commonplace. Falconry remains an important part of the Arab heritage and culture.  The [[UAE]] reportedly spends over 27 million dollars annually towards the protection and conservation of wild falcons, and has set up several state-of-the-art falcon hospitals in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uaeinteract.com/news/default.asp?ID=72|title=UAE Interact, United Arab Emirates information, news, photographs, maps and webcams|first=|last=UAEINTERACT|website=Uaeinteract.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital]] is the largest falcon hospital in the whole world.  There are two breeding farms in the Emirates, as well as those in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.  Every year, falcon beauty contests and demonstrations take place at the [[ADIHEX]] exhibition in Abu Dhabi.

[[Eurasian sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawks]] were formerly used to take a range of small birds, but are really too delicate for serious falconry and have fallen out of favour now that American species are available.

In North America and the UK, falcons usually fly only after birds. Large falcons are typically trained to fly in the "waiting-on" style, where the falcon climbs and circles above the falconer and/or dog and the quarry is flushed when the falcon is in the desired commanding position. Classical game hawking in the UK saw a [[Brace (hunting)|brace]] of [[peregrine falcon]]s flown against the [[red grouse]], or [[merlin (bird)|merlins]] in "ringing" flights after [[skylark]]s. [[Rook (bird)|Rooks]] and [[crow]]s are classic game for the larger falcons, and the [[magpie]], making up in cunning what it lacks in flying ability, is another common target. Short-wings can be flown in both open and wooded country against a variety of bird and small mammal prey.  Most hunting with large falcons requires large open tracts where the falcon is afforded opportunity to strike or seize its quarry before it reaches cover. Most of Europe practices similar styles of falconry, but with differing degrees of regulation.

[[Medieval]] falconers often rode [[horse]]s but this is now rare with the exception of contemporary Kazakh and Mongolian falconry. In [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Mongolia]], the [[golden eagle]] is traditionally flown (often from horseback), hunting game as large as [[fox]]es and [[Gray wolf|wolves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avmv20.dsl.pipex.com/Photo%20Album/Kyrgyzstan/Ishpays%20eagle.htm | title= Kyrgyz berkut, kyrgyz hunting eagle |publisher= Pipex |accessdate= 2013-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, the northern goshawk has been used for centuries.  Japan continues to honor its strong historical links with falconry ([[takagari]]) while adopting some modern techniques and technologies.

In Australia, although falconry is not specifically illegal, it is illegal to keep any type of bird of prey in captivity without the appropriate permits. The only exemption is when the birds are kept for purposes of rehabilitation (for which a licence must still be held), and in such circumstances it may be possible for a competent falconer to teach a bird to hunt and kill wild quarry, as part of its regime of rehabilitation to good health and a fit state to be released into the wild.

In New Zealand, falconry was formally legalised for one species only, the swamp/Australasian harrier (''[[Circus approximans]]'') in 2011. This was only possible with over 25 years of effort from both Wingspan National Bird of Prey Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wingspan.co.nz/falconry_education_flight_demonstrations.html| title = Wingspan National Bird of Prey Centre | place = [[New Zealand|NZ]] | accessdate= 1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Raptor Association of New Zealand (RANZ).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.raptors.org.nz/ |title= Raptor Association | place = [[New Zealand|NZ]] |accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falconry can only be practiced by people who have been issued a falconry permit by the Department of Conservation.  There are currently only four practicing falconers in New Zealand.

Tangent aspects, such as [[bird abatement]] and [[raptor rehabilitation]] also employ falconry techniques to accomplish their goals.

==Clubs and organizations==
In the UK, the British Falconers' Club (BFC) is the oldest and largest of the falconry clubs. The club was founded in 1927 by the surviving members of the Old Hawking Club, itself founded in 1864. Working closely with the Hawk Board, an advisory body representing the interests of UK bird of prey keepers, the BFC is in the forefront of raptor conservation, falconer education, and sustainable falconry. Established in 1927, the BFC now has a membership of over 1,200 falconers. It began as a small and elite club, however it is now a sizeable democratic organisation that has members from all walks of life flying hawks, falcons, and eagles at legal quarry throughout the British Isles.

The North American Falconers' Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.n-a-f-a.com/|title=North American Falconers Association|website=N-a-f-a.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (NAFA), founded in 1961, is the premier club for falconry in the US, Canada, and Mexico, and has members worldwide. See [[North American Falconers Association]]. NAFA is the primary club in the United States and has a membership from around the world.  Most USA states have their own falconry clubs. Although these clubs are primarily social, they also serve to represent falconers within the state in regards to that state's wildlife regulations.

The IAF – [[International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaf.org/|title=International Association for Falconry and Conservation of Birds of Prey - Home|website=Iaf.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1968, currently represents 130 falconry clubs and conservation organisations from 89 countries worldwide totaling over 75,000 members.

==Captive breeding and conservation==
The successful and now widespread captive breeding of birds of prey began as a response to dwindling wild populations due to persistent toxins such as [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] and [[Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane|DDT]], systematic persecution as undesirable predators, habitat loss, and the resulting limited availability of popular species for falconry, particularly the [[peregrine falcon]].  The first known raptors to breed in captivity belonged to a German falconer named Renz Waller. In 1942&amp;ndash;43, he produced two young peregrines in [[Düsseldorf]] in Germany.

[[Image:Falconry equipment.jpg|thumb|Falconry equipment]]
The first successful captive breeding of [[peregrine falcon]]s in North America occurred in the early 1970s by [[The Peregrine Fund]], Professor and falconer Heinz Meng, and other private falconer/breeders such as David Jamieson and Les Boyd who bred the first peregrines by means of artificial insemination. In Great Britain, falconer [[Phillip Glasier]] of the Falconry Centre in [[Newent, Gloucestershire]], was successful in obtaining young from more than 20 species of captive raptors.  A cooperative effort began between various government agencies, non-government organizations, and falconers to supplement various wild raptor populations in peril.  This effort was strongest in North America where significant private donations along with funding allocations through the [[Endangered Species Act]] of 1972 provided the means to continue the release of captive-bred peregrines, [[golden eagle]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, [[aplomado falcon]]s and others. By the mid-1980s, falconers had become self-sufficient as regards sources of birds to train and fly, in addition to the immensely important conservation benefits conferred by captive breeding.

Between 1972 and 2001, nearly all peregrines used for falconry in the U.S. were captive-bred from the progeny of falcons taken before the U. S. [[Endangered Species Act]] was enacted and from those few infusions of wild genes available from Canada and special circumstances.  Peregrine falcons were removed from the United States' endangered species list on August 25, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Peregrine Falcons | url =http://www.fws.gov/endangered/what-we-do/peregrine-falcon.html|work= Endangered Species Program | publisher = US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|accessdate= 23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2001, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.

Some controversy has existed over the origins of captive breeding stock used by [[The Peregrine Fund]] in the recovery of [[peregrine falcon]]s throughout the contiguous United States.  Several peregrine subspecies were included in the breeding stock, including birds of Eurasian origin.  Due to the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of the Eastern ''anatum'' (''Falco peregrinus anatum''), the near extirpation of the ''anatum'' in the Midwest,  and the limited gene pool within North American breeding stock, the inclusion of non-native [[subspecies]] was justified to optimize the [[genetic diversity]] found within the species as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Cade | first1 = TJ | last2 = Burnham | first2 = W | year = 2003 | title = The Return of the Peregrine: a North American sage of tenacity and teamwork | publisher = The Peregrine Fund}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such strategies are common in endangered species re-introduction scenarios, where dramatic population declines result in a [[genetic bottleneck]] and the loss of [[genetic diversity]].

Laws regulating the capture and import/export of wild falcons throughout the Middle East and Asia vary, and the effective enforcement of existing national and international regulations are lacking in some regions.  The proliferation of captive-bred falcons into the falcon markets of the Arabian Peninsula has likely moderated this demand for wild falcons.

==Hybrid falcons==
The species within the genus ''Falco'' are closely related and some pairings produce viable offspring.  The heavy northern [[gyrfalcon]] and Asiatic [[Saker falcon|saker]] being especially closely related, and it is not known whether the [[Altai falcon]] is a subspecies of the saker or descendants of naturally occurring hybrids. Peregrine and prairie falcons have been observed breeding in the wild and have produced offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Oliphant | first = LW | year = 1991 | title = Hybridization Between a Peregrine Falcon and a Prairie Falcon in the Wild. | journal = The Journal of Raptor Research | volume = 25 | number = 2 | pages = 36–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These pairings are thought to be rare, however [[extra-pair copulations]] between closely related species may occur more frequently and/or account for most natural occurring hybridization.  Some male first generation hybrids may have viable sperm, whereas very few first generation female hybrids lay fertile eggs.  Thus, naturally occurring hybridization is thought to be somewhat insignificant to gene flow in raptor species.

The first hybrid falcons produced in captivity occurred in western Ireland when veteran falconer Ronald Stevens and John Morris put a male [[Saker falcon|saker]] and a female [[Peregrine falcon|peregrine]] into the same moulting [[mews]] for the spring and early summer, and the two mated and produced offspring.

Captively bred hybrid falcons have been available since the late 1970s, and enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity in North America and the UK in the 1990s. Hybrids were initially "created" to combine the horizontal speed and size of the gyrfalcon with the good disposition and aerial ability of the peregrine.  Hybrid falcons first gained large popularity throughout the Arabian Peninsula, feeding a demand for particularly large and aggressive female falcons capable and willing to take on the very large [[houbara bustard]], the classic falconry quarry in the deserts of the Middle East.  These falcons were also very popular with Arab falconers as they tended to withstand a respiratory disease (''aspergillosis'' from the mold strain [[aspergillus]]) in stressful desert conditions better than other pure species from the Northern Hemisphere.

==Artificial selection and domestication==
Some believe that no species of raptor have been in captivity long enough to have undergone successful selective breeding for desired traits. Captive breeding of raptors over several generations tends to result, either deliberately, or inevitably as a result of captivity, in selection for certain traits, including:
* Ability to survive in captivity.
* Ability to breed in captivity.
* (In most cases) suitability for interactions with humans for falconry. Birds which demonstrated an unwillingness to hunt with men were most often discarded, rather than being placed in breeding projects.
* With [[gyrfalcon]]s in areas away from their natural Arctic [[tundra]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], better [[immunology|disease resistance]].
* With gyrfalcons, feather color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falconscanada.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230114821/http://falconscanada.com/ |archivedate=2013-12-30 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Escaped falconry birds==
[[File:Shaw Monument - North Facing side.JPG|thumb|The [[Shaw Monument]], a falconry observation tower in Scotland.]]
Falconers' birds are inevitably lost on occasion, though most are found again. The main reason birds can be found again is because, during free flights, birds usually wear radio transmitters or bells.  The transmitters are in the middle of the tail, on the back, or attached to the bird's legs.

Records of species becoming established in Britain after escaping or being released include:
* Escaped [[Harris hawk]]s reportedly breed in the wild in Britain.
* The return of the [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]] as a breeding bird to Britain since 1945 is due in large part to falconers' escapes: the earlier British population was wiped out by gamekeepers and egg collectors in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
* A pair of [[European eagle owl]]s bred in the wild in Yorkshire for several years, feeding largely or entirely on [[rabbit]]s. The pair are most likely captive escapees. It is not yet known if this will lead to a population becoming established.
* In 1986, a lost captive-bred female [[prairie falcon]] (which had been [[cross-foster]]ed by an adult [[peregrine falcon|peregrine]] in captivity) mated with a wild male peregrine in [[Utah]]. The prairie falcon was trapped and the eggs removed, incubated, hatched and the hybrid offspring were given to falconers.  The wild peregrine paired with another peregrine the next year.
* Falconry in Hawaii is prohibited largely due to the fears of escaped non-native birds of prey becoming established on the island chain and aggravating an already rampant problem of invasive species impacts on native wildlife and plant communities.

==Regulations==

===In Great Britain===
In sharp contrast to the US, falconry in Great Britain is permitted without a special license. However, a restriction exists of using only captive-bred birds. In the lengthy, record-breaking debates in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] during the passage of the 1981 Wildlife &amp; Countryside Bill, efforts were made by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] and other lobby groups to have falconry outlawed, but these were successfully resisted. After a centuries-old but informal existence in Britain, the sport of falconry was finally given formal legal status in Great Britain by the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]], which allowed it to continue provided all captive raptors native to the UK were officially ringed and government-registered. [[DNA]]-testing was also available to verify birds' origins. Since 1982 the British government's licensing requirements have been overseen by the Chief Wildlife Act Inspector for Great Britain, who is assisted by a panel of unpaid assistant inspectors.
[[Image:White Gyr on Block P1144.jpg|thumb|A [[gyrfalcon|white gyrfalcon]]]]
British falconers are entirely reliant upon captive-bred birds for their sport. The taking of raptors from the wild for falconry, although permitted by law under government licence, has not been allowed in recent decades.

Anyone is permitted to possess legally registered or captive-bred raptors, although falconers are anxious to point out that this is not synonymous with falconry, which specifically entails the hunting of live quarry with a trained bird.  A raptor kept merely as a pet or possession, although the law may allow it, is not considered to be a falconer's bird. Birds may be used for breeding or kept after their hunting days are over, but falconers believe it is preferable that young, fit birds are flown at quarry.

===In the United States===
In the United States, falconry is legal in all states except [[Hawaii]].  It is also illegal in the [[District of Columbia]]. A falconer must have a state permit to practice the sport. (Requirements for a federal permit were changed in 2008 and the program discontinued effective January 1, 2014.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2008-10-08/pdf/E8-23226.pdf|title=73 FR 59448|website=Gpo.gov|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Acquiring a falconry license in the United States requires an aspiring falconer to pass a written test, have equipment and facilities inspected, and serve a minimum of two years as an apprentice under a licensed falconer, during which time, the falconer may only possess one raptor. There are three classes of the falconry license, which is a permit issued jointly by the falconer's state of residence and the federal government. The aforementioned Apprentice license matriculates to a General Class license, which allows the falconer to up to three raptors at one time (some jurisdictions may further limit this). After a minimum of five years at General level, falconers may apply for a Master Class license, which allows them to keep up to five wild raptors for falconry and an unlimited number of captively-produced raptors (all must be used for falconry). Certain highly experienced master falconers may also apply to possess golden eagles for falconry.

Within the United States, a state's regulations are limited by federal law and treaties protecting raptors. Most states afford falconers an extended hunting season relative to seasons for archery and firearms, however species to be hunted, bag limits, and possession limits remain the same for both. No extended seasons for falconry exist for the hunting of migratory birds such as waterfowl and doves.

Federal regulation of falconry in North America is enforced under the statutes of the [[Migratory Bird Treaty]] Act of 1918 (MBTA), originally designed to address the rampant commercial market hunting of migratory waterbirds during the early 20th century. Birds of prey suffered extreme persecution from the early 20th century through the 1960s, where thousands of birds were shot at conspicuous migration sites and many state wildlife agencies issued bounties for carcasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Matthiessen | first = P | year = 1959 | title = Wildlife in America | publisher = Viking}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to widespread persecution and further impacts to raptor populations from DDT and other toxins, the act was amended in 1972 to include birds of prey (eagles are also protected under the [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] of 1959). Under the MBTA, it is illegal for people to "take" migratory birds, their eggs, feathers or nests.  Take is defined in the MBTA to "include by any means or in any manner, any attempt at hunting, pursuing, wounding, killing, possessing or transporting any migratory bird, nest, egg, or part thereof".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/pacific/migratorybirds/mbta.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203110142/http://www.fws.gov/pacific/migratorybirds/mbta.htm |archivedate=2010-12-03 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; Falconers are allowed to trap, and otherwise possess certain birds of prey and their feathers with special permits issued by the Migratory Bird Office of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and by state wildlife agencies (issuers of trapping permits).

The Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna ([[CITES]]) restricts the import and export of most native birds species and are listed in the CITES Appendix I, II, &amp; III.

The [[Wild Bird Conservation Act]] (WBCA), legislation put into effect circa 1993, regulates importation of any CITES-listed birds into the United States.

Some controversy exists over the issue of falconer's ownership of captively bred birds of prey. Falconry permits are issued by states in a manner that entrusts falconers to "take" (trap) and possess permitted birds and use them only for permitted activities, but does not transfer legal ownership.  No legal distinction is made between native wild trapped vs. captive bred birds of the same species. This legal position is designed to disincentivize the commercial exploitation of native wildlife.

==Falconry today==
[[File:مقناص بن سويف.jpg|thumb|Falconry]]
Falcons can live into their mid-teens, with larger hawks living longer and eagles likely to see out middle-aged owners. Through the captive breeding of rescued birds, the last 30 years have seen a great rebirth of the sport, with a host of innovations; falconry's popularity, through [[lure (falconry)|lure]] flying displays at country houses and game fairs, has probably never been higher in the past 300 years. Ornithologist [[Tim Gallagher]], editor of the [[Cornell Lab of Ornithology]]'s ''[[Living Bird]]'' magazine, documented his experiences with modern falconry in a 2008 book, ''Falcon Fever''.{{Efn | At the moment there are about 5,000 falconers around the United states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wildbirdonthefly.blogspot.com/2008/05/tim-gallaghers-got-falcon-fever.html | work =Wild Bird on the Fly | title = Tim Gallagher's got "Falcon Fever" |publisher= Google | type = [[World Wide Web]] log | format = Blog spot | accessdate = 2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Making use of the natural relationship between raptors and their prey, today, falconry is used to control pest birds and animals in urban areas, landfills, commercial buildings, and airports. Falconer [http://www.hawkeye.ca/ Dan Frankian] of Hawkeye Bird and Animal Control frequently speaks on the subject to news crews while his hawks and falcons are flying over Toronto City Hall, in an effort to control the city's gull and pigeon population.

Falconry centres or birds of prey centres house these raptors.
They are responsible for many aspects of bird of prey conservation (through keeping the birds for education and breeding). Many conduct regular flying demonstrations and educational talks, and are popular with visitors worldwide.

Such centres may also provide falconry courses, hawk walks, displays and other experiences with these raptors - see links at bottom of page for details.

== Intangible Cultural Heritage ==
{{Main|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists}}
In 2010, UNESCO inscribed falconry as a living human heritage element of eleven countries, including [[United Arab Emirates]],
[[Belgium]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Republic of Korea]], [[Mongolia]], [[Morocco]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Spain]], and [[Syrian Arab Republic]]. [[Austria]] and [[Hungary]] were added in 2012 and [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Portugal]] were added in 2016. With a total of eighteen countries, falconry is the largest multi-national nomination on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Falconry, a living human heritage|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/falconry-a-living-human-heritage-01209|website=UNESCO|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
* In historic literature of Mongols, ''The Secret History of Mongol'' has one of earliest book that described Bodonchar Munkhag, first leader of Borjigan tribe has first caught falcon and fed it until spring. Through falconry he not only survived but also made it his tribal custom. His eight generation Esukhei Baatar (hereo) was also falconry and he was father of Genghis Khan. Through Genghis Khan's Great Mongol empire, this custom was introduced to China, Korea, Japan, Europe as well as Middle East.

* In James Clavell's ''[[Shōgun (novel)|Shōgun]]'', Toranaga, one of the main characters, practices falconry throughout the book, often during or immediately before or after important plot events. His thoughts also reveal analogy between his falconry and his use of other characters towards his ends.
* The 1985 film ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]]'' involved a medieval warrior who carried a red tail hawk as a pet, but in truth, the hawk was actually his lover who had been cursed by an evil bishop to keep the two apart.

The '''''Farnese Hercules''''' ({{lang-it|Ercole Farnese}}) is an ancient statue of [[Hercules]], probably an enlarged copy made in the early third century AD and signed by Glykon, who is otherwise unknown; the name is Greek but he may have worked in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The sculpture bears the incised signature of Glykon, in Greek. Glykon, whether working in Rome or Athens, is not otherwise known.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like much [[Ancient Roman sculpture]] it is a copy or version of a much older Greek original that was well-known, in this case an original by [[Lysippos]] (or one of his circle) that would have been made in the fourth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bieber|1961}}; {{harvnb|Robertson|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The enlarged copy was made for the [[Baths of Caracalla]] in [[Rome]] (dedicated in 216 AD), where the statue was recovered in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;The chronicler [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], 1556.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now in the [[Museo Archeologico Nazionale Napoli|Museo Archeologico Nazionale]] in [[Naples]]. The heroically-scaled ''Hercules'' is one of the most famous sculptures of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haskell|Penny|1981|pages=229–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has fixed the image of the mythic hero in the European imagination.

The ''Farnese Hercules'' is a massive marble statue, following a lost original [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] in [[bronze]] through a method called [[lost wax casting]]. It depicts a muscular, yet weary, [[Hercules]] leaning on his club, which has the skin of the [[Nemean lion]] draped over it. In myths about Heracles, killing the lion was his first task. He has just performed one of the last of [[The Twelve Labours]], which is suggested by the [[Hesperides|apples of the Hesperides]] he holds behind his back.

The type was well known in antiquity, and among many other versions a Hellenistic or Roman bronze reduction, found at [[Foligno]] is in the [[Musée du Louvre]]. A small Roman marble copy can be seen in the Museum of the Ancient Agora, Athens (see illustration).

== History ==
[[Image:Hercules Farnese type Louvre Br652.jpg|thumb|left|Late Classical Greek bronze version, found at [[Foligno]] ([[Musée du Louvre]])|326x326px]]
The rediscovered statue quickly made its way into the collection of [[Alessandro Farnese (cardinal)|Cardinal Alessandro Farnese]], grandson of [[Pope Paul III]]. Alessandro Farnese was well placed to form one of the greatest collections of classical sculpture that has been assembled since Antiquity. It stood for generations in its own room at [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome]], where the statue was surrounded by frescoed depictions of the hero's mythical feats that were created by [[Annibale Carracci]] and his studio, executed in the 1590s. The Farnese statue was moved to Naples in 1787 with most of the [[Farnese Collection]] and is now displayed in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale there.

The sculpture has been reassembled and restored by degrees. According to a letter of [[Guglielmo della Porta]], the head had been recovered separately, from a well in [[Trastevere]], and was bought for Farnese through the agency of della Porta, whose legs made to complete the figure were so well-regarded that when the original legs were recovered from ongoing excavations in the Baths of Caracalla, della Porta's were retained, on [[Michelangelo]]'s advice, in part to demonstrate that modern sculptors could bear direct comparison with the ancients. The original legs, from the [[Borghese]] collection, were not reunited with the sculpture until 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haskell|Penny|1981|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goethe]], in his Italian Journey, recounts his differing impressions upon seeing the Hercules with each set of legs, however, marvelling at the clear superiority of the original ones.

Hercules is caught in a rare moment of repose. Leaning on his knobby club which is draped with the pelt of the [[Nemean Lion]], he holds the apples of the [[Hesperides]], but conceals them behind his back cradled in his right hand. Many engravings and woodcuts spread the fame of the Farnese's Hercules. By 1562 the find was already included in the set of engravings for ''Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae'' ("Mirror of Rome's Magnificence") and connoisseurs, artists, and tourists gaped at the original, which stood in the courtyard of the Palazzo Farnese, protected under the arcade. In 1590–91, during his trip to Rome, [[Hendrik Goltzius]] sketched the statue in the palazzo courtyard. Later (in 1591) Goltzius recorded the less-common rear view, in a bravura engraving (''illustration, right''), which emphasizes the already exaggerated muscular form with swelling and tapering lines that flow over the contours. The young [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] made quick sketches of the planes and massing of the statue of Hercules. Before photography, prints were the only way to put the image into many hands.

[[Image:GoltziusFarneseHerc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The ''Farnese Hercules'', engraved by [[Hendrick Goltzius]], 1591, two onlookers give scale]]
The sculpture was admired from the start, reservations about its exaggerated musculature only surfacing in the later eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haskell|Penny|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Napoleon]] remarked to [[Antonio Canova]] that its omission from the museum he accumulated in Paris was the most important gap in the collection. More than once, the sculpture was crated and made ready for shipment to Paris before the Napoleonic regime fled Naples.

== List of other ancient copies ==
The prominently sited statue was well liked by the Ancient Romans, and copies have been found in Roman palaces and gymnasiums: another, coarser copy, stood in the courtyard of Palazzo Farnese; one with the feigned (but probably ancient) inscription "Lykippos" has stood in the court of [[Palazzo Pitti]], Florence, since the sixteenth century.
Ancient copies of the statue include:
* Hercules, 2nd century AD, Roman copy, [[Uffizi Gallery]], [[Florence]].
* The “Weary Herakles” is a heavily broken Roman marble statue that was excavated in 1980 in [[Perge]], Turkey. The looted upper torso was sold to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], in 1981. The upper torso was returned to Turkey in 2011 and is now displayed with the rest of the piece at the [[Antalya Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://traffickingculture.org/encyclopedia/case-studies/weary-herakles/ Weary Herakles], Trafficking Culture, 31-Dec-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Colossal statue of Hercules, uncovered at the baths in Hippo Regius (Annaba), Algeria.
* Resting Herakles, [[Hermitage, Saint Petersburg]].
* Badly damaged late Hellenistic Parian marble [http://antikythera.whoi.edu/artifacts/marble-statues/ headless statue], recovered from the [[Antikythera wreck|Antikythera Shipwreck]] in 1901 [[Athens]], [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]]. 
* Headless statue at Izmit Archaeology and Ethnography Museum.
* Broken headless torso found in the bathhouse Roman &amp; Byzantine village in the Jezreel valley.
* Broken headless torso from the Amphiareion of Oropos, [[Athens]], [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]].
* Broken headless torso of 2nd or 3rd century AD, in Museum of Saint-Raymond in Toulouse.
* Statuette of 2nd century AD, in Detroit Institute of Arts.
* Bronze statuette with silver-inlaid eyes of 40 - 70 AD, [[Getty Villa]].

== Later Copies ==
After rediscovery of the Farnese Hercules, copies appeared in sixteenth- and eighteenth-century gardens throughout Europe. During construction of the [[Alameda de Hercules]] (1574) in [[Seville]], the oldest public garden preserved in Europe, at its entrance were installed two columns from a Roman temple, elements of a building still preserved in the ''Mármoles'', an unquestionable sign of admiration for the Roman archaeological sites. On them were placed two sculptures by [[Diego de Pesquera]], in 1574, recognizing Hercules as founder of the city, and [[Julius Caesar]], restorer of Híspalis. The first was a copy of the Farnese Hercules, nearly the monumental size of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Albardonedo Freire|1999A}}; {{harvnb|Albardonedo Freire|1999B}}; {{harvnb|Albardonedo Freire|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Wilhelmshöhe]], near [[Kassel]], a colossal version 8.5 m high produced by Johann Jacob Anthoni, 1713–1717, has become a symbol for the city.

[[André Le Nôtre]] placed a full-size gilded version against the skyline at the far end of the main vista at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]. That at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] is a copy by [[Jean Cornu]], 1684–1686. In [[Scotland]] a rare copy in [[lead]], of the first half of the eighteenth century, is sited incongruously in the central [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], overlooking the recently restored Hercules Garden in the grounds of [[Blair Castle]]. Wealthy collectors were able to afford one of the numerous bronze replicas created in sizes for table-top display.

It is shown in the 1954 film ''[[Journey to Italy]]'' along with the [[Farnese Bull]].

A replica, titled ''Herakles in Ithaca'', was erected in 1989 on the campus of [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, NY]]. The statue was a gift from its sculptor, [[Jason Seley]], a professor of fine arts. Seley made the sculpture in 1981 out of chrome automobile bumpers.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/iconic-sculpture-herakles-returns-plinth-thanks-gift&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LePetomane.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Le Pétomane]] was a professional flatulist around the start of the 20th century in France.]]
A '''flatulist''', '''fartist''', or '''professional farter''' is an [[entertainer]] (sometimes considered a [[comedian]]) whose routine consists solely or primarily of [[Flatulence|passing gas]] in a creative, musical, or amusing manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ljhelms.com/pet/_pujol/thestory/retro.htm Le Pétomane:The Strange Life of a "Fartiste"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are a number of scattered references to [[Classical Antiquity|ancient]] and [[Middle Ages|medieval]] flatulists, who could produce various rhythms and pitches with their [[flatulence|intestinal wind]]. [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] in ''City of God (De Civitate Dei)'' (14.24) mentions some performers who did have "such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing." [[Juan Luis Vives]], in his 1522 commentary to Augustine's work, testifies to having himself witnessed such a feat,{{cn|date=March 2015}} a remark referenced by [[Michel de Montaigne]] in an essay.{{Which|date=December 2017}}

The professional farters of medieval [[Ireland]] were called braigetoír. They are listed together with other performers and musicians in the 12th century ''Tech Midchúarda'', a diagram of the banqueting hall of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. As entertainers, these braigetoir ranked at the lower end of a scale headed by [[bard]]s, [[fili]], and [[harp]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The bagpipe: the history of a musical instrument | first=Francis M. | last=Collinson | publisher=Routledge | year=1975 | isbn=0-7100-7913-3 | page=73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Drama and the performing arts in pre-Cromwellian Ireland: a repertory of sources and documents from the earliest times until c. 1642 | first=Alan John | last=Fletcher | publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer | year=2001 | isbn=0-85991-573-5 | page=468 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One late medieval flatulist is mentioned in an entry in the 13th-century English ''Liber Feodorum'' or ''[[Book of Fees]]''. It lists one [[Roland the Farter]], who held [[Hemingstone]] manor in the county of [[Suffolk]], for which he was obliged to perform ''"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum"'' (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) annually at the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] every Christmas. The ''Activa Vita'' character in the 14th century allegorical poem [[Piers Plowman]] appears to number farting among the abilities desirable in a good entertainer in general, alongside storytelling, fiddling, or playing the harp.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meredith, [http://brepols.metapress.com/content/v76511103m5t4746/ "The professional travelling players of the fifteenth century: myth or reality?"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714165129/http://brepols.metapress.com/content/v76511103m5t4746/ |date=2012-07-14 }} ''European Medieval Drama'' '''2''' (1998) 21-34. DOI 10.1484/J.EMD.2.300900&lt;/ref&gt; This poem translates to "As for me, I can neither drum nor trumpet, nor tell jokes, nor fart amusingly at parties, nor play the harp."

In Japan, during the [[Edo period]], flatulists were known as "heppiri otoko" (放屁男), lit. "farting men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

*In the manga/anime series ''[[One Piece]]'', there is a new character named "Kin'emon" who was introduced with his body cut into three segments, one of which being his lower-half which was the first to be encountered by the main protagonists. During that time he was able to communicate via flatulence.
*[[Johnny Fartpants]] from ''[[Viz (comic)|Viz]]'' occasionally performs as a flatulist; however, he generally employs his rectal capacity as a [[superhero]].

The '''Gebelein predynastic mummies''' are six [[mummy|naturally mummified]] bodies, dating to approximately [[35th century BC|3400&amp;nbsp;BC]] from the [[Predynastic Egypt|Late Predynastic period]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. They were the first complete predynastic bodies to be discovered. The well-preserved bodies were excavated at the end of the nineteenth century by [[E. A. Wallis Budge|Wallis Budge]], the British Museum Keeper for Egyptology, from shallow sand graves near [[Gebelein]] (today, [[Naga el-Gherira]]&lt;ref name=Bard1999 /&gt;) in the Egyptian desert.

Budge excavated all the bodies from the same grave site. Two were identified as male and one as female, with the others being of undetermined gender. The bodies were given to the [[British Museum]] in 1900. Some grave-goods were documented at the time of excavation as "pots and flints", however they were not passed on to the British Museum and their whereabouts remain unknown. Three of the bodies were found with coverings of different types (reed matting, palm fibre and an animal skin), which still remain with the bodies. The bodies were found in foetal positions lying on their left sides.

Since 1901, the first body excavated has remained on display in the British Museum. This body was originally nicknamed Ginger due to his red hair; this nickname is no longer officially used as part of recent ethical policies for human remains.

==Excavation==

In 1895 and 1896 the ruins at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], [[Naqada|Tukh]], [[Hierakonpolis]] and [[Gebelein]] were excavated. In 1892 [[Jacques de Morgan]], Director of Antiquities in Egypt, proved that pottery found at Abydos and Nakadah pre-dated the dynastic period, stimulating interest by many European Archaeologists. As each excavation was completed, local Egyptian residents would continue to search the sites for remains. In 1895 [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], on behalf of the British Museum, procured inscribed coffins and funerary furniture from the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|12th Dynasty]] tombs at [[Al-Barshah]] by working with the Egyptian Service of Antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Budge|1920|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Budge started purchasing predynastic finds from the locals including bowls, spear and arrow heads, carved flint and bone figures and partial human remains (described as chiefly bones without skin or flesh remaining).&lt;ref name=Budge359/&gt;

In 1896, Budge was approached by a resident of Gebelein who claimed to have found more mummies. Budge was taken to the bodies, and he immediately recognized them as from the predynastic period and the first complete pre-dynastic bodies identified. He began excavations and a total of six mummified bodies were removed from shallow sand graves at Baḥr Bila Mâ (''Waterless River'') located at the eastern slopes of the north-most hill at Gebelein.&lt;ref name=Bard1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Budge359&gt;{{harvnb|Budge|1920|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only grave goods were a pot found with the female adult body and partial remains of wicker, fur and linen with the other bodies.&lt;ref name=budge1920/&gt; In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and sometimes loosely wrapped. In such a burial, when the body is covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean that most of the water in the body is quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rae|1996|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial [[mummification]] was developed.&lt;ref name=bmdb&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=117645&amp;partid=1 |title=Human mummy EA 32751 (collection database record) |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural mummification that occurred with these dry sand burials may have led to the original Egyptian belief in an after-death survival and started the tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson|Gray|1968|p=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All bodies were in similar flexed positions lying on their left sides with knees raised up towards their chin. In comparison, most bodies excavated from Egypt dating to the predynastic period are in a similar position, however at [[Merimda Beni Salama]]&lt;ref&gt;Merimda Beni Salama is a [[Neolithic]] settlement 60 km North of [[Cairo]], see {{citation |last=Hawass |first=Zahi |year=1988 |title=Chronology, Sediments, and Subsistence at Merimda Beni Salama |last2=Hassan |first2=Fekri A |last3=Gautier |first3=Achilles |journal=The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology |volume= 74 |issn=0307-5133 |oclc=480070236|pages=31–38 |doi=10.2307/3821745}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[El-Amra]] bodies were found on their right sides. From the time these bodies were buried up until the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] period, the dead were laid on their sides. After this period they were buried on their backs (dorsal position), and from the [[Fifth Dynasty]] the bodies were always fully extended.&lt;ref name=dgside&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson|Gray|1968|pp=vii–viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological interest in Gebelien started in the early 18th century and was included in [[Benoît de Maillet]]'s ''Description de l'Egypte''.&lt;ref name=Mascrier1735 &gt;{{citation | last1=Mascrier | first1=Jean Baptiste Le | year=1735 | title=Description de l'Egypte | last2=de Maillet | first2=Benoit | publisher=chez Louis Genneay }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site includes the remains from a temple to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Hathor]] with a number of [[cartouche]]s on mud bricks and a royal [[stela]] from the [[2nd Dynasty]] and [[3rd Dynasty]]. Later period finds include 400 Demotic and Greek [[ostraca]] from a 2nd–1st century BC mercenary garrison. As well as official excavations, many artefacts from the site were traded on the antiquities market and can be found in the museums of Turin, Cairo, Berlin, Lyons and the British Museum.&lt;ref name=Bard1999&gt;{{citation | last1=Bard | first1=Kathryn A. | year=1999 | title=Encyclopedia of the archaeology of ancient Egypt | last2=Shubert | first2=Steven Blake | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-18589-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XNdgScxtirYC  | page=338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bodies were buried in separate shallow graves, placed in the [[fetal position]] (knees raised towards their heads), which was the most common form for Egyptian burials of the time.&lt;ref name=dgside/&gt;

In 1967 a series of X-rays and photographs of all mummified bodies in the British Museum's Egyptian Antiquities collection provided a detailed analysis for the mummies from the Gebelein excavations.  The findings are summarized below:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dawson|Gray|1968|pp=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first body excavated had red hair; this led to the nickname of "Ginger" by curators and later by the public.&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt;&lt;ref name=auto-gt-2007 &gt;{{citation | year=2007 | first=Cynthia Clayton |last=Ochterbeck| title=Michelin Green Guide Great Britain | edition=5 | publisher=Michelin Apa Publications | isbn=978-1-906261-08-5 | page=327 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jalf4tSUb68C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-417396/Hi-Mummy-Im-home.html |title=Hi Mummy I'm home |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |first=Robert |last=Hardman|date=20 November 2006 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]], the British Museum has developed policies for ethical treatment of human remains and no longer uses this nickname.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/human_remains.aspx |title=Human remains |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=15 June 2010 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uFCXvc62?url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/statements/human_remains.aspx |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of Gebelein Man===
In November 2012 it was revealed that EA 32751 (Gebelein Man) had probably been murdered. A CAT scan of the mummified body taken at the [[Cromwell Hospital]] in London showed that Gebelein Man was aged about 18 to 20 at the time of his death and was well-muscled. Under his left shoulder blade, the scan revealed a puncture to the body; the murder weapon was used with such force that it slightly damaged the shoulder blade, but shattered the rib beneath it and penetrated the lung. It was believed that the injury was caused by a copper blade or flint knife at least 12&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 2&amp;nbsp;cm wide. Daniel Antoine, the [[British Museum]]'s expert on human remains, believes that Gebelein Man had been taken by surprise by the attack as there were no defense wounds.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' 16 November 2012 (pg 10)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20353934|title=British Museum exhibit Gebelein Man died 'violent death'|date=16 November 2012|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition history==

The mummies were acquired by the [[British Museum]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;The registration number ''1900,1018.1'' shows the body logged as received on 18 October 1900.&lt;/ref&gt; One male adult body, museum number EA 32751 (then nicknamed "Ginger"), went on display in 1901, and  was the earliest mummified body seen by the public. Apart from maintenance, it has been on continuous display in the same gallery since 1901.&lt;ref name=CS134408841 &gt;{{Cite news|title=Egyptian Antiquities At The British Museum |date=9 April 1902 |page=8 |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/keywordsearch.arc?queryKeywords=Egyptian+Antiquities+At+The+British+Museum |work=The Times |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gu1987/&gt; In 1987 the body was temporarily taken off display for restoration and a female mummified body replaced it. She was nicknamed "Gingerella" even though the body has long brown hair.&lt;ref name=gu1987&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian (London)|date=14 October 1987|title=Ancient Egyptian given new lease of life |first=Maev|last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gingerella/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Associated Press|date=9 October 1987|title=British Museum Overhauls Popular Mummy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The male body, EA 32751,  is displayed in a reconstructed sand grave in the British Museum in room 64 and case 15. Though Budge wrote of "pots and flints" with the body, these artefacts were not acquired by the museum. A number of Egyptian grave goods taken from similar graves of the period are instead used in the display.&lt;ref name=bmover&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/aes/p/predynastic_egyptian_man.aspx |title=Predynastic Egyptian Man (highlights) |publisher=British Museum |date=14 May 2010 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmdb/&gt; The grave goods include black-topped clay pots that were typical of the predynastic period through to [[Naqada II]], and plain and buff coloured pots and bowls typical of slightly later periods. There are also slate palettes, hard stone vessels and flint knives which would be associated with more elaborate burials of the [[historical period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strudwick|2006|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|One man was wrapped in a skin, a second in a mat of palm fibre, and the third was rolled up in a reed mat. The woman was without covering, and the only pot in her grave contained what seemed to be a sort of dried porridge...&lt;br&gt;
I unpacked the first man we had taken out of his grave at [[Gebel&amp;ecirc;n]] one Saturday in March 1900, in the presence of [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|Lord Crawford]] and the Principal Librarian, and when it was laid on a table it was as complete as when I first saw it at Gebel&amp;ecirc;n. But when it was examined again on the following Monday morning it was discovered that the top joint of one of the forefingers was missing, and it has, to my knowledge never been found since. The body was exhibited at once in the First Egyptian Room, and for the first time the British public saw a neolithic Egyptian.|[[E. A.

Of the other five bodies, only the female adult, given museum number EA 32752, has been exhibited.  In 1997-8 the body was part of a tour to Rome as part of the [[List of palazzi in Italy#Rome and Vatican City|Palazzo Ruspoli]], ''Ancient Faces'' exhibition.

Strips of [[polyethylene]] were used to reduce movement of the right arm.&lt;ref name=gingerella/&gt;

'''Green anarchism''' (or '''eco-anarchism''') is a [[Anarchist schools of thought|school of thought]] within [[anarchism]] which puts a particular emphasis on [[environmental issues]]. A green anarchist theory is normally one that extends anarchist ideology beyond a critique of human interactions, and includes a critique of the interactions between humans and non-humans as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freedomnews.org.uk/green-anarchism-towards-the-abolition-of-hierarchy/ 'Green Anarchism: Towards the Abolition of Hierarchy']&lt;/ref&gt; This often culminates in an anarchist revolutionary praxis that is not merely dedicated to human liberation, but also to some form of nonhuman liberation,&lt;ref&gt;[https://drstevebest.wordpress.com/category/total-liberation-2/ 'Steve Best on total liberation']&lt;/ref&gt; and that aims to bring about an environmentally sustainable anarchist society.

Important early influences were [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Leo Tolstoy]]&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"/&gt; and [[Élisée Reclus]].&lt;ref name="Reclus1"/&gt; In the late 19th century there emerged [[anarcho-naturism]] as the fusion of anarchism and [[Naturism|naturist]] philosophies within [[individualist anarchist]] circles in France, Spain, Cuba,&lt;ref name="raforum.info"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://raforum.info/spip.php?article3061&amp;lang=fr |title=Introduction to ''Anarchism and countercultural politics in early twentieth-century Cuba'' by Kirwin R.

== Early ecoanarchism ==
=== Henry David Thoreau ===
{{main|Henry David Thoreau}}
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry David Thoreau]], influential early green anarchist who wrote ''[[Walden]]'']]
Anarchism started to have an ecological view mainly in the writings of American [[anarchist]] and [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]]. In his book ''[[Walden]]'' he advocates [[simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] among natural surroundings in resistance to the advancement of [[industrial civilization]].&lt;ref name="Thoreau"&gt;"Su obra más representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una cabaña en el bosque, y vivir en íntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosofía trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armonía de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar también motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX."[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html "LA INSUMISIÓN VOLUNTARIA. EL ANARQUISMO INDIVIDUALISTA ESPAÑOL DURANTE LA DICTADURA Y LA SEGUNDA REPÚBLICA (1923-1938)" by Xavier Diez] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526224800/http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html |date=2006-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is part personal declaration of independence, [[social experiment]], voyage of spiritual discovery, satire, and manual for self-reliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Henry David Thoreau : A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers / Walden / The Maine Woods / Cape Cod |first=Henry David |last=Thoreau |publisher=[[Library of America]] | isbn=978-0-940450-27-1 |year=1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published in 1854, it details Thoreau's experiences over the course of two years, two months, and two days in a cabin he built near [[Walden Pond]], amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], near [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], Massachusetts. The book compresses the time into a single calendar year and uses passages of four seasons to symbolize human development. By immersing himself in nature, Thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through personal introspection. [[Simple living]] and [[self-sufficiency]] were Thoreau's other goals, and the whole project was inspired by [[transcendentalist]] philosophy, a central theme of the American Romantic Period. As Thoreau made clear in his book, his cabin was not in wilderness but at the edge of town, about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from his family home.

As such "Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and [[anarcho-primitivism]] represented today in [[John Zerzan]]. For [[George Woodcock]] this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century."&lt;ref name="Thoreau"/&gt; [[John Zerzan]] himself included the text "Excursions" (1863) by Thoreau in his edited compilation of writings called ''Against civilization: Readings and reflections'' from 1999.&lt;ref name="Zerzan2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zerzan|first=John |authorlink=John Zerzan|title=Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvplAAAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Feral House|isbn=978-0-922915-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Élisée Reclus ===
{{main|Élisée Reclus}}
[[File:EliseeReclusNadar.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Élisée Reclus]], [[French anarchist]] geographer and [[environmentalist]]]]
Élisée Reclus (15 March 1830 – 4 July 1905), also known as Jacques Élisée Reclus, was a renowned [[French people|French]] [[geographer]], writer and [[anarchist]]. He produced his 19-volume masterwork ''La Nouvelle Géographie universelle, la terre et les hommes'' ("Universal Geography"), over a period of nearly 20 years (1875–1894). In 1892, he was awarded the prestigious Gold Medal of the [[Société de Géographie|Paris Geographical Society]] for this work, despite his having been banished from France because of his political activism. According to [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]:&lt;ref name=Sale&gt;[[Kirkpatrick Sale|Sale, Kirkpatrick]] (2010-07-01) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/jul/01/00045/ Are Anarchists Revolting?], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|His geographical work, thoroughly researched and unflinchingly scientific, laid out a picture of human-nature interaction that we today would call [[bioregionalism]]. It showed, with more detail than anyone but a dedicated geographer could possibly absorb, how the ecology of a place determined the kinds of lives and livelihoods its denizens would have and thus how people could properly live in self-regarding and self-determined bioregions without the interference of large and centralized governments that always try to homogenize diverse geographical areas.}}

For the authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] Reclus "argued that a "secret harmony exists between the earth and the people whom it nourishes, and when imprudent societies let themselves violate this harmony, they always end up regretting it." Similarly, no contemporary ecologist would disagree with his comments that the "truly civilised man [and women] understands that his [or her] nature is bound up with the interest of all and with that of nature.

==== France ====
Richard D. Sonn comments on the influence of naturist views in the wider French anarchist movement: 

{{quote|In her memoir of her anarchist years that was serialized in ''Le Matin'' in 1913, [[Rirette Maitrejean|Rirette Maîtrejean]] made much of the strange food regimens of some of the ''compagnons''. ... She described the "tragic bandits" of the [[Bonnot gang]] as refusing to eat meat or drink wine, preferring plain water. Her humorous comments reflected the practices of the "naturist" wing of individualist anarchists who favored a simpler, more "natural" lifestyle centered on a vegetarian diet. In the 1920s, this wing was expressed by the journal ''Le Néo-Naturien, Revue des Idées Philosophiques et Naturiennes''. Contributors condemned the fashion of smoking cigarettes, especially by young women; a long article of 1927 actually connected cigarette smoking with cancer! Others distinguished between vegetarians, who foreswore the eating of meat, from the stricter "vegetalians," who ate nothing but vegetables. An anarchist named G. Butaud, who made this distinction, opened a restaurant called the Foyer Végétalien in the nineteenth arrondissement in 1923. Other issues of the journal included vegetarian recipes. In 1925, when the young anarchist and future detective novelist Léo Malet arrived in Paris from Montpellier, he initially lodged with anarchists who operated another vegetarian restaurant that served only vegetables, with neither fish nor eggs. Nutritional concerns coincided with other means of encouraging health bodies, such as nudism and gymnastics. For a while in the 1920s, after they were released from jail for antiwar and birth-control activities, Jeanne and Eugène Humbert retreated to the relative safety of the "integral living" movement that promoted nude sunbathing and physical fitness, which were seen as integral aspects of health in the Greek sense of ''[[gymnos]]'', meaning nude. This back-to-nature, primitivist current was not a monopoly of the left; the same interests were echoed by right-wing Germans in the interwar era. In France, however, these proclivities were mostly associated with anarchists, insofar as they suggested an ideal of self-control and the rejection of social [[taboo]]s and prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sonn|first=Richard D.|title=Sex, Violence, and the Avant-Garde|year=2010|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03663-2.html|publisher=Penn State University|isbn=978-0-271-03663-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1902, he was one of the main initiators, alongside Georges Butaud and Sophie Zaïkowska, of the [[cooperative]] ''Colonie de Vaux'' established in [[Essômes-sur-Marne]], in [[Aisne]].

Zisly's political activity, "primarily aimed at supporting a return to 'natural life' through writing and practical involvement, stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment. Zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization, which he regarded as 'absurd, ignoble, and filthy.' He openly opposed industrialization, arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian, defended nudism, advocated a non-dogmatic and non-religious adherence to the 'laws of nature,' recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self-sufficiency, and disagreed with vegetarianism, which he considered 'anti-scientific.'"&lt;ref name="Boni" /&gt;

==== Cuba ====
The historian Kirwin R. Schaffer in his study of [[Cuban anarchism]] reports anarcho-naturism as "A third strand within the island's anarchist movement" alongside [[anarcho-communism]] and [[anarcho-syndicalism]].&lt;ref name="raforum.info"/&gt; Naturism was a global alternative health and lifestyle movement. Naturists focused on redefining one's life to live simply, eat cheap but nutritious vegetarian diets, and raise one's own food if possible. The countryside was posited as a romantic alternative to urban living, and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the healthful benefits of nudism. Globally, the naturist movement counted anarchists, liberals, and socialists as its followers. However, in Cuba a particular "anarchist" dimension evolved led by people like Adrián del Valle, who spearheaded the Cuban effort to shift naturism's focus away from only individual health to naturism having a "social emancipatory" function."&lt;ref name="raforum.info"/&gt;

Schaffer reports the influence that anarcho-naturism had outside naturists circles. So "For instance, nothing inherently prevented an anarcho-syndicalist in the Havana restaurant workers' union from supporting the alternative health care programs of the anarcho-naturists and seeing those alternative practices as "revolutionary."".&lt;ref name="raforum.info"/&gt; "Anarcho-naturists promoted a rural ideal, simple living, and being in harmony with Nature as ways to save the laborers from the increasingly industrialized character of Cuba. Besides promoting an early twentieth-century "[[back-to-the-land]]" movement, they used these romantic images of Nature to illustrate how far removed a capitalist industrialized Cuba had departed from an anarchist view of natural harmony."&lt;ref name="raforum.info"/&gt; The main propagandizer in Cuba of anarcho-naturism was the [[Catalonia]] born "Adrián del Valle (aka Palmiro de Lidia) ... Over the following decades, Del Valle became a constant presence in not only the anarchist press that proliferated in Cuba but also mainstream literary publications ... From 1912 to 1913 he edited the [[Freethought|freethinking]] journal ''El Audaz''. Then he began his largest publishing job by helping to found and edit the monthly alternative health magazine that followed the anarcho-naturist line ''Pro-Vida''.&lt;ref name="raforum.info"/&gt;

==== Spain ====
[[File:Isaac Puente.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Isaac Puente]], [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish]] [[Anarcho-naturism|anarchist naturist]] and [[anarcho-communist]]]]
Anarcho-naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in the [[Anarchism in Spain|spanish anarchist movement]]&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt; In [[Anarchism in France|France]], later important propagandists of anarcho-naturism include [[Henri Zisly]]&lt;ref name="Boni" /&gt; and [[Emile Gravelle|Émile Gravelle]] whose ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in Spain, where [[Federico Urales]] (pseudonym of Joan Montseny) promoted the ideas of Gravelle and Zisly in ''[[La Revista Blanca]]'' (1898–1905):&lt;ref name="naturismo1"&gt;[http://www.nodo50.org/lagarbancitaecologica/garbancita/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=150:los-origenes-del-naturismo-libertario&amp;catid=61:investigacion-formacion-debate&amp;Itemid=77 "Los origenes del naturismo libertario" por Agustín Morán]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|The linking role played by the Sol y Vida group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, ''Ecléctico'', in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First ''Etica'' and then ''[[Iniciales]]'', which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the [[Spanish Civil War]]. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to ''Iniciales''. He writes it under the odd pseudonym of ''silvestre del campo'' (wild man in the country). "I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society.&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt;}}

The "relation between Anarchism and Naturism gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of [[Han Ryner]]) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, ([[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]])".&lt;ref name="naturismo.org"/&gt; This ecological tendency in Spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]]–[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica|FAI]] in Spain. [[Daniel Guérin]] in ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' reports: 

{{quote|Spanish [[anarcho-syndicalism]] had long been concerned to safeguard the autonomy of what it called "[[affinity group]]s." There were many adepts of naturism and [[vegetarianism]] among its members, especially among the poor [[peasant]]s of the south. Both these ways of living were considered suitable for the transformation of the human being in preparation for a libertarian society. At the Saragossa congress the members did not forget to consider the fate of groups of naturists and nudists, "unsuited to industrialization." As these groups would be unable to supply all their own needs, the congress anticipated that their delegates to the meetings of the confederation of communes would be able to negotiate special economic agreements with the other agricultural and industrial communes. On the eve of a vast, bloody, social transformation, the CNT did not think it foolish to try to meet the infinitely varied aspirations of individual human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Daniel_Guerin__Anarchism__From_Theory_to_Practice.html |title=Anarchism: From theory to practice|author-link=Daniel Guérin|first=Daniel |last=Guérin}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Naturism also met [[anarchism in the United Kingdom]]. "In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900s nudism, anarchism, vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life. In the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radical.org.uk/nudism/radical.htm "Nudism the radical tradition" by Terry Phillips] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911041132/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radical.org.uk%2Fnudism%2Fradical.htm |date=2012-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Anarchism in Italy|Italy]], during the IX Congress of the [[Italian Anarchist Federation]] in [[Carrara]] in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the ''Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica''.

"Speaking of life at the Stelton Colony of New York in the 1930s, noted with disdain that it, "like other colonies, was infested by vegetarians, naturists, nudists, and other cultists, who sidetracked true anarchist goals." One resident "always went barefoot, ate raw food, mostly nuts and raisins, and refused to use a tractor, being opposed to machinery, and he didn't want to abuse horses, so he dug the earth himself." Such self-proclaimed anarchists were in reality "ox-cart anarchists," Dolgoff said, "who opposed organization and wanted to return to a simpler life." In an interview with [[Paul Avrich]] before his death, Dolgoff also grumbled, "I am sick and tired of these half-assed artists and poets who object to organization and want only to play with their belly buttons."".&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Brian_Oliver_Sheppard__Anarchism_vs._Primitivism.html Brian Oliver Sheppard.

[[File:Ilya Repin - Leo Tolstoy Barefoot - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|100px|[[Leo Tolstoy]] dressed in peasant clothing by [[Ilya Repin]] (1901)]]
Russian [[Christian anarchist]] and [[anarcho-pacifist]] Leo Tolstoy is also recognized as an early influence in green anarchism.&lt;ref name="naturismolibertario"/&gt; The novelist was struck by the description of Christian, [[Buddhist]], and [[Hindu]] ascetic renunciation as being the path to holiness. After reading passages such as the following, which abound in Schopenhauer's ethical chapters, the Russian nobleman chose poverty and formal denial of the will: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But this very necessity of involuntary suffering (by poor people) for eternal salvation is also expressed by that utterance of the Savior ([[Matthew 19:24]]): "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." Therefore those who were greatly in earnest about their eternal salvation, chose [[voluntary poverty]] when fate had denied this to them and they had been born in wealth. Thus [[Buddha]] [[Sakyamuni]] was born a prince, but voluntarily took to the mendicant's staff; and [[Francis of Assisi]], the founder of the [[mendicant orders]] who, as a youngster at a ball, where the daughters of all the notabilities were sitting together, was asked: "Now Francis, will you not soon make your choice from these beauties?" and who replied: "I have made a far more beautiful choice!" "Whom?" "''La povertà'' (poverty)": whereupon he abandoned every thing shortly afterwards and wandered through the land as a mendicant.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. II, §170&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite his misgivings about [[anarchist violence]], Tolstoy took risks to circulate the prohibited publications of [[anarchism in Russia|anarchist thinkers in Russia]], and corrected the proofs of Kropotkin's "Words of a Rebel", illegally published in St Petersburg in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter Kropotkin: From Prince to Rebel]]''.

Mannin's 1944 book ''Bread and Roses: A Utopian Survey and Blue-Print'' has been described by anarchist historian [[Robert Graham (historian)|Robert Graham]] as setting forth "an [[ecological]] vision in opposition to the prevailing and destructive [[Industrial society|industrial]] organization of society".&lt;ref name="rg"/&gt;

=== Leopold Kohr ===
{{main|Leopold Kohr}}
Leopold Kohr (5 October 1909 in [[Oberndorf bei Salzburg]], Austria – 26 February 1994 in [[Gloucester]], England) was an [[economist]], [[philosopher]] and [[political scientist]] known both for his opposition to the "cult of bigness" in social organization and as one of those who initiated the'' [[Small is Beautiful|small is beautiful]]'' movement. For almost twenty years he was Professor of Economics and Public Administration at the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. He described himself as a "[[philosophical anarchism|philosophical anarchist]]." In 1937, Kohr became a freelance correspondent during the [[Spanish Civil War]], where he was impressed by the limited, self-contained governments of the separatist states of [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]], as well as the small [[Spanish anarchist]] [[city states]] of [[Alcoy (Spain)|Alcoy]] and [[Caspe]]. In his first published essay "Disunion Now: A Plea for a Society based upon Small Autonomous Units", published in [[Commonweal (UK)|Commonweal]] in 1941, Kohr wrote about a Europe at war: "We have ridiculed the many little states, now we are terrorized by their few successors."  He called for the breakup of Europe into hundreds of city states.&lt;ref name="Sale-foreword"/&gt;  Kohr developed his ideas in a series of books, including ''The Breakdown of Nations'' (1957), ''Development without Aid'' (1973) and ''The Overdeveloped Nations'' (1977).&lt;ref name="rightlivelihood"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightlivelihood.org/recip/kohr.htm|title=Right Livelihood Award: Leopold Kohr|accessdate=2008-02-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007091418/http://www.rightlivelihood.org///recip/kohr.htm|archivedate=2006-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Leopold Kohr's most popular work ''The Breakdown of Nations'': &lt;blockquote&gt;... there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery: bigness. Oversimplified as this may seem, we shall find the idea more easily acceptable if we consider that bigness, or oversize, is really much more than just a social problem. It appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation. Whenever something is wrong, something is too big.  ... And if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression, brutality, collectivism, or massive idiocy, it is not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement. It is because human beings, so charming as individuals or in small aggregations, have been welded into overconcentrated social units.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in his academic and writing career he protested the "cult of bigness" and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life. He argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation. His vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control.&lt;ref name="rightlivelihood"/&gt; Kohr was an important inspiration to the [[Green movement|Green]], [[Bioregionalism|bioregional]], [[Fourth World]], [[Decentralization|decentralist]], and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movements, Kohr contributed often to [[John Papworth]]'s `Journal for the Fourth World', [[Resurgence &amp; Ecologist|Resurgence]]. One of Kohr's students was economist [[E. F. Schumacher]], another prominent influence on these movements, whose [[bestseller|best selling]] book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' took its title from one of Kohr's core principles.&lt;ref name="NYT-Obit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/28/obituaries/dr-leopold-kohr-84-backed-smaller-states.html Dr. Leopold Kohr, 84; Backed Smaller States], [[New York Times]] obituary, 28 February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, his ideas inspired [[Kirkpatrick Sale]]'s books ''Human Scale'' (1980) and ''Dwellers in the Land: The Bioregional Vision'' (1985). Sale arranged the first American publication of ''The Breakdown of Nations'' in 1978 and wrote the foreword.&lt;ref name="Sale-foreword"/&gt;

Murray Bookchin (January 14, 1921 – July 30, 2006)&lt;ref&gt;Small, Mike. "Murray Bookchin", ''The Guardian'' August 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]] author, orator, and philosopher. In 1958, Murray Bookchin defined himself as an [[anarchist]],&lt;ref name="youtube2007"&gt;{{youtube|id=Vd0hxVUIQvk |title=''Anarchism In America'' documentary }}&lt;/ref&gt; seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology. His first book, ''[[Our Synthetic Environment]],'' was published under the [[pseudonym]] Lewis Herber in 1962, a few months before [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/bio1.html |title=''A Short Biography of Murray Bookchin'' by Janet Biehl |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism. His groundbreaking essay "Ecology and Revolutionary Thought" introduced [[ecology]] as a concept in radical politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/ecologyandrev.html |title=Ecology and Revolution |publisher=Dwardmac.pitzer.edu |date=2004-06-16 |accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he founded another group that published the influential ''Anarchos'' magazine, which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy, and on decentralization and miniaturization. Lecturing throughout the United States, he helped popularize the concept of ecology to the [[counterculture]].

''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' is a collection of [[essay]]s written by [[Murray Bookchin]] and first published in 1971 by Ramparts Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Post-scarcity anarchism,&lt;nowiki&gt; [WorldCat.org]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=[[WorldCat.org]]|oclc = 159676}}&lt;/ref&gt; It outlines the possible form [[anarchism]] might take under conditions of [[Post scarcity|post-scarcity]].

He was a principal figure in the Burlington Greens in 1986-90, an ecology group that ran candidates for city council on a program to create neighborhood democracy. In ''From Urbanization to Cities'' (originally published in 1987 as ''The Rise of Urbanization and the Decline of Citizenship''), Bookchin traced the democratic traditions that influenced his political philosophy and defined the implementation of the [[libertarian municipalism]] concept. A few years later ''The Politics of Social Ecology'', written by his partner of 20 years, [[Janet Biehl]], briefly summarized these ideas.

=== Jacques Ellul ===
{{main|Jacques Ellul}}
Jacques Ellul (January 6, 1912&amp;nbsp;– May 19, 1994) was a French [[philosopher]], [[jurisprudence|law professor]], [[sociology|sociologist]], [[lay theologian]], and [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]]. He wrote several books about Christianity, the technological society, propaganda, and the interaction between [[political science of religion|religion and politics]]. Professor of History and the Sociology of Institutions on the Faculty of Law and Economic Sciences at the University of Bordeaux, he authored 58 books and more than a thousand articles over his lifetime in all, the dominant theme of which has been the threat to human freedom and religion created by modern technique. The Ellulian concept of technique is briefly defined within the "Notes to Reader" section of ''The Technological Society'' (1964). What many consider to be Ellul's most important work, ''The Technological Society'' (1964) was originally titled: ''La Technique: L'enjeu du siècle'' (literally, "The Stake of the Century").&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Paul A. and Jan Ll. Harris. ''Digital Matters: The Theory and Culture of the Matrix.'' (London: Routledge, 2005), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Ellul set forth seven characteristics of modern technology that make efficiency a necessity: [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationality]], artificiality, automatism of technical choice, self-augmentation, [[monism]], [[universalism]], and [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="TechnologicalSociety"&gt;Ellul, Jacques. ''The Technological Society'', trans. John Wilkinson (New York: Random House, 1964), 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ellul the rationality of technique enforces logical and mechanical organization through division of labor, the setting of production standards, etc. And it creates an artificial system which "eliminates or subordinates the natural world." Today, he argues, the technological society is generally held sacred (cf. Saint Steve Jobs&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Michael E. [http://www.christianpost.com/news/death-of-secular-saint-steve-jobs-in-a-theologically-devoid-culture-59595/ Death of Secular Saint Steve Jobs in a Theologically Devoid Culture] The Christian Post Sept. 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;). Since he defines technique as "the totality of methods rationally arrived at, and having absolute efficiency (for a given stage of development) in every field of human activity",&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, Jacques. ''The Technological Society'', trans. John Wilkinson (New York: Random House, 1964), Note to the Reader.&lt;/ref&gt; it is clear that his sociological analysis focuses not on the society of machines as such, but on the society of "efficient techniques".

=== Social ecology and Communalism ===
{{main|Social ecology (theory)|Communalism (Political Philosophy)}}
[[File:Murray Bookchin.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Murray Bookchin]]]]Social ecology is closely related to the work and ideas of [[Murray Bookchin]] and influenced by anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]]. Social ecologists assert that the present [[ecological crisis]] has its roots in human social problems, and that the domination of human-over-nature stems from the domination of human-over-human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bookchin |first=Murray |authorlink= |title=The Philosophy of Social Ecology: Essays on Dialectical Naturalism |year=1994 |pages=119–120 |publisher=Black Rose Books |location= |isbn=978-1-55164-018-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bookchin later developed a political philosophy to complement social ecology which he called "[[Communalism (Political Philosophy)|Communalism]]" (spelled with a capital "C" to differentiate it from other forms of communalism). While originally conceived as a form of [[Social anarchism]], he later developed Communalism into a separate ideology which incorporates what he saw as the most beneficial elements of Anarchism, Marxism, syndicalism, and radical ecology.

Politically, Communalists advocate a network of directly democratic citizens' assemblies in individual communities/cities organized in a confederal fashion. This method used to achieve this is called [[Libertarian Municipalism]] which involves the establishment of face-to-face democratic institutions which are to grow and expand confederally with the goal of eventually replacing the nation-state.

[[Janet Biehl]] (born 1953) is a writer associated with [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]], the body of ideas developed and publicized by [[Murray Bookchin]]. In 1986, she attended the [[Institute for Social Ecology]] and there, began a collaborative relationship with Bookchin, working intensively with him over the next two decades in the explication of social ecology from their shared home in [[Burlington, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html|title=Janet Biehl: Short Biography &amp; Selected Works|publisher=Canto Libertário|accessdate=19 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402155302/http://www.cedap.assis.unesp.br/cantolibertario/textos/0022.html|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1987 to 2000, she and Bookchin co-wrote and co-published the theoretical newsletter ''Green Perspectives'', later renamed ''Left Green Perspectives''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.social-ecology.org/category/social-ecology-journals/left-green-perspectives/|title=Left Green Perspectives (1988-1998)|publisher=Institute for Social Ecology|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the editor and compiler of ''The Murray Bookchin Reader'' (1997);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bookchin/reader/intro.html|title=The Murray Bookchin Reader: Introduction|last=Biehl|first=Janet|publisher=Anarchy Archives|accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author of ''The Politics of Social Ecology: Libertarian Municipalism'' (1998) and ''Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics'' (1991); and coauthor (with Peter Staudenmaier) of ''Ecofascism: Lessons from the German Experience'' (1995).

=== ''Green Anarchist'' ===
{{main|Green Anarchist}}

The magazine ''Green Anarchist'' was for a while the principal voice in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] advocating green anarchism, an explicit fusion of [[libertarian socialist]] and [[ecological]] thinking. Founded after the 1984 [[Stop the City]] protests, the magazine was launched in the summer of that year by an editorial collective consisting of [[Alan Albon]], [[Richard Hunt (editor)|Richard Hunt]] and [[Marcus Christo]]. Early issues featured a range of broadly anarchist and ecological ideas, bringing together groups and individuals as varied as [[Class War]], veteran anarchist writer [[Colin Ward]], anarcho-punk band [[Crass]], as well as the [[Peace Convoy]], anti-nuclear campaigners, [[animal rights]] activists and so on. However, the diversity that many saw as the publication's greatest strength quickly led to irreconcilable arguments between the essentially [[pacifism|pacifist]] approach of Albon and Christo, and the advocacy of violent confrontation with the State favoured by Hunt. During the 1990s ''Green Anarchist'' came under the helm of an editorial collective that included [[Paul Rogers (Green Anarchist)|Paul Rogers]], [[Steve Booth]] and others, during which period the publication became increasingly aligned with [[anarcho-primitivism|primitivism]], an anti-civilization philosophy advocated by writers such as [[John Zerzan]] and [[Fredy Perlman]]. Starting in 1995, [[Hampshire]] Police began a series of at least 56 raids, [[code name]]d 'Operation Washington', that eventually resulted in the August to November 1997 [[Portsmouth]] trial of Green Anarchist editors Booth, [[Saxon Wood]], [[Noel Molland]] and Paul Rogers, as well as [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) Press Officer [[Robin Webb]] and [[Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group]] (ALFSG) newsletter editor Simon Russell. The defendants organised the [[GANDALF Defence campaign]]. Three of the editors of Green Anarchist, Noel Molland, Saxon Wood and Booth were jailed for 'conspiracy to incite'. However, all three were shortly afterwards released on appeal.

=== Fredy Perlman ===
{{main|Fredy Perlman}}
Fredy Perlman (August 20, 1934 – July 26, 1985) was a Czech-born, naturalised American author, publisher and militant. His most popular work, the book ''[[Against His-Story, Against Leviathan]]!'', details the rise of state domination with a retelling of history through the [[Hobbesian]] metaphor of the [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]. The book remains a major source of inspiration for anti-civilization perspectives in [[contemporary anarchism]], most notably on the thought of philosopher [[John Zerzan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=[[John Moore (anarchist)|John Moore]] |last=Purkis | first = Johnathan |chapter=Anarchy Unbound | title = I Am Not a Man, I Am Dynamite!

=== Anarcho-primitivism ===
{{main|Anarcho-primitivism}}

Anarcho-primitivism is an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] critique of the origins and progress of [[civilization]]. According to anarcho-primitivism, the shift from [[hunter-gatherer]] to [[Agriculture|agricultural]] subsistence gave rise to [[social stratification]], [[coercion]], and [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non-"civilized" ways of life through [[deindustrialisation]], abolition of the [[division of labour]] or [[specialization (functional)|specialization]], and abandonment of large-scale organization [[technology|technologies]]. There are other non-anarchist forms of primitivism, and not all primitivists point to the same phenomenon as the source of modern, civilized problems. Anarcho-primitivists are often distinguished by their focus on the [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] of achieving a [[feral]] state of being through "[[Rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]]".

==== John Zerzan ====
{{main|John Zerzan}}
[[File:John Zerzan SF - Anarchist Bookfair '06.JPG|thumb|180px|[[John Zerzan]], anarcho-primitivism theorist]]
John Zerzan is an American [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] philosopher and author. His works criticize agricultural [[civilization]] as inherently oppressive, and advocate drawing upon the ways of life of [[hunter gatherer]]s as an inspiration for what a free society should look like. Some subjects of his criticism include [[domestication]], [[language]], [[Anarcho-primitivism#Critique of symbolic culture|symbolic thought]] (such as [[mathematics]] and art) and the concept of time.

His five major books are ''Elements of Refusal'' (1988), ''[[Future Primitive and Other Essays]]'' (1994), ''Running on Emptiness'' (2002), ''[[Against Civilization: Readings and Reflections]]'' (2005) and ''Twilight of the Machines'' (2008). Zerzan was one of the editors of ''[[Green Anarchy]]'', a controversial journal of anarcho-primitivist and [[insurrectionary anarchist]] thought. He is also the host of ''Anarchy Radio'' in Eugene on the [[University of Oregon]]'s radio station [[KWVA]]. He has also served as a contributing editor at ''[[Anarchy Magazine]]'' and has been published in magazines such as ''[[AdBusters]]''. He does extensive speaking tours around the world, and is married to an independent consultant to museums and other nonprofit organizations. In 1974, Black and Red Press published ''Unions Against Revolution'' by Spanish [[ultra-left]] theorist [[Grandizo Munis]] that included an essay by Zerzan which previously appeared in the journal ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]''. Over the next 20 years, Zerzan became intimately involved with the ''[[Fifth Estate (periodical)|Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]]'', ''Demolition Derby '' and other anarchist periodicals. He began to question civilization in the early 80's, after having sought to confront issues around the neutrality of technology and division of labour, at the time when [[Fredy Perlman]] was making similar conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |title=Interview: Anarcho-Primitivist Thinker and Activist John Zerzan &amp;#124; CORRUPT.org: Conservation &amp; Conservatism |publisher=CORRUPT.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002121547/http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/john_zerzan |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAC was started towards the end of 1999 in the aftermath of the massive street protests in Eugene (Reclaim the Streets) and in Seattle (WTO) of that year. That aftermath gave a new voice and standing for green anarchist and [[anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] writers and viewpoints within both the [[anarchist]] milieu and the culture at large. The first issue came out in winter of 2000-2001 (currently out of print) and contained a mix of reprints and some original articles from [[Derrick Jensen]] and [[John Zerzan]] among others. Issue two came in the following year in the wake of Sept. 11 and took a major step from the first issue in becoming something of its own rather than another mouthpiece of green anarchist rhetoric. The articles took a more in depth direction opening a more [[Analytic induction|analytical]] and critical draw between [[anarchy (word)|anarchy]] and [[anthropology]], attacks on [[Reason]] and the [[Myth of Progress|Progress/linear]] views of human history and Future that stand at the base of the ideology of [[civilization]].

=== Vegananarchism ===
{{main|Veganarchism}}
[[Veganarchism]] or vegan anarchism, is the [[political philosophy]] of [[veganism]] (more specifically [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] and [[earth liberation]]) and [[anarchism]],&lt;ref name="alfsgjonny"&gt;Alberwite, Jonny.

{{main|Layla AbdelRahim}}
[[Layla AbdelRahim]] is a Canadian [[anthropology|anthropologist]] and author. Her work critiques [[civilization]], [[technology|technologies]], and, what she calls a "predatory anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://puntickovanichrobaci.noblogs.org/post/2013/11/17/interview-with-layla-abdelrahim-on-anarcho-primitvism-red-anarchism-and-veganism/ |title=Interview with Layla AbdelRahim on anarcho-primitivism, red anarchism and veganism |publisher=Puntickovani Chrobaci. |date=2013 |accessdate=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Children's Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness'' (2015), she attributes the [[Holocene extinction]] and [[climate change]] to the human choice of hunting as a cultural choice for subsistence. This anthropological revolution in human self-construction as [[predation|predator]], she argues, generated the need for developing the technologies that would ensure the propagation of a predatory culture and violence.&lt;ref name="AbdelRahim 2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = AbdelRahim | first = Layla | authorlink=Layla AbdelRahim | title = Children's Literature, Domestication, and Social Foundation: Narratives of Civilization and Wilderness | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-0-415-66110-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The first of these technologies is ... the technology of absence. ... This entails physical and emotional absence, but also includes a metaphysical dimension, since technological development is literally linked to death.

''Wild Children – Domesticated Dreams: Civilization and the Birth of Education'' (2013) argues that civilized child rearing cultures are based on the principles of animal domestication.

=== Total liberation ===
{{main|Total liberation}}
[[Total liberation]]ism is a form of green anarchism that combines an opposition to all forms of human oppression with a commitment to animal and earth liberation.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Pellow (2014) ''Total Liberation: The Power and Promise of Animal Rights and the Radical Earth Movement''; Minneapolis, USA: University of Minnesota Press, pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst more conventional approaches to anarchist politics typically maintain a [[tacit assumption]] of anthropocentrism, proponents of total liberation espouse a holistic revolutionary strategy aimed at identifying the intersections between all forms of domination and social hierarchy, and building alliances between individual political movements in order to integrate them into a single movement aimed at abolishing a range of social structures such as [[the state]], [[capitalism]], [[patriarchy]], [[racism]], [[heterosexism]], [[cissexism]], [[disablism]], [[ageism]], [[speciesism]], and ecological domination.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Best (2014) "The Politics of Total Liberation: Revolution for the 21st century", New York City, USA: Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; As David Pellow summarises: &lt;blockquote&gt;The concept of total liberation stems from a determination to understand and combat all forms of inequality and oppression. I propose that it comprises four pillars: (1) an ethic of justice and anti-oppression inclusive of humans, nonhuman animals, and ecosystems; (2) anarchism; (3) anti-capitalism; and (4) an embrace of direct action tactics.&lt;ref&gt;D. Pellow (2014) pp.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He prefers to be called "[[indigenism|indigenist]]" or an "ally to the indigenous," because "indigenous peoples have had the only sustainable human social organizations, and ... we need to recognize that we [colonizers] are all living on stolen land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zoeblunt.wordpress.com/2011/03/20/uncivilized/ |title=Uncivilized |first=Zoe |last=Blunt |work=[[Canadian Dimension]] |year=2011 |accessdate=24 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Language Older Than Words'' uses the lens of [[domestic violence]] to look at the larger violence of [[western culture]]. ''The Culture of Make Believe'' begins by exploring [[racism]] and [[misogyny]] and moves to examine how this culture's economic system leads inevitably to hatred and atrocity. ''Strangely Like War'' is about [[deforestation]]. ''Walking on Water'' is about [[education]] (It begins: "As is true for most people I know, I've always loved learning. As is also true for most people I know, I always hated school. Why is that?").&lt;ref&gt;''Walking on Water'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Welcome to the Machine'' is about [[surveillance]], and more broadly about science and what he perceives to be a Western obsession with control. ''Resistance Against Empire'' consists of interviews with [[J. W. Smith]] (on poverty), [[Kevin Bales]] (on slavery), Anuradha Mittal (on hunger), [[Juliet Schor]] ('globalization' and environmental degradation), [[Ramsey Clark]] (on US 'defense'), Stephen Schwartz (editor of ''The Nonproliferation Review'', on nukes), [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] (politics and heroin), [[Christian Parenti]] (the US prison system), [[Katherine Albrecht]] (on RFID), and [[Robert W. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] (on (freedom of) the media) conducted between 1999 and 2004. ''Endgame'' is about what he describes as the inherent [[wikt:unsustainability|unsustainability]] of civilization. In this book he asks: "Do you believe that this culture will undergo a voluntary transformation to a sane and sustainable way of living?" Nearly everyone he talks to says no. His next question is: "How would this understanding&amp;nbsp;— that this culture will not voluntarily stop destroying the natural world, eliminating indigenous cultures, exploiting the poor, and killing those who resist&amp;nbsp;— shift our strategy and tactics? The answer? Nobody knows, because we never talk about it: we're too busy pretending the culture will undergo a magical transformation." ''Endgame'', he says, is "about that shift in strategy, and in tactics."&lt;ref&gt;''Endgame'' V.1, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen co-wrote the book ''Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet'' with [[Lierre Keith]] and Aric McBay

==== Convictions ====
{{main|GANDALF trial|SHAC 7|Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty#Operation Achilles}}
[[Rod Coronado]] is an eco-anarchist and is an unofficial spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front and [[Earth Liberation Front]]. On February 28, 1992, Coronado carried out an [[arson]] attack on research facilities at [[Michigan State University]] (MSU), and released [[mink]] from a nearby research farm on campus, an action claimed by the ALF, and for which Coronado was subsequently convicted.

In 1997, the editors of ''[[Green Anarchist]]'' magazine and two British supporters of the Animal Liberation Front were tried in connection with conspiracy to incite violence, in what came to be known as the [[GANDALF trial]].

'''Huaguangjiao One''' ({{zh|s=华光礁一号}}) is a Chinese [[merchant ship]], built during the [[Southern Song dynasty]] (1127-1279), that sank off the coast of [[Paracel Islands]] (Xisha Islands) in the [[South China Sea]]. The ship's name translates as "Magnificent China Reef Wreck #1". It was discovered in 1996&lt;ref name="Shujuan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/life/2010-05/25/content_9888637_3.htm|title=Deep Secrets Uncovered|last=Shujuan|first=Lin|date=May 2010|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently the oldest hull that China has discovered in the open seas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/culture/210242.htm| title=Undersea Excavation Reveals Bounteous Booty|publisher=China.org.cn|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archeological findings==
In 1996, a group of Chinese fishermen discovered a {{convert|20.0|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|6.0|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide ship about three meters below the surface near the Huaguang Reef. The wreckage covered 180 square meters meaning that the ship would have had an estimated displacement capacity of 60 tons and 11 cabins.&lt;ref name="Hau Mau"/&gt; 

On 15 March 2007, an archeological salvaging operation was organized by the [[National Museum of China]] and the Hainan Provincial Administration of Culture, Radio &amp; Television, Publishing and Sport, and the excavation of the shipwreck site at Huaguang Reef initiated. This operation not only helped the archaeologists involved in the survey locate nearly 10 other shipwrecks in the surrounding area,&lt;ref name="Shujuan"/&gt; but also helped establish the first time that China conducted high-seas excavation work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en/2007-05/17/content_98069.htm|title=A Milestone in China's Archaeology: Discovery of Ancient Ceramics off Xisha Islands|publisher=China Culture.org|accessdate=2 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118183319/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en/2007-05/17/content_98069.htm|archivedate=18 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Zhang Wei, director of the China's Underwater Research Center with the National Museum at the time of the discovery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diving-industry.com/2007/05/11/ancient-ceramics-discovered-off-xisha-islands-south-china-sea/|title=Ancient ceramics discovered off Xisha Islands-South China Sea|year=2007|publisher=Diving Indrustry.com| accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though the wreck had been robbed many times and severely damaged by looters, the retrieval of the more than 10,000 pieces of antique [[pottery]] and [[porcelain]], which seems to have mainly come from the [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] [[kilns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.maritimeasia.ws/topic/chronology.html| title=Chronology of Asian maritime history|publisher=Maritime Asia|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; most certainly provide a very important piece of information and undeniable evidence of an already well established [[Trade route#Maritime trade|maritime trade route]], known as the [[Silk Road#Marine route|"Marine Silk Road"]], between China and the rest of the world during the Song and [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1280-1368).&lt;ref name="Hau Mau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://haumau.org/?p=219|title=Chinese Archeologists Discover Ancient Ceramics off Xisha Islands|publisher=Hau Mau Conversations|accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artefacts==
Many fragments of porcelain and pottery were collected at the site, mostly concentrated in an area of 38 square meters within the reef.

'''Iatromathematicians''' (from Greek ἰατρική "medicine" and μαθηματικά "mathematics") were a school of physicians in 17th-century Italy who tried to apply the laws of [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]] in order to understand the functioning of the human body. They were also keen students of [[anatomy]]. These iantromathematicians made an effort to prove that applying a purely mechanical conception to the study of the human body is futile. The mechanical conceptions that they had referred to was [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s studies of the human body, and the writings of  Aristotle about the motion of animals related to geometric analysis. Iantromathematicians considered the bodies functioning to be measured by quantifiable numbers, weights, and measures.

==Iatromathematics==
The field of iatromathematics is allied to science; however, it lacks the applicability of the proper scientific method and is therefore considered a form of [[pseudoscience]]. It applies the study of [[astrology]] to medicine.

Iatromathematicians viewed the human body through astrological reasoning as well as mechanics. They associate various stars, or zodiac signs with the functioning of the human body. The twelve astrological signs contribute to each part of the body from head to toe. Moreover, planets and existing cosmos in space are correlated with certain parts of the body. Through examining a [[natal chart]], iatromathematicians attempt to predict biological setbacks in an individual.

Iatromathematicians examine the active and energetic temperament of the human body. Moreover, they explore the causes of various health problems and attempt to find ways to treat certain detrimental diseases. In iatromathematics, there is a particular assumption that there is an impact of various energetic fields caused on the star bodies. The star body of an individual is often referred to by astrologists as an energetic matrix and is believed to be spawned by heavenly bodies such as the sun, moon, planets, and several other astrological signs.

Iatromathematicians study these conceptions and try to regulate the path of the star body of individuals so that it will give a positive, rather than a negative result. By doing so, they believe that it will contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Its doctrine is based on [[cosmobiology]] in which several emotional and physiological dilemmas in the body are associated with the positioning of celestial bodies in outer space.

Iatromathematics is closely correlated with [[biomechanics]] because the field of biomechanics investigates macrobiotic bodies to a macroscopic degree through the appliance of several engineering principles. The perspective of iatromathematicians differed from that of iatrophysicists and iatrochemists in terms of the way human bodies function. Iatrophysicists predicted the deviations from the biological norm of the body through the appliance of physics, while iatrochemists measured the detrimental problems of the body by chemical means.

==Ibn Ezra==

Several individuals contributed to this field study of iatromathematics. For example, [[Abraham ibn Ezra|Ibn Ezra]] (Rabbi Avraham Ben Meir Ibn Ezra) wrote nine different astrological treatises. He covered all the subsections of astrology which include the branches of natal, medicinal, horary, electional, and mundane. Ibn Ezra’s best known work was known as ''The Beginning of Wisdom''. Over time, various individuals studied his works comprehensively. One such person was [[George Sarton]], who is the founder of the [[History of Science Society]].

Recently, [[Archibald Pitcairne]] was mentioned as the "forgotten father of mathematical medicine" and his contribution praised to creating the bases of iatromathematics.&lt;ref name=pitc-lancet&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashrafian|first=Hutan|title=Mathematics in medicine: the 300-year legacy of iatromathematics|journal=Lancet|date=November 30, 2013|volume=382|page=1780|url=http://download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS014067361362543X.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62542-8|pmid=24290588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pitcairne&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerrini|first=Anita|title=Archibald Pitcairne and Newtonian Medicine|journal=Medical History|year=1987|volume=31|pages=70–83|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139685/pdf/medhist00068-0074.pdf|accessdate=7 February 2014|pmc=1139685|pmid=3543564|issue=1|doi=10.1017/s0025727300046329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Imbrex Tegula PD.gif|right|thumb|400px|Each tegula (a) overlaps the one below it and its raised lateral borders tapering in to nestle between its lower tile's upper border. Each curved imbrex (b) covers the side ridges of the joints formed between adjacent tegulae. Some imbrices are not shown in order to reveal the details of the tegular joints.]]

The '''imbrex''' and '''tegula''' (plurals '''imbrices''' and '''tegulae''') were overlapping [[roof tiles]] used in [[Architecture of ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]] as a waterproof and durable [[Roof construction|roof covering]]. They were made predominantly of [[Terracotta|fired]] [[clay]], but also sometimes of [[marble]], [[bronze]] or [[Gilding|gilt]].  In Rome, they replaced [[wood shingle|wooden shingles]], and were used on almost every type of structure, from humble outbuildings to grand temples and public facilities.

The tegula ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''solenes''') was a plain flat tile, or a flat tile with raised edges, which was laid flat upon the roof, while the imbrex (Greek '''kalupter''') was a semi-cylindrical roofing tile, like a half-pipe, laid over the joints between the tegulae. When well-made and properly imbricated (overlapped), there was little need for further waterproofing or [[sealant]].

The roofing area was generally surrounded by [[antefix]]ae which were often decorated, and had several decorative [[anthemion|anthemia]] to cover each end row imbrex.

The concept of imbrex and tegula roofing in pitched roof construction is still in use today as an international feature of style and design, and is the origin of the term [[:wikt:imbrication|imbrication]] for the condition of things arranged in overlapping layers.

==History and development==
[[File:Tiles Fishbourne.JPG|thumb|right|An example of the construct at [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]] museum]]
Imbrices and tegulae were first made by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]].  Like [[brick]]s, they were formed of wet [[clay]] in a four-sided [[molding (process)|mould]], often shaped with a piece of wire, and then baked in an oven or [[kiln]].  More sophisticated moulds were developed over time.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Tegulae were originally made perfectly flat, or with nothing more than a ridge underneath the upper border, which allowed the tile to be "hung" upon a sloping roof so that it would not slide to the ground. Later, tegulae were formed with a raised border on the two vertical sides, which would channel rainwater to the bottom of the tile, rather than allowing it to seep between tiles to dampen the roofing materials. Another improvement occurred when these two raised borders were made to converge, forming a broad v-shaped [[trapezoid]] with the narrowest edge downwards, nestling into the widest part of the tile below it to form a continuous channel.&lt;ref name="Warry"&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Warry |title=Tegulae Manufacture, Typology and Use in Roman Britain |publisher=Archaeopress |location=Oxford, England |year=2006 |isbn=1-84171-956-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imbrices completed the [[waterproofing]] of the roof by arching over the joints between the vertical edges of the tegulae, dividing the roof into channels. Rain water flowed off the curved imbrices into the channels and down over the surfaces of the tegulae, and descended into the [[Rain gutter|gutter]] (''canalis'').  In formal architecture the ''canalis'' had a plain or ornamented frontal piece set atop the [[entablature]], immediately above the [[cornice]]. The semicircular opening at the front of the lowermost imbrex was often capped with an ornamental ''fronton'', and the spouts which drained the gutters were frequently decorated with [[lion]]s' heads (''capita leonina'') or other fantastic or grotesque faces.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

[[Image:RoofTiles CC-BY Stewart.jpg|thumb|left|Imbrices and tegulae are still in use in Rome in 2005.]]
By Roman times many tiles were being made under the auspices of various [[Roman legion]]s, and were imprinted with a stamp of the legion's insignia. Imbrices and tegulae are common finds in [[archaeological site]]s, and their design and markings can be of use in dating the sites and identifying the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Warry" /&gt; For instance, a 1993 archaeological dig in [[Merseyside]] in England uncovered over {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of tile and [[kiln]] remains. Some of the tegulae were stamped with the "LXXVV" insigniae of the [[Legio XX Valeria Victrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Vivien G. |last=Swan |author2=Robert A. Philpott |title=Legio XX VV and Tile Production at Tarbock, Merseyside |encyclopedia=Britannia |volume=31 |year=2000 |pages=55–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen James |last=Malone |title=Legio XX Valeria Victrix: Prosopography, Archaeology and History |publisher=Archaeopress |location=Oxford, England |year=2006 |isbn=1-84171-922-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Romans also often recycled broken tiles by incorporating them into [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]].

Tiles of [[marble]] were first used around the year [[620s BC|620 BC]].&lt;ref name=Paus&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0159&amp;layout=&amp;loc=5.10.2 v.10 §2] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the superior beauty and durability of the material, these tiles could be made of a much larger size than those of clay. Consequently, they were used in the construction of the greatest temples, such as the [[Temple of Zeus, Olympia|Temple of Zeus]] at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]],&lt;ref name=Paus /&gt; the [[Parthenon]] at [[Athens]], and the [[Serapeum]] at [[Pozzuoli|Puteoli]] (modern Pozzuoli). Still more expensive and magnificent tiles were made of [[bronze]] and [[gilding|gilt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0138&amp;layout=&amp;loc=33.18 Book 33.3 §18] {{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Iraqi Insurgency (2017–present)''' is an [[insurgency]] that began in late 2017 after multiple defeats of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), causing it to lose its territorial control, by the [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi military]] (largely backed by the [[United States]]) and [[Private militias in Iraq|allied]] paramilitary forces (largely backed by [[Iran]]).

==Background==
The insurgency is a direct continuation of the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|Iraqi Civil War from 2014 to 2017]], with mostly Sunni rebel groups continuing armed opposition against the Shia-led [[Iraqi Government]]. Along with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIL), other insurgents fighting the government include a group known as the [[White Flags]] which is reportedly composed of former ISIL members and Kurdish rebels and is believed by the government of Iraq to be part of [[Ansar al-Islam]] and possibly affiliated with [[al-Qaeda]].&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt; The group operates mostly in the [[Kirkuk Governorate]] and has used an assortment of [[guerilla]] tactics against government forces. Other factions opposed to the Iraqi government include the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Iraqi Baath Party]] currently led by [[Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri]] a former official to [[Saddam Hussein]] during his rule in Iraq and has been active in Iraq's conflict since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|US-led invasion]] in 2003 leading multiple factions including the [[Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order|Naqshbandi Army]] and [[Supreme Command for Jihad and Liberation]].

==Course of the Insurgency==
Since ISIL's [[Battle of Mosul (2016–2017)|loss]] of [[Mosul]] in late 2017 which was declared as Iraq's victory over ISIL and widely seen as an end to the civil war, and declared as such by Iraq's Prime Minister [[Haidar al-Abadi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate/iraq-declares-final-victory-over-islamic-state-idUSKBN1E30B9|title=Iraq declares final victory over Islamic State|first=Maher|last=Chmaytelli|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; multiple incidents of violence have occurred being carried out by the conflicting sides, in spite of Iraq's declaration of victory over ISIL the group is widely seen as far from gone and continues to retain a presence throughout Iraq, and still capable of carrying out attacks and skirmishes with pro-government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/isis-returns-iraq-terror-hawija|title=ISIS returns to Iraq, and a town confronts a new wave of terror|website=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL has been waging a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] with a strong presence in the governorates of [[Kirkuk Governorate|Kirkuk]], [[Diyala Governorate|Diyala]], [[Saladin Governorate|Saladin]], and the [[Sulaymaniyah Governorate]], with local forces largely ill-equipped and inexperienced, ISIL has also taken advantage of the areas rough terrain to carry out operations. ISIL has also made a notable presence in the cities of [[Kirkuk]], [[Hawija]] and [[Tuz Khurmato]] and has carried out attacks at night in rural areas.

ISIL fighters also reportedly move through villages during the day without interference from security forces, and locals have been asked by ISIL to give fighters food and give information on the whereabouts of Iraqi personnel, locals have also stated that ISIL fighters will frequently enter into Mosques and ask for [[Zakat]] to fund the insurgency. Among ISIL's operations include assassinations, kidnappings, raids and ambushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2018/09/16/isis-has-not-vanished-it-is-fighting-a-guerrilla-war-against-the-iraqi-state/|title=The Underground Caliphate: ISIS Has Not Vanished. It Is Fighting a Guerrilla War Against the Iraqi State.|first=Simona|last=Foltyn|date=16 September 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[The Pentagon]] ISIL is still stronger than it was between 2006–2007 when the group declared the [[Islamic State of Iraq]] during its incarnation as [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]], citing a UN report which claimed that ISIL still had 20.000-30.000 fighters in Syria and Iraq. That claim of strength was simultaneously tempered though, with The Pentagon saying that ISIL had lost all of its territory and fighters were scattered, making them much less of a threat. The Pentagon predicted that ISIL will lose strength because of their dispersion in a way similar to what happened to al-Qaeda, while also warning that ISIL is still in a position to make a comeback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/world/2018/8/17/17715374/isis-still-threat-defeated-terror-attacks-pentagon-iraq-syria-trump|title=The Pentagon says ISIS is "well-positioned" to make a comeback|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ISIL's defeat they have been greatly weakened and violence in Iraq has been sharply reduced in 2018. Only 95 people lost their lives during the month of May, the lowest figure in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://1001iraqithoughts.com/2018/06/04/daish-goes-underground-literally-in-iraq-as-peace-persists/&lt;/ref&gt;

====January-April====
Between January and February 2018, Iraqi security forces and [[Peshmerga]] clashed with the [[White Flags]] around parts of the Kirkuk and [[Saladin Governorate|Saladin]] governorates for control of oil fields which the Iraqi government claims the group's priority is. The Iraqi government said in the clashes the composition of the White Flag's fighters are ISIL members and individuals linked to the Kurdish mafia, the government also alleges that the [[Kurdish Regional Government]] allowed oil theft to occur in the area while it was under their control and enabled ISIL for their own interests.&lt;ref name="middleeasteye.net"/&gt;

In March 2018, In two separate attacks ISIL reportedly killed 10 individuals including a pro-government Sunni tribal Sheikh along with his son and guests at his house in the town of [[Al-Shirqat]] south of [[Mosul]], in the other attack ISIL killed 5 individuals from the same family whom were [[Iraqi Turkmen]] and Shia at a fake checkpoint set up by the group posing as Iraqi security forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/1202326/iraq-least-10-killed-two-isis-attacks|title=Iraq: At Least 10 Killed in Two ISIS Attacks|first=Asharq|last=Al-awsat|website=aawsat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30245">{{short description|A movement of activists whose Judaism informs their support left-wing or liberal causes}}
The '''Jewish left''' consists of [[Jews]] who identify with, or support, [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] or [[Liberalism|liberal]] causes, consciously as Jews, either as individuals or through organizations. There is no one organization or movement which constitutes the Jewish left, however. Jews have been major forces in the history of the [[labor movement]], the [[settlement house]] movement, the [[women's rights]] movement, [[anti-racist]] work, and [[anti-fascist]] and [[anti-capitalist]] organizations of many forms in [[Europe]], the [[United States]] and modern-day [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/newleft.html "The New Left."] ''Jewish Virtual Library'' (2008); retrieved 6 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Jews have a rich history of involvement in [[Jewish anarchism|anarchism]], [[socialism]], [[Marxism]], and Western [[liberalism]]. Although the expression "on the left" covers a range of politics, many well-known figures "on the left" have been of Jews who were born into Jewish families and have various degrees of connection to Jewish communities, Jewish culture, Jewish tradition, or the Jewish religion in its many variants.

==History==
Jewish leftism has its philosophic roots in the Jewish Enlightenment, or [[Haskalah]], led by thinkers such as [[Moses Mendelssohn]], as well as the support of many European Jews such as [[Ludwig Börne]] for [[republicanism|republican]] ideals in the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a movement for [[Jewish Emancipation]] spread across [[Europe]], strongly associated with the emergence of [[political liberalism]], based on the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of [[rights]] and [[equality under the law]]. Because liberals represented the political left of the time (see [[left-right politics]]), emancipated Jews, as they entered the political culture of the nations where they lived, became closely associated with liberal parties. Thus, many Jews supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1776, the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, and the [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]]; while [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]] tended to vote for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], which had led the parliamentary struggle for [[Emancipation of the Jews in England|Jewish Emancipation]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Alderman]] (1983) ''The Jewish Community in British Politics'', Oxford: Clarendon.&lt;/ref&gt; — an arrangement called by some scholars "the liberal Jewish compromise".&lt;ref&gt;see Sharman Kadish ''Bolsheviks and British Jews'', London: Frank Cass. (1992, e. g., pp. 55-60, 132); Jonathan Hyman [http://www.humanities.manchester.ac.uk/medialibrary/arts/history/workingpapers/wp_50.pdf ''Jews in Britain During the Great War''], Manchester: University of Manchester Working Papers in Economic and Social History No. 51, October (2001, e. g., p. 11). The phrase was coined by [[Steven Bayme]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The emergence of a Jewish working class===
In the age of [[industrialisation]] in the late nineteenth century, a Jewish [[working class]] emerged in the cities of [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]]. Before long, a Jewish [[labour movement]] emerged too. The Jewish Labour Bund–[[General Jewish Labor Union]] was formed in [[Lithuania]], Poland, and Russia in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes, Philip. [http://jewishcurrents.org/rise-fall-jewish-labor-bund-23131 "The Rise and Fall of the Jewish Labor Bund"], ''Jewish Currents'' (Autumn 2013); accessed 8 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Distinctive Jewish [[socialist]] organizations formed and spread across the Jewish [[Pale of Settlement]] in the [[Russian Empire]]. There were also a significant number of people of Jewish origin who did not explicitly identify as Jews per se, but were active in anarchist, socialist, and social democratic as well as communist organizations, movements, and parties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As [[Zionism]] grew in strength as a political movement, [[socialist Zionist]] parties were formed, such as [[Ber Borochov]]'s [[Poale Zion]]. There were non-Zionist left-wing forms of [[Jewish nationalism]], such as [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialism]] (which called for a Jewish national homeland, but not necessarily in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]), [[Jewish Autonomism|autonomism]] (which called for non-territorial national rights for Jews in multinational empires), and the [[Folkspartei|folkism]], advocated by [[Simon Dubnow]], (which celebrated the [[cultural Judaism|Jewish culture]] of the [[Yiddish]]-speaking masses).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

As Eastern European Jews migrated West from the 1880s, these ideologies took root in growing Jewish communities, such as [[London]]'s [[East End]], [[Paris]]'s [[Pletzl]], [[New York City]]'s [[Lower East Side]], and [[Buenos Aires]]. There was a lively Jewish anarchist scene in London, a central figure of which was, the non-Jewish German thinker and writer [[Rudolf Rocker]]. The important Jewish socialist movement in the United States, with its Yiddish-language daily, ''[[The Forward]]'', and trade unions such as the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] and the [[Amalgamated Clothing Workers]]. Important figures in these milieux included [[Rose Schneiderman]], [[Abraham Cahan]], [[Morris Winchevsky]], and [[David Dubinsky]].

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jews played a major role in the [[Social Democratic]] parties of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Germany]], [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|Russia]], [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Austria-Hungary]], and [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Poland]]. Historian [[Enzo Traverso]] has used the term "Judeo-Marxism" to describe the innovative forms of [[Marxism]] associated with these Jewish socialists. These ranged from strongly [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] positions hostile to all forms of [[nationalism]] (as with [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Leon Trotsky]]) to positions more sympathetic to cultural nationalism (as with the [[Austromarxists]] or [[Vladimir Medem]]).

===In Soviets and against fascism===
As with the American revolution of 1776, the French revolution of 1789, and the German revolution of 1848, many Jews worldwide welcomed the [[Russian revolution of 1917]], celebrating the fall of a regime that had presided over antisemitic [[pogroms]], and believing that the new order in what was to become the Soviet Union would bring improvements in the situation of Jews in those lands. Many Jews became involved in [[Communist parties]], constituting large proportions of their membership in many countries, including [[Great Britain]] and the U.S. There were specifically Jewish sections of many Communist parties, such as the [[Yevsektsiya]] in the [[Soviet Union]]. The Communist regime in the USSR pursued what could be characterised as ambivalent policies towards Jews and Jewish culture, at times supporting their development as a national culture (e. g., sponsoring significant Yiddish language scholarship and creating an [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast|autonomous Jewish territory]] in [[Birobidzhan]]), at times pursuing antisemitic purges, such as that in the wake of the so-called [[Doctors' plot]]. (See also [[Komzet]].)

With the advent of [[fascism]] in parts of Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, many Jews responded by becoming actively involved in the left, and particularly the Communist parties, which were at the forefront of the [[anti-fascist]] movement. For example, many Jewish volunteers fought in the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (for instance in the American [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] and in the Polish-Jewish [[Naftali Botwin Company]]). Jews and leftists fought [[Oswald Mosley]]'s British fascists at the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. This mass movement was influenced by the [[Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee]] in the Soviet Union.

In [[World War II]], the Jewish left played a major part in [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to Nazism]]. For example, Bundists and left Zionists were key in [[Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]]. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

===Radical Jews in Central and Western Europe===
As well as the movements rooted in the Jewish working class, relatively [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[middle class]] Jews in Central and Western Europe began to search for sources of radicalism in Jewish tradition. For example, [[Martin Buber]] drew on [[Hasidism]] in articulating his anarchist philosophy, [[Gershom Scholem]] was an anarchist and a [[kabbalah]] scholar, [[Walter Benjamin]] was equally influenced by [[Marxism]] and Jewish [[messianism]], [[Gustav Landauer]] was a religious Jew and a [[libertarian communist]], [[Jacob Israël de Haan]] combined socialism with [[Haredi]] Judaism, while [[left-libertarian]] [[Bernard Lazare]] became a passionately Jewish Zionist in 1897, but wrote 2 years later to Herzl - and by extension to the [[Zionist Action Committee]] -, "You are [[bourgeois]] in thoughts, bourgeois in your feelings, bourgeois in your ideas, bourgeois in your conception of society.".&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Piterberg (2008), ''The Returns of Zionism: Myths, Politics, and Scholarship in Israel'', London: Verso, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Weimar Germany]], [[Walther Rathenau]] was a leading figure of the Jewish left.

===Socialist Zionism and the Israeli left===
{{Main|Labor Zionism}}
In the twentieth century, especially after the [[Second Aliyah]], socialist Zionism - first developed in Russia by the Marxist Ber Borochov and the non-Marxists [[Nachman Syrkin]] and [[A. D. Gordon]] - became a powerful force in the [[Yishuv]], the Jewish settlement in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Poale Zion, the [[Histadrut]] labour union and the [[Mapai]] party played a major part in the campaign for an [[Israel|Israeli state]], with socialist politicians like [[David Ben-Gurion]] and [[Golda Meir]] amongst the founders of the nation. At the same time, the [[kibbutz]] movement was an experiment in practical socialism.

In the 1940s, many on the left advocated a [[binational state]] in Israel/Palestine, rather than an exclusively Jewish state. (This position was taken by [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Martin Buber]], for example). Since independence in 1948, there has been a lively Israeli left, both Zionist ([[Labor Party (Israel)|the Labour Party]], [[Meretz-Yachad|Meretz]]) and [[anti-Zionist]] ([[Palestine Communist Party]], [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]]). The Labour Party and its predecessors have been in power in Israel for significant periods since 1948.

There are two worldwide groupings of left-wing Zionist organizations. The World Labour Zionist Movement, associated with the Labor Zionist tendency, is a loose association, including [[Labor Party (Israel)|Avoda]], [[Habonim Dror]], [[Histadrut]] and [[Na'amat]]. The [[Meretz|World Union of Meretz]], associated with what was historically known as the Socialist Zionist tendency, is a loose association of the Israeli Meretz party, the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] Socialist Zionist youth movement, the [[Kibbutz Movement|Kibbutz Artzi Federation]] and the [[Givat Haviva]] research and study center. Both movements exist as factions within the [[World Zionist Organization]], as well as regional or country-specific Zionist movements; the two roughly correspond to the interwar split between the Poale Zion Right (the tradition that led to Avoda) and the Poale Zion Left (Hashomer Hatzair, Mapam, Meretz).

===Apartheid South Africa===
South Africa's Jewish left-wing was heavily involved in left-wing causes such as the anti-apartheid movement. The most famous member of the anti-apartheid Jewish left-wing was [[Helen Suzman|Helen Suzman, DBE]]. There were also several liberal left-wing Jewish defendants in the [[Rivonia Trial]]: [[Joe Slovo]], [[Denis Goldberg]], [[Lionel Bernstein]], [[Bob Hepple]], [[Arthur Goldreich]], [[Harold Wolpe]], and [[James Kantor]].

==Contemporary Jewish left==
===1960s–1990s===
As the Jewish working class died out in the years after the [[Second World War]], its institutions and political movements did too. The [[Arbeter Ring]] in England, for example, came to an end in the 1950s and Jewish trade unionism in the US ceased to be a major force at that time. There are, however, still some remnants of the Jewish working class organizations left today, including the [[Workmen's Circle]], [[Jewish Labor Committee]], and ''[[The Forward]]'' (newspaper) in New York, the [[International Jewish Labor Bund]] in Australia, and the [[United Jewish People's Order]] in Canada.

The 1960s-1980s saw a renewal of interest among Western Jews in Jewish [[working class culture]] and the various radical traditions of the Jewish past. This led to the growth of a new sort of radical Jewish organization that was both interested in Yiddish culture, Jewish spirituality, and social justice. In the US, for example, between 1980–1992, [[New Jewish Agenda]] functioned as a national, multi-issue progressive membership organization with the mission of acting as a "Jewish voice on the Left and a Left voice in the Jewish Community". In 1991, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice formed to fight for "equitable distribution of economic and cultural resources and political power" in New York City. And in 1999, leftists broke from the LA chapter of the American Jewish Congress to form the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance]]. In Britain, the [[Jewish Socialists' Group]] and Rabbi [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]]'s [[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] have similarly continued this tradition, while more recently groups like [[Jewdas]] have taken an even more eclectic and radical approach to Jewishness. In [[Belgium]], the [[Union des progressistes juifs de Belgique]] is, since 1969, the heir of the Jewish Communist and Bundist Solidarité movement in the [[Belgian Resistance]], embracing the [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|Israeli refuseniks]] cause as well as of the undocumented immigrants in Belgium.

===2000s–present===
During the first decade of the 2000s, the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] became a defining element in the composition of the diasporic Jewish left. A new wave of Jewish organizations formed to support Palestinian causes. Groups such as [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], [[Independent Jewish Voices (Canada)]], [[Independent Jewish Voices|Independent Jewish Voices (UK)]] and the [[International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network]] gave renewed voice to [[Jewish Anti-Zionism]]. This perspective continues to be reflected in media outlets such as [[Mondoweiss]] and the Treyf Podcast.

Following the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], many leftist Jewish organizations in the US and Canada focused on directly challenging establishment Jewish organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/direct-action-disrupts-israeli-canadian-complicity-in-settler-colonialism|title=Direct action disrupts Jewish-Canadian complicity in settler colonialism – Canadian Dimension|website=Canadiandimension.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus|title=The rise of 'If Not Now' and the collapse of the pro-Israel consensus|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2014-09-10|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/national/339090/17-jewish-activists-protesting-israeli-occupation-arrested-at-adl-headquart/ |title=17 Jewish Activists Protesting Israeli Occupation Arrested at ADL Headquarters|website=Forward.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/louis-cancel-police|title=St. Louis Jews call on ADL to cancel honor to police|website=Mondoweiss.net|date=2015-07-18|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Jewish Federations|Jewish Federation]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], the [[Anti-Defamation League]], and [[Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs]], for their support for Israel's actions during the conflict. In the US, this intra-community conflict expanded to domestic politics following the [[United States presidential election, 2016]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jewschool.com/2016/11/78055/photos-young-jews-march-on-trump-hq-stopbannon|title=PHOTOS: Young Jews march on Trump HQ: #StopBannon: Will the Jewish Federations of North America follow suit?|website=Jewschool.com|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups such as If Not Now, [[Jewish Voice for Peace]], and Jews for Racial and Economic Justice began organizing under the banner of #JewishResistance to "challenge institutional Jewish support for the Trump administration and affiliated white nationalists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/160010/hundreds-join-jewish-resistance-protest-against-trump-chief-strategist-steve-bannon#.mNWlaFWoe|title=Hundreds join #JewishResistance protest against Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon|website=Mic.com|date=2016-11-21|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to exit polls, 71% of American Jews voted Democrat during the 2016 US Presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strickland |first1=Produced By Jon Huang, Samuel Jacoby, Michael |last2=Lai |first2=K. k Rebecca |title=Election 2016: Exit Polls |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=1 |website=The New York Times |accessdate=16 January 2017 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20161211011026/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html?_r=1 |archivedate=11 December 2016 |date=8 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last decade, the Jewish vote has gone to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] by 76–80%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/jewvote.html|title=Jewish Voting Record in U.S. Presidential Elections|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in each election. A large majority of American Jews also report feeling somewhat or very attached to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/jewish-american-beliefs-attitudes-culture-survey|title=A Portrait of Jewish Americans |publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary Israeli left===
Operating in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] governmental system based on [[proportional representation]], left-wing political parties and blocs in Israel have been able to elect members of the [[Knesset]] with varying degrees of success. Over time, those parties have evolved, with some merging, others disappearing, and new parties arising.

Israeli left-wing parties have included:
*[[Hadash]]
*[[Mapam]]
*[[Meretz-Yachad]]
*[[HaAvoda]]
*[[Meimad]]
*[[Progressive List for Peace]]
*[[Ratz (political party)|Ratz]]
*[[Left Camp of Israel]]
*[[HaOlam HaZeh – Koah Hadash]]

Notable figures in these parties have included: [[Meir Vilner]], [[Shulamit Aloni]], [[Uri Avnery]], [[Yossi Beilin]], [[Ran Cohen]], [[Mattityahu Peled|Matti Peled]], [[Amnon Rubinstein]], and [[Yossi Sarid]].

{{further|Politics of Israel#Political left}}

==British Jewish left==
[[British Jews]] have been influential in the left-wing [[politics of the United Kingdom]] for many years, especially in the main social democratic/socialist party, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], but also in the socially liberal [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

During the years when the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] was Britain's main party of the left, two Jews in particular attained high office: [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]], who led the Liberal Party from 1930–1935, and [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], the only British Jew to have been created a Marquess. Other notable Liberal Jews of the 1800s and early 1900s included: [[Lionel de Rothschild]], the first Jew to serve as an MP, [[David Salomons|Sir David Salomons]], [[Francis Goldsmid|Sir Francis Goldsmid]], [[George Jessel (jurist)|Sir George Jessel]], [[Arthur Cohen (politician)|Arthur Cohen]], [[Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling|The Lord Swaythling]], [[Sir Edward Sassoon, 2nd Baronet, of Kensington Gore|Sir Edward Sassoon]], [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|The Lord Hore-Belisha]] [[Edwin Samuel Montagu]], [[Ignaz Trebitsch-Lincoln]], and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|The Lord Wandsworth]].

In the early part of the 20th century, the Liberal Party gave way to the more radical and socialist Labour Party. [[Leonard Woolf]] and [[Hugh Franklin (suffragist)|Hugh Franklin]] were among the figures influential in the early Labour Party, and Jewish MPs like [[Barnett Janner, Baron Janner|Barnett Janner]], [[Sir Percy Harris, 1st Baronet|Sir Percy Harris]] and [[Harry Nathan, 1st Baron Nathan|The Lord Nathan]] were among the radical Liberal MPs, many of whom switched from Liberal to Labour, economists like [[Harold Laski]] and [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and intellectuals like [[Victor Gollancz]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] provided the intellectual impetus for British socialism to take hold. Prominent early Labour MPs included [[Lewis Silkin, 1st Baron Silkin|The Lord Silkin]], who became a Minister in [[Clement Attlee]]'s government, [[Sydney Silverman]], who abolished [[capital punishment]] in Britain, and [[Manny Shinwell, Baron Shinwell|The Lord Shinwell]], one of the leaders of [[Red Clydeside]] who later became [[Secretary of State for War]].

At the end of the [[Second World War]], the Labour Party entered government again, and several newly elected Labour MPs were Jewish, and often on the socialist left of the Party, radicalised by incidents like the [[Battle of Cable Street]]. Those MPs included [[Herschel Lewis Austin]], [[Maurice Edelman]], and [[Ian Mikardo]], as well as [[Phil Piratin]], one of only four MPs in British history to have represented the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]]. Several MPs elected in the 1940s and 1950s went on to be Ministers in [[Harold Wilson]]'s governments of the 1960s and 1970s: [[Joel Barnett, Baron Barnett|The Lord Barnett]], [[Edmund Dell]], [[John Diamond, Baron Diamond|John Diamond]], [[Reg Freeson]], [[Dora Gaitskell, Baroness Gaitskell|The Baroness Gaitskell]], [[Myer Galpern]], [[Gerald Kaufman]], [[Harold Lever, Baron Lever of Manchester|The Lord Lever of Manchester]], [[Paul Rose (UK politician)|Paul Rose]], [[Samuel Segal, Baron Segal|The Lord Segal]], [[Beatrice Serota, Baroness Serota|The Baroness Serota]], [[Robert Sheldon, Baron Sheldon|The Lord Sheldon]], [[John Silkin|John]] and [[Samuel Silkin, Baron Silkin of Dulwich|Samuel Silkin]], [[Barnett Stross]], and [[David Weitzman]]. A prominent Jewish Labour politician in this era was [[Leo Abse]], who put forward the private members' bill which decriminalised homosexuality and reformed the divorce laws in Britain. [[Robert Maxwell]], a Labour MP during the 1964–66 Wilson government, eventually became a leading newspaper publisher when his holding company purchased [[Mirror Group Newspapers]] in 1984.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party experienced significant turbulence with the rise of the [[Entryism|entryist]] [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant tendency]] (a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] group led by [[Ted Grant]]), and the centre-left [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] (SDP) breaking away and forming an [[SDP–Liberal Alliance|Alliance]] with the Liberal Party (who had two Jewish MPs, [[Alex Carlile, Baron Carlile of Berriew|The Lord Carlile of Berriew]] and [[Clement Freud]]), later to unite as the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. One such parliamentary defector to the SDP was [[Neville Sandelson]], and the [[Keynesian]] economist [[Robert Skidelsky, Baron Skidelsky|The Lord Skidelsky]] also defected. Those Jewish Labour MPs who stuck with the party included [[Harry Cohen]], [[Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs|Alf Dubs]], [[Millie Miller]], [[Eric Moonman]], and [[David Winnick]].

During the late 1980s and 1990s, with the shift away from the socialist left of the party, and during [[Tony Blair]]'s leadership of the Labour Party, notable senior Jewish politicians included [[Peter Mandelson]], one of the architects of "[[New Labour]]", [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith]], [[Jeremy Beecham, Baron Beecham|The Lord Beecham]], and [[Philip Gould, Baron Gould of Brookwood|The Lord Gould of Brookwood]]. Mandelson, party fund-raiser [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|The Lord Levy]] and [[Jack Straw]] (who is of partial Jewish ancestry), were accused by [[Tam Dalyell]], MP, of being a "[[cabal]] of Jewish advisers" around Blair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2999219.stm|title=Dalyell's 'Jewish cabal' remarks denied|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Blair's Ministers and Labour backbenchers were Jewish or partially Jewish, including [[Barbara Roche]], [[Margaret Hodge|Dame Margaret Hodge]], [[Fabian Hamilton]], [[Louise Ellman]], [[Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman|The Baroness Hayman]], [[Oona King, Baroness King of Bow|The Baroness King of Bow]], and [[Gillian Merron]]. Labour donors during the 1990s and 2000s who were Jewish included [[David Abrahams (businessman)|David Abrahams]], [[Alexander Bernstein, Baron Bernstein of Craigweil|The Lord Bernstein of Craigweil]], [[Richard Caring]], [[Trevor Chinn|Sir Trevor Chinn]], [[David Garrard (property developer)|Sir David Garrard]], [[Robert Gavron, Baron Gavron|The Lord Gavron]], [[Emmanuel Kaye|Sir Emmanuel Kaye]], [[Andrew Rosenfeld]], [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|The Lord Sainsbury of Turville]], and [[Barry Townsley]]. Several of these were caught up in the [[Cash for Honours]] scandal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Under the government of Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], brothers [[David Miliband]] and [[Ed Miliband]] became members of the Cabinet. Their father was the Marxist academic [[Ralph Miliband]]. The brothers differed in their view of the party's future direction, and they fought a bitter [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2010|leadership election]] against each other in 2010. Ed Miliband won the election and became the first Jewish leader of the Labour Party. One of Miliband's Shadow Cabinet members, [[Ivan Lewis]], as well as advisers [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], [[Industrial Areas Foundation|Arnie Graf]], and [[Maurice Glasman, Baron Glasman|The Lord Glasman]] are all Jewish.

Current Jewish Labour politicians include: [[William Bach, Baron Bach|William Bach]], [[Steve Bassam, Baron Bassam of Brighton|The Lord Bassam of Brighton]], [[Luciana Berger]], [[Michael Cashman]], [[Anthony Grabiner, Baron Grabiner|The Lord Grabiner]], [[Ruth Henig, Baroness Henig|Ruth Henig]], [[Jonathan Kestenbaum, Baron Kestenbaum|The Lord Kestenbaum]], [[Jonathan Mendelsohn]], [[Janet Neel Cohen, Baroness Cohen of Pimlico|Janet Neel Cohen]], [[Meta Ramsay, Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale|Meta Ramsay]], [[Catherine Stihler]], [[Andrew Stone, Baron Stone of Blackheath|Andrew Stone]], [[Alan Sugar]], [[Leslie Turnberg, Baron Turnberg|Leslie Turnberg]], and [[Robert Winston]].

Since the foundation of the Liberal Democrats, several Jews have achieved prominence: [[David Alliance, Baron Alliance|David Alliance]], the aforementioned Alex Carlisle, [[Miranda Green (journalist)|Miranda Green]], [[Rosalind Grender, Baroness Grender|Olly Grender]], [[Sally Hamwee, Baroness Hamwee|Sally Hamwee]], [[Evan Harris]], [[Susan Kramer, Baroness Kramer|Susan Kramer]], [[Anthony Lester, Baron Lester of Herne Hill|Anthony Lester]], [[Jonathan Marks, Baron Marks of Henley-on-Thames|Jonathan Marks]], [[Julia Neuberger, Baroness Neuberger|Julia Neuberger]], [[Monroe Palmer, Baron Palmer of Childs Hill|Monroe Palmer]], [[Paul Strasburger, Baron Strasburger|Paul Strasburger]], and [[Lynne Featherstone]], who became a Minister in the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Coalition government 2010-15]].

{{Nihongo|'''''Joe &amp; Mac'''''|ジョーとマック 戦え原始人|Joe &amp; Mac: Tatakae Genshijin|lit. "Joe &amp; Mac: Caveman Combat"}}, also known as '''''Caveman Ninja''''', is a 1991 [[platform game]] released for the [[Arcade game|arcades]] by [[Data East]].&lt;ref name=Arcade/&gt; It was later adapted for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]], [[Amiga]], [[Zeebo]], [[Nintendo Switch]], and [[Personal computer|PC]].

==Gameplay==
[[image:Joe &amp; Mac.png|thumb|left|Joe fights a Tyrannosaurus in the game's first level using the stone wheel.]]
The game stars the green-haired Joe and the blue-haired Mac, cavemen who battle through numerous prehistoric levels using weapons such as [[boomerang]]s, [[bone]]s, [[fire]], [[flint]]s, [[electricity]], stone [[wheel]]s, and [[club (weapon)|club]]s. The objective of the game is to rescue a group of women who were kidnapped by a rival tribe of cavemen. The game features a health system by which the player loses health over a period of time, apart from during boss battles.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hardcoregaming101.net/joeandmac/joeandmac.htm]." Hardcore Gaming 101. Retrieved on August 04, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A two-player mode is available, in some versions both characters are capable of damaging each other.

The original arcade version and Amiga, Genesis, Zeebo MS-DOS ports have the distinction of allowing the player to select between different routes at the end of boss battles. Also, after defeating the final boss, the players can choose between three exits – each one leading to a slightly different ending sequence.

==Ports==
The game has been [[ported]] to various systems, some of which drop the name ''Caveman Ninja'', referring to the game simply as ''Joe &amp; Mac.''

A [[Super NES]] version was developed and published in 1991 by [[Data East]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141114144409/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=110 "''Joe &amp; Mac'' (SNES) Overview"]. AllGame. Archived November 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, another version was developed by Eden Entertainment Software and published by [[Takara]] for the [[Sega Genesis]].&lt;ref name=Genesis/&gt; In December 1992, a version for the [[NES]] was released. It was developed by [[Elite Systems]] and published by Data East.&lt;ref name=NES/&gt; A [[Game Boy]] version, released in North America and the United Kingdom in April 1993,&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Total/&gt; was developed by Motivetime and was also published by Data East.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141114235158/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=17543 "''Joe &amp; Mac'' (Game Boy) Overview"]. AllGame. Archived November 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Genesis version is considered a close match to the arcade version.&lt;ref name=Visions/&gt; The Super NES version is a reworked game which features an overworld map used to choose the levels (unlike other versions all of them have to be played), which were longer, plus some bonus stages (either in the levels or out in the world map). Some of the weapons are missing and can no longer be charged up. The final boss is also different, and there are only two endings. The NES and Game Boy versions lack the option of choosing levels or endings. Both feature variants of the arcade boss.

==Reception==
Kyle Knight of [[AllGame]] rated the arcade version two and a half stars out of five and wrote that it "is an adequate but uninspired action game. The graphics are easily Caveman Ninja's high point. Both background and character graphics are drawn well and finely detailed while the coloring is generally lush and vivid." However, Knight criticized the easy difficulty of the game because of its short levels: "The levels are practically over as soon as they begin." Knight also called the game's music "dull and uninspired," as well as "boring and repetitive."&lt;ref name=Arcade&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141116020546/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=9735&amp;tab=review "''Caveman Ninja'' Review"]. Kyle Knight. AllGame. Archived November 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skyler Miller of AllGame rated the NES version two and a half stars out of five and criticized its "unresponsive controls," writing that, "Jumping and simultaneously throwing your weapon, an important move, is often hard to perform." Miller also wrote, "Although the graphics are above average for the NES, they vary from level to level."&lt;ref name=NES&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141116152351/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=103&amp;tab=review "''Joe &amp; Mac'' (NES) Review"]. Skyler Miller. AllGame. Archived November 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' wrote that the NES version was colorful but that the graphics "are prehistoric," criticizing the "flat backgrounds and sprites". ''GamePro'' also criticized the music, described as "rock-splitting clinks and clanks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo Pro Review: Joe &amp; Mac (NES)|url=https://archive.org/stream/GamePro_Issue_046_May_1993#page/n41/mode/1up|website=GamePro|accessdate=September 3, 2017|page=40|date=May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Super Play]]'' magazine gave the SNES version of the game a 72 percent rating and praised its colorful graphics, but also wrote, "The snag is that there isn't a lot to hold your interest. [...] the appeal starts to flag after a few minutes. The collision detection is annoying as well, tending to give baddies the benefit of the doubt in any clash of heads. I'm afraid this, coupled with the awkward controls, soon saw me adopting a 'couldn't care less' attitude towards the game."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Superplay_Issue_01_1992-11_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n69/mode/1up/search/mac "''Joe and Mac'' (SNES) review"]. ''[[Super Play]]'' (November 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame gave the Sega Genesis version of ''Joe &amp; Mac'' three and a half stars out of five. Weiss praised the game's graphics and sound effects, and wrote, "This game features some of the best music ever on a 16-bit system." Weiss criticized the game's two-player mode, writing, "With two players, you might help each other out of a jam from time to time, but you also slow each other down."&lt;ref name=Genesis&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141116165915/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12668&amp;tab=review "''Joe &amp; Mac'' (Genesis) review"]. Brett Alan Weiss, [[AllGame]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sega Visions]]'' praised the Genesis version's "bright colors and bouncy sounds," but criticized its controls.&lt;ref name=Visions&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Sega_Visions_1994-02_Sega_US#page/n85/mode/1up|title=Joe and Mac|work=[[Sega Visions]]|date=February 1994|accessdate=June 16, 2016|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''GamePro'', reviewing the Genesis version, noted similarities to the SNES version and praised the "entertaining" two-player mode. However, the magazine concluded, "It's fun, but this style of game is gradually going the way of the dinosaur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://archive.org/stream/GamePro_Issue_056_March_1994#page/n55/mode/1up|title= Joe &amp; Mac (Genesis)|date= March 1994|work= [[GamePro]]|access-date= October 28, 2016|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British television program ''[[Bad Influence!]]'' gave the SNES version 4 out of 5.&lt;ref name=CU/&gt; Tony Dillon of ''[[CU Amiga]]'' gave the Amiga version a 78 percent rating and wrote that the game "is a lot of fun to play. Not as complete or polished as ''[[Zool]]'', but still a great platform game. Controls are responsive, the graphics are good and the sampled sound is excellent, but I couldn't help feeling that in these times of epic Amiga games, this one is just a little too limited."&lt;ref name=CU&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/cuamiga-magazine-034/CUAmiga_034_Dec_1992#page/n55/mode/1up|title=Joe &amp; Mac Caveman Ninja|last=Dillon|first=Tony|publisher=[[EMAP]]|date=December 1992|work=[[CU Amiga]]|access-date=May 19, 2016|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huw Melliar-Smith of ''[[Amiga Action]]'' gave the Amiga version a 79 percent rating and wrote that the animation of the game's enemies "is pretty good. Not spectacular, but good nonetheless. As Joe &amp; Mac are the focus of attention, perhaps a little more effort might have gone into their creation." Melliar-Smith praised the multiplayer option as being superior to single-player mode, and also complimented the sound effects, but called the music "repetitive and not particularly creative." Melliar-Smith also criticized the unresponsive controls, writing, "It is the gameplay that is most disappointing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melliar-Smith|first=Huw|date=February 1993|title=Joe &amp; Mac Caveman Ninja|journal=[[Amiga Action]]|publisher=[[Europress]]|pages=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Paget of ''[[Amiga Format]]'' gave the Amiga version a 74 percent rating and praised its "clear graphics and well-drawn backdrops," but wrote that the game "is a bit shallow, your cavemen amble along and the levels are linear and allow no exploration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Amiga_Format_Issue_043_1993-02_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n88/mode/1up|title=Joe and Mac: Caveman Ninja|last=Paget|first=Dave|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=February 1993|work=[[Amiga Format]]|access-date=May 19, 2016|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Upchurch of ''[[The One (magazine)|The One Amiga]]'' gave the Amiga version a 22 percent rating and called the plot and gameplay "uninspired." Upchurch also wrote, "The colour palettes are garish, and it's often hard to pick out the [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] from the backgrounds. Worse still, everything's so sluggish - the so-called Ninjas amble around like they've been drugged and getting them to do anything quickly (pretty essential for a game like this) is near-impossible. Difficulty-wise, it's paradoxically very hard and very easy." Upchurch criticized the unresponsive controls, but praised the sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Upchurch|first=David|date=February 1993|title=Joe &amp; Mac Caveman Ninja|journal= [[The One (magazine)|The One Amiga]]|publisher=EMAP|pages=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stuart Campbell of ''[[Amiga Power]]'' also gave the Amiga version a 22 percent rating and criticized the game for using "the kind of options screen that you'd have to be a professional semaphore operator to penetrate. I had to spend almost five minutes reading the manual just to work out how to select which of the two pointlessly-complicated joystick modes I wanted to use [...] and I still haven't quite got to grips with how to toggle the music and sound effects." Campbell also criticized the game for "some of the cheap 'n' nastiest-looking graphics seen on the Amiga in recent memory." Campbell criticized the game's poor control system and its "fairly short and tedious" levels, and concluded that the game was "a lump of crap."&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite journal |last=Campbell|first=Stuart|date=February 1993|title=Joe &amp; Mac Caveman Ninja|journal=[[Amiga Power]]|publisher=Future plc|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Total!]]'' gave the Game Boy version a 75 percent rating, praising the graphics, but criticizing the [[collision detection]]. The magazine also criticized the backgrounds, which caused the main character of Joe to blend into the environment, creating confusion regarding his location.&lt;ref name=Total&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe 'n' Mac (Game Boy)|url=https://archive.org/stream/Total_Issue_014_1993-02_Future_Publishing_GB#page/n60/mode/1up/|accessdate=April 17, 2018|work=Total!|date=February 1993|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' positively wrote about the Game Boy version, "Good graphics and animation rival those of the NES and Super NES versions," but negatively wrote, "Background blur while walking is severe, making it difficult to see approaching enemies."&lt;ref name=GB&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20047%20April%201993#page/n65/mode/2up|title=Joe &amp; Mac|publisher=Nintendo of America|date=April 1993|work=Nintendo Power|access-date=September 3, 2017|pages=64–67, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' compared the US release to the Japanese version, and wrote of the game's sexual content that "All that's pictured during the initial display is a hut that quickly fades into the title screen, allowing players to commence the cartoony prehistoric action. Data East USA: 'We didn't want kids to see [the Japanese display] and think it was okay.'"&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/article/1992/04/10/japanese-video-games-get-tailored-states/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
The game was followed by various sequels. The Japanese version of the SNES game ''[[Congo's Caper]]'' was presented as a sequel called ''Tatakae Genshijin 2: Rookie no Bōken'' and featured a new protagonist. The title duo would later return in ''[[Joe &amp; Mac 2: Lost in the Tropics]]'', which added light [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] aspects to the series. An arcade sequel titled ''[[Joe &amp; Mac Returns]]'' eschewed the scrolling action of the original games in favor of gameplay similar to another Data East series, ''[[Tumblepop]]''.

==Possible reboot==
In November 2009, Golgoth Studio announced plans to reboot the ''Joe &amp; Mac'' series, following their completion of a ''[[Toki (video game)|Toki]]'' remake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a185667/golgoth-to-resurrect-joe--mac-series.html#~p0nALrQukw7BW4 "Golgoth to resurrect 'Joe &amp; Mac' series"] Mark Langshaw, www.DigitalSpy.com (November 7, 2009). Retrieved January 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; No further information has been released as of 2018.

== Other media ==
Joe and Mac appear in a German [[Mario]] comic, titled ''Super Mario: Verloren in der Zeit''.

The '''''Madonna of the Stairs''''' (or '''''Madonna of the Steps''''') is a [[relief]] sculpture by [[Michelangelo]] in the [[Casa Buonarroti]], Florence. It was sculpted around 1491, when Michelangelo was about seventeen. This and the ''[[Battle of the Centaurs (Michelangelo)|Battle of the Centaurs]]'' were Michelangelo's first two sculptures. The first reference to the ''Madonna of the Stairs'' as a work by Michelangelo was in the 1568 edition of [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casabuonarroti.it/english/e-mad.htm Madonna of the stairs in [[Casa Buonarroti]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229111528/http://www.casabuonarroti.it/english/e-mad.htm |date=February 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The work is an obvious homage to stiacciato of Donatello, as Vasari also noted, both in technique and sizes plans with millimeter thickness variations, both in iconography, starting from the scale pattern with pronounced steps and handrails foreshortened, visible for example in the Feast of Herod in Lille, smashing spatially opening a path of dramatic vanishing.

The figure of the Madonna, sitting on a square stone, and in profile while looking away, occupies the entire height of the relief, from edge to edge, with a severity and monumentality reminiscent of the classic rods. Very original is the composition of the sacred group, at the same time blocked and dynamic, with the Virgin and upright and keep him away gaze, in a prophetic attitude, as she lifts her dress to feed or protect the child asleep, and generates a movement spiral thanks to the arrangement in opposite limb: Jesus has indeed let go of his arm behind his back and Maria comes to weave his feet, showing the right plant and breaking the stillness of the smooth surface of the bas-relief. The right hand of the Child turned out was later used more than once by the artist to symbolize the abandonment of the body in sleep or in death, as in the portrait of Lorenzo de 'Medici, Duke of Urbino or the Bandini Pietà and refers to ' Farnese Hercules (since by Michelangelo man is seen as Hercules).

Pronounced is the muscle of the Child and the taking of Mary, especially with large hands, thanks to the different treatment of the surfaces, make it appear vigorous simple, everyday gesture. Virtuoso is finally the fall of the drapery, especially on Cubic's seat, which follows form with great realism.

On the left, on the scale that gives its name to the survey, there are two putti just blanks in attitude dance or fight and another who, leaning on the handrail, tents, along with a fourth figure placed behind the Virgin, a drape. It is difficult to determine the significance of this background scene, perhaps a simple exercise in style or a tribute to dancing putti Donatello.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2799">The '''military housing privatization''' initiative (MHPI) was established by the [[United States Congress]] in 1996 as tool to help the military improve the quality of life for its service members by improving the condition of their housing. The MHPI was designed and developed to attract private-sector financing, expertise and innovation to provide necessary housing faster and more efficiently than traditional military construction processes would allow. The Office of the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] has delegated to the military services the MHPI and they are authorized to enter into agreements with private developers selected in a competitive process to own, maintain and operate family housing via a fifty-year lease.

MHPI addresses two significant problems concerning housing for military-service members and their families: (1) the poor condition of housing owned by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DOD), and (2) a shortage of quality affordable private housing. Under the MHPI authorities, DOD works with the private sector to revitalize military family housing through a variety of financial tools-direct loans, loan guarantees, equity investments, conveyance or leasing of land and/or housing/and other facilities. Military service members receive a basic allowance where they can choose to live in private sector housing, or privatized housing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/housing].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich Albert Moritz Schlick''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|l|ɪ|k}}; {{IPA-de|ʃlɪk|lang|de_schli.ogg}}; April 14, 1882 – June 22, 1936) was a [[Germany|German]] philosopher, physicist, and the founding father of [[logical positivism]] and the [[Vienna Circle]].

==Early life and works==
Schlick was born in [[Berlin]] to a wealthy family, his father was Ernst Albert Schlick and his mother was Agnes Arndt. He studied [[physics]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]], the [[University of Lausanne]], and, ultimately, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] under [[Max Planck]]. In 1904, he completed his dissertation essay, "Über die Reflexion des Lichts in einer inhomogenen Schicht" ("On the Reflection of Light in a Non-Homogeneous Medium"). After a year as [[Privatdozent]] at Göttingen, he turned to the study of Philosophy in Zurich. In 1907, he married Blanche Hardy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/ivc/Schlick-Projekt/biographie.html Biography] at [[Vienna University]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, he published ''Lebensweisheit'' ("The Wisdom of Life"), a slim volume about [[eudaemonism]], the theory that happiness results from the pursuit of personal fulfillment as opposed to passing pleasures. His habilitation essay, "Das Wesen der Wahrheit nach der modernen Logik" ("The Nature of Truth According to Modern [[Logic]]"), was published in 1910. Several essays about [[aesthetics]] followed, whereupon Schlick turned his attention to problems of [[epistemology]], the [[philosophy of science]], and more general questions about [[science]]. In this last category, Schlick distinguished himself by publishing a paper in 1915 about [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]], a topic only ten years old. He also published ''Raum und Zeit in der gegenwärtigen Physik'' ("Space and Time in Contemporary Physics"), which extended his earlier results by  applying Poincaré's geometric conventionalism to explain Einstein's adoption of a non-Euclidean geometry in the [[general theory of relativity]].

==The Vienna Circle and Wittgenstein==
After early appointments at Rostock and Kiel, in 1922 Schlick assumed the chair of Naturphilosophie at the [[University of Vienna]] which had previously been held by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] and [[Ernst Mach]].  Schlick displayed an unusual success in organizing talented individuals in the philosophical and scientific spheres. When Schlick arrived in Vienna, he was invited to lead a group of scientists and philosophers who met regularly (on Thursday evenings in the Chemistry Building) to discuss philosophical topics in the sciences. Early members included the mathematician [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and, within a few years, they were joined by [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Friedrich Waismann]] and others. They initially called themselves the [[Ernst Mach]] Association, but they eventually became best known as the [[Vienna Circle]]. In the years 1925-1926, the Thursday night group discussed recent work in the foundations of mathematics by [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Wittgenstein's book, ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', was a work that advanced, among other things, a logical theory of [[symbol]]ism and a "picture" or "model" theory of language. Schlick and his group were impressed by the work, devoting considerable time to its study and, even when it was no longer the principal focus of their discussion, it was mentioned in discussion. Eventually Wittgenstein agreed to meet with Schlick and other Circle members to discuss the ''Tractatus'' and other ideas but he later found it necessary to restrict the visitors to sympathetic interlocutors. Through Schlick's influence, Wittgenstein was encouraged to consider a return to philosophy after some ten years away from the field. Schlick and Waismann's discussions with Wittgenstein continued until the latter felt that germinal ideas had been used without permission in an essay by Carnap, a charge of dubious merit. But he continued discussions in letters to Schlick after he no longer met with other Circle members.

==''General Theory of Knowledge'' and later works==
Schlick had worked on his ''Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre'' (''General Theory of Knowledge'') between 1918 and 1925, and, though later developments in his philosophy were to make various contentions of his epistemology untenable, the ''General Theory'' is perhaps his greatest work in its acute reasoning against synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge. This critique of synthetic ''a priori'' knowledge argues that the only truths which are self-evident to reason are statements which are true as a matter of definition, such as the statements of formal logic and mathematics. The truth of all other statements must be evaluated with reference to [[empirical evidence]]. If a statement is proposed which is not a matter of definition, and not capable of being confirmed or falsified by evidence, that statement is "metaphysical", which is synonymous with "meaningless", or "nonsense". This is the principle upon which members of the Vienna Circle were most clearly in agreement — with each other, as well as with Wittgenstein.

==''Problems of Ethics''==
Between 1926  and 1930, Schlick labored to finish ''Fragen der Ethik'' (''Problems of Ethics'''), in which he surprised some of his fellow Circlists by including [[ethics]] as a viable branch of philosophy. In his 1932-33 contribution to ''Erkenntnis'', "Positivism and Realism",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/PositivismAndRealism/SchlickMoritz-PositivismAndRealism_djvu.txt |title='&amp;#39;Erkenntnis'&amp;#39; vol. 3, 1932/33. English: translated by David Rynin |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlick offered one of the most illuminating definitions of [[positivism]] as every view "which denies the possibility of metaphysics" (Schlick [1932-1933], p.&amp;nbsp;260). Accordingly he defined metaphysics as the doctrine of “true being”, “thing in itself” or “transcendental being”, a doctrine which obviously "presupposes that a non-true, lesser or apparent being stands opposed to it"  (Ibid). Therefore in this work he bases the positivism on a kind of epistemology which holds that the only true beings are givens or constituents of experience. Also during this time, the Vienna Circle published ''The Scientific View of the World: The Vienna Circle'' as a homage to Schlick. Its strong anti-metaphysical stance crystallized the viewpoint of the group.

===Comment on Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus''===
[[Carnap]], in his book ''Logical Syntax of Language'', included a comment by Schlick on Wittgenstein 's ''Tractatus''.

{{ quotation | Schlick ( [Wende] p.8 ) interprets [[Wittgenstein]]'s position as follows: philosophy "is that activity by which the meaning of propositions is established or discovered" ; it is a question of "what the propositions actually mean. The content, soul, and spirit of science naturally consist in what is ultimately meant by its sentences; the philosophical activity of rendering significant is thus the alpha and omega of all scientific knowledge". | Carnap, p.284 | ''Logical Syntax of Language '' }}

==Schlick's murder==
With the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Germany and [[Austrofascism]] in Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States and the United Kingdom. Schlick, however, stayed on at the University of Vienna. When visited by [[Herbert Feigl]] in 1935, he expressed dismay at events in Germany. On June 22, 1936, Schlick was ascending the steps of the University for a class when he was confronted by a former student, [[Johann Nelböck]], who killed Schlick with a pistol. The court declared Nelböck to be fully [[compos mentis]], he confessed to the act, was detained without any resistance, but was unrepentant. The delinquent used the judicial proceedings as a chance to present himself and his ideology in the public. He claimed that Schlick's anti-metaphysical philosophy had "interfered with his moral restraint". In another version of the events, the murderer covered up all political causes and claimed that he was motivated by jealousy over his failed attachment to the female student Sylvia Borowicka, leading to a paranoid delusion about Schlick as his rival and persecutor. Nelböck was tried and sentenced, but the event became a distorted ''cause célèbre'' around which crystallized the growing nationalist and anti-Jewish sentiments in the city. (The fact that Schlick was not Jewish did not seem to matter to propagandists capitalizing on the crime.) After the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany]] in 1938 the assassin was released on probation after serving two years of a 10-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stadler|first=Friedrich|title=Documentation: The Murder of Moritz Schlick, in: Friedrich Stadler (ed.).

==Legacy==
Schlick's enduring contribution to the world of philosophy is as the fount of [[logical positivism]]. His humanity, good will, gentleness, and especially his encouragement have been documented by many of his peers. Herbert Feigl and [[Albert Blumberg]], in their introduction to the ''General Theory of Knowledge'', wrote,

{{Quotation|No other thinker was so well prepared to give new impetus to the philosophical questings of the younger generation. Though many of his students and successors have attained a higher degree of exactitude and adequacy in their logical analyses of problems in the theory of knowledge, Schlick had an unsurpassed sense for what is essential in philosophical issues.|Feigl and Blumberg|Introduction, ''[[General Theory of Knowledge]]'', p. xxi}}

In [[romance languages]], '''''nomen à clef''''' or '''''nomen à clé''''' ({{IPA-fr|nomen‿a kle|}}, French for "name with a key"), is a [[name]] describing a real person, behind a façade of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxFomoeKT74C&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=film+%C3%A0+clef&amp;lr=&amp;ei=mFMTS4H2FpCuzQSZ3737DA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The films in my life" By François Truffaut, Da Capo Press, 1994, ISBN 0-306-80599-5, ISBN 978-0-306-80599-8, pg 131]&lt;/ref&gt; "Key" in this context means a table one can use to swap out the names.  
It is the nomenclature complement of the [[roman à clef]].

The '''Obelisk of Axum''' ({{lang-am|የአክሱም ሐውልት}}) is a 4th-century AD, 24-metre-tall (79-feet) [[granite]] [[stele]]/[[obelisk]], weighing 160&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s, in the city of [[Axum]] in [[Ethiopia]]. It is ornamented with two false [[door]]s at the base and features decorations resembling [[window]]s on all sides. The obelisk ends in a semi-circular top part, which used to be enclosed by metal frames.

==History==

===Overview===
The obelisk—properly termed a "[[stele]]" or, in the local [[Afro-Asiatic languages]], ''hawelt/hawelti'' (as it is not topped by a pyramid)&amp;nbsp;— is found along with many other stelae in the city of [[Axum]] in modern-day [[Ethiopia]]. The stelae were probably carved and erected during the 4th century A.D. by subjects of the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], an ancient Ethiopian civilization. Erection of stelae in Axum was a very old practice (today it is still possible to see primitive roughly carved stelae near more elaborated "obelisks"), probably borrowed from the Kushitic kingdom of [[Meroe]]. Their function is supposed to be that of "markers" for underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-story false windows and false doors, while lesser nobility would have smaller, less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in various "stelae fields". The last stele erected in Axum was probably the so-called [[King Ezana's Stele]], in the 4th century A.D.
[[File:2 giugno 2002-Axum.JPG|thumb|left|220px|The Obelisk of Axum in [[Rome]] in 2002, before its repatriation.]]

King [[Ezana]] (c.321&amp;nbsp;– c. 360), influenced by his childhood tutor [[Saint Frumentius|Frumentius]], introduced [[Christianity]] to Axum, precluding the [[Paganism|pagan]] practice of erecting burial stelae (it seems that at the feet of each obelisk, together with the grave, there was also a sacrificial altar).

Over the course of time, many of these stelae fell to the ground&lt;ref&gt;Poissonnier B. (2012) [https://www.academia.edu/3439296/_2014 The giant stelae of Aksum in the light of the 1999 excavations], in Fauvelle-Aymar F.-X.(ed.), ''Palethnology of Africa, P@lethnology'', '''4''', 49-86.&lt;/ref&gt; due to: structural collapse (as, probably, in the case of the Great Stele, measuring 33 m), possibly immediately after their erection; earthquakes (Axum is in a [[seismic zone]]); or the military incursions of the Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi|Ahmad Gragn]] during the [[Ethiopian-Adal War]] from 1529 to 1543. In the 19th century, of the three major "royal" stelae, only [[King Ezana's Stele]] remained erect, shown in the painting "Sight of Axum" of [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] (1780–1827).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

At the end of 1935, following the Italian occupation, Italian soldiers found the Obelisk of Axum was collapsed and broken. It had fallen in the 4th century and had broken into five pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/laws/pdf/abstract_scovazzi.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= UNESCO |first= Tullio |last= Scovazzi |date= April 2008 |title= The return of the Axum Obelisk |quote= Abstract with pictorial }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, it was taken as war booty and moved to Italy by the Fascist regime, which wanted to commemorate the occupation of Ethiopia and the birth of the ephemeral "new Roman Empire" (see [[Italian Empire]]). The stele was transported by truck along the tortuous route between Axum and the port of [[Massawa]], taking five trips over a period of two months. It arrived via ship in [[Naples]] (on a ship called ''[[Battle of Adowa|Adwa]]''), on March 27, 1937. It was then transported to Rome, where it was reassembled and erected on [[Porta Capena]] square in front of the Ministry for Italian Africa (later the headquarters of the [[United Nations]]'s [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]) and the [[Circus Maximus]]. It was officially unveiled on October 28, 1937 to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the [[March on Rome]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; The operation was coordinated by Ugo Monneret de Villard.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} 

A bronze statue of the [[Lion of Judah]], symbol of the Ethiopian monarchy, was taken along with the obelisk and displayed in front of [[Roma Termini railway station|Termini railway station]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Repatriation===
[[File:Aksum-107547.jpg|alt=Workers during Aksum Obelisk re-installation|thumb|Workers during Aksum Obelisk re-installation]]
In a 1947 UN agreement, Italy agreed to return the stele to Ethiopia,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1402354.stm |title=No return for Ethiopian treasure |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-06-22 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the other looted piece, the Lion of Judah. While the latter was returned in 1967 following the 1961 visit of emperor [[Haile Selassie]] to Italy, little action was taken to return the stele for more than 50 years, partly as a consequence of the considerable technical difficulties related to its transportation.

One source&lt;ref&gt;For example, prince Amedeo di Savoia&lt;/ref&gt; also suggests that emperor Haile Sellassie, after hearing of these technical difficulties (and of the enormous costs necessary to overcome them), decided to grant the stele to the city of Rome, as a gift for the "renewed friendship" between Italy and Ethiopia. This assertion, however, remains very controversial and was not recognized by successive authorities. Colonel [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] who overthrew the emperor in 1974, asked the Italian government to return the stele to Ethiopia. Another controversial arrangement, according to some sources, seems to be that Italy could keep the stele in exchange for the construction of a hospital in Addis Ababa (Saint Paul's Hospital) and for the cancellation of debts owed by Ethiopia. In any case, after the fall of the Mengistu regime, the new Ethiopian government asked for the return of the stele, finding a positive answer from the then president of the Italian republic [[Oscar Luigi Scalfaro]], in April 1997.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

[[File:Axum northern stelea park.jpg|thumb|The Northern Stelae Park in [[Axum]], with the [[King Ezana's Stele]] at the centre and the Great Stele lying broken.]]
The first steps in dismantling the structure were taken in November 2003, under the supervision of Giorgio Croci, Professor of Structural Problems of Monuments and Historical Buildings at [[Sapienza University of Rome]].&lt;ref name="spectator-2003"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Johnson | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Johnson (writer) | title=Trundling Musso’s stolen obelisk back to its African home | url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2005/03/trundling-mussos-stolen-obelisk-back-to-its-african-home/ | newspaper=The Spectator | date=12 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent was to ship the stele back to Ethiopia in March 2004, but the repatriation project encountered a series of obstacles: The runway at [[Axum Airport]] was considered too short for a cargo plane carrying even one of the thirds into which the stele had been cut; the roads and bridges between Addis Ababa and Axum were thought to be not up to the task of road transport; and access through the nearby [[Eritrea]]n port of Massawa&amp;nbsp;— which was how the stele originally left Africa&amp;nbsp;— was impossible due to the [[Foreign relations of Ethiopia#Eritrea|strained state of relations between Eritrea and Ethiopia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Another reason for the delay in returning the stele from Italy to Ethiopia in 2004 was because of Italy's claim of not having the money to pay for the transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/obelisk_email.htm |title=E |publisher=Ethiopic.com |date=2005-04-29 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to get help from the United States was unsuccessful, as Americans stated that their planes were tied up in the war in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethiopic.com/hertage/ambassador.htm |title=An Open Letter to the US Ambassador in Addis |publisher=Ethiopic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous attempts by Professor [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], who spearheaded the campaign to return the stele, remained unsuccessful until an American-Ethiopian, Dr. Aberra Molla, threatened the Italian government with the option of raising the money on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/aksum.htm|title = Axsum Obelisk|publisher = Aberra Molla|date = 2004-03-07|accessdate = 2013-07-07|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150725213113/http://www.ethiopic.com/heritage/aksum.htm|archivedate = 2015-07-25|dead-url = yes|type = Email}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aksum-107569.jpg|alt=Inauguration Ceremony for the reinstallation of the Aksum Obelisk|thumb|Inauguration Ceremony for the reinstallation of the Aksum Obelisk]]
The runway at Axum airport was then upgraded specially to facilitate the return of the stele.&lt;ref name="return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4458105.stm |title=Obelisk arrives back in Ethiopia |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dismantled stele remained sitting in a warehouse near Rome's [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport]], until 19 April 2005 when the middle piece was repatriated by use of an [[Antonov An-124]], amidst much local celebration.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; It was the largest and heaviest piece of air freight ever carried.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; The second piece was returned on 22 April 2005, with the final piece returned on 25 April 2005. The operation cost Italy $7.7 million.&lt;ref name="return" /&gt; The stele remained in storage while Ethiopia decided how to reconstruct it without disturbing other ancient treasures still in the area (especially King Ezana's Stele). By March 2007 the foundation had been poured for the re-erection of the stele near King Ezana's Stele, structurally consolidated in this occasion. Reassembly began in June 2008, with a team chosen by [[UNESCO]] and led by Giorgio Croci, and the monument was re-erected in its original home and unveiled on 4 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7597589.stm |title=Ethiopia unveils ancient obelisk |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When it was reassembled in Rome in 1937 three [[steel]] bars were inserted per section. When the obelisk was hit by [[lightning]] during a violent [[thunderstorm]] over Rome on 27 May 2002 this caused "considerable" damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2012770.stm |title=Rome obelisk struck by lightning |publisher=BBC News |date=2002-05-28 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the new reconstruction the three sections are fixed together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/08_maggio_26/l_obelisco_conteso_rinasce_ad_axum_6f8d4c02-2aec-11dd-9793-00144f02aabc.shtml |title='&amp;#39;Corriere della sera (in Italian)'&amp;#39;;L’obelisco conteso rinasce ad Axum |publisher=Corriere.it |date= |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a total of eight [[aramid]] fiber ([[Kevlar]]) bars: four between the first and second and four between the second and third sections. This arrangement guarantees structural resistance during earthquakes and avoids the use of steel, so as not to again make the stele a magnet for lightning and to avoid [[rust]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Several other similar stelae/obelisks exist in Ethiopia and Eritrea, such as the [[Hawulti (monument)|Hawulti]] in [[Metera]]. Like the Obelisk of Axum, the other stelae have a [[rectangular]] base with a false door carved on one side.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''Ometepe''' Island is an important archaeological site, located in the [[Lake Nicaragua]] in the Republic of [[Nicaragua]], administratively belongs to the [[Rivas Department]]. Its name derives from the [[Nahuatl]] words ome (two) and tepetl (mountain), meaning two mountains, given that it is formed and practically the whole island is formed by two [[volcano]]es: [[Concepción (volcano)|Concepción]] and [[Maderas]].

==The Island==
[[Ometepe]] has an area of 276&amp;nbsp;km². It is the largest volcanic island located within a lake. The population is estimated at 42,000. The island has two larger cities, Moyogalpa and [[Altagracia]] that also are the main access ports to the island.  There are an enormous amount of [[prehispanic]] statues, petroglyphs and pottery found on the island, and the area is believed to be an important ceremonial center for the its ancient inhabitants.

===History===
There is evidence that the island was inhabited at least since 1500 BC. Apparently this population would be part of a migration movement originated in South America with final destination in Mexico. On the island found ceramic and large sculptures carved basalt rock have been found, that are exhibited today in the Park of Altagracia Church and the Managua National Museum. These sculptures are attributable to the same style as those found in the Zapatera Island by the Chorotega culture.

Some petroglyphs were also found in the island made from 300 a. C.

The conquistadores found the country occupied by numerous towns dedicated to the practice of the arts and peaceful industries. Dr. Berendt, great explorer and scholar of Aboriginal people of Central America, in the light of philological results obtained by himself and American diplomat Ephraim George Squier (1849), and traditions preserved mainly from Oviedo, Torquemada and Herrera, believed that the chorotegan, Cholutecas, Dirianes and Orotinas were descendants of people that migrated from [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], Mexico. These people occupied the greater part of the country from the Gulf of Fonseca to Nicoya, its territorial continuity was interrupted in the vicinity of current Leon by the Marabios and again by an Aztec colony that occupied the narrowest part of the strip of land between the Pacific and the Nicaragua Lake and the lake islands. The King and the capital of this nation was named Nicarao (Conference read before the American geographical society, July 10, 1876, by Dr. C. H. Berendt). The former inhabitants of this region left abundant relics of their civilization in mounds, cemeteries, etc. (Bransford, J.F. 1881. Introduction, p.&amp;nbsp;4)

The first archaeological report on the Ometepe material came to light with the 1852 publication "Nicaragua, its people and landscapes" by American diplomat [[E. G. Squier]], who explored the area in 1849.

In December, 1872, the Navy Department sent an expedition under the command of Commander E.P. Lull, USN, to Nicaragua, to complete the studies initiated in the spring of that year for an inter-oceanic canal. (For valuable information on the country, see the report published by the Navy Department, 1874 on studies for a canal through Nicaragua.) J.F Bransford, was a medical officer assigned to expeditions, with instructions to perform general scientific research on natural history, etc., of the country. He visited the Ometepe Island and while searching for antiquities, he managed by chance to see a ditch which had been recently excavated, in which were exposed funerary urns. This was an estate that belonged to don José Angel Luna, near Moyogalpa. (Bransford, J.F. 1881. Preliminary Note, p.&amp;nbsp;1)

In 1876, he was sent to Nicaragua in particular service related to the study, and was instructed to perform archaeological research in the Ometepe Island. He was in the country from January to mid-May, more than half the time exploring and digging in the island, having carried out the main portion of the work at the Luna Hacienda, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He was again in the island from February, 1877 and remained until the first of July. As before, most of the time was spent on the island, focusing in Santa Helena and Chilaite, north from Moyogalpa. Then some investigations were made in firm land near San Jorge, followed by a trip south to Nicoya in Costa Rica. (Bransford, J.F. 1881. Preliminary Note, p.&amp;nbsp;1)

For his part, Professor [[Carl Bovallius]], arrived at Ometepe from Granada, on 1882-1883 New Year’s Eve and stayed in the Moyogalpa village, on the northwest tip of the island. From there he took several trips in different directions, and although his zoological research occupied a lot of his time, he had numerous opportunities to perform archaeological excavations. (Carl Bovallius. 1886, p.&amp;nbsp;9-10)

'''Unicode''' supports several '''phonetic scripts''' and notations through the existing writing systems and the addition of extra blocks with phonetic characters. These phonetic extras are derived of an existing script, usually Latin, Greek or Cyrillic. In Unicode there is no "IPA script". Apart from IPA, [[extensions to the IPA]] and [[obsolete and nonstandard IPA symbols]], these blocks also contain characters from the [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet]] and the [[Americanist Phonetic Alphabet]].

==Phonetic scripts==
The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] makes use of letters from other writing systems as most phonetic scripts do. IPA notably uses Latin, Greek and Cyrillic characters. Combining diacritics also adds meaning to the phonetic text. Finally, these phonetic alphabets make use of modifier letters, that are specially constructed for the phonetic meaning. A "modifier letter" is strictly intended not as an independent grapheme but as a modification of the preceding character&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Spacing%20Modifier%20Letters |title=Spacing modifier letters |website=Everything2.com |date=2002-08-29 |accessdate=2016-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a distinct grapheme, notably in the context of the International Phonetic Alphabet. For example, [[ʰ]] should not occur on its own but modifies the preceding or following symbol. Thus, {{IPA|tʰ}} is a single IPA symbol, distinct from {{IPA|t}}. In practice, however, several of these "modifier letters" are also used as full graphemes, e.g. [[ʿ]] as transliterating Semitic [[ayin]] or Hawaiian [[ʻOkina|okina]], or [[˚]] transliterating Abkhaz [[ә]].

==From IPA to Unicode==
{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet}}

===Consonants===
The following tables indicates the Unicode code point sequences for phonemes as used in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]]. A bold code point indicates that the Unicode chart provides an application note such as "voiced retroflex lateral" for {{unichar|026D|LATIN SMALL LETTER L WITH RETROFLEX HOOK|html=|size=100%}}. An entry in bold italics indicates the character name itself refers to a phoneme such as {{unichar|0298|LATIN LETTER BILABIAL CLICK|html=|size=100%}}

=== Vowels ===
[[File:IPA vowel chart 2005.png|thumb|200px]]
The following figures depict the phonetic vowels and their Unicode / UCS code points. Vowels appearing in pairs in the figure to the right indicate rounded and unrounded variations respectively. Again, characters with Unicode names referring to phonemes are indicated by bold text. Those with explicit application notes are indicated by bold italic text. Those from borrowed unchanged from another script (Latin, Greek or Cyrillic) are indicated by italics.

===Spacing Modifier Letters (U+02B0–02FF)===

The characters in the "Spacing Modifier Letters" block are intended as forming a unity with the preceding letter (which they "modify"). E.g. the character {{unichar|02B0|MODIFIER LETTER SMALL H}} isn't intended simply as a superscript ''h'' (&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;), but as the mark of aspiration placed after the letter being aspirated, as in {{IPA|pʰ}} "[[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] [[voiceless bilabial plosive]]". The block contains:
*Latin superscript modifier letters: (U+02B0&amp;ndash;U+02B8):  ʰ aspiration;	ʱ breathy voice, murmured;	ʲ palatalization;	ʳ, 	ʴ, ʵ, ʶ r-coloring or r-offglides; 	ʷ labialization;	ʸ palatalization, [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] usage for U+02B2
*Miscellaneous phonetic modifiers: (U+02B9&amp;ndash;U+02D7): ʹ 	ʺ 	ʻ 	ʼ 	ʽ 	ʾ 	ʿ 	ˀ 	ˁ 	˂ 	˃ 	˄ 	˅ 	ˆ 	ˇ 	ˈ 	ˉ 	ˊ 	ˋ 	ˌ 	ˍ 	ˎ 	ˏ 	ː 	ˑ 	˒ 	˓ 	˔ 	˕ 	˖ 	˗

==Fonts support for IPA==

IPA font support is increasing, and is now included in several fonts such as the [[Times New Roman]] versions that come with various recent computer [[operating systems]]. Diacritics are not always properly rendered, however. IPA fonts that are freely available online include [[Gentium]], several from the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics|SIL]] (such as [[Charis SIL]], and [[Doulos SIL]]), [[DejaVu fonts|DejaVu Sans]], and [[Bitstream Cyberbit|TITUS Cyberbit]], which are all [[Free software Unicode typefaces|freely available]]; as well as commercial typefaces such as Brill, available from [[Brill Publishers]], and  [[Lucida Sans Unicode]] and [[Arial Unicode MS]], shipping with various [[Microsoft]] products. These all include several ranges of characters in addition to the IPA. Modern [[Web browser]]s generally do not need any configuration to display these symbols, provided that a font capable of doing so is available to the operating system.


== Input by selection from a screen==
Further Information: [[Unicode input#Selection from a screen]]
[[File:Gucharmap screenshot.png|thumb|300px|Applet for character selection]]

Many systems provide a way to select Unicode characters visually. [[ISO/IEC 14755]] refers to this as a ''screen-selection entry method''.

[[Microsoft Windows]] has provided a Unicode version of the Character Map program (find it by hitting {{keypress|Win|R}} then type &lt;code&gt;charmap&lt;/code&gt; then hit {{keypress|Enter}}) since version NT 4.0&amp;nbsp;– appearing in the consumer edition since XP. This is limited to characters in the [[Basic Multilingual Plane]] (BMP). Characters are searchable by Unicode character name, and the table can be limited to a particular code block. More advanced third-party tools of the same type are also available (a notable [[freeware]] example is [[Andrew West (linguist)#BabelMap|BabelMap]]).

[[Mac OS X|macOS]] provides a "character palette" with much the same functionality, along with searching by related characters, glyph tables in a font, etc. It can be [https://web.archive.org/web/20110109234035/http://www.apple.com/pro/techniques/glyphspalette/ enabled] in the input menu in the menu bar under System Preferences → International → Input Menu (or System Preferences → Language and Text → Input Sources) or can be viewed under Edit → Emoji &amp; Symbols in many programs.

Equivalent tools&amp;nbsp;– such as [[gucharmap]] ([[GNOME]]) or [[List of KDE applications|kcharselect]] ([[KDE]])&amp;nbsp;– exist on most Linux desktop environments.

'''Quantitative comparative linguistics''' is the use of [[quantitative research|quantitative analysis]] as applied to [[comparative linguistics]].

==History==
Statistical methods have been used for the purpose of quantitative analysis in [[comparative linguistics]] for more than a century. During the 1950s, the [[Swadesh list]] emerged: a standardised set of [[lexical concept]]s found in most languages, as words or phrases, that allow two or more languages to be compared and contrasted empirically.

Probably the first published quantitative historical linguistics study was by Sapir in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;Time perspective in aboriginal American culture, Memoir 10, Anthropological Series 13, Ottawa&lt;/ref&gt; while Kroeber and Chretien in 1937 &lt;ref&gt;Quantitative classification of Indo-European languages, Language 13&lt;/ref&gt; investigated  nine Indo-European (IE) languages using 74 morphological and phonological features (extended in 1939 by the inclusion of Hittite). Ross &lt;ref&gt;Philological probability problems, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 12&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950 carried out an investigation into the theoretical basis for such studies. Swadesh, using word lists, developed [[lexicostatistics]] and [[glottochronology]] in a series of papers &lt;ref&gt;For example, Lexico-statistical dating of prehistoric ethnic contacts, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 6 (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; published in the early 1950s but these methods were widely criticised &lt;ref&gt;For example, by [[Knut Bergsland|Bergsland]] and Vogt, On the validity of glottochronology, Current Anthropology 3 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; though some of the criticisms were seen as unjustified by other scholars. Embleton published a book on "Statistics in Historical Linguistics" in 1986 which reviewed previous work and extended the glottochronological method. Dyen, Kruskal and Black carried out a study of the lexicostatistical method on a large IE database in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;An Indoeuropean classification: a lexicostatistical experiment, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 82/5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, there was renewed interest in the topic, based on the application of methods of  [[computational phylogenetics]] and [[cladistics]]. Such projects often involved collaboration by linguistic scholars, and colleagues with expertise in [[information science]] and/or [[biological anthropology]]. These projects often sought to arrive at an optimal [[phylogenetic tree]] (or network), to represent a hypothesis about the evolutionary ancestry and perhaps its language contacts. Pioneers in these methods included the founders of CPHL: computational phylogenetics in historical linguistics (CPHL project): [[Donald Ringe]], [[Tandy Warnow]], [[Luay Nakhleh]] and [[Steven N. Evans]].

In the mid-1990s a group at Pennsylvania University computerised the comparative method and used a different IE database with 20 ancient languages.&lt;ref&gt;Ringe, [[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] and Taylor, Indo-European and Computational Cladistics, Transactions of the Philological Society Volume 100 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; In the biological field several software programs were then developed which could have application to historical linguistics. In particular a group at the University of Auckland developed a method that gave controversially old dates for IE languages.&lt;ref&gt;Initially announced in Gray and Atkinson, [https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:d6aef57c-ce30-40fb-8786-f64c4a70afd1/datastreams/ATTACHMENT01 Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin], Nature 426, 27 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on "Time-depth in Historical Linguistics" was held in August 1999 at which many applications of quantitative methods were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;Published by Renfrew, McMahon and Trask in 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently many papers have been published on studies of various language groups as well as comparisons of the methods.

Greater media attention was generated in 2003 after the publication by anthropologists [[Russell Gray]] and [[Quentin Atkinson]] of a short study on [[Indo-European languages]] in ''[[Nature magazine|Nature]]''. Gray and Atkinson attempted to quantify, in a probabilistic sense, the age and relatedness of modern Indo-European languages and, sometimes, the preceding proto-languages.

The proceedings of an influential 2004 conference, ''Phylogenetic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages'' were published in 2006, edited by [[Peter Forster (geneticist)|Peter Forster]] and [[Colin Renfrew]].

==Background==
The standard method for assessing language relationships has been the [[comparative method]]. However this has a number of limitations. Not all linguistic material is suitable as input and there are issues of the linguistic levels on which the method operates. The reconstructed languages are idealized and different scholars can produce different results. Language family trees are often used in conjunction with the method and "borrowings" must be excluded from the data, which is difficult when borrowing is within a family. It is often claimed that the method is limited in the time depth over which it can operate.  The method is difficult to apply and there is no independent test.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon and McMahon, Language Classification by Numbers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Thus alternative methods have been sought that have a formalised method, quantify the relationships and can be tested.

A goal of comparative historical linguistics is to identify instances of genetic relatedness amongst languages.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781405166201.ch2/summary On the limits of the comparative method], in Joseph and Janda, The Handbook of Historical Linguistics (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The steps in quantitative analysis are (i) to devise a procedure based on theoretical grounds, on a particular model or on past experience, etc. (ii) to verify the procedure by applying it to some data where there exists a large body of linguistic opinion for comparison (this may lead to a revision of the procedure of stage (i) or at the extreme of its total abandonment) (iii) to apply the procedure to data where linguistic opinions have not yet been produced, have not yet been firmly established or perhaps are even in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Embleton, Statistics in Historical Linguistics, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying phylogenetic methods to languages is a multi-stage process: (a) the encoding stage - getting from real languages to some expression of the relationships between them in the form of numerical or state data, so that those data can then be used as input to phylogenetic methods (b) the representation stage - applying phylogenetic methods to extract from those numerical and/or state data a signal that is converted into some useful form of representation, usually two dimensional graphical ones such as trees or networks, which synthesise and "collapse" what are often highly complex multi dimensional relationships in the signal (c) the interpretation stage - assessing those tree and network representations to extract from them what they actually mean for real languages and their relationships through time.&lt;ref&gt;Heggarty "Interdiscipline Indiscipline" in Phylogenetic Methods and the prehistory of Languages - Forster and Renfrew (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of trees and networks==
An output of a quantitative historical linguistic analysis is normally a tree or a network diagram. This allows summary visualisation of the output data but is not the complete result. A tree is a [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connected]] acyclic graph, consisting of a set of vertices (also known as "nodes") and a set of edges ("branches") each of which connects a pair of vertices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/download/42179609/llc08.pdf Tutorial on Computational Linguistic Phylogeny], Nichols and [[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]], Language and Linguistics Compass 2/5 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; An internal node represents a linguistic ancestor in a phylogenic tree or network. Each language is represented by a path, the paths showing the different states as it evolves.  There is only one path between every pair of vertices. Unrooted trees plot the relationship between the input data without assumptions regarding their descent. A rooted tree explicitly identifies a common ancestor, often by specifying a direction of evolution or by including an "outgroup" that is known to be only distantly related to the set of languages being classified. Most trees are binary, that is a parent has two children. A tree can always be produced even though it is not always appropriate. A different sort of tree is that only based on language similarities / differences. In this case the internal nodes of the graph do not represent ancestors but are introduced to represent the conflict between the different splits ("bipartitions") in the data analysis.  The "phenetic distance" is the sum of the weights (often represented as lengths) along the path between languages. Sometimes an additional assumption is made that these internal nodes do represent ancestors.

When languages converge, usually with word adoption ("borrowing"), a network model is more appropriate. There will be additional edges to reflect the dual parentage of a language. These edges will be bidirectional if both languages borrow from one another. A tree is thus a simple network, however there are many other types of network. A phylogentic network is one where the taxa are represented by nodes and their evolutionary relationships are represented by branches.&lt;ref&gt;Huson and Bryant, Application of Phylogenetic Networks in Evolutionary Studies  - Molecular Biology and Evolution 23(2) 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Another type is that based on splits, and is a combinatorial generalisation of the split tree. A given set of splits can have more than one representation thus internal nodes may not be ancestors and are only an "implicit" representation of evolutionary history as distinct from the "explicit" representation of phylogenetic networks. In a splits network the phrenetic distance is that of the shortest path between two languages. A further type is the reticular network which shows incompatibilities (due to for example to contact) as reticulations and its internal nodes do represent ancestors. A network may also be constructed by adding contact edges to a tree. The last main type is the consensus network formed from trees. These trees may be as a result of bootstrap analysis or samples from a posterior distribution.

==Language change==
Change happens continually to languages, but not usually at a constant rate,&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, Meade, Venditti, Greenhill and Pagel : Languages Evolve in Punctuational Bursts - Science 319 (1 Feb 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; with its cumulative effect producing splits into dialects, languages and language families. It is generally thought that morphology changes slowest and phonology the quickest. As change happens, less and less evidence of the original language remains. Finally there could be loss of any evidence of relatedness. Changes of one type may not affect other types, for example sound changes do not affect cognancy. Unlike biology, it cannot be assumed that languages all have a common origin and establishing relatedness is necessary. In modelling it is often assumed for simplicity that the characters change independently but this may not be the case. Besides borrowing, there can also be semantic shifts and polymorphism.

==Analysis input==

===Data===
Analysis can be carried out on the "characters" of languages or on the "distances" of the languages. In the former case the input to a language classification generally takes the form of a data matrix where the rows correspond to the various languages being analysed and the columns correspond to different features or characters by which each language may be described. These features are of two types cognates or typological data. Characters can take one or more forms (homoplasy) and can be lexical, morphological or phonological. Cognates are morphemes (lexical or grammatical) or larger constructions. Typological characters can come from any part of the grammar or lexicon. If there are gaps in the data these have to be coded.

In addition to the original database of (unscreened) data, in many studies subsets are formed for particular purposes (screened data).

In lexicostatistics the features are the meanings of words, or rather semantic slots. Thus the matrix entries are a series of glosses. As originally devised by Swadesh the single most common word for a slot was to be chosen, which can be difficult and subjective because of semantic shift. Later methods may allow more than one meaning to be incorporated.

===Constraints===
Some methods allow constraints to be placed on language contact geography (isolation by distance) and on sub-group split times.

==Databases==
Swadesh originally published a 200 word list but later refined it into a 100 word one.&lt;ref&gt;Towards greater accuracy in lexicostatistical dating, International Journal of American Linguistics 21, 121 (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly used IE database is that by Dyen, Kruskal and Black which contains data for 95 languages, though the original is known to contain a few errors. Besides the raw data it also contains cognacy judgements. This is available online.&lt;ref&gt;At http://www.idc.upenn.edu{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database of Ringe, Warnow and Taylor has information on 24 IE languages, with 22 phonological characters, 15 morphological characters and 333 lexical characters. Gray and Atkinson used a database of 87 languages with 2449 lexical items, based on the Dyen set with the addition of three ancient languages. They incorporated the cognacy judgements of a number of scholars. Other databases have been drawn up for African, Australian and Andean language families, amongst others.

Coding of the data may be in binary form or in multistate form. The former is often used but does result in a bias. It has been claimed that there is a constant scale factor between the two coding methods, and that allowance can be made for this. However, another study suggests that the topology may change &lt;ref&gt;Rexova ''et al.'', [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0748300702001470 Cladistic analysis of languages - IE classification based on lexicostatistical data], Cladistics 19/2 (Apr 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Word lists===
The word slots are chosen to be as culture- and borrowing- free as possible. The original [[Swadesh list]]s are most commonly used but many others have been devised for particular purposes. Often these are shorter than Swadesh's preferred 100 item list. Kessler has written a book on "The Significance of Word Lists &lt;ref&gt;CSLI Publications, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; while McMahon and McMahon carried out studies on the effects of reconstructability and retentiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Language Classification by Numbers, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of increasing the number of slots has been studied and a law of diminishing returns found, with about 80 being found satisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Holman ''et al.'', Explorations in automated language classification&lt;/ref&gt; However some studies have used less than half this number.

Generally each cognate set is represented as a different character but differences between words can also be measured as a distance measurement by sound changes. Distances may also be measured letter by letter.

===Morphological features===
Traditionally these have been seen as more important than lexical ones and so some studies have put additional weighting on this type of character. Such features were included in the Ringe, Warnow and Taylor IE database for example. However other studies have omitted them.

===Typological features===
Examples of these features include glottalised constants, tone systems, accusative alignment in nouns, dual number, case number correspondence, object-verb order, and first person singular pronouns. These will be listed in the WALS database, though this is only sparsely populated for many languages yet.&lt;ref&gt;Haspelmath ''et al.'', World Atlas of Language Structures, OUP 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probabilistic models==
Some analysis methods incorporate a statistical model of language evolution and use the properties of the model to estimate the evolution history. Statistical models are also used for simulation of data for testing purposes. A stochastic process can be used to describe how a set of characters evolves within a language. The probability with which a character will change can depend on the branch but not all charters evolve together, nor is the rate identical on all branches. It is often assumed that each character evolves independently but this is not always the case. Within a model borrowing and parallel development (homoplasy) may also be modelled, as well as polymorphisms.

===Effects of chance===
Chance resemblances produce a level of noise against which the required signal of relatedness has to be found. A study was carried out by Ringe &lt;ref&gt;On calculating the factor of chance in language comparison, Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 82 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; into the effects of chance on the [[mass comparison]] method. This showed that chance resemblances were critical to the technique and that Greenberg's conclusions could not be justified, though the mathematical procedure used by Rimge was later criticised.

With small databases sampling errors can be important.

In some cases with a large database and exhaustive search of all possible trees or networks is not feasible because of running time limitations. Thus there is a chance that the optimum solution is not found by heuristic solution-space search methods.

==Detection of borrowing==
Loanwords can severely affect the topology of a tree so efforts are made to exclude borrowings. However, undetected ones sometimes still exist. McMahon and McMahon &lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Language Classification by Numbers&lt;/ref&gt; showed that around 5% borrowing can affect the topology while 10% has significant effects. In networks borrowing produces reticulations. Minett and Wang &lt;ref&gt;On detection of borrowing, Diachronia 20/2 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; examined ways of detecting borrowing automatically.

==Split dating==
Dating of language splits can be determined if it is known how the characters evolve along each branch of a tree. The simplest assumption is that all characters evolve at a single constant rate with time and that this is independent of the tree branch. This was the assumption made in glottochronology. However, studies soon showed that there was variation between languages, some probably due to the presence of unrecognised borrowing.&lt;ref&gt;see for example Bergsland and Vogt&lt;/ref&gt; A better approach is to allow rate variation, and the gamma distribution is usually used because of its mathematical convenience. Studies have also been carried out that show that the character replacement rate depends on the frequency of use.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Pagel, Atkinson and Meade, [https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:39a9a999-ca60-4a79-ad1b-3623a5b64966/datastreams/ATTACHMENT01 Frequency of word-use predicts rates of lexical evolution throughout Indo-European history], Nature 449, 11 Oct 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread borrowing can bias divergence time estimates by making languages seem more similar and hence younger. However, this also makes the ancestor's branch length longer so that the root is unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson and Gray, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.799.7328&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf How old is the Indo-European family] (in Phylogenetic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

This aspect is the most controversial part of quantitative comparative linguistics.

==Types of analysis==
There is a need to understand how a language classification method works in order to determine its assumptions and limitations. It may only be valid under certain conditions or be suitable for small databases. The methods differ in their data requirements, their complexity and running time. The methods also differ in their optimisation criteria.

===Character based models===

====Maximum parsimony and maximum compatibility====
These two methods are similar but the maximum parsimony method's objective is to find the tree (or network) in which the minimum number of evolutionary changes occurs. In some implementations the characters can be given weights and then the objective is to minimise the total weighted sum of the changes. The analysis produces unrooted trees unless an outgroup is used or directed characters. Heuristics are used to find the best tree but optimisation is not guaranteed. The method is often implemented using the programs PAUP or [http://www.lillo.org.ar/phylogeny/tnt/ TNT].

Maximum compatibility also uses characters, with the objective of finding the tree on which the maximum number of characters evolve without homoplasy. Again the characters can be weighted and when this occurs the objective is to maximise the sum of the weights of compatible characters. It also produces unrooted trees unless additional information is incorporated. There are no readily available heuristics available that are accurate with large databases. This method has only been used by Ringe's group.&lt;ref&gt;Indo-European and Computational Cladistics, Transactions of the Philosophical Society 100/1 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

In these two methods there are often several trees found with the same score so the usual practice is to find a consensus tree via an algorithm. A majority consensus has bipartitions in more than half of the input trees while a greedy consensus adds bipartitions to the majority tree. The strict consensus tree is the least resolved and contains those splits that are in every tree.

Bootstrapping (a statistical resampling strategy) is used to provide branch support values. The technique randomly picks characters from the input data matrix and then the same analysis is used. The support value is the fraction of the runs with that bipartition in the observed tree. However, bootstrapping is very time consuming.

====Maximum likelihood and Bayesian analysis====
Both of these methods use explicit evolution models. The maximum likelihood method optimises the probability of producing the
observed data, while Bayesian analysis estimates the probability of each tree and so produces a probability distribution. A random walk is made through the "model-tree space". Both take an indeterminate time to run, and stopping  may be arbitrary so a decision is a problem. However, both produce support information for each branch.

The assumptions of these methods are overt and are verifiable. The complexity of the model can be increased if required. The model parameters are estimated directly from the input data so assumptions about evolutionary rate are avoided.

====Perfect Phylogenetic Networks====
This method produces an explicit phylogenic network having an underlying tree with additional contact edges. Characters can be borrowed but evolve without homoplasy. To produce such networks, a graph-theoretic algorithm &lt;ref&gt;Nakhleh ''et al.'' Perfect Phylogenic networks, Language 81 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; has been used.

====Gray and Atkinson's method====
The input lexical data is coded in binary form, with one character for each state of the original multi-state character. The method allows homoplasy and constraints on split times. A likelihood-based analysis method is used, with evolution expressed as a rate matrix. Cognate gain and loss is modelled with a gamma distribution to allow rate variation and with rate smoothing. Because of the vast number of possible trees with many languages, Bayesian inference is used to search for the optimal tree. A [[Markov Chain]] [[Monte Carlo algorithm]] &lt;ref&gt;Metropolis ''et al.'' 1953&lt;/ref&gt; generates a sample of trees as an approximation to the posterior probability distribution. A summary of this distribution can be provided as a greedy consensus tree or network with support values. The method also provides date estimates.

The method is accurate when the original characters are binary, and evolve identically and independently of each other under a rates-across-sites model with gamma distributed rates; the  dates are accurate when the rate of change is constant. Understanding the performance of the method when the original characters are multi-state is more complicated, since the binary encoding produces characters that are not independent, while the method assumes independence.

====Nicholls and Gray's method====
This method &lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.799.8282&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Quantifying Uncertainty in a Stochastic Model of Vocabulary Evolution] (in Phylogenic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; is an outgrowth of Gray and Atkinson's. Rather than having two parameters for a character, this method uses three. The birth rate, death rate of a cognate are specified and its borrowing rate. The birth rate is a Poisson random variable with a single birth of a cognate class but separate deaths of branches are allowed (Dollo parsimony). The method does not allow homoplasy but allows polymorphism and constraints. Its major problem is that it cannot handle missing data (this issue has since been resolved by Ryder and Nicholls.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Ryder|first1=Robin|last2=Nicholls|first2=Geoff| title= Missing data in a stochastic Dollo model for cognate data, and its application to the dating of Proto-Indo-European | journal= Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C | volume=60 | issue=1 | year=2011 | pages=71–92 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00743.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistical techniques are used to fit the model to the data. Prior information may be incorporated and an MCMC research is made of possible reconstructions. The method has been applied to Gray and Nichol's database and seems to give similar results.

===Distance based models===
These use a triangular matrix of pairwise language comparisons. The input character matrix is used to compute the distance matrix either using the [[Hamming distance]] or the [[Levenshtein distance]]. The former measures the proportion of matching characters while the latter allows costs of the various possible transforms to be included. These methods are fast compared with wholly character based ones. However, these methods do result in information loss.

====UPGMA====
The "Unweighted Pairwise Group Method with Arithmetic-mean" ([[UPGMA]]) is a clustering technique which operates by repeatedly joining the two languages that have the smallest distance between them. It operates accurately with clock-like evolution but otherwise it can be in error. This is the method used in Swadesh's original lexicostatistics.

====Split Decomposition====
This is a technique for dividing data into natural groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bandelt and Dress 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The data could be characters but is more usually distance measures.  The character counts or distances are used to generate the splits and to compute weights (branch lengths) for the splits. The weighted splits are then represented in a tree or network based on minimising the number of changes between each pair of taxa. There are fast algorithms for generating the collection of splits. The weights are determined from the taxon to taxon distances. Split decomposition is effective when the number of taxa is small or when the signal is not too complicated.

====Neighbor joining====
This method operates on distance data, computes a transformation of the input matrix and then computes the minimum distance of the pairs of languages.&lt;ref&gt;Saitou and Nei (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; It operates correctly even if the languages do not evolve with a lexical clock. A weighted version of the method may also be used. The method produces an output tree. It is claimed to be the closest method to manual techniques for tree construction.

====Neighbor-net====
It uses a similar algorithm to neighbor joining.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant and Moulton : [https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/21/2/255/1187993 Neighbor-net, an agglomerative method for the construction of phylogenetic networks] - Molecular Biology and Evolution 21 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Split Decomposition it does not fuse nodes immediately but waits until a node has been paired a second time. The tree nodes are then replaced by two and the distance matrix reduced. It can handle large and complicated data sets. However, the output is a phenogram rather than a phylogram. This is the most popular network method.

====Network====
This was an early network method that has been used for some language analysis. It was originally developed for genetic sequences with more than one possible origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bandelt et al. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Network collapses the alternative trees into a single network. Where there are multiple histories a reticulation (a box shape) is drawn. It generates a list of characters incompatible with a tree.

====ASP====
This uses a declarative knowledge representation formalism and the methods of Answer Set Programming.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Erdem. Minett and Ringe : Character-based cladistics and answer set programming&lt;/ref&gt; One such solver is CMODELS which can be used for small problems but larger ones require heuristics. Preprocessing is used to determine the informative characters.  CMODELS transforms them into a propositional theory that uses a SAT solver to compute the models of this theory.

====Fitch/Kitch====
Fitch and Kitch are maximum likelihood based programs in PHYLIP that allow a tree to be rearranged after each addition, unlike NJ. Kitch differs from Fitch in assuming a constant rate of change throughout the tree while Fitch allows for different rates down each branch.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon and McMahon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Separation level method====
Holm introduced a method in 2000 to deal with some known problems of lexicostatistical analysis. These are the "symplesiomorphy trap", where shared archaisms are difficult to distinguish from shared innovations, and the "proportionality "trap" when later changes can obscure early ones. Later he introduced a refined method, called SLD,  to take account of the variable word distribution across languages.&lt;ref&gt;Holm : The new arboretum of Indo-European trees - Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 14 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The method does not assume aconstant rate of change.

====Fast convergence methods====
A number of fast converging analysis methods have been developed for use with large databases (&gt;200 languages). One of these is the Disk Covering Method (DCM).&lt;ref&gt;Nakhleh, Roshan, St John, Sun and [[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]] : Designing fast converging phylogentic methods - Bioinfomatics, OUP 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This has been combined with existing methods to give improved performance. A paper on the DCM-NJ+MP method is given by the same authors in "The performance of Phylogenetic Methods on Trees of Bounded Diameter", where it is compared with the NJ method.

===Resemblance based models===
These models compare the letters of words rather than their phonetics. Dunn ''et al.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:59371/component/escidoc:59372/Dunn_2005_structural.pdf Structural Phylogenetics and the reconstruction of ancient language history], Science 309, 2072 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; studied 125 typological characters across 16 Austronesian and 15 Papuan languages. They compared their results to an MP tree and one constructed by traditional analysis. Significant differences were found. Similarly Wichmann and Saunders &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/download/37993874/Wichmann_and_Saunders_2007_HowToUse.pdf How to use typological databases in historical linguistic research], Diachronica 24, 373 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; used 96 characters to study 63 American languages.

====Computerised mass comparison====
A method that has been suggested for initial inspection of a set of languages to see if they are related was [[mass comparison]]. However, this has been severely criticised and fell into disuse. Recently Kessler has resurrected a computerised version of the method but using rigorous hypothesis testing.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3f51/a01d8e0a77f5b765d92f305f3315b03b4ea2.pdf The Mathematical Assessment of Long Range Linguistic Relationships] - Language and Linguistics Compass 2/5 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to make use of similarities across more than two languages at a time. In another paper &lt;ref&gt;Kessler and Lehtonen : [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.582.6204&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Multilateral Comparison and Significance Testing]&lt;/ref&gt; various criteria for comparing word lists are evaluated. It was found that the IE and Uralic families could be reconstructed but there was no evidence for a joint super-family.

====Nichol's method====
This method uses stable lexical fields, such as stance verbs, to try to establish long-distance relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols : Quasi-cognates and Lexical Type Shifts (in Phylogenetics and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Account is taken of convergence and semantic shifts to search for ancient cognates. A model is outlined and the results of a pilot study are presented.

====ASJP====
The [[Automated Similarity Judgment Program]] (ASJP) is similar to [[lexicostatistics]], but the judgement of similarities is done by a computer program following a consistent set of rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://email.eva.mpg.de/%7Ewichmann/AutomatedLanguageClassification.pdf Brown et al. : Automated classification of the world's languages, Sprachtypologie und Universalienforschung, 61.4: 285-308, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623083031/http://email.eva.mpg.de/%7Ewichmann/AutomatedLanguageClassification.pdf |date=June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trees are generated using standard phylogenetic methods. ASJP uses 7 vowel symbols and 34 consonant symbols. There are also various modifiers. Two words are judged similar if at least two consecutive consonants in the respective words are identical while vowels are also taken into account. The proportion of words with the same meaning judged to be similar for a pair of languages is the Lexical Similarity Percentage (LSP). The Phonological Similarity Percentage (PSP) is also calculated. PSP is then subtracted from the LSP yielding the Subtracted Similarity Percentage (SSP) and the ASJP distance is 100-SSP. Currently there are data on over 4,500 languages and dialects in the ASJP database&lt;ref&gt;[http://email.eva.mpg.de/~wichmann/LanguagesOfTheWorld.pdf ASJP processed languages] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511171251/http://email.eva.mpg.de/~wichmann/LanguagesOfTheWorld.pdf |date=May 11, 2010 }} (March 15, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; from which a tree of the world's languages was generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://email.eva.mpg.de/%7Ewichmann/WorldLanguageTree-003.pdf Müller, A., S. Wichmann, V. Velupillai et al. 2010. ''ASJP World Language Tree of Lexical Similarity: Version 3 (July 2010)''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730171446/http://email.eva.mpg.de/%7Ewichmann/WorldLanguageTree-003.pdf |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Serva and Petroni's method====
This measures the orthographical distance between words to avoid the subjectivity of cognacy judgements.&lt;ref&gt;Indo-European language tree by Levenstein distance&lt;/ref&gt;  It determines the minimum number of operations needed to transform one word into another, normalised by the length of the longer word. A tree is constructed from the distance data by the UPGMA technique.

===Phonetic evaluation methods===
Heggarty has proposed a means of providing a measure of the degrees of difference between cognates, rather than just yes/no answers.&lt;ref&gt;Quantifying change over time in phonetics (in Time-depth in Historical Linguistics, Renfrew, McMahon and Trask, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on examining many (&gt;30) features of the phonetics of the glosses in comparison with the protolanguage. This could require a large amount of work but Heggarty claims that only a representative sample of sounds is necessary. He also examined the rate of change of the phonetics and found a large rate variation, so that it was unsuitable for glottochronology. A similar evaluation of the phonetics had earlier been carried out by Grimes and Agard for Romance languages, but this used only six points of comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Linguistic diversity in Romance Languages, Language 35 1959&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of methods==

===Metrics===
Standard mathematical techniques are available for measuring the similarity/difference of two trees. For consensus trees the Consistency Index (CI) is a measure of homoplasy. For one character it is the ratio of the minimimum conceivable number of steps on any one tree (= 1 for binary trees) divided by the number of reconstructed steps on the tree. The CI of a tree  is the sum of the character CIs divided by the number of characters.&lt;ref&gt;Kluge and Farris, Systematic Zoology 18, 1-32 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the proportion of patterns correctly assigned.

The Retention Index (RI) measures the amount of similarity in a character. It is the ratio (g - s) / (g - m) where '''g''' is the greatest number of steps of a character on any tree, '''m''' is the minimum number of steps on any tree, and '''s''' is the minimum steps on a particular tree. There is also a Rescaled CI which is the product of the CI and RI.

For binary trees the standard way of comparing their topology is to use the [[Robinson-Foulds metric]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Foulds : Comparison of phylogenetic trees - Mathematical Biosciences - 53 (1981)&lt;/ref&gt; This distance is the average of the number of false positives and false negatives in terms of branch occurrence. R-F rates above 10% are considered poor matches. For other sorts of trees and for networks there is yet no standard method of comparison.

Lists of incompatible characters are produced by some tree producing methods. These can be extremely helpful in analysing the output. Where heuristic methods are used repeatability is an issue. However, standard mathematical techniques are used to overcome this problem.

===Comparison with previous analyses===
In order to evaluate the methods a well understood family of languages is chosen, with a reliable dataset. This family is often the IE one but others have been used. After applying the methods to be compared to the database, the resulting trees are compared with the reference tree determined by traditional linguistic methods. The aim is to have no conflicts in topology, for example no missing sub-groups, and compatible dates. The families suggested for this analysis by Nichols and Warnow &lt;ref&gt;Tutorial on Computational Linguistic Phylogeny, Language and Linguistic Compass 2/5 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; are Germanic, Romance, Slavic, Common Turkic, Chinese, and Mixe Zoque as well as older groups such as Oceanic and IE.

===Use of simulations===
Although the use of real languages does add realism and provides real problems, the above method of validation suffers from the fact that the true evolution of the languages is unknown. By generating a set of data from a simulated evolution correct tree is known. However it will be a simplified version of reality. Thus both evaluation techniques should be used.

===Sensitivity analysis===
To assess the robustness of a solution it is desirable to vary the input data and constraints, and observe the output. Each variable is changed slightly in turn. This analysis has been carried out in a number of cases and the methods found to be robust, for example by Atkinson and Gray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.799.7328&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf How old is the Indo-European language family?] (in Phylogenic Methods and the Prehistory of Languages, Forster and Renfrew, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies comparing methods==
During the early 1990s, linguist [[Donald Ringe]], with computer scientists [[Luay Nakhleh]] and [[Tandy Warnow]], statistician [[Steven N. Evans]] and others, began collaborating on research in quantitative comparative linguistic projects. They later founded the [[CHPL project]], the goals of which include: "producing and maintaining real linguistic datasets, in particular of Indo-European languages", "formulating statistical models that capture the evolution of historical linguistic data", "designing simulation tools and accuracy measures for generating synthetic data for studying the performance of reconstruction methods", and "developing and implementing statistically-based as well as combinatorial methods for reconstructing language phylogenies, including phylogenetic networks".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cs.rice.edu/~nakhleh/CPHL/ ''CPHL: Computational Phylogenetics in Historical Linguistics''] (homepage), 2009 (17 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparison of coding methods was carried out by Rexova ''et al.'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;Cladistic analysis of languages, Cladistics 19/2 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; They created a reduced data set from the Dyen database but with the addition of Hittite. They produced a standard multistate matrix where the 141 character states corresponds to individual cognate classes, allowing polymorphism. They also joined some cognate classes, to reduce subjectivity and polymorphic states were not allowed. Lastly they produced a binary matrix where each class of words was treated as a separate character. The matrices were analysed by PAUP. It was found that using the binary matrix produced changes near the root of the tree.

McMahon and McMahon (2003) used three PHYLIP programs (NJ, Fitch and Kitch) on the DKB dataset.&lt;ref&gt;Finding Families, quantitative methods in language classification. Transactions of the Philological Society 101 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; They found that the results produced were very similar. Bootstrapping was used to test the robustness of any part of the tree. Later they used subsets of the data to assess its retentiveness and reconstructability.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The outputs showed topological differences which were attributed to borrowing. They then also used Network, Split Decomposition, Neighbor-net and Splitstree on several data sets. Significant differences were found between the latter two methods. Neighbor-net was considered optimal for discerning language contact.

In 2005, Nakhleh, Warnow, Ringe and Evans carried out a comparison of six analysis methods using an Indo-European database.&lt;ref&gt;Nakhleh, Warnow, Ringe and Evans, "[http://statistics.berkeley.edu/tech-reports/672 A Comparison of Phylogenetic Reconstruction Methods on an IE Dataset]" (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The methods compared were UPGMA, NJ MP, MC, WMC and GA. The PAUP software package was used for UPGMA, NJ, and MC as well as computing the majority consensus trees. The RWT database was used but 40 characters were removed due to evidence of polymorphism.  Then a screened database was produced excluding all characters that clearly exhibited parallel development, so eliminating 38 features. The trees were evaluated on the basis of the number of incompatible characters and on agreement with established sub-grouping results. They found that UPGMA was clearly worst but there was not a lot of difference between the other methods. The results depended on the data set used. It was found that weighting the characters was important, which requires linguistic judgement.

Saunders (2005) &lt;ref&gt;Linguistic Phylogenetics for three Austronesian family, BA Thesis Swarthmore College (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; compared NJ, MP, GA and Neighbor-Net on a combination of lexical and typological data. He recommended use of the GA method but Nichols and Warnow have some concerns about the study methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Tutorial on Computational Linguistic Phylogeny&lt;/ref&gt;

Cysouw ''et al.'' (2006)  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/download/38036854/Cysouw_et_al_2006_Critique_of_the_separation-base_method.pdf A critique of the separation base method for genealogical subgrouping, with data from Mixe-Zoquean], Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 13, 225 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; compared Holm's original method with NJ, Fitch, MP and SD. They found Holm's method to be less accurate than the others.

In 2013, François Barbancon, Warnow, Evans, Ringe and Nakleh (2013) studied various tree reconstruction methods using simulated data.&lt;ref&gt;Barbancon, Warnow, Evans, Ringe and Nakhleh, [https://bioinfocs.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs266/f/Diachronica13_0.pdf An Experimental Study Comparing Linguistic Phylogenetic Reconstruction Methods]&lt;/ref&gt;  Their simulated data varied in the number of contact edges, the degree of homoplasy, the deviation from a lexical clock, and the deviation from the rates-across-sites assumption. It was found that the accuracy of the unweighted methods (MP, NJ, UPGMA, and GA) were consistent in all the conditions studied, with MP being the best. The accuracy of the two weighted methods (WMC and WMP) depended on the appropriateness of the weighting scheme. With low homoplasy the weighted methods generally produced the more accurate results but inappropriate weighting could make these worse than MP or GA under moderate or high homoplasy levels.

==Choosing the best model==
Choice of an appropriate model is critical for the production of good phylogenetic analyses. Both underparameterised or overly restrictive models may produce aberrant behaviour when their underlying assumptions are violated, while overly complex or overparameterised models require long run times and their parameters may be overfit.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan and Joyce, [https://www.academia.edu/download/44485077/Sullivan_Joyce2005.pdf Model selection in phylogenetics], Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics 36 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The most common method of model selection is the "Likelihood Ratio Test" which produces an estimate of the fit between the model and the data, but as an alternative the Akaike Information Criterion or the Bayesian Information Criterion can be used. Model selection computer programs are available.

'''''Read More About It''''' was a [[public service announcement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/mivana/mediaplayer.php?id=b3ed709abaa8c83f5d2317e93b2f6011&amp;media=cbs-1982-readmoreaboutit&amp;type=mp4 |title=iNTERACTIVE (Beta5-U312010) |publisher=TV ARK |date= |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign created as a joint venture between [[CBS]] and the [[Library of Congress]] that ran from 1980 to 1999 on CBS. The campaign, which usually aired one at the end of a special primetime program, was famous for its opening title sequence, which originally showed a live action TV set which zoomed in using [[stop motion]] that used pages on the side flipping into either the celebrity of the program aired or just on-screen graphics, which was remade in 1990 using [[computer animation]] that used [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the pages on the side of the TV flipping to revolve to the celebrity/graphics. The spiel in each PSA talks about learning more about what happened in the program, the books the Library of Congress suggests, and that they can be found in their local library or [[bookstore]]. It ended with either the celebrity of the program or an announcer saying, "Visit them. They'll be happy to help you ''Read More About It''." 

Originally the theme music was composed by [[Keith Mansfield]], but in 1983, "Moments of Courage" by composer [[Craig Palmer]] became the theme for the PSAs.  Along with a remade intro came a new theme for the campaign which lasted for the 1990s.  With the arrival of the internet came new resources to learn about the subject of the special or movie aired on CBS and other networks.  Because of this, ''Read More About It'' was succeeded at the turn of the 21st century by the ''[[CBS Cares]]'' campaign, which like its predecessor usually airs at the end of either a movie (example: ''[[The Karen Carpenter Story]]'') (until 2010) or a special program (example: The [[Grammy Awards]] or the [[Super Bowl]]) and focuses primarily on resources, online and print, to learn about the event or subject featured in the preceding program or community involvement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35218">The '''Rheinische Dokumenta''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʁaɪnɪʃə ˌdokuˈmɛntaː}}) is a [[phonetic]] writing system developed in the early 1980s by a working group of academics, linguists, local language experts, and local language speakers of the [[Rhineland]]. 
It was presented to the public in 1986 by the [[Landschaftsverband Rheinland]].&lt;ref name="1-honnen" /&gt;

It offers a uniform common notation of almost every [[phoneme]] spoken in the [[Lower Rhine region (Germany)|Lower Rhine]] area, the western and central Rhineland, the [[Berg (German region)|Berg region]], the [[Westerwald]], [[Eifel]], and [[Hunsrück]] mountain regions, plus the areas surrounding the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahe]] and [[Moselle River]]s.
It encompasses the [[dialect]]s of cities such as
[[Aachen]],
[[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]],
[[Bonn]],
[[Cologne]],
[[Duisburg]],
[[Düsseldorf]],
[[Eschweiler]] and [[Eschweiler, Wiltz|Eschweiler]],

[[Gennep]],

and many more.

Rheinische Dokumenta was designed to be easily readable for dialect speakers educated in German writing, but there are some differences that make it quite distinct from the usual ways of writing the dialects: There is no doubling of consonants to mark short vowels, and there are extra [[diacritical mark]]s. The German letters {{angbr|z}} and {{angbr|x}} are spelled {{angbr|ts}} and {{angbr|ks}},  German {{angbr|ch}} is spelled {{angbr|k}} when it indicates a {{IPA|/k/}} pronunciation, German {{angbr|qu}} is spelled {{angbr|kw}}. These spellings appear in other Germanic languages as well, but Rhinelanders are generally not accustomed to them.

==Letters==
The Rheinische Dokumenta uses the [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] of today's [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]], without {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|q}}, {{angbr|x}}, {{angbr|y}}, {{angbr|z}}, though it has the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|&lt;u&gt;ch&lt;/u&gt;}}, {{angbr|ng}}, [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] {{angbr|sch}}.  In addition, the three common [[German language|German]] [[Umlaut (diacritic)|Umlaut]]ed letters are used: {{angbr|ä}}, {{angbr|ö}}, {{angbr|ü}}, and ten more letters, digraphs, and a trigraph, each having diacritical marks:
: [[Image:Rheindok1.png]]

Each letter, digraph, or trigraph is strictly representing one [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]]. Most letters represent the usual sounds for which they are used in the [[German alphabet]] or, slightly less so, in the [[Dutch alphabet]] or that of the [[Luxembourgish language]]. Several letters are ambiguous in these languages, such as voiced consonants which [[final-obstruent devoicing|lose their voice when appearing at the end of a word]]. These ambiguities are avoided writing Rheinische Dokumenta; despite the fact that word stems may change their printed appearance, when [[Declension|declined]] or [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]], always the most phonetically correct letters, digraphs, or trigraphs are being used.

=== Digraph and trigraph unambiguity ===
As opposed to [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the combination of {{angbr|s}} followed by {{angbr|ch}} does not occur in the languages for which Rheinische Dokumenta was made. Thus, since {{angbr|c}} is not otherwise used in Rheinische Dokumenta, both {{angbr|[[ch (digraph)|ch]]}} and {{angbr|[[sch (trigraph)|sch]]}} are unambiguous, especially the underlined letter combinations, and the ones having an arch below.

Only the digraph {{angbr|ng}} has some ambiguity. An {{angbr|n}} may occur at the end of a [[syllable]], but only a few dialects allow a syllable initial (g) after a syllable final {{angbr|n}}. While {{angbr|ng}} at syllable joints is frequent in German, most languages that can use Rheinische Dokumenta have {{angbr|mg}} or {{angbr|nj}} instead in almost all instances. The authors of Rheinische Dokumenta suggest using the single letter [[eng (letter)|eng]] {{angbr|[[ŋ]]}} instead of the digraph {{angbr|ng}} when possible.

=== Letter case ===
Though not defined in the original specification,&lt;ref name="1-honnen" &gt;[[Peter Honnen]] (presented following the previous works of [[Fritz Langensiepen]]): ''Rheinische Dokumenta: Lautschrift für Rheinische Mundarten, Mundartdokumentation im Rheinland''. Rheinland-Verlag, Köln, 2nd edition, 1987, {{ISBN|3-7927-0947-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; upper case letters can be used. While some authors do not use them at all, others start sentences with capitals or capitalise names, and few use capital initial letters on each [[substantive]] and [[noun]], as [[standard German]] writing does.

==Accents==
[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] and the [[tonal accent]]s are usually ignored when writing in  Rheinische Dokumenta. There are [[Diacritical mark|diacritics]] to indicate them, but since they are seen to considerably hamper readability, make prints ugly, and are hardly necessary to facilitate understanding, they are seldom used. Some dialects do not have tonal accent anyway. For the other ones, there are only a very few [[minimal pair|word pairs or triplets]] having identical unaccented Rheinische Dokumenta spellings but different tonal or stress accents.

Also, other [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], such as the "melody" of sentence, which carries [[semantic]] information in many Rheinisch languages,&lt;ref name="münch"&gt;Ferdinand Münch: {{lang|de|Grammatik der ripuarisch-fränkischen Mundart. Verlag Friedrich Cohen, Bonn 1904. Nachdruck mit Genehmigung, Saendig Reprint Verlag, Vaduz, 1970.}} {{ISBN|3-500-21670-6}}.&lt;br /&gt;https://archive.org/stream/grammatikderrip00mngoog#page/n18/mode/1up (November 5, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; is not preserved in Rheinische Dokumenta writing.

==Vowels==
Vowels come in two variants, short and long. That many dialects feature three distinct vowel lengths is ignored, as doing so does not create any ambiguities and makes reading easier. Short vowels are represented by single letters, long vowels are represented by the same letters doubled to indicate lengthening.

=== Monophthongs ===
Rheinische Dokumenta can write 25 monophthongs.

==== Short monophthongs ====
There are 14 short vowels in the languages that the script was designed for, 13 of which are representable in Rheinische Dokumenta:

The "e̩" is {{IPAblink|ə}}, a [[schwa]]. There is no long version of "e̩". Although a schwa usually cannot carry word accent or stress, in some dialects there are exceptions. Words having only schwas do have their stress on schwas, and they can receive the main stress within a sentence as well. The [[Colognian language|Colognian]] word {{Audio|Ksh-M-enß.ogg|"e̩ns"}} (in Rheinische Dokumenta writing) is an example.

===== The schwa "e̩r" =====
There is another schwa. It does not have a corresponding [[grapheme]] in Rheinische Dokumenta. It could be noted in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] as an unstressed short {{IPA|[ɔ̆]}}, in some dialects and positions also as an unstressed short {{IPAblink|ɐ|showsymbol=ɐ̆}}. Some publications call it a "vocalic r".&lt;ref&gt;e.g. on page 178 in Christa Bhatt, Markus Lindlar (editors) ''Alles Kölsch – eine Dokumentation der aktuellen Stadtsprache in Köln.'' 286 pages, 4 [[compact disk|CDs]], Bouvier Verlag, Bonn, 1998. {{ISBN|3-416-02847-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost always followed by a [[glottal stop]]. Glottal stops are not noted in Rheinische Dokumenta, even though they are [[phoneme]]s occasionally having [[minimal pair]]s and a length attribute. Since this schwa almost always corresponds to the digraph "er" ending a word or a separable syllable prefix of Standard German orthography, most users of Rheinische Dokumenta positionally print "er", or "e̩r", respectively, for increased readability in an attempt of courtesy towards their readers who read German more fluently than Rheinische Dokumenta. From the standpoint of phonological writing, this is incorrect.

==== Long monophthongs ====
There are 12 long vowels. For each short vowel with the exception of the [[schwa]] "e̩", there is a corresponding long vowel:

=== Diphthongs ===
In Rheinische Dokumenta, Diphthongs are simply denoted as a sequence of the two monophthongs heard and spoken jointly. For instance, the English word "[[boy]]" would be spelled: "bǫi" in Rheinische Dokumenta. There are occasions, when two monophthongs need to be written together without forming a diphthong; that means they are pronounced separately with either a [[glottal stop]] or an intervocalic joiner consonant "j" in between. There is no written distinction between these cases, although it is not forbidden to write the character "j" for clarity. The number of diphthongs existing in a dialect is far less than each possible combination of two vowels, thus there are not very many ambiguities when taking syllable structure into account.

[[Assimilation (linguistics)|Assimilation]] and [[coarticulation]] are predominant in most of the languages written using Rheinische Dokumenta, thus diphthong [[Manner of articulation|articulation]] may deviate somewhat from the articulation of the isolated monophthongs. Also, depending on languages, the lengths of their diphthongs may vary considerably between the extremes of as short as a typical short monophthong to longer than the sum of two long monophthongs. Varying lengths of diphthongs are not noted in Rheinische Dokumenta, which at least does not create ambiguities within a dialect.

=== Other ===
There are no triphthongs, although diphthongs can be followed by schwas in some languages. If, for instance, Rheinische Dokumenta was used in writing [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]], triphthongs would be written in a manner analogous to the diphthongs, using three adjacent letters of vocals.

==Consonants==
Since most dialects follow the [[German language|German]], and [[Lower Franconian]], rule of [[final-obstruent devoicing]], voiced consonants cannot, or hardly ever, appear at the end of a word or sentence. This is one of the major differences between Rheinische Dokumenta and Standard German writing, since Standard German orthography tries to keep word [[stem (linguistics)|stem]]s unaltered, even if pronunciation varies with suffixes, endings, or [[phonology|phonological rules]]. If there is [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] or other [[sandhi]] across word boundaries which yields a consonant voiced at a word end, some authors write them as [[Syncope (phonetics)|contractions]] or join the words with a [[dash]] "-" to avoid having final voiced consonants.

|}

===Nasals===
Though some dialects vary the duration of nasal consonants considerably, they are not doubled to indicate extended length when written, while vocals are. Though this never creates ambiguities within a language, comparison of languages is less supported. A good argument against doubling is that often nasal durations depend on speaker, style of speech, and [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] rather than being a characteristic of a word or a dialect, although that is not always so.

The letter [[eng (letter)|eng]] (&lt;code&gt;ŋ&lt;/code&gt;) is recommended rather than the &lt;code&gt;ng&lt;/code&gt; digraph when technically feasible. This recommendation is not always followed in an attempt to create prints closer resembling Standard German or Dutch. Though the phoneme cannot appear at the beginning of a syllable, upper case glyphs exist for [[all caps]] and [[small caps]] print.

=== Liquids or approximants ===
Some dialects vary the duration of liquids. With the exception of [[Ripuarian dialects]], this is hardly a characteristic of words, but prosodic. It is not noted when writing Rheinische Dokumenta.

There is no distinction between the different [[phone (phonetics)|phone]]s represented by &lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;.{{specify|What phones does the r with overdot and underdot represent?|date=May 2015}} They are nearly [[allophone]]s; most often a specific dialect uses one, but not the other phone of a pair.

Both &lt;code&gt;ṛ&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ṙ&lt;/code&gt;, are rarely used since these sounds occur in few dialects only.

The letter &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; is recommended to be used as a replacement of &lt;code&gt;ṣ&lt;/code&gt;, when &lt;code&gt;ṣ&lt;/code&gt; is technically not available. This resembles the use of &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; in Dutch writing.

The variations &lt;code&gt;Sch&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Ch&lt;/code&gt;, are used for [[title case]], while &lt;code&gt;SCH&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;CH&lt;/code&gt;, are used for [[all caps]] and [[small caps]].

Few West- and Central [[Ripuarian dialects|Ripuarian languages]], most notably [[Colognian language|Colognian]], have the non-[[allophone]]s {{IPAblink|ʃ}} and {{IPAblink|ɧ}}&lt;ref&gt;Whether or not the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] glyph {{IPA|[ɧ]}} really is the correct notation is disputable, see [[voiceless palatal-velar fricative#Colognian|voiceless palatal-velar fricative]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both are written &lt;code&gt;sch&lt;/code&gt; in Rheinische Dokumenta. The associated [[phone (phonetics)|phone]]s are to a large extent positionally distinguishable and clearly [[Manner of articulation|articulated]] differently. Nevertheless they are acoustically hard to distinguish, in part due to [[coarticulation]], at times even for natives. So the designers of Rheinische Dokumenta choose to consider their differentiation unnecessary or marginal.

== Typographical considerations ==
Rheinische Dokumenta has several [[diacritical mark]]s, some of which have their [[typography|typographical]] peculiarities.

[[Trema (diacritic)|Umlauts]] can be seen as their counterparts in German, or [[Latin script]], typography.

The "[[central hook below]]", which is being used to denote openness of the vowels ą̈, ǫ, ǫ̈. respectively, could be confused with the [[ogonek]]. In fact, it is different. While the ogonek is to be placed somewhat off the optical center of the glyph it goes with, the Rheinische Dokumenta hook explicitly goes to its center. Thus it gives another impression and does not resemble the ogonek. Most Rheinische Dokumenta prints choose it to be slightly more angular, longer, and thus appear bolder than ogoneks usually are.

The "[[center dot below]]" may not always be available. Using &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; as a replacement for &lt;code&gt;ṣ&lt;/code&gt; is recommended in such cases, resembling Dutch writing. There are no such replacements or recommendations for the letters &lt;code&gt;ạ&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;ṛ&lt;/code&gt;, respectively, which are comparatively much less used.

When the "[[horizontal bar below]]" is not available, using the glyph &lt;code&gt;ə&lt;/code&gt; as a replacement for &lt;code&gt;e̩&lt;/code&gt;, when possible, is recommended in such cases.

The phoneme denoted by &lt;code&gt;ŋ&lt;/code&gt; in print, alternately spelt &lt;code&gt;ng&lt;/code&gt;, never appears at the beginning of a syllable, word, or sentence. Yet its upper case version could be used in [[all caps]] or [[small caps]] type.

The two variations of &lt;code&gt;sch&lt;/code&gt;, and the three variations of &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt;, when written in [[title case]], usually have only their 1st character uppercased, when used in all caps or small caps, however, each letter is converted to upper case.

== Unicode ==
Rheinische Dokumenta cannot currently be fully written in [[Unicode]] but proposals are underway to have missing pieces added.

Rheinische Dokumenta is part of the Latin character set of Unicode, and thus part of its Basic Multilingual [[Plane (Unicode)]]. It is to a large extent covered by single [[code point]]s. While unaccented characters do that anyway, even some of the characters having [[diacritical mark]]s nevertheless occupy only one character position in a text stream in their [[Unicode normalization|normalized]] form.

'''Richard Lyman Bushman''' (born 20 June 1931){{sfn|Woodworth|2009}} is an American [[historian]] and [[Gouverneur Morris]] Professor of History emeritus at [[Columbia University]]. Bushman taught at [[Brigham Young University]],  [[Harvard University]], [[Boston University]], and the [[University of Delaware]] before joining the history faculty at Columbia. Bushman is the author of ''Rough Stone Rolling'', an important biography of [[Joseph Smith]], and he serves as one of three general editors of the [[The Joseph Smith Papers|Joseph Smith Papers]]. Bushman has been called "one of the most important scholars of American religious history" of the late 20th century, and in 2012 a $3 million donation to the [[University of Virginia]] established the Richard Lyman Bushman Chair of Mormon Studies in his honor.{{sfn|Cannon|2012}}

==Biography==
Richard L. Bushman was born on 20 June 1931, in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  His father, Ted Bushman (1902–1980), was a fashion illustrator, advertiser, and department store executive, and his mother, Dorothy Bushman (''née'' Lyman; 1908–1995), was a secretary and homemaker. Bushman's family relocated to [[Portland, Oregon]] when he was a small child.{{sfn|Woodworth|2009}}

After graduating from high school in 1949, Bushman spent two years as an [[LDS missionary]] in the northeastern United States. After completing his missionary service, he matriculated at [[Harvard University]], graduating in 1955 with an [[B.A.|A.B.]] ''magna cum laude'' in history.{{sfn|Woodworth|2009}}{{sfn|Columbia University: Department of History}} Bushman married fellow historian [[Claudia Lauper Bushman]] in August 1955 and the couple raised six children. Bushman continued at Harvard as a graduate student, earning [[Master of Arts|A.M.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degrees in the History of American Civilization, where he studied with distinguished early American historian [[Bernard Bailyn]]. While still a graduate student he was awarded the Sheldon Fellowship to work on his dissertation in London.{{sfn|Woodworth|2009}} 

Bushman first taught at Brigham Young University from 1960 to 1968 but two of those years he spent out on a doctoral fellowship to study history and psychology at [[Brown University]]. In 1967, he won the [[Bancroft Prize]] for his published dissertation, ''From Puritan to Yankee: Character and the Social Order in Connecticut, 1690-1765''. Bushman was awarded a year-long fellowship in 1969 at Harvard's Charles Warren Center. At Harvard he was recruited to teach by Boston University. In 1977, Bushman transferred from Boston University to the University of Delaware to work with material culture at the [[Winterthur Museum]]. In an interview with Jed Woodworth, a historian, Bushman's "major work on refinement and gentility dated from those years, which included a year-long fellowship at the Smithsonian Institution."{{sfn|Woodworth|2009}} In 1989, Bushman was asked to teach [[Colonial history of the United States|American Colonial history]] at [[Columbia University]]. During his time at Columbia he completed year-long fellowships at the Davis Center at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], the [[National Humanities Center]], and the [[Huntington Library]]. It was at the Huntington Library in 1997 that Bushman started his biography of [[Joseph Smith]] entitled [[Rough Stone Rolling|''Rough Stone Rolling'']]. Bushman decided to retire from Columbia in 2001 to work full-time on the Joseph Smith biography.{{sfn|Woodworth|2009}} Bushman was recognized by Columbia University and become the Gouverneur Morris Professor of History in 1992.{{sfn|Shipps|2007}} From 2008 to 2011, Bushman served as the first [[Howard W. Hunter]] Chair of Mormon Studies at [[Claremont Graduate University]] and held a [[Huntington Library]] fellowship.{{sfn|Cannon|2012}}{{sfn|Gordon|2007}}{{sfn|''"Richard L. Bushman named as Hunter Visiting Professor"''}}{{sfn|Mauss|2011}} In 2012, the University of Virginia established the Richard Lyman Bushman Chair of Mormon studies in the Department of Religious Studies. The chair was funded by a $3 million endowment by anonymous donors.{{sfn|Cannon|2012}}

==Awards and honors==
[[File:Richard Bushman cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Bushman addressing the John Whitmer Historical Association in 2011]]
Bushman's scholarship includes studies of early American social, cultural, and political history, American religious history, and the history of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). In 1968, Bushman's ''From Puritan to Yankee: Character and Social Order in Connecticut, 1690-1765'' won the [[Bancroft Prize]], an award given by the trustees of Columbia University for the year's best book on American history. Bushman has also received the [[Phi Alpha Theta]] prize, and Evans Biography Awards, administered by the Mountain West Center for Regional Studies at [[Utah State University]]. He published ''Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism'', which was awarded best biography from the Mormon History Association in 1985.{{sfn|Richard L. Bushman named as Hunter Visiting Professor}} Bushman has held Guggenheim, Huntington, [[National Humanities Center]], and [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] fellowships; and served as president of the Mormon History Association (1985–1986).{{sfn|Past MHA Presidents }} Bushman was honored at the January 2011 annual meeting of the American Historical Association (MHA) where a breakout session entitled ''A Retrospective on the Scholarship of Richard Bushman'' was heavily attended.{{sfn|Underwood|Stout|2011}}

===''Rough Stone Rolling''===
Bushman's work, ''Rough Stone Rolling'' focuses heavily on new Mormon history. ''Rough Stone Rolling'' sold over 100,000 copies and gathered many awards including the Evans Biography Award and the [[Mormon History Association]]'s annual 2006 Best Book award.{{sfn|Shipps|2007}} In an article by Larry Gordon, LA Times writer, the initial response to ''Rough Stone Rolling'' has "garnered many positive reviews, although some critics said it uncomfortably straddled reverence and logic."{{sfn|Gordon|2007}}

==Bushman's religion==
Bushman is a member of the LDS Church. He interrupted his undergraduate studies at Harvard to serve as a [[Mormon missionary|missionary]].{{sfn|BYU Religious Studies Center }} See "My Faith" in Bushman, ''Believing History: Latter-day Saint Essays'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 2004), 20-29. In the essay, Bushman notes how he went on his LDS mission as an agnostic but after three months could say "with conviction that I knew the Book of Mormon was right."{{sfn|Bushman|2004}}{{sfn|Manwaring|2018}} He served a religious mission in [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]], and held various positions within the LDS Church, including [[Church Educational System#Seminaries|Seminary]] teacher, [[bishop]], [[stake president]], and [[Patriarch (Mormonism)|stake patriarch]].{{sfn|BYU Religious Studies Center }} On his decision to study the religion he is affiliated with Bushman replied, "Would you say that the only people who can do black studies are not blacks, or that to do women's studies you have to be a non-woman? You get all sorts of people who have deep personal commitments to a subject they teach, and that has its advantages."{{sfn|Gordon|2007}}

The '''rule of avoidance''' was a rule employed in the [[Sui Dynasty]] in [[China]] for the appointment of officials. A system similar to this was adopted by [[Emperor Akbar]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] to prevent corruption and favoritism. It is also an entirely different principle in [[United States]] constitutional law, and a cultural norm in some cultures that promotes [[exogamy]].

== Sui Dynasty ==
The rule of avoidance employed during the [[Sui Dynasty]], and continued by subsequent [[Confucianism|Confucian]] governments, prohibited local officials from serving in their places of origin, so that family and friends would not influence them. Terms of service were for only three or four years, and parents and sons over fifteen could not accompany officials. Each prefecture sent delegates to an annual court assembly. This practice would continue through to the end of the Qing Dynasty.

== Mughal Empire ==

In the time of [[Emperor Akbar]] of the [[Mughal Empire]] (in the area of what is now [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]), a system similar to this was put into place to ensure smooth running of government and to prevent corruption. Government officials were not allowed to serve in one jurisdiction for long so that they did not become too involved in local affairs and become stronger than the Emperor himself. After a period of time, employees of the Emperor were transferred and jurisdiction of service was thus rotated regularly. The implementation of this system in the Empire by Akbar helped in preventing corruption and favoritism. This method was discarded and forgotten by the later Emperors.

== United States law ==
The rule of avoidance employed by the [[United States Supreme Court]] is a principle, settled in ''Ashwander v. TVA'' (297 US 288, 346-347 (1936)), that where a controversy may be settled on a platform other than one involving constitutional adjudication, the court should avoid the constitutional question.

==Irish Law==
This principle is also used in Irish law: see [[European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003#Important Case Law|Carmody v Minister for Justice]].[http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IEHC/2005/H10.html]

[[Image:Crucifixion châsse saint Calmin Mozac.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Detail of the crucifixion on the casket.]]
The '''Saint Calminius Reliquary''' (French – ''châsse de saint Calmin'') is the 12th-century [[chasse (casket)|chasse]]-form [[reliquary]] which was the main object in the treasury of [[Mozac Abbey]]. It contains the bones of [[Saint Calminius]] and his wife [[Saint Namadie]].

The structure is of wood and measures 81 × 24&amp;nbsp;cm x 45&amp;nbsp;cm. Fourteen copper plaques have been attached, which are enameled using the ''[[champlevé]]'' technique (gaps are carved in the metal, into which molten enamel is poured before firing). The box is in the shape of a church without a [[transept]] or [[choir (architecture)|choir]]. It is decorated with [[Limoges enamel|Limoges]] [[champlevé enamel]], depicting scenes from the life of the saint and his wife, in particular the foundation of the three institutions and his funeral.

It was permanently exhibited on the south arm of the transept of the abbey church. It was hidden and saved in 1789 during the [[French Revolution]] by a villager and municipal councillor Jean Ozenne (1756–1832). It is now housed in the [[Musée Dobrée]].

[[Image:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|[[Double Herm of Socrates and Seneca]] ([[Antikensammlung Berlin]])]]

'''Senecan tragedy''' refers to a set of [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[tragedies]]. Ten of these [[Play (theatre)|plays]] exist, of which most likely eight were written by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher and politician [[Lucius Annaeus Seneca]]. The group includes ''Hercules Furens'', ''Medea'', ''Troades'', ''Phaedra'', ''Agamemnon'', ''Oedipus'', ''Phoenissae'', ''Thyestes'', ''Hercules Oetaeus'', and ''Octavia''. ''Hercules Oetaeus'' is generally considered not to have been written by Seneca, and ''Octavia'' is certainly not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-16th century, [[Italian humanists]] rediscovered these works, making them models for the revival of tragedy on the [[Renaissance]] stage. The two great, but very different, dramatic traditions of the age — French neoclassical tragedy and [[Revenge play|Elizabethan tragedy]] — both drew inspiration from Seneca. Usually, the Senecan tragedy focuses heavily on supernatural elements.

Although many of the Senecan tragedies adapt the same Greek myths as tragedies by [[Sophocles]], [[Aeschylus]], and [[Euripides]], scholars tend not to view Seneca's works as direct adaptations of the Attic works, as Seneca's approach to the myths differs significantly from the Greek poets and often contains themes familiar from his philosophical writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Buckley|editor1-first=Emma|editor2-last=Dinter|editor2-first=Martin|title=A Companion to the Neronian Age|date=2013|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|accessdate=2014-07-12|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Seneca's tragic style was more directly influenced by [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarrant|first1=R. J.|title=Senecan Drama and Its Antecedents|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|date=1978|volume=82|pages=213–263|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French neoclassical dramatic tradition, which reached its highest expression in the 17th-century tragedies of [[Pierre Corneille]] and [[Jean Racine]], drew on Seneca for form and grandeur of style. These neoclassicists adopted Seneca's innovation of the confidant (usually a servant), his substitution of speech for action, and his moral hairsplitting.

The Elizabethan dramatists found Seneca's themes of bloodthirsty revenge more congenial to English taste than they did his form. The first English tragedy, ''[[Gorboduc (play)|Gorboduc]]'' (1561), by [[Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset|Thomas Sackville]] and [[Thomas Norton]], is a chain of slaughter and revenge written in direct imitation of Seneca. (As it happens, ''Gorboduc'' does follow the form as well as the subject matter of Senecan tragedy: but only a very few other English plays—e.g. ''[[The Misfortunes of Arthur]]''—followed its lead in this.) Senecan influence is also evident in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', and in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''. All three share a revenge theme, a corpse-strewn climax, and The Spanish Tragedy and Hamlet also have ghosts among the cast; all of these elements can be traced back to the Senecan model.

[[Image:SEUtahStrat.JPG|thumb|The [[Permian]] through [[Jurassic]] strata of the [[Colorado Plateau]] area of southeastern [[Utah]] demonstrate the principles of stratigraphy.]]{{About|the branch of geology|stratigraphy in [[archaeology]]|Stratigraphy (archaeology)}}
'''Stratigraphy''' is a branch of [[geology]] concerned with the study of [[rock (geology)|rock]] layers ([[Stratum|strata]]) and layering (stratification). It is primarily used in the study of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and layered [[volcanic rock]]s.
Stratigraphy has two related subfields: [[lithostratigraphy]] (lithologic stratigraphy) and [[biostratigraphy]] (biologic stratigraphy).

==Historical development==
[[Image:Smith fossils1.jpg|left|thumb|Engraving from William Smith's monograph on identifying strata based on fossils]]
Catholic priest [[Nicholas Steno]] established the theoretical basis for stratigraphy when he introduced the [[law of superposition]], the [[principle of original horizontality]] and the [[principle of lateral continuity]] in a 1669 work on the fossilization of organic remains in layers of sediment.

The first practical large-scale application of stratigraphy was by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]] in the 1790s and early 19th century. Known as the "Father of English geology",&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8j-nmabapH0C&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=1831+Sedgwick+Smith+Father+of+English+geology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1d8NkrqGhS&amp;sig=Y9KCP_buCwx5mHs2nMrqO0Xp750&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=EIxwVKuGEZfvaoqhgVA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1831%20Sedgwick%20Smith%20Father%20of%20English%20geology&amp;f=false | title=Whatever is Under the Earth the Geological Society of London 1807-2007 | publisher=Geological Society | author=Davies G.L.H. | year=2007 | location=London | pages=78 | isbn=9781862392144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith recognized the significance of [[Stratum|strata]] or rock layering and the importance of fossil markers for correlating strata; he created the first [[geologic map]] of England. Other influential applications of stratigraphy in the early 19th century were by [[Georges Cuvier]] and [[Alexandre Brongniart]], who studied the geology of the region around Paris.

==Lithostratigraphy==
{{main|Lithostratigraphy}}
[[Image:Geology of Cyprus-Chalk.jpg|thumb|Chalk layers in [[Cyprus]], showing sedimentary layering]]

Variation in rock units, most obviously displayed as visible layering, is due to physical contrasts in rock type ([[lithology]]). This variation can occur vertically as layering (bedding), or laterally, and reflects changes in [[sedimentary depositional environment|environments of deposition]] (known as [[facies]] change). These variations provide a lithostratigraphy or lithologic stratigraphy of the rock unit. Key concepts in stratigraphy involve understanding how certain geometric relationships between rock layers arise and what these geometries imply about their original depositional environment. The basic concept in stratigraphy, called the [[law of superposition]], states: in an undeformed stratigraphic sequence, the oldest strata occur at the base of the sequence.

[[Chemostratigraphy]] studies the changes in the relative proportions of trace elements and [[isotope]]s within and between lithologic units. [[Carbon]] and [[oxygen]] [[isotope ratio]]s vary with time, and researchers can use those to map subtle changes that occurred in the paleoenvironment. This has led to the specialized field of isotopic stratigraphy.

[[Cyclostratigraphy]] documents the often cyclic changes in the relative proportions of [[mineral]]s (particularly [[Carbonate mineral|carbonates]]), grain size, thickness of sediment layers ([[varve]]s) and fossil diversity with time, related to seasonal or longer term changes in [[paleoclimatology|palaeoclimate]]s.

==Biostratigraphy==
{{main|Biostratigraphy}}

Biostratigraphy or [[paleontology|paleontologic]] stratigraphy is based on [[fossil]] evidence in the rock layers. Strata from widespread locations containing the same fossil fauna and flora are said to be correlatable in time. Biologic stratigraphy was based on William Smith's [[principle of faunal succession]], which predated, and was one of the first and most powerful lines of evidence for, [[biological evolution]]. It provides strong evidence for the formation ([[speciation]]) and [[extinction]] of [[species]]. The [[geologic time scale]] was developed during the 19th century, based on the evidence of biologic stratigraphy and faunal succession. This timescale remained a relative scale until the development of [[radiometric dating]], which gave it and the stratigraphy it was based on an absolute time framework, leading to the development of chronostratigraphy.

One important development is the [[Vail curve]], which attempts to define a global historical sea-level curve according to inferences from worldwide stratigraphic patterns. Stratigraphy is also commonly used to delineate the nature and extent of [[hydrocarbon]]-bearing reservoir rocks, seals, and traps of [[petroleum geology]].

==Chronostratigraphy==
{{main|Chronostratigraphy}}
Chronostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy that places an absolute age, rather than a relative age on rock [[stratum|strata]]. The branch is concerned with deriving [[geochronology|geochronological]] data for rock units, both directly and inferentially, so that a sequence of time-relative events that created the rocks formation can be derived. The ultimate aim of chronostratigraphy is to place dates on the sequence of deposition of all rocks within a geological region, and then to every region, and by extension to provide an entire geologic record of the Earth.

A gap or missing strata in the geological record of an area is called a stratigraphic hiatus. This may be the result of a halt in the deposition of sediment. Alternatively, the gap may be due to removal by erosion, in which case it may be called a stratigraphic vacuity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepmstrata.org/Terminology.aspx?id=hiatus SEPM Strata, Society for Sedimentary Geology, Terminology=hiatus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martinsen"&gt;Martinsen, O.

===Magnetostratigraphy===
{{main|Magnetostratigraphy}}

Magnetostratigraphy is a chronostratigraphic technique used to date sedimentary and volcanic sequences. The method works by collecting oriented samples at measured intervals throughout a section. The samples are analyzed to determine their detrital [[wikt:remanent|remanent]] magnetism (DRM), that is, the polarity of Earth's magnetic field at the time a stratum was deposited. For sedimentary rocks this is possible because, as they fall through the water column, very fine-grained magnetic minerals (&lt;&amp;nbsp;17&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]) behave like tiny compasses, orienting themselves with [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Upon burial, that orientation is preserved.  For volcanic rocks, magnetic minerals, which form in the melt, orient themselves with the ambient magnetic field, and are fixed in place upon crystallization of the lava.

Oriented paleomagnetic core samples are collected in the field; mudstones, siltstones, and very fine-grained sandstones are the preferred lithologies because the magnetic grains are finer and more likely to orient with the ambient field during deposition. If the ancient magnetic field were oriented similar to today's field ([[North Magnetic Pole]] near the North Rotational Pole), the strata would retain a normal polarity. If the data indicate that the North Magnetic Pole were near the South Rotational Pole, the strata would exhibit reversed polarity.

Results of the individual samples are analyzed by removing the [[natural remanent magnetization]] (NRM) to reveal the DRM. Following statistical analysis, the results are used to generate a local magnetostratigraphic column that can then be compared against the Global Magnetic Polarity Time Scale.

This technique is used to date sequences that generally lack fossils or interbedded igneous rocks. The continuous nature of the sampling means that it is also a powerful technique for the estimation of sediment-accumulation rates.

'''Uroscopy''' is the historic medical practice of visually examining a patient's [[urine]] for [[pus]], [[blood]], or other symptoms of disease. It dates back to ancient [[Egypt]], [[Babylon]], and [[India]]. It was particularly emphasized in [[Byzantine medicine]].

By modern medical standards, uroscopy is considered to be a very limited means of obtaining evidence for the correct diagnosis of a patient's condition.{{dubious|date=April 2018}} In addition, many of the assumptions made by ancient physicians regarding uroscopy have proved to be quite incorrect and unscientific.{{dubious|date=April 2018}} However, visual examination of a patient's urine may provide preliminary evidence for a diagnosis, but is generally limited to conditions that affect the [[urinary system]] such as [[infection]] [[turbidity]] or blood [[infection]] or [[haemorrhage]].

==The procedure==
[[File:The Medical Alchemist by Janneck FA.2000.00.275.jpg|thumb|''The Medical Alchemist'' vt. ''The Uroscopy'' by {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Christoph Janneck|de}} (1703-1761), ([[Science History Institute]])]]

===How Uroscopy Flask is Used===
A uroscopy flask is a piece of glass that is circular at the bottom, while there is a thin neck at the top, and on top of that neck there is an opening for urine.  In order for a doctor to examine a patients urine one would have to urinate into a uroscopy flask. A uroscopy flask is a glass bottle that must be transparent. If there is any color to the uroscopy flask, diagnosis could be wrong. In the process of uroscopy, color is very crucial to find diseases. If the uroscopy flask has a tint of color, the doctor may not be able effectively diagnose the patient. The glass must also have an even thickness throughout the flask. If the top is very thin glass and the bottom is thick glass, then the impurities in the top may look different from the top and bottom. While in all actuality they could be the very same impurities.  The impurities in urine have varying shapes, uneven glass will corrupt the diagnosis.

===Urine Wheel===
[[Image:Uros Rad.jpg|thumb|left|Uroscopy Wheel]]

The uroscopy wheel is a diagram that linked the color of urine to a particular disease. It usually has twenty different uroscopy flasks with urine of different colors aligned  around the border of the circle. Each flask has a line that connects it to a summary of a particular disease. This allowed doctors to have a quick reference guide to twenty different types of urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ḎḤWTY|title=The Urine Wheel and Uroscopy: What Your Wee Could Tell a Medieval Doctor|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/urine-wheel-and-uroscopy-your-wee-could-tell-medieval-doctor-009744|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=30 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature When Testing===
The temperature at which the urine is examined is a very important factor to consider in the process of uroscopy. When a patient urinates, the urine will be warm, so it is necessary for it to stay warm for proper evaluation. The external temperature should be the same as the internal temperature. When the temperature of urine goes down the bubbles in it will change. Some of them will disappear, but some will remain. With the temperature decrease particles and impurities will be more difficult to evaluate. They will move toward the middle of the flask, then sink to the bottom. They will all mix, making it more difficult to see the impurities.

Another problem with urine cooling is that it would become thicker. The longer that it had to cool down the more likely it was that the crystals in the it would bond together, causing it to thicken. This could lead to a false diagnosis, that is why doctors usually inspected the urine quickly.

[[Richard Bright (physician)|Richard Bright]] in the 19th century A.D. invented a technique that allowed doctors to examine a patients urine effectively after the temperature had dropped. The process involved heating water, then inserting the uroscopy flask containing cooled urine. This would heat the urine causing the crystals that formed during loss of temperature to break down. As a result, the urine will become thin again. This process is very effective, but a doctor should “also be careful not to shake them much before you inspect them for you will move the particles and destroy the bubbles and dilute the deposits and confuse the situation,” (The Late [[Greco-Roman]] and Byzantine Contribution to the Evolution of Laboratory Examinations of Bodily Excrement. Part1: Urine, Sperm, Menses and Stools, Pavlos C. Goudas).

===Lighting When Testing===
Since identifying the color of the urine is essential for a proper diagnosis, the lighting is crucial. This is a very complicated step in the uroscopy test. The doctor must not visually examine the urine in an overly lit location, because it will make the urine seem too bright. He can not examine the urine in a poorly lit location, because he will not be able to properly see the urine. So, he must examine the urine in both conditions. This is done to offset the effects of not enough light and too much light. After he examines in both conditions the doctor must use his best judgment, to make a diagnosis.

==Common Diseases Found==

===Diabetes mellitus===
Disease in which the [[pancreas]] does not function properly. Victims of this disease will have high glucose [[blood sugar]]. Victims may suffer from: [[cardiovascular disease]] (doubled risk), [[chronic kidney disease]] (it is the main cause for dialysis in developed world adults), retinal damage which can lead to blindness and is the most significant cause of adult blindness in the non-elderly in the developed world, nerve damage, [[erectile dysfunction]], to gangrene with risk of amputation of toes, feet, and even legs.

Doctors would test by tasting the urine.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} A sweet taste meant the patient had diabetes.

===Jaundice===
Yellowish discoloration of the whites of the eyes, skin, and [[mucous membrane]]s caused by deposition of [[Bile|bilirubine]] in these tissues. It occurs as a symptom of various diseases, such as hepatitis, that affect the processing of bile. Also called icterus. 
	
Doctors would test by using their vision. If the urine had a brownish tint then the patient would most likely have jaundice.

===Kidney Disease===
The kidneys are supposed to filter excesses (especially urea) from the blood and excrete them, along with water, as urine. When they are not performing this task the patient is suffering from [[Nephrology|kidney disease]]. The medical field that studies the kidneys and diseases affecting the kidney is called nephrology, from the Ancient Greek name for kidney.
	
Doctors would test urine using a visual examination. If the urine was red and/or foamy the patient was suffering from kidney disease.

===Tumors of urinary tract===
When a patient develops an uncontrolled, abnormal, circumscribed growth of cells in the urinary tract.

Doctors would test urine by using a visual examination. If the urine had blood in it the patient was suffering from tumors in the urinary tract.

==Importance of uroscopy==
Uroscopy was important to the Roman and Byzantine eras, because it allowed doctors to diagnose patients without technology. This was an era in which there was no microscope, stethoscope, or even thermometers. All that was needed was a uroscopy wheel, uroscopy flask, and an experienced doctor to be able to give a diagnosis. It was a very simple procedure that a doctor could determine a patients problem by simply tasting and/or looking at their urine.

Uroscopy was also necessary, because the [[Hippocratic Oath]] did not allow doctors to perform any type of [[surgery]]. It stated “I will not cut for stone, even for patients in whom the disease is manifest . . .” (Hippocratic Oath). Doctors needed a different way to find out the problems with their patients. That is when the uroscopy test became involved. It followed the Hippocratic Oath and was a very effective test for that particular time period.

Uromancy is a form of [[divination]] whose origins begun with ''uroscopy''.  It is performed by reading the bubbles in [[urine]] that form when urinating in a pot. In uromancy, it is said that the examination of urine does not only give indications of a person's health, but also foretells the future.

[[File:International Association for World Englishes.jpg|thumb|380px|alt=International Association for World Englishes|International Association for World Englishes]]

'''World Englishes''' is a term for emerging localized or [[Indigenous language|indigenized]] varieties of English, especially varieties that have developed in territories influenced by the United Kingdom or the United States. The study of World Englishes consists of identifying varieties of English used in diverse sociolinguistic contexts globally and analyzing how sociolinguistic histories, multicultural backgrounds and contexts of function influence the use of English in different regions of the world.

The issue of World Englishes was first raised in 1978 to examine concepts of regional Englishes globally. Pragmatic factors such as appropriateness, comprehensibility and interpretability justified the use of English as an international and intra-national language. In 1988, at a [[TESOL Inc.|Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)]] conference in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]], the International Committee of the Study of World Englishes (ICWE) was formed. In 1992, the ICWE formally launched the International Association for World Englishes (IAWE) at a conference of "World Englishes Today", at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]], USA.&lt;ref name="web"&gt;International Association of World Englishes [http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214100854/http://www.iaweworks.org/history.php# |date=2010-12-14 }}, Retrieved on 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There is now an academic journal devoted to the study of this topic, titled ''World Englishes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467971x|title=World Englishes - Wiley Online Library|website=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there are approximately 75 territories where English is spoken either as a [[first language]] (L1) or as an unofficial or institutionalized [[second language]] (L2) in fields such as government, law and education. It is difficult to establish the total number of Englishes in the world, as new varieties of English are constantly being developed and discovered.&lt;ref name="Crystal"&gt;Crystal, D. (2007). ''English as a Global Language.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==World English vs. World Englishes vs. Global Englishes==
The notions of [[International English|World English]] and World Englishes are far from similar, although the terms are often mistakenly {{Citation needed|reason=How does one know this isn't just some arbitrary distinction just on Wikipedia?|date=December 2014}} used interchangeably. ''World English'' refers to the English language as a [[lingua franca]] used in business, trade, diplomacy and other spheres of global activity, while ''World Englishes'' refers to the different varieties of English and [[English-based creole languages|English-based creoles]] developed in different regions of the world. Alternatively, the term ''Global Englishes'' has been used by scholars in the field to emphasise the more recent spread of English due to [[globalization]], which has resulted in increased usage of [[English as a lingua franca]].&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, N. &amp; Rose, H. (2015). ''Introducing Global Englishes.'' Arbingdon, UK: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paradowski|first=Michał B.|title=Barbara Seidlhofer: Understanding English as a Lingua Franca: A Complete Introduction to the Theoretical Nature and Practical Implications of English used as a Lingua Franca (Review article)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3318842|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==

===History of English===
{{Main|History of the English language}}

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that originated from the [[Anglo-Frisian]] [[dialect]]s brought by [[Germanic tribes|Germanic invaders]] into [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Initially, [[Old English]] was a diverse group of dialects, reflecting the varied origins of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdoms of England. Eventually, one of these dialects, [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|Late West Saxon]], came to dominate.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;Baugh, A. C. and Cable. T. (1993). ''A History of the English Language''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original [[Old English language]] was then influenced by two further waves of invasion: the first by speakers of the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian branch]] of the Germanic language family, who conquered and colonized parts of Britain in the 8th and 9th centuries; the second by the [[Norman conquest of England|Normans in the 11th century]], who spoke [[Old Norman]] and ultimately developed a Norman variety called [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. For two centuries after the Norman Conquest, [[French language|French]] became the language of everyday life among the upper classes in England. Although the language of the masses remained English, the [[bilingual]] character of England in this period was thus formed.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Middle English]] period, France and England experienced a process of separation. This period of conflicting interests and feelings of resentment was later termed the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the beginning of the 14th century, English had regained universal use and become the principal tongue of all England, but not without having undergone significant change.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], patriotic feelings regarding English brought about the recognition of English as the national language of England. The language was advocated as acceptable for learned and literary use. With the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the language in this period matured to a standard and differed significantly from the [[Middle English]] period, becoming recognizably "[[Early Modern English|modern]]".&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, R. (2002). "How much shifting actually occurred in the historical English vowel shift?", Minkova, Donka; Stockwell, Robert. ''Studies in the History of the English Language: A Millennial Perspective''. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Modern English|18th century]], three main forces were driving the direction of the English language: (1) to reduce the language to rule and effect a standard of correct usage; (2) to refine the language by removing supposed defects and introducing certain improvements; and (3) to fix English permanently in the desired form. This desire for system and regularity in the language contrasted with the individualism and spirit of independence characterized by the previous age.&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

By the 19th century, the expansion of the [[British Empire]], as well as global trade, had led to the spread of English around the world. The rising importance of some of England's larger colonies and former colonies, such as the rapidly developing United States, enhanced the value of the English varieties spoken in these regions, encouraging the belief, among the local populations, that their distinct varieties of English should be granted equal standing with the standard of [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="intro" /&gt;

===Global spread of English===
;The First dispersal: English is transported to the 'new world'
The first [[diaspora]] involved relatively large-scale [[Human migration|migrations]] of mother-tongue English speakers from [[England]], Scotland and Ireland predominantly to [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]], Australia, [[South Africa]] and New Zealand. Over time, their own English dialects developed into modern American, Canadian, West Indian, South African, Australian, and [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] Englishes. In contrast to the [[British English|English of Great Britain]], the varieties spoken in modern North America and Caribbean, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand have been modified in response to the changed and changing sociolinguistic contexts of the migrants, for example being in contact with indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], [[Khoisan]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]], [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] or [[Māori people|Maori]] populations in the colonies.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins"&gt;[[Jenkins, Jennifer]]. (2003). ''World Englishes: A Resource Book for Students.'' London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

;The Second dispersal: English is transported to Asia and Africa
The second [[diaspora]] was the result of the colonization of Asia and Africa, which led to the development of '[[New Englishes]]', the second-language varieties of English. In [[colonial Africa]], the history of English is distinct between West and East Africa. English in [[West Africa]] began with trade. particularly the [[slave trade]]. English soon gained official status in what are today [[Gambia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]], and some of the [[pidgin]] and [[creole language|creoles]] which developed from English contact, including [[Krio language|Krio]] (Sierra Leone) and [[Cameroon Pidgin]], have large numbers of speakers now.

As for [[East Africa]], extensive British settlements were established in what are now [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where English became a crucial language of the government, education and the law. From the early 1960s, the six countries achieved independence in succession; but English remained the official language and had large numbers of second language speakers in Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi (along with [[Chewa language|Chewa]]).

English was formally introduced to the sub-continent of [[South Asia]] (India, [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]]) during the second half of the eighteenth century. In India, English was given status through the implementation of Macaulay 'Minute' of 1835, which proposed the introduction of an English educational system in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frances Pritchett |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00generallinks/macaulay/txt_minute_education_1835.html |title=Minute on Education (1835) by Thomas Babington Macaulay |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the process of '[[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]]' led to the development of a distinctive national character of English in the Indian sub-continent.

British influence in [[South-East Asia]] and the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] began in the late eighteenth century, involving primarily the territories now known as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Hong Kong]]. [[Papua New Guinea]], also a [[British protectorate]], exemplified the English-based [[pidgin]] - [[Tok Pisin]].

The Americans came late in [[South-East Asia]] but their influence spread like wildfire as their reforms on education in the [[Philippines]] progressed in their less than half a century colonization of the islands. English has been taught since the American period and is one of the official languages of the Philippines. Ever since English became the official language, a localized variety gradually emerged - [[Philippine English]]. Lately, linguist Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wilkinson_Daniel_Wong_Gonzales?ev=hdr_xprf&amp;_sg=mCNszti2YtJXBcgvTb_FFtSXL3-s4zdYcFDgMf1MYf5IPlslU5e-unjgtlDoLAPc|title=Wilkinson Daniel Wong Gonzales {{!}} Master of Arts, English Language and Linguistics {{!}} National University of Singapore, Singapore {{!}} NUS {{!}} Department of English Language &amp; Literature {{!}} ResearchGate|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that this variety has in itself more varieties, suggesting that we move towards [[Philippine Englishes]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307896694|title=a to A��o Social Salesiana em rede... {{!}} Browse publications|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; paradigm to progress further in Schneider's dynamic model after gathering evidences of such happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Villanueva|first=Rey John Castro|title=The Features of Philippine English across Regions|date=2016|url=http://lynchlibrary.pssc.org.ph/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=2750&amp;shelfbrowse_itemnumber=6284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, English is also learnt in other countries in neighbouring areas, most notably in [[Taiwan]], Japan and [[Korea]], with the latter two having begun to consider the possibility of making English their official second language.&lt;ref name="Jenkins" /&gt;

==Classification of Englishes==
The spread of English around the world is often discussed in terms of three distinct groups of users, where English is used respectively as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jenkins|first1=Jennifer|title=World englishes : a resource book for studens|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-25806-7|pages=14–15|edition=1. edition, 3. reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# a [[native language]] (ENL); the [[primary language]] of the majority population of a country, such as in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.
# a [[second language]] (ESL); an additional language for ''intra''national as well as ''inter''national communication in communities that are [[multilingual]], such as in India, [[Nigeria]], and [[Singapore]]. Most of these Englishes developed as a result of imperial expansion that brought the language to various parts of the world.
# a [[foreign language]] (EFL); used almost exclusively for international communication, such as in Japan.

===Kachru's Three Circles of English===
[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.jpg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English''.]] The most influential model of the spread of English is [[Braj Kachru]]'s model of World Englishes. In this model the diffusion of English is captured in terms of three Concentric Circles of the language: The Inner Circle, the Outer Circle, and the Expanding Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). ''The Other Tongue: English across cultures''. University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Inner Circle''''' refers to English as it originally took shape and was spread across the world in the first [[diaspora]]. In this transplantation of English, speakers from England carried the language to Australia, New Zealand and North America. The Inner Circle thus represents the traditional historical and sociolinguistic bases of English in regions where it is now used as a primary language: the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, anglophone Canada and [[South Africa]], and some of the [[Caribbean]] territories. English is the [[native language]] or [[mother tongue]] of most people in these countries. The total number of English speakers in the inner circle is as high as 380 million, of whom some 120 million are outside the United States.

The '''''Outer Circle''''' of English was produced by the second [[diaspora]] of English, which spread the language through imperial expansion by [[Great Britain]] in [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. In these regions, English is not the native tongue, but serves as a useful [[lingua franca]] between [[ethnic]] and language groups. Higher education, the [[legislature]] and [[judiciary]], national commerce and so on may all be carried out predominantly in English. This circle includes [[India]], [[Nigeria]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], [[Malaysia]], [[Tanzania]], [[Kenya]], non-Anglophone [[South Africa]], the [[Philippines]] (colonized by the US) and others. The total number of English speakers in the outer circle is estimated to range from 150 million to 300 million.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, Y. (2006). ''World Englishes in Asian Contexts''. (Larry E. Smith Eds.) Hong Kong: Hong Kong University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], while in the Outer Circle, may be drifting into the Inner Circle as English becomes more often used as a home language (see [[Languages of Singapore]]), much as Ireland did earlier. Countries where most people speak an [[English-based creole]] and retain standard English for official purposes, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], are also in the Outer Circle.

Finally, the '''''Expanding Circle''''' encompasses countries where English plays no historical or governmental role, but where it is nevertheless widely used as a medium of international communication. This includes much of the rest of the world's population not categorized above, including territories such as China, Russia, Japan, non-Anglophone [[Europe]] (especially the [[Netherlands]] and [[Nordic countries]]), [[South Korea]], [[Egypt]] and [[Indonesia]]. The total in this expanding circle is the most difficult to estimate, especially because English may be employed for specific, limited purposes, usually in a business context. The estimates of these users range from 100 million to one billion.

The inner circle (UK, US etc.) is 'norm-providing'; that means that English language [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] are developed in these countries. The outer circle (mainly [[Commonwealth countries|New Commonwealth countries]]) is 'norm-developing'. The expanding circle (which includes much of the rest of the world) is 'norm-dependent', because it relies on the standards set by [[native speakers]] in the inner circle.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. (1992). World Englishes: approaches, issues and resources. ''Language Teaching'', 25: 1-14. Cambridge UP''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schneider's Dynamic Model of Postcolonial Englishes===
{{Main|Schneider's Dynamic Model}}
Edgar Werner Schneider tries to avoid a purely geographical and historical approach evident in the 'circles' models and incorporates [[sociolinguistic|sociolinguistic concepts]] pertaining to acts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name="y2"&gt;Le Page, R. B. and Tabouret-Keller, A. (1985). ''Acts of identity: Creole-based approaches to language and ethnicity''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
He outlines five characteristic stages in the spread of English:

'''''Phase 1 - Foundation''''': This is the initial stage of the introduction of English to a new territory over an extended period of time. Two linguistic processes are operative at this stage: (a) [[language contact]] between English and [[indigenous language]]s; (b) contact between different [[dialects of English]] of the settlers which eventually results in a new stable [[dialect]] (see [[Koiné language|koiné]]). At this stage, [[bilingualism]] is marginal. A few members of the local populace may play an important role as interpreters, translators and guides. Borrowings are limited to lexical items; with local place names and terms for local fauna and flora being adopted by the English.&lt;ref name="y5"&gt;Schneider, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the world''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 2 - Exonormative stabilization''''': At this stage, the settler communities tend to stabilize politically under British rule. English increases in prominence and though the [[colloquial]] English is a colonial [[Koiné language|koiné]], the speakers look to England for their formal norms. Local vocabulary continues to be adopted. Bilingualism increases amongst the [[indigenous population]] through education and increased contacts with English settlers. Knowledge of English becomes an asset, and a new indigenous [[elite]] develops.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 3 - Nativisation''''': According to Schneider, this is the stage at which a transition occurs as the English settler population starts to accept a new [[identity (social science)|identity]] based on present and local realities, rather than sole allegiance to their 'mother country'. By this time, the indigenous strand has also stabilized an [[Second language|L2]] system that is a synthesis of substrate effects, interlanguage processes and features adopted from the settlers' [[Koiné language|koiné]] English. [[Neologisms]] stabilize as English is made to adapt to local sociopolitical and cultural practices.&lt;ref name="y5" /&gt;

'''''Phase 4 - Endonormative stabilization''''': This stage is characterized by the gradual acceptance of local [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], supported by a new locally rooted linguistic self-confidence. By this time political events have made it clear that the settler and indigenous strands are inextricably bound in a sense of [[nation]]hood independent of Britain. Acceptance of local English(es) expresses this new [[identity (social science)|identity]]. National dictionaries are enthusiastically supported, at least for new [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] (and not always for localized grammar). [[Literary genre|Literary creativity]] in local English begins to flourish.&lt;ref name="y1"&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend and Bhatt, Rakesh M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of New Linguistic Varieties''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Phase 5 - Differentiation''''': At this stage there is a change in the dynamics of [[identity (social science)|identity]] as the young nation sees itself as less defined by its differences from the [[British Empire|former colonial power]] as a composite of subgroups defined on regional, social and ethnic lines. Coupled with the simple effects of time in effecting [[language change]] (with the aid of [[social differentiation]]) the new English [[Koiné language|koiné]] starts to show greater differentiation.&lt;ref name="y1" /&gt;

===Other models of classification===
====Strevens's world map of English====
The oldest map of the spread of English is Strevens's world map of English.  His world map, even predating that of Kachru's three circles, showed that since American English became a separate variety from British English, all subsequent Englishes have had affinities with either one or the other.&lt;ref name="y3"&gt;Strevens, P. (1980). ''Teaching English as an International Language''. Oxford: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====McArthur's circle of World English====
McArthur's "wheel model" has an idealized central variety called "World Standard English," which is best represented by "written international English." The next circle is made of regional standards or standards that are emerging. Finally, the outer layer consists of localized varieties which may have similarities with the regional standards or emerging standards.

Although the model is neat, it raises several problems. Firstly, the three different types of English&amp;nbsp;— ENL, [[ESL]] and [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]], are conflated in the second circle. Secondly, the multitude of Englishes in Europe are also missing in this layer. Finally, the outside layer includes [[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and [[Second language|L2]] Englishes. Most scholars would argue that [[Pidgin English|English pidgins]] and [[English creoles|creoles]] do not belong to one family: rather they have overlapping multiple memberships.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, A. (1987). "The English Languages?" ''English Today'': 11:9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Görlach's circle model of English====
Manfred Görlach's and McArthur's models are reasonably similar. Both exclude English varieties in Europe. As Görlach does not include [[English as a foreign or second language|EFL]]s at all, his model is more consistent, though less comprehensive. Outside the circle are mixed varieties ([[pidgins]], [[creole language|creoles]] and mixed languages involving English), which are better categorized as having partial membership.&lt;ref&gt;Görlach, M. (1990).''Studies in the History of the English Language''. Heidelberg: Carl Winter.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modiano's model of English====
In Modiano's model of English, the center consists of users of English as an International Language, with a core set of features which are comprehensible to the majority of native and competent [[non-native speakers]] of English. The second circle consists of features which may become internationally common or may fall into obscurity. Finally, the outer area consists of five groups ([[American English]], [[British English]], other major varieties, local varieties, foreign varieties) each with features peculiar to their own speech community and which are unlikely to be understood by most members of the other four groups.&lt;ref&gt;Modiano, M. (1999). "Standard English(es) and educational practices for the world's lingua franca". ''English Today'': 15/4: 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations and varieties==
 {{main|List of dialects of the English language}}

The World Englishes paradigm is not static, and neither are rapidly changing realities of language use worldwide. The use of English in the Outer and Expanding Circle societies (refer to '''Kachru's Three Circles of English''') continues its rapid spread, while at the same time new patterns of [[language contact]] and variety differentiation emerge. The different varieties range from English in the Inner circle societies such as the United States, Canada, [[South Africa]], Australia and New Zealand, to the Outer circle post-colonial societies of [[Asia]] and [[Africa]].
The World Englishes initiative, in recognizing and describing the New Englishes of the [[Caribbean English|Caribbean]], [[African English|Africa]] and [[Asia]], has been partly motivated by a consideration of the local linguistic factors and partly by a consideration of the wider [[cultural]] and [[political]] contexts of [[language acquisition]] and use. This, in turn, has involved the creative rewriting of discourses towards a recognition of [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]] and multiple possibilities for scholarship. The notion of varieties in this context is similarly dynamic, as new contexts, new realities, new discourses, and new varieties continue to emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Kachru, B. B., Kachru, Y. and Nelson, C. (2009). ''The Handbook of World Englishes''. Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''[[language]]'' and ''[[dialect]]'' are not easily defined concepts. It is often suggested that languages are [[Autonomous language|autonomous]], while dialects are [[Heteronomous language|heteronomous]]. It is also said that dialects, in contrast with languages, are mutually intelligible, though this is not always the case. Dialects are characteristically spoken, do not have a codified form and are used only in certain domains.&lt;ref name ="Melchers"&gt;Melchers, G. and Shaw, P. (2003) World Englishes. ''The English Language Series''. Department of English, Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to avoid the difficult dialect-language distinction, linguists tend to prefer a more neutral term, ''variety'', which covers both concepts and is not clouded by popular usage. This term is generally used when discussing World Englishes.

==The future of World Englishes==
Two scenarios have been advanced about English's future status as the major [[world language]]: it  will ultimately fragment into a large number of [[mutually unintelligible]] varieties (in effect, [[languages]]), or it will converge so that differences across groups of speakers are largely eliminated.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

===English as the language of 'others'===
If English is, numerically speaking, the language of 'others', then the center of gravity of the language is almost certain to shift in the direction of the 'others'. In the words of [[Henry Widdowson|Widdowson]], there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread:&lt;ref&gt;Widdowson, H. G. (1997). "EIL, ESL, EFL: Global Issues and Local Interests". ''World Englishes'', 16: 135–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When we talk about the spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.}}

In this new paradigm, English spreads and adapts according to the linguistic and cultural preferences of its users in the Outer and Expanding circles (refer to Kachru's Three Circles of English). However, if English is genuinely to become the language of 'others', then the 'others' have to be accorded&amp;nbsp;– or perhaps more likely, accord themselves&amp;nbsp;– at least the same English language rights as those claimed by mother-tongue speakers.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paradowski, M.B. 2008, Apr. Winds of change in the English language&amp;nbsp;– Air of peril for native speakers? Novitas-ROYAL (Research on Youth and Language) 2(1), 92–119. http://www.novitasroyal.org/paradowski.pdf However, it remains to be seen whether such a [[paradigm shift]] will take place.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A different world language===
The other potential shift in the linguistic center of gravity is that English could lose its [[International English|international role]] altogether, or come to share it with a number of equals. Although this would not happen mainly as a result of native-speaker resistance to the spread of non-native speaker Englishes and the consequent abandoning of English by large numbers of non-native speakers, the latter could play a part.&lt;ref name ="Jenkins" /&gt;

As evidence that English may eventually give way to another language (or languages) as the world's [[lingua franca]], [[David Crystal]] cites [[Internet]] data:&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, D. (2001) Language and the Internet. Cambridge UP.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|When the internet started it was of course 100 percent English because of where it came from, but since the 1980s that status has started to fall away. By 1995, it was down to about 80 per cent present of English on the internet, and the current figures for 2001 are that it is hovering somewhere between 60 percent and 70 percent, with a significant drop likely over the next four or five years.}}
On the other hand, there are at least 1500 languages present on the internet now and that figure is likely to increase.  Nevertheless, Crystal predicts that English will retain its dominant presence.
