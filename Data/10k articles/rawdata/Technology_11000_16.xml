[[File:George malins z aeroskopem St Eloi.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Geoffrey Malins]] with aeroscope camera during [[World War I]]]]
'''Aeroscope''' was a type of [[compressed air]] camera for making films, constructed by [[Poles|Polish]] inventor [[Kazimierz Pr√≥szy≈Ñski]] in 1909 (French patent from April 10, 1909) and built in England since 1911,&lt;ref name="pros"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/proszynski.htm | publisher=Victorian Cinema | title=Kazimierz Proszynski, Polish inventor | accessdate=2007-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; at first by [[Newman &amp; Sinclair]],&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/newman.htm | publisher=Victorian Cinema | title=Arthur Samuel Newman, British camera manufacturer | accessdate=2007-01-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070112181926/http://victorian-cinema.net/newman.htm| archivedate= 12 January 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1912 by Cherry Kearton Limited.

==Background==
Patented in England in 1910 by the [[Poles|Polish]] inventor [[Kazimierz Pr√≥szy≈Ñski]],&lt;ref name="pros" /&gt; Aeroscope was the first successful hand-held operated film camera. It has been powered by [[Pneumatics|compressed air]] pumped before filming into the camera with a simple hand pump, similar to the one we still use to [[Bicycle pump|pump bicycle tires]]. Filming with Aeroscope, a cameraman did not have to turn the crank to advance the material filming, as in all cameras of that time, so he could operate the camera with both hands, holding the camera and controlling the focus. This made it possible to film with the Aeroscope hand-held in most difficult circumstances, as well as made possible to film [[Aerial photography|from the airplanes]], also for the military purposes. Camera carried {{convert|400|ft|m}} of [[35 mm film|35mm film]] and, once pressurised, could work with no further pumping for up to 10 minutes. The Aeroscope was known for its simplicity and reliability.&lt;ref name="pros" /&gt;

==Popularity==
Hundreds of light and relatively compact Aeroscope cameras were used by the [[British War Office]] for the combat cameramen on the battlefields of [[World War I]], and by all [[newsreel]] cameramen all over world, until the late 1920s. Aeroscope has been used among others by [[Geoffrey Malins|Arthur Herbert Malins]] recognized by Kelly (1997, Page 60) as ‚Äúthe most famous of the war cinematographers‚Äù who used it at the battle of the Somme. As several of the cameramen died filming from the firing lines Aeroscope got a name of ''camera of death''.

In 1928 [[Kazimierz Pr√≥szy≈Ñski|Pr√≥szy≈Ñski]] built an improved version of his camera, with an air pressure meter, but the more practical spring cameras like [[Eyemo]] and later [[Bolex]] took over. However, even by the beginning of [[World War II]], some of the improved Aeroscope cameras were in use by the British combat cameramen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41764">'''Ancient Egyptian technology''' describes devices and technologies invented or used in [[Ancient Egypt]]. The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many [[simple machines]], such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] and the [[lever]], to aid construction processes. They used [[rope]] [[truss]]es to stiffen the [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of ships. Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[ancient Egyptian pottery|pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the [[Mediterranean]] basin. The [[wheel]] was used for a number of purposes, but [[chariots]] only came into use after the [[Second Intermediate period]]. The Egyptians also played an important role in developing Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including [[ship]]s and [[lighthouse]]s. 
[[File:Ancient Egypt rope manufacture.jpg|thumb|222px|right|Ancient Egyptian depiction of women engaged in mechanical [[rope]] making, the first graphic evidence of the craft, shown in the two lower rows of the illustration]]

==Technology in Dynastic Egypt==
Significant advances in [[ancient Egypt]] during the [[History of ancient Egypt|dynastic period]] include [[astronomy]], [[Egyptian mathematics|mathematics]], and [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|medicine]]. Their [[geometry]] was a necessary outgrowth of [[surveying]] to preserve the layout and ownership of farmland, which was flooded annually by the [[Nile river]]. The 3,4,5 [[right triangle]] and other rules of thumb served to represent rectilinear structures, and the post and lintel architecture of Egypt. Egypt also was a center of [[Alchemy#Alchemy in Ancient Egypt|alchemy]] research for much of the western world.

===Paper and writing===
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|222px|A section of the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]], which is written and drawn on papyrus]]
The word ''paper'' comes from the Greek term for the ancient [[Egypt]]ian [[writing material]] called [[papyrus]], which was formed from beaten strips of [[Cyperus papyrus|papyrus plants]]. Papyrus was produced in Egypt as early as 3000&amp;nbsp;BC, and was sold to ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. The establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] limited the supply of papyrus for others. According to the Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] records, xiii.21), as a result of this, [[parchment]] was invented under the patronage of [[Eumenes II of Pergamon]] to build his rival library at [[Pergamon]]. However, this is a myth; [[parchment]] had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.

[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], a [[phonetic]] [[writing system]], served as the basis for the [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which later alphabets, such as Hebrew, Greek and Latin were derived. With this ability, writing and record keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the ‚Äîif not ''the''‚Äî first [[Decimal|decimal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers. Page 162 (cf., "''As we have seen, Sumer used a sexagesimal base; whereas the system of Ancient Egypt was strictly decimal.''")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert E Krebs, 
Groundbreaking scientific experiments, inventions, and discoveries of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Page 127. {{ISBN|0-313-32433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Little Heath, Manual of Greek Mathematics. Page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Alexandria]] retained preeminence for its records and scrolls with its [[Library of Alexandria|library]]. This ancient library was damaged by fire when it fell under Roman rule,&lt;ref name="Plutarch"&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Caesar'' 49.3.&lt;/ref&gt; and was destroyed completely by 642&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]] (1203): "the library which [[Amr ibn al-A'as|'Amr ibn al-'As]] burnt with the permission of '[[Umar]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Europe: A History'', p 139. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1996. {{ISBN|0-19-820171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; With it, a vast supply of antique literature, history, and knowledge was lost.

===Structures and construction===

====Tools====
Some of the older tools used in the construction of Egyptian housing included reeds and clay. According to Lucas and Harris, ‚Äúreeds were plastered with clay in order to keep out of heat and cold more effectually‚Äù. &lt;ref&gt;A. Lucas and J. Harris, "Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries" (New York: Courier Corporation, 2012), 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Other tools that were used were "limestone, chiseled stones, wooden mallets, and stone hammers". &lt;ref&gt;A. Lucas and J. Harris, "Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries" (New York: Courier Corporation, 2012), 64.&lt;/ref&gt; With these tools, ancient Egyptians were able to create more than just housing, but also sculptures of their gods, goddesses, pyramids, etc.

====Buildings====
Many [[Egyptian temple|temple]]s from Ancient Egypt are  not standing today. Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, [[Hatshepsut]], were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh [[Tutankamun]]'s rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewellery and antiques. In some late myths, [[Ptah]] was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. [[Imhotep]], who was included in the [[Egyptian pantheon]], was the first documented engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |title=What is Civil Engineering: Imhotep |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112195627/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] on the island of Pharos.]]
In [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], [[lighthouse]] technology was developed, the most famous example being the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247&amp;nbsp;BC) on the island of Pharos in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.

====Monuments====
{{main|Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}
The Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential [[civilization]]s in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the [[pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx]]‚Äîamong the largest and most famous buildings in the world.

[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|222px|thumb|Giza Plateau, Cairo. Khafre's pyramid in the background]]
The most famous [[pyramid]]s are the [[Egyptian pyramids]]‚Äîhuge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as [[tomb]]s for [[pharaoh]]s. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally "place of ascendance." The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over {{convert|13|acre|m2}} in area. It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.

The [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of [[Egyptian pyramids]]. [[Menkaure's Pyramid]], likely dating to the same era, was constructed of [[limestone]] and granite blocks. The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (c. [[26th century BC|2580 BC]]) contains a huge granite [[sarcophagus]] fashioned of "Red [[Aswan]] Granite." The mostly ruined [[Black Pyramid]] dating from the reign of [[Amenemhat III]] once had a polished granite [[pyramidion]] or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] (see [[Dahshur]]). Other uses in [[Ancient Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Mosques/CAIRO_Rocks_1.htm eeescience utoledo.edu : Cairo Rocks]&lt;/ref&gt; include [[column]]s, door [[lintel]]s, [[Sill plate|sill]]s, [[jamb]]s, and wall and floor [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]].

The ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in [[Sakkara]]). How the [[Egyptians]] worked the solid [[granite]] is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist [[Patrick Hunt (archeologist)|Patrick Hunt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm Arce/Nc Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031747/http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has postulated that the Egyptians used [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] shown to have higher [[Hardenability|hardness]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the [[lever]] moved and uplifted [[obelisk]]s weighing more than 100 [[Tonne|tons]].

====Obelisks and pillars====
[[Obelisk]]s were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica wrote, "The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of [[Senusret I]] of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68&amp;nbsp;feet high)". The word "obelisk" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ''unfinished obelisk'' being built by [[Hatshepsut]] to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity [[Ra]] and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the [[sun]] (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patricia Blackwell Gary |author2=Richard Talcott |title=Stargazing in Ancient Egypt |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |pages=62‚Äì7 |date=June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used [[Column|pillar]]s extensively.

It is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had [[kite]]s, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html Caltech researchers successfully raised an obelisk with a kite to test theory about ancient pyramids]&lt;/ref&gt; Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently led a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9&amp;nbsp;mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA).

===Navigation and ship building===
The Ancient Egyptians had knowledge to some extent of [[sail]] construction. This is governed by the [[science]] of [[aerodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;A primary feature of a properly designed sail is an amount of "[[draft (sailing)|draft]]", caused by curvature of the surface of the sail. When the sail is oriented into the wind, this curvature induces lift, much like the wing of an airplane.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest Egyptian sails were simply placed to catch the wind and push a vessel.&lt;ref name="SportsStudies"&gt;Encyclopedia Of International Sports Studies. Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; Later Egyptian sails dating to 2400 BCE were built with the recognition that ships could sail [[close-hauled|against the wind]] using the [[forces on sails|lift of the sails]].&lt;ref name="SportsStudies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Technological Choices: Transformation in Material Cultures. Page 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Queen [[Hatshepsut]] oversaw the preparations and funding of an expedition of five ships, each measuring seventy feet long, and ''with several sails''.{{dubious - discuss|date=July 2017}}{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Various others exist, also.

Although quarter rudders were the norm in Nile navigation, the Egyptians were the first to use also stern-mounted rudders (not of the modern type but center mounted steering oars).

===Irrigation and agriculture===
Irrigation as the artificial application of water to the soil was used to some extent in Ancient Egypt, a [[hydraulic civilization]] (which entails [[hydraulic engineering]]).&lt;ref&gt;Blake L. White, [http://www.strategic-tech.org/images/Egyptian_Engineering_and_Culture.pdf Ancient Egypt Provides an Early Example of How A Society's Worldview Drives Engineering and the Development of Science]. Strategic Technology Institute. Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In crop production it is mainly used to replace missing rainfall in periods of drought, as opposed to reliance on direct rainfall (referred to as dryland farming or as rainfed farming). Before technology advanced, the people of Egypt relied on the natural flow of the Nile River to tend to the crops. Although the Nile provided sufficient watering survival domesticated animals, crops, and the people of Egypt, there were times where the Nile would flood the area wreaking havoc amongst the land. &lt;ref&gt;JG Manning, "Water, Irrigation, and Their Connection to State Power in Egypt" (Econ Yale 2012), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Amenemhet III]] in the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|twelfth dynasty]] (about 1800 [[Common era|BCE]]) using the natural lake of the [[Al Fayyum|Fay√ªm]] as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons, as the lake swelled annually with the [[flooding of the Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Glassworking===
The earliest known [[glass]] beads from [[Egypt]] were made during the [[New Kingdom]] around 1500&amp;nbsp;BC and were produced in a variety of colors. They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The [[Egyptians]] made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like [[iron]] and the more modern [[crucible steel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html#Origin%20Myth| title = Glassmaking in Antiquity| accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Susan Hampton| publisher = The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113459/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
{{main|Egyptian calendar|Archaeoastronomy}}
The Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy&lt;ref&gt;Ronald A Wells, "Archaeoastronomy in Egypt", in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p.28&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.&lt;ref&gt;John Britton and Christopher Walker, Astrology and Astronomy in Mesopotamia, in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of [[Sirius]] in its [[heliacal rising]] after its annual absence of about 70 days.&lt;ref&gt;Tyldesley, Joyce, Pyramids: The Real Story Behind Egypt's Ancient Monuments, Viking, 2003, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

After unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E. Neugebauer | title = The Exact Sciences in Antiquity | origyear = 1957 | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-22332-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C}}, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; However, by Seti I's time day and night were normally divided into 12 hours each, the length of which would vary according to the time of year.

Key to much of this was the motion of the sun god [[Ra]] and his annual movement along the horizon at sunrise. Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] came the development of the [[Egyptian calendar]], time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of [[Ramesses VI]] shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.

During the [[Fifth Dynasty]] six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by [[Niuserre]] at [[Abu Gurab]] and [[Userkaf]] at [[Abusir]] have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

[[File:Dendera.jpg|222px|thumb|The [[Dendera Zodiac]] was on the ceiling of the Greco-Roman temple of Hathor at Dendera]]

Claims have been made that [[precession of the equinoxes]] was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] prior to the time of [[Hipparchus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Santillana |first=G. |last2=Von Dechend |first2=H. |title=Hamlet's Mill |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql7ATHGee50C |publisher=David R. Godine |isbn=9780879232153}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been disputed however on the grounds that pre-Hipparchus texts do not mention precession and that "it is only by cunning interpretation of ancient myths and images, which are ostensibly about something else, that precession can be discerned in them, aided by some pretty esoteric numerological speculation involving the 72 years that mark one degree of shift in the zodiacal system and any number of permutations by multiplication, division, and addition." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Archaeological Fantasies:How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30593-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oB7pBZ3s6dIC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;dq=precession+Egyptians#v=onepage&amp;q=precession%20Egyptians&amp;f=false|author =Paul Jordan|editor=Garrett G. Fagan|page=123|chapter=Esoteric Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.

===Medicine===
The [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of [[neuroscience]]. However, medical historians believe that ancient Egyptian pharmacology was largely ineffective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf Microsoft Word ‚Äì Proceedings-2001.doc] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a paper published by Michael D. Parkins, 72% of 260 medical prescriptions in the Hearst Papyrus had no curative elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf 10th Annual Proceedings of the History of Medicine Days] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407062556/http://www.hom.ucalgary.ca/Dayspapers2001.pdf |date=April 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael D. Parkins, sewage pharmacology first began in ancient Egypt and was continued through the Middle Ages,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; and while the use of animal dung can have curative properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0838/is_n65/ai_12694466 |title=animal dung can have curative properties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20040918170945/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0838/is_n65/ai_12694466 |archivedate=2004-09-18 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; it is not without its risk. Practices such as applying cow dung to wounds, ear piercing, tattooing, and chronic ear infections were important factors in developing tetanus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/ije/7.2.185 |vauthors=Mamtani R, Malhotra P, Gupta PS, Jain BK |title=A comparative study of urban and rural tetanus in adults |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=185‚Äì8 |date=June 1978 |pmid=681065 |url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=681065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank J. Snoek wrote that Egyptian medicine used fly specks, lizard blood, swine teeth, and other such remedies which he believes could have been harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =Frank J. Snoek |date=August 2001 |title=The Mind Matters |journal=Diabetes Spectrum |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=116‚Äì117 |doi=10.2337/diaspect.14.3.116 |url=http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/14/3/116.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mummy|Mummification]] of the dead was not always practiced in Egypt. Once the practice began, an individual was placed at a final resting place through a set of rituals and protocol. The Egyptian funeral was a complex ceremony including various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in honor of the deceased. The poor, who could not afford expensive tombs, were buried in shallow graves in the sand, and because of the arid environment they were often naturally mummified.

===The Wheel===
Evidence indicates that Egyptians made use of [[potter's wheel]]s in the manufacturing of pottery from as early as the [[4th Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Doherty |first=Sarah |date=2013 |title=The origins and the use of the potters wheel in Ancient Egypt. |type= |chapter= |publisher=Cardiff University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/45612/ |access-date=8 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chariots]], however, are only believed to have been introduced by the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] in the [[Second Intermediate period]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/egyptchariots_000.pdf Hyskos introduced chariots to ancient Egypt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629203129/http://www.historymatters.appstate.edu/documents/egyptchariots_000.pdf |date=June 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[New Kingdom|New Kingdom era]], [[Chariotry in ancient Egypt|chariotry]] became central to Egypt's [[Military of ancient Egypt#New Kingdom Armies|military]].

===Other developments===
[[File:Henry Holiday weaving and spinning in ancient Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stained glass window from c. 1914 depicting weaving and spinning in ancient Egypt]]
The Egyptians developed a variety of [[furniture]]. There in the lands of ancient Egypt is the first evidence for [[Chair|stool]]s, [[bed]]s, and [[Table (furniture)|table]]s (such as from the tombs similar to Tutenkhamen's). Recovered Ancient Egyptian furniture includes a third millennium BC bed discovered in the Tarkhan Tomb, a c.2550&amp;nbsp;BC. gilded set from the tomb of Queen [[Hetepheres I]], and a c. 1550&amp;nbsp;BC. stool from Thebes.

Some have suggested that the Egyptians had some form of understanding [[electric]] [[phenomena]] from observing [[lightning]] and interacting with [[electric fish]] (such as ''[[Malapterurus electricus]]'') or other animals (such as [[electric eel]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Karl Brugsch-Bey and Henry Danby Seymour, "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0CJl3KVQupibKmzuADNu17&amp;id=LoiTizgRo9kC A History of Egypt Under the Pharaohs]''". J. Murray, 1881. Page 422. (cf., [... the symbol of a]'' 'serpent' is rather a fish, which still serves, in the Coptic language, to designate the electric fish'' [...])&lt;/ref&gt; The comment about lightning appears to come from a misunderstanding of a text referring to "high poles covered with copper plates" to argue this&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Kolbe, Francis ed Legge, Joseph Skellon, tr., "''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=0o90G64Z2FDIyKUsLs9&amp;id=150IAAAAIAAJ An Introduction to Electricity]''". Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr√ºbner, 1908. 429 pages. Page 391. (cf., "[...] ''high poles covered with copper plates and with gilded tops were erected 'to break the stones coming from on high'.'' J. D√ºmichen, Baugeschichte des Dendera-Tempels, Strassburg, 1877")&lt;/ref&gt; but Dr. Bolko Stern has written in detail explaining why the copper covered tops of poles (which were lower than the associated pylons) do not relate to electricity or lightning, pointing out that no evidence of anything used to manipulate electricity had been found in Egypt and that this was a magical and not a technical installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Stern | first = Bolko | title = √Ñgyptische Kulturgeschichte | publisher = Reprint-Verlag-Leipzig |origyear=1896 |date=1998 | pages = 106‚Äì108 | isbn = 978-3-8262-1908-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dendera light 002.jpg|222px|thumb|The single representation of the image, called the "[[Dendera light]]" by some alternative suggestions, exists on the left wall of the right wing in one of the crypts of the [[Hathor temple]]]]

Those exploring [[fringe science|fringe theories]] of [[History of technology|ancient technology]] have suggested that there were [[Dendera light|electric lights used in Ancient Egypt]]. Engineers have constructed a working model based on their interpretation of a relief found in the [[Hathor]] temple at the Dendera Temple complex.&lt;ref name="KrassaHabeck"&gt;Krassa, P., and R. Habeck, "''Das Licht der Pharaonen.''". {{ISBN|3-548-35657-5}} (Tr. ''The Light of the Pharaohs'')&lt;/ref&gt; Authors (such as [[Peter Krassa]] and [[Reinhard Habeck]]) have produced a basic theory of the device's operation.&lt;ref name="KrassaHabeck"/&gt; The standard explanation, however, for the ''[[Dendera light]]'', which comprises three stone reliefs (one single and a double representation) is that the depicted image represents a lotus leaf and flower from which a sacred snake is spawned in accordance with Egyptian mythological beliefs. This sacred snake sometimes is identified as the Milky Way (the snake) in the night sky (the leaf, lotus, or "bulb") that became identified with Hathor because of her similar association in creation.

==Later technology in Egypt==

===Greco-Roman Egypt===
{{main|Ancient Greek technology|Roman technology}}

Under [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic rule]], Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the [[Hellenistic civilization]]. The ancient Egyptian city of [[Rhakotis]] was renovated as [[Alexandria]], which became the largest city around the [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Under [[History of Roman Egypt|Roman rule]], Egypt was one of the most prosperous regions of the [[Roman Empire]], with Alexandria being second only to [[ancient Rome]] in size.

Recent scholarship suggests that the [[water wheel]] originates from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], where it appeared by the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Wikander/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; This is seen as an evolution of the paddle-driven water-lifting wheels that had been known in Egypt a century earlier.&lt;ref name=Wikander&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=Chapter 6: Sources of Energy and Exploitation of Power|author =√ñrjan Wikander| author-link = √ñrjan Wikander|title=The Oxford Handbook of Engineering and Technology in the Classical World|editor=John Peter Oleson|editor-link=John Peter Oleson|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2008|isbn=0-19-518731-8|pages=141‚Äì2|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Peter Oleson]], both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic Noria may have been invented in Egypt by the 4th century BC, with the [[Sakia]] being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds at [[Faiyum]], [[Egypt]], where the oldest archeological evidence of a water-wheel has been found, in the form of a Sakia dating back to the 3rd century BC. A [[papyrus]] dating to the 2nd century BC also found in Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC [[fresco]] found at [[Alexandria]] depicts a compartmented Sakia, and the writings of [[Callixenus of Rhodes]] mention the use of a Sakia in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] during the reign of [[Ptolemy IV Philopator|Ptolemy IV]] in the late 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{Cite book|title=Water architecture in the lands of Syria: the water-wheels|author =Adriana de Miranda|publisher=L'Erma di Bretschneider|year=2007|isbn=88-8265-433-8|pages=38‚Äì9|postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Greek technology]] was often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. [[Ancient Roman technology]] is a set of artifacts and customs which supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years.

===Arabic-Islamic Egypt===
{{main|Inventions in medieval Islam|Muslim Agricultural Revolution|Timeline of science and engineering in the Islamic world}}

Under [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab rule]], Egypt once again became one of the most prosperous regions around the Mediterranean. The Egyptian city of [[Cairo]] was founded by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] and served as its capital city. At the time, Cairo was second only to [[Baghdad]], capital of the rival [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. After the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|fall of Baghdad]], however, Cairo overtook it as the largest city in the Mediterranean region until the [[early modern period]].

[[File:Australasian Photographic Review of Reviews.jpg|thumb|First page of the ''Australasian Photographic Review of Reviews'', later the ''Australasian Photographic Review'', later the ''Australasian Photo-Review''.]]
The '''''Australasian Photo-Review''''' was an English language [[magazine]], published for photographers by Baker &amp; Rouse and later Kodak (Australasia), and published in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="DOS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Australasian Photo-review Magazine or periodical |url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/artefact/australasian_photo-review |website=Dictionary of Sydney |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The magazine was first published in 1894 as the Australian edition of the ''British Photographic Review of Reviews'', after the photographic supply company Baker &amp; Rouse purchased the Australasian publishing rights.&lt;ref name="PRR.1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Welch |first1=Edwin J |title=Publisher's Notice |journal=Photographic Review of Reviews |date=January 1894 |issue= 1 |pages=3‚Äì4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this early stage of its publication, the magazine was issued as a short ten to fifteen page supplement to the British edition.&lt;ref name="PRR.4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Welch |first1=Edwin |title=An Australian P.P.R. |journal=Photographic Review of Reviews |date=January 1894 |issue=1 |page=4 |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-410279079/view?partId=nla.obj-410279597#page/n3/mode/1up |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895 the magazine's name was changed to ''Australalasian Photographic Review'', and in 1903, the title was shortened to ''Australalasian Photo-Review''.&lt;ref name="photo"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Caption Title |journal=Australian Photo-Review |date=January 1903 |volume= X |issue= 1 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine was [[Edwin Welch|Edwin J. Welch]], who reported the declaration, within the first issue, that Australian photographic works would be reviewed with 'bluntness, perhaps, but no namby pamby'.&lt;ref name="photo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PRR.1"/&gt; In 1922 [[Keast Burke|Eric Keast Burke]] became associate editor, and eventually editor, a position he held until the Review ceased publication in 1956.&lt;ref name="adb"&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/burke-eric-keast-9628 ''Australian Dictionary of Biography''.] Retrieved 6 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Review is notable for promoting the work of Australian photographers or 'camerists', as they were referred to as in early editions, and for it's inclusion of high-grade photographic prints.&lt;ref name="PRR.1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Austlit"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matthew |first1=Jill Julius |title=Australasian Photo-Review periodical |url=https://www.austlit.edu.au/austlit/page/C594110 |website=Austlit |accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, [[Keast Burke|Eric Keast Burke]], while still acting as editor for the publication, rediscovered the wet plate negative collection of [[Holtermann collection|Bernhard Otto Holtermann]], showing panoramas of Sydney, and the gold-fields of Hill End and Gulgong.&lt;ref name="goldandsilver"&gt;''Gold and Silver: Photographs of Australian Goldfileds from the Holtermann Collection'', by Keast Burke, Penguin Books Australia, 1973, inside cover; p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holstein dairy cows.jpg|thumb|250px|rBST is a product allowed only in certain jurisdictions and primarily given to [[dairy cattle]] by injection to increase milk production.]]
'''Bovine somatotropin''' or '''bovine somatotrophin''' (abbreviated '''bST''' and '''BST'''), or '''bovine growth hormone''' ('''BGH'''), is a [[peptide hormone]] produced by cows' [[pituitary glands]].&lt;ref name="Brennand"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/factsheet/FN-250_6.pdf |title=Bovine Somatotropin in Milk |accessdate=6 March 2011 |author=Charlotte P.

''the New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; it became possible to synthesize the hormone using [[recombinant DNA technology]] to create '''recombinant bovine somatotropin''' ('''rBST'''), '''recombinant bovine growth hormone''' ('''rBGH'''), or '''artificial growth hormone'''. Four large pharmaceutical companies, [[Monsanto]], [[American Cyanamid]], [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]], and [[Upjohn]], developed commercial rBST products and submitted them to the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for approval.&lt;ref&gt;Bijman, J.

The FDA,&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; and [[National Institutes of Health]]&lt;ref name="NIH RBST"/&gt; have independently stated that dairy products and meat from BST-treated cows are safe for human consumption.

A European Union report on the animal welfare effects of rBST states that its use often results in "severe and unnecessary pain, suffering and distress" for cows, "associated with serious [[Mastitis in dairy cattle|mastitis]], foot disorders and some reproductive problems".&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Report on Animal Welfare Aspects of the Use of Bovine Somatotrophin | url = http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out21_en.pdf | format = PDF | date = 10 March 1999 | accessdate = 16 January 2008 | publisher = The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, [[European Union]]. | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080904003449/http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scah/out21_en.pdf | archivedate = 4 September 2008 | df = dmy-all }} &lt;br /&gt;Note: According to the report, somatotropine, which is often used,  is a misnomer as "&lt;u&gt;tropic&lt;/u&gt; factors affect direction or extent of body movement while &lt;u&gt;trophic&lt;/u&gt; factors affect growth". So the Commission uses the spelling somatotrophin.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the administration of BST was shown to increase the milk yield in [[lactation|lactating]] cows by preventing mammary cell death in dairy cattle.&lt;ref name=collier/&gt; Until the 1980s, use of the compound was very limited in agriculture as the sole source of the hormone was from bovine carcasses.

Lilly, American Cyanamid, Upjohn, and Monsanto all submitted applications to market rBST to the U.S. FDA, and the FDA completed its review of the human safety component of these applications in 1986 and found food from rBST-treated cows to be safe; however, strong public concern led to calls for more studies, investigations, and public discussions, which included an unprecedented conference on the safety of rBST in 1990 organized by the [[National Institutes of Health]] &lt;!-- (NIH) --&gt; at the request of Sen. [[Patrick Leahy]].&lt;ref name=Audit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oig.hhs.gov/oas/reports/phs/c9000046.pdf|title=Auditor's Report|author=|date=|website=HHS.gov|access-date=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; FDA approved Monsanto's application in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm055435.htm |title=FDA page on BST |publisher=FDA.gov |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto launched rBST, brand-named Posilac, in 1994.&lt;ref name = MG&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html | title = General information ‚Äì Posilac |access-date=16 January 2008 | year = 2007 | publisher = Monsanto | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080101123956/http://www.monsantodairy.com/about/general_info/index.html| archivedate = 1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism of action==
An average dairy cow begins her lactation with a moderate daily level{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} of milk production. This daily output increases until, at about 70 days into the lactation, production peaks. From that time until the cow is dry, production slowly decreases. This increase and decrease in production is partially caused by the count of milk-producing cells in the udder. Cell counts begin at a moderate number,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} increase during the first part of the lactation, then decrease as the lactation proceeds. Once lost, these cells generally do not regrow until the next lactation.

Administration of rBST or BST prior to peak production, in cows that are well fed, slows the rate at which the number of mammary cells decreases, and increases the amount of nutrients directed away from fat and toward the mammary cells, leading to an extension of peak milk production.

From 2000 to 2005, the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service &lt;!-- (NASS) --&gt; survey of dairy producers found that about 17% of producers used rBST.&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie J et al (2010) [http://www.agbioforum.org/v13n3/v13n3a04-gillespie.pdf Adoption of Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin and Farm Profitability: Does Farm Size Matter?] AgBioForum, 13(3): 251-262.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2010 USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service survey of Wisconsin farms found that about 18% of dairy farms used rBST.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service 2010.

=== Role in synchronized fertilization on dairy farms ===
By using cows that produce offspring within a  one to two week period, synchronized breeding allows dairy farmers to artificially inseminate cows for maximum pregnancy rates with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeJarnette|first1=Mel|title=OVSYNCH, CO-SYNCH, PRESYNCH and KITCHENSYNCH: How did breeding cows get so complicated?|url=http://www.selectsires.com/programs/docs/ovsynch_cosynch_presynch.pdf?version=20161206|website=Select Sires|publisher=Select Sires Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bovine somatotropin is a [[placental lactogen]] (PL) hormone and falls under the class of growth hormone, or somatotropin. It is relevant to the practice of artificially expediting placental development in farm mammals, specifically dairy cattle. The mechanism through which the hormones of this somatotropin exert their effects can be observed at the cellular and molecular level in placental tissue. For mammals exposed to the hormone, bovine somatotropin associates with [[N-linked glycosylation|N-glycosylated]] proteins that are heavily involved in placental gestation. Knowledge of this and how BT works in conjunction with growth hormones allows for agricultural researchers to experiment on the effects of synchronization in farm animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extension.uga.edu/publications/detail.cfm?number=B1227|title=Dairy Herd Synchronization Programs {{!}} Publications {{!}} UGA Extension|website=extension.uga.edu|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronization involves treating cattle with a dose of BsT before artificially inseminating them, according to a fixed interval schedule. Synchronization and bST treatment may be used to increase first-service pregnancy rates while following this timed artificial insemination protocol. This would therefore allow agricultural researchers to observe the effects of hormones in relation to natural estrous cycles. Dairy cattle experienced increased rates of pregnancy during synchronization when exposed to BsT.  The effects of BsT on this treatment are dependent on the step in the estrous cycle, seeing how BsT has a stimulatory effect of progesterone on the corpus luteum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopes|first=Fernanda|title=Effects of Presynchronization and Bovine Somatotropin on Pregnancy Rates to a Timed Artificial Insemination Protocol in Lactating Dairy Cows|url=https://www.academia.edu/8285143/Effects_of_Presynchronization_and_Bovine_Somatotropin_on_Pregnancy_Rates_to_a_Timed_Artificial_Insemination_Protocol_in_Lactating_Dairy_Cows|journal=Journal of Dairy Science|doi=10.3168/jds.s0022-0302(01)74600-0|volume=84|year=2001|pages=1646‚Äì1659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Though approved by the FDA in 1993, rBST has been immersed in controversy since the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=Dobs /&gt; Part of the controversy concerns potential effects on [[animal health]] and [[human health]].

===Animal health===
One [[meta-analysis]] published in 2003 suggested a negative impact of rBST's effects on bovine health.&lt;ref name="Dohoo2003b"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14620861 |year=2003 |last1=Dohoo |first1=IR |last2=Desc√¥teaux |first2=L |last3=Leslie |first3=K |last4=Fredeen |first4=A |last5=Shewfelt |first5=W |last6=Preston |first6=A |last7=Dowling |first7=P |title=A meta-analysis review of the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin. 2.

The same study reported a decrease in body condition score for cows treated with rBST, though an increase in their dry matter intake occurred.

Another meta-analysis (2003) reported on body condition scores (BCS) but could not reach a conclusion due to lack of homogeneity in study design and reporting. They found a trend towards decreased BCS in treated cows but state "Depending on the level of body condition in these cows, this effect may have been beneficial or detrimental." &lt;ref name="Dohoo2003"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14620860 |year=2003 |last1=Dohoo |first1=IR |last2=Leslie |first2=K |last3=Desc√¥teaux |first3=L |last4=Fredeen |first4=A |last5=Dowling |first5=P |last6=Preston |first6=A |last7=Shewfelt |first7=W |title=A meta-analysis review of the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin. 1.

A more recent meta-analysis (2014) published by the Journal of the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] showed no significant increase in risk of clinical [[Mastitis in dairy cattle|mastitis]] nor other adverse effects on cow health and well-being. This review included 26 peer-reviewed studies that involved the use of the rBST-Zn formulation available to US producers in accordance with the label instructions for treatment initiation (57 to 70 days postpartum), dose (500&amp;nbsp;mg, q 14 d), and route (SC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=St-Pierre|first=Normand R.|last2=Milliken|first2=George A.|last3=Bauman|first3=Dale E.|last4=Collier|first4=Robert J.|last5=Hogan|first5=Joseph S.|last6=Shearer|first6=Jan K.|last7=Smith|first7=K.

[[File:Mamite √• grangrin vatche p√©s fritches.jpg|thumb|250px|One meta-analysis suggested that the use of rBST increases health problems with cows, including [[Mastitis in dairy cattle|mastitis]].]]

In 1994, a European Union scientific commission was asked to report on the incidence of mastitis and other disorders in dairy cows and on other aspects of their welfare.&lt;ref name="ec.europa.eu"/&gt; The commission's statement, subsequently adopted by the European Union, stated that the use of rBST substantially increased health problems with cows, including foot problems, mastitis, and injection site reactions, impinged on the welfare of the animals, and caused reproductive disorders. The report concluded, on the basis of the health and welfare of the animals, rBST should not be used. [[Health Canada]] prohibited the sale of rBST in 1999; the external committees found, although there was no significant health risk to humans, the drug presents a threat to animal health, and, for this reason, cannot be sold in Canada.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_03_e.html | website = [[Health Canada]] | title = Health Canada rejects bovine growth hormone in Canada | date = 14 January 1999 |accessdate=16 January 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110050349/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_03_e.html| archivedate = 10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monsanto-sponsored trials reviewed by the FDA asked whether the use of rBST makes cows more susceptible to mastitis.&lt;ref name="JECFA 1997"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://consumersunion.org/news/potential-public-health-impacts-of-the-use-of-recombinant-bovine-somatotropin-in-dairy-production-part-1/ |title = Potential Public Health Impacts Of The Use Of Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin In Dairy Production | date = September 1997 |last1=Hansen |first1=Michael, Ph.D. |last2=Halloran |first2=Jean M. |last3=Groth |first3=Edward III, Ph.D. |last4=Lefferts |first4=Lisa Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the FDA, which used data from eight Monsanto-sponsored trials in its decision in 1993 to approve Monsanto's rBST product, the answer is yes. The data from these eight trials, which involved 487 cows, showed that during the period of rBST treatment, mastitis incidence increased by 76% in [[primiparous]] cows and by 50% for multiparous cows. Overall, the increase was 53%.&lt;ref name="JECFA 1997"/&gt;

Conversely, however a study from the University of Georgia on the monitoring post-approval of rBST, showed that there was no statistically significant (P&gt;0.05) derivation in cases of clinical mastitis in dairy cows treated with rBST.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ads.uga.edu/documents/relationshipbetweentheuseofrecombinantbovinesomatotropinposilacindairycowsandtheincidenceofc.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010092939/http://www.ads.uga.edu/documents/relationshipbetweentheuseofrecombinantbovinesomatotropinposilacindairycowsandtheincidenceofc.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 October 2015|title=Relationship between the Use of Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin (Posilac¬Æ) in Dairy Cows and the Incidence of Clinical Mastitis|last=McClary|first=David|date=21 December 2010|website=|publisher=University of Georgia Agriculture|access-date=18 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Macronutrient composition====
The overall composition of the milk including the fat, protein, and lactose content is not altered substantially by the use of rBST in dairy cows. The milk may have a slight change in fat content within the first few weeks of rBST treatment as the cow is allowed to adjust her metabolism and feed intake. The changes in the fat content have been shown to be temporary. The composition of the milk has been examined in more than 200 different experiments. Natural variation within milk is normal with or without rBST treatment in cows due to genetics, location, feed, age, and other environmental factors.  Protein in milk content has also been studied and was shown to have no apparent change in rBST treated cows. The vitamins and minerals that are normally in milk were also unaltered in milk from rBST treated cows. Freezing point, pH, thermal properties, and other manufacturing characteristics of milk were shown to be the same regardless of whether it came from rBST treated cows or not.&lt;ref name="Bauman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=R.

====Hormones====
BST is destroyed in the digestive system and even if directly injected, has not been found to have any direct effect on humans.&lt;ref name=Bauman2014/&gt; Researchers have found that "IGF-1 in milk is not denatured by pasteurization and the extent to which intact, active IGF-1 is absorbed through the human digestive tract remains still however uncertain" implicating that an extensive study on the nature of IGF-1 in relation to rBST milk is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Analytical strategies to detect use of recombinant bovine somatotropin in food-producing animals|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165993613002306|journal = TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry|date = 2014-01-01|pages = 1‚Äì10|volume = 53|doi = 10.1016/j.trac.2013.08.006|first = G.|last = Dervilly-Pinel|first2 = S.|last2 = Pr√©vost|first3 = F.|last3 = Monteau|first4 = B.|last4 = Le Bizec}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FDA rBST labeling guidelines state, "FDA is concerned that the term 'rbST free' may imply a compositional difference between milk from treated and untreated cows rather than a difference in the way the milk is produced. Without proper context, such statements could be misleading. Such unqualified statements may imply that milk from untreated cows is safer or of higher quality than milk from treated cows. Such an implication would be false and misleading".&lt;ref name="grist"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grist.org/article/food-2010-10-06-court-rules-on-rbgh-free-milk |title=Court Rules rBGH-Free Milk *Is* Better than the Kind Produced with Artificial Hormones.

The American Cancer Society issued a report declaring, "The evidence for potential harm to humans [from rBGH milk] is inconclusive. It is not clear that drinking milk produced using rBGH significantly increases IGF-1 levels in humans or adds to the risk of developing cancer. More research is needed to help better address these concerns."&lt;ref name = "ACS"&gt;Staff, American Cancer Society. Last Medical Review: 18 February 2011; Last Revised: 18 February 2011.

===Human health===
The effects of rBGH on human health is an ongoing debate, in part due to the lack of conclusive evidence. A few of the most debated issues include:

[[IGF-1]] is a hormone found in humans that is responsible for growth promotion, protein synthesis, and insulin actions over the lifecycle. The hormone has been shown to influence the growth of tumors in some studies and may be linked to the development of prostate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Allen | first1 = NE | last2 = Key | first2 = TJ | last3 = Appleby | first3 = PN | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2007 | title = Serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-binding protein-3 concentrations and prostate cancer risk: Results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 1121‚Äì1127 |pmid=17548673|doi=10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-1062}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; colorectal, breast,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hankinson | first1 = SE | last2 = Schernhammer | first2 = ES | year = 2003 | title = Insulin-like growth factor and breast cancer risk: Evidence from observational studies | journal = Breast Dis. | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 27‚Äì40 |pmid=15687675| doi=10.3233/bd-2003-17104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rinaldi | first1 = S | last2 = Peeters | first2 = PH | last3 = Berrino | first3 = F | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2006 | title = IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and breast cancer risk in women: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) | url = | journal = Endocr Relat Cancer | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 593‚Äì615 | doi=10.1677/erc.1.01150}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giovannucci | first1 = E | year = 2003 | title = Nutrition, insulin, insulin-like growth factors and cancer | url = | journal = Hormone &amp; Metabolic Research | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 694‚Äì704 | doi=10.1055/s-2004-814147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furstenberger | first1 = G | last2 = Senn | first2 = HJ | year = 2002 | title = Insulin-like growth factors and cancer | url = | journal = Lancet Oncol | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 298‚Äì302 | doi=10.1016/s1470-2045(02)00731-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Giovannucci | first1 = E | last2 = Pollak | first2 = M | last3 = Liu | first3 = Y | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2003 | title = Nutritional predictors of insulin-like growth factor I and their relationships to cancer in men | url = | journal = Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 84‚Äì89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IGF-1 is also found in milk. Previous research has proposed an increase of IGF-1 in rBST-treated cows, but this claim is currently not substantiated. In addition, no current evidence shows that orally consumed IGF-1 is absorbed in humans and the dietary amount is negligible when compared to what the body produces on its own. "IGF-1 in milk is not denatured (inactivated) by pasteurization. The extent to which intact, active IGF-1 is absorbed through the human digestive tract remains uncertain.

The American Cancer Society has reviewed the evidence concerning IGF-1 in milk from rBST-treated cows, and found that:  "While there may be a link between IGF-1 blood levels and cancer, the exact nature of this link remains unclear.  Some studies have shown that adults who drink milk have about 10% higher levels of IGF-1 in their blood than those who drink little or no milk. But this same finding has also been reported in people who drink soymilk. This suggests that the increase in IGF-1 may not be specific to cow's milk, and may be caused by protein, minerals, or some other factors in milk unrelated to rBGH. There have been no direct comparisons of IGF-1 levels in people who drink ordinary cow's milk vs. milk stimulated by rBGH. At this time, it is not clear that drinking milk, produced with or without rBGH treatment, increases blood IGF-1 levels into a range that might be of concern regarding cancer risk or other health effects. IGF-1 concentrations are slightly higher (to variable degrees, depending on the study) in milk from cows treated with rBGH than in untreated milk. This variability is presumed to be much less than the normal range of variation of IGF-1 in cow's milk due to natural factors, but more research is needed."&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;

Research is supportive of milk supplying vital nutrients used in childhood development.&lt;ref&gt;https://medical.gerber.com/nutrition-health-topics/infant-early-childhood-nutrition/articles/early-childhood-nutrition-toddlers-to-preschoolers&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, evidence does not link rBST-treated milk with adverse health outcomes for children.&lt;ref name="Bauman2014" /&gt; Several studies have looked at the relationship between type 1 diabetes and infant feeding. Environmental triggers that may elicit an autoimmune reaction is the mechanism in which is being studied. Some studies have shown early exposure to bovine milk may predispose an infant to type 1 diabetes, whereas other studies show no causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Concerns about Dairy Products|url=http://www.pcrm.org/health/diets/vegdiets/health-concerns-about-dairy-products|website=The Physicians Committee|language=en|date=13 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Society of Animal Science published an article in 2014 after reviewing health issues arising from the rBST debate. The article indicated "there are no new human health issues related to the use of rbST by the dairy industry. Use of rbST has no effect on the micro- and macrocomposition of milk. Also, no evidence exists that rbST use has increased human exposure to antibiotic residues in milk. Concerns that IGF-I present in milk could have biological effects on humans have been allayed by studies showing that oral consumption of IGF-I by humans has little or no biological activity. Additionally, concentrations of IGF-I in digestive tract fluids of humans far exceed any IGF-I consumed when drinking milk. Furthermore, chronic supplementation of cows with rbST does not increase concentrations of milk IGF-I outside the range typically observed for effects of farm, parity, or stage of lactation. Use of rbST has not affected expression of retroviruses in cattle or posed an increased risk to human health from retroviruses in cattle. Furthermore, risk for development of type 1 or type 2 diabetes has not increased in children or adults consuming milk and dairy products from rbST-supplemented cows. Overall, milk and dairy products provide essential nutrients and related benefits in health maintenance and the prevention of chronic diseases." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collier | first1 = R.

Keeping in mind that bovine somatropin is a protein growth hormone, it can increase average milk yield anywhere from 10 to 15%, which in turn would lead to cows consuming substantially more nutrients in order to keep up with the increased milk production. Most of a cow's energy consumption goes directly towards milk production. In certain areas of the world, like Ethiopia where this was studied extensively, as the cows needed to intake more nutrition to balance out their milk production, there was also an increased level of chemical fertilizers and heavy metal traces found in the milk due to increased exposure to agricultural chemicals. These chemicals can then easily be passed on to humans and lead to a contaminated milk supply. BST increases the longevity or the activity of the mammary cell leading to higher milk production and some other non-desirable side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Centner|first=Terence J.|date=2016-09-01|title=Efforts to slacken antibiotic resistance: Labeling meat products from animals raised without antibiotics in the United States|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716310130|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=563‚Äì564|pages=1088‚Äì1094|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite public controversy of the use of growth hormones in food-producing animals, the number of violations has decreased substantially in the past two decades.{{When|date=May 2017}} For comparison, the level of rBST detected in bulk milk tank trucks in 2012 was one fifth the level that it was in 1996. As reported by the USDA, the US pattern for milk BTSCC declined steadily from 316.000 cells per mL of milk in 2001 to 224,000 cells/mL in 2010 and 206,000 cells/mL in 2011 (USDA, 2013). Mammary health in the animals themselves has improved over this time period as well as the overall health of the dairy herd in general. This is mostly attributed to better application methods of rBST and a better understanding of how the hormone affects the animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hdl.handle.net/1813/37969 |title=An Update On rBST - Human Safety And Animal Efficiency  And Welfare |last1=Bauman |first1=D.E.|last2=Collier |first2=R.J.|date=2014|conference= Cornell Nutrition Conference for Feed Manufacturers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
On an industry level, supplementing one million cows with rBST would result in the same amount of milk produced using 157,000 fewer cows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Capper|first1=J.

Some studies show that rBST-treated cows reduce the impact of greenhouse gases in comparison with conventional and organic dairy operations, however, it must be noted that the lead of the project, Roger Cady, was linked to Monsanto's rBST department.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.organicconsumers.org/news/deconstructing-monsantos-propaganda-bovine-growth-hormone-will-reduce-global-warming&lt;/ref&gt; Cady's study showed that excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus, two major environmental pollutants arising from animal agriculture, was reduced by 9.1 and 11.8%, respectively.&lt;ref name=Capper2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Capper | first1 = JL | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | date = Jul 2008 | title = The environmental impact of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) use in dairy production | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 105 | issue = 28| pages = 9668‚Äì73 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0802446105 | pmid = 18591660 | pmc=2442129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is recognized to be the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas,&lt;ref&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

* Livestock metabolism-use of rBST in lactating cows decreases the quantity of energy and protein needed in comparison to conventional dairy operations along with reducing the total feedstuff used.
* Fossil fuel consumption-targets atmospheric pollution and resource sustainability environmental concerns. With cows treated with rBST, producing a higher milk yield reduces the feed requirement which in turn decreases with electricity for milk production and the energy required from fossil fuels for cropping. In addition, the global warming potential is reduced equivalent to removing 400,000 family cars from the road. 
When conventional, conventional with rBST, and organic dairy operations are compared, 8% fewer cows are needed in an rBST-supplemented population, whereas organic production systems require a 25% increase to meet production targets.&lt;ref name=Capper2008/&gt; This is due to a lower milk yield per cow due to the pasture-based system which is attributed with a greater maintenance energy expenditure associated with grazing behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Subcommittee on Dairy Cattle Nutrition; Committee on Animal Nutrition; Board on Agriculture and Natural Resources (BANR); Division on Earth and Life Studies (DELS); National Research Council  [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309069971 Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle: Seventh Revised Edition.

===Lawsuit against WTVT===
In 1997, the news division of [[WTVT]] (Channel 13), a [[Fox Television Stations Group|Fox-owned station]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], planned to air an investigative report by [[Steve Wilson (reporter)|Steve Wilson]] and [[Jane Akre]] on the health risks associated with Monsanto's bovine growth hormone product, Posilac.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/081900/TampaBay/Reporter_wins_suit_ov.shtml |title=Reporter wins suit over firing |publisher=SPTimes.com |date=19 August 2000 |access-date=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before the story was to air, Fox received a letter from Monsanto saying the reporters were biased and that the story would damage the company.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt;  Akre stated that Wilson and she went through 83 rewrites over eight months.&lt;ref&gt;''Deconstructing Supper''. Dir. Marianne Kaplan. Prod. Leonard Terhoch &amp; Marianne Kaplan. 2002. VHS. Retrieved 2011-11-24. (23-minute mark.)&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations broke down and both reporters were eventually fired. Wilson and Akre alleged the firing was for retaliation, while WTVT contended they were fired for insubordination.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt; The reporters then sued Fox/WTVT in Florida state court under the state's [[whistleblower]] statute. In 2000, a Florida jury found that while no evidence showed Fox/WTVT had bowed to any pressure from Monsanto to alter the story, Akre, but not Wilson, was a whistleblower and was unjustly fired.&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt; She was awarded a $425,000 settlement. At the time of the decision, "the station claimed it did not bend to Monsanto's letter and wanted to air a hard-hitting story with a number of statements critical of Monsanto."&lt;ref name="sptimes.com" /&gt; Fox appealed the decision stating that under Florida law, a whistleblower can only act if "a law, rule, or regulation" has been broken and argued that the FCC's policy against distortions or misrepresentations presented as news did not fit that definition.&lt;ref name="decision"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/fl-district-court-of-appeal/1310807.html |title=NEW WORLD COMMUNICATIONS OF TAMPA INC WTVT TV v.

Recognizing an uncodified agency policy developed through the adjudicative process as the equivalent of a formally adopted rule is not consistent with this policy, and it would expand the scope of conduct that could subject an employer to liability beyond what Florida's Legislature could have contemplated when it enacted the whistle-blower's statute."&lt;ref name="decision" /&gt;

In 1990, the European Union placed a moratorium on its sale by all member nations. It was turned into a permanent ban starting from 1 January 2000; the decision was based solely on veterinary concerns, laws, and treaties.&lt;ref name=eucelex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999D0879:EN:HTML |title=European Council Decision of December 17, 1999 |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An in-depth report published in 1999 analysed in detail the various human health risks associated with rBST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Report on Public Health Aspects of the Use of Bovine Somatotrophin|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scv/out19_en.html|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the board stated, with the exception of concerns raised regarding hypersensitivity, "the panel finds no biologically plausible reason for concern about human safety if rBST were to be approved for sale in Canada."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/vet/issues-enjeux/rbst-stbr/rep_rcpsc-rap_crmcc_e.html |title=Executive Summary ‚Äì Report of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada Expert Panel on Human safety of rBST |publisher=Hc-sc.gc.ca |date=21 August 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Codex Alimentarius]] Commission, a United Nations body that sets international food standards, has, as of 2017, refused to approve rBST as safe. The Codex Alimentarius does not have authority to ban or approve the hormone, but its decisions are regarded as a standard and approval by the Codex would have allowed exporting countries to challenge countries with a ban on rBST before the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbghsuit.com/codex063099.htm |title=International Health Group Shuns Bgh |publisher=Foxbghsuit.com |date=3 July 1999 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse on dairy farms ===
Recombinant bovine somatotropin is an artificially synthesized form of the bovine growth hormone. It is legal for use as an artificial cattle lactation stimulant in several countries, including the US. However, its use is prohibited in most of Europe for reasons of consumer preference, animal well-being, and skepticism of new technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bauman|first1=Dale E.|title=Facts about Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin (rbST)|url=https://ansci.cals.cornell.edu/sites/ansci.cals.cornell.edu/files/shared/documents/Recombinant%20Bovine%20Somatotropin_v3.pdf|website=Cornell University|publisher=Department of Animal Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers who opt to use the synthetic hormone do so because they believe it increases milk production without other inputs. However, concerns of both product safety and livestock abuse have prompted discussions for new methods in assaying the levels of dairy cattle rBST. One proposed method involves quantifying the presence or absence of the rBST-binding antibody in serum. However, this method would require blood samples to be taken regularly and is thus considered by some critics{{Who|date=May 2017}} to be too invasive. The development of other alternative methods continue to undergo development. One such example, tested by W.W. Thatcher at the University of Florida,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Meta-analysis of the effects of sometribove zinc suspension on the production and health of lactating dairy cows|first1=Normand R.|last1=St-Pierre|first2=George A.|last2=Milliken|first3=Dale E.|last3=Bauman|first4=Robert J.|last4=Collier|first5=Joseph S.|last5=Hogan|first6=Jan K.|last6=Shearer|first7=K.

Dairy cattle do respond to the rBST angtigen and have shown positive results in immunosorbent trials on milk samples. Tests involving [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]] milk samples have even shown consistent results, with immunoglobulin rBST still detectable and distinguishable despite other antibodies remaining present.

===United States===
In 1993, the product was approved for use in the U.S. by the FDA, and its use began in 1994. The product is now sold in all 50 states.

The FDA stated that food products made from rBST-treated cows are safe for human consumption, and no statistically significant difference exists between milk derived from rBST-treated and untreated cows.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm130321.htm | title = Report on the Food and Drug Administration's Review of the Safety of Recombinant Bovine Somatotropin |accessdate=2 May 2009 | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA found BST to be biologically inactive when consumed by humans and found no biological distinction between rBST and BST.&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt; In 1990, an independent panel convened by the National Institute of Health supported the FDA opinion that milk and meat from cows supplemented with rBST is safe for human consumption.&lt;ref name="NIH RBST"&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK15180/ |chapter=Bovine Somatotropin |title=NIH State of the Science Statements |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labeling====
The FDA does not require special labels for products produced from cows given rBST, but has charged several dairies with "misbranding" its milk as having no hormones, because all milk contains hormones and cannot be produced in such a way that it would not contain any hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Janet |last1=Raloff |date=November 2003 |title=Hormones in Your Milk |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/4375/title/Food_for_Thought__Hormones_in_Your_Milk |work=[[Science News]] |access-date=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto sued [[Oakhurst Dairy]] of Maine over its use of a label which pledged not to use artificial growth hormones.&lt;ref name="0708-10.htm"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0708-10.htm | title = Oakhurst Sued by Monsanto Over Milk Advertising | last = Wickenheiser | first = M | work = [[Portland Press Herald]] | access-date = 29 January 2008 | date = 8 July 2003 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080201163140/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0708-10.htm | archivedate = 1 February 2008 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dairy stated that its disagreement was not over the scientific evidence for the safety of rBST (Monsanto's complaint about the label), but, "We're in the business of marketing milk, not Monsanto's drugs." The suit was settled when the dairy agreed to add a qualifying statement to its label: "FDA states: No significant difference in milk from cows treated with artificial growth hormones." The FDA recommends this additional labeling, but does not require it.&lt;ref name="0708-10.htm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purefood.org/monsanto/mainegives122903.cfm |title=Maine Dairy Caves in to Pressure from Monsanto on rBGH-Free Labeling |publisher=Purefood.org |date=25 December 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106231643/http://www.purefood.org/monsanto/mainegives122903.cfm |archivedate=6 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement itself caused much controversy, with anti-rBST advocates claiming that Oakhurst had capitulated in response to intimidation by a larger corporation and others claiming that Oakhurst's milk labels were in and of themselves using misleading scare tactics that deserved legal and legislative response.

==== Ohio ====
In 2008, Ohio's Department of Agriculture (ODA) banned the use of labeling in dairy products as rBST-free because it was deemed misleading to consumers. However, the International Dairy Foods Association and the Organic Trade Association claimed ODA's ban was a violation of the first amendment by not allowing consumers to decide whether they deem the milk was safe and filed suit against the bill. "The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Ohio, concluding that using "rBST" as a label was inherently misleading because it implies "a compositional difference between those products that are produced with rBST and those that are not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Recent Developments in Health Law|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-720X.2011.00554.x/abstract|journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics|date = 2011-03-01|issn = 1748-720X|pages = 96‚Äì101|volume = 39|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1748-720X.2011.00554.x|language = en|first = Cordaro|last = Rodriguez|first2 = Elena|last2 = Papoulias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kansas====
In 2009, the [[Kansas Legislature]] passed a bill that would have required dairies that did not use rBST to print disclaimers on their labels that stated, "The Food and Drug Administration has determined there are no significant differences between milk from cows that receive injections of the artificial hormone and milk from those that do not." The bill was vetoed in the last days of the 2009 legislative session by then-Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]]. The legislature removed the labeling language and passed the bill without the provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ethicurean.com/2009/05/04/kansas-milk-labels/ | title = Kansas Senate leaves rBST milk labels on ag committee floor
|accessdate=28 October 2011 | date = 23 April 2009 | format = PDF | publisher = [[Consumers Union]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
In 2007, [[Pennsylvania]] adopted a regulation that would have banned the practice of labeling milk as derived from cows not treated with rBST. Pennsylvania's Agriculture Secretary Dennis Wolff made the following statement in support of the measure:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consumers are getting confused with the extra labels. They deserve a choice, and so do producers. But from the standpoint of safety, all milk is healthy milk. Our milk is a safe product. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture is not in a position to say use rBST or not. The key word is: choice. I used rBST from day one of its approval to the last day that I milked cows. It was an important management tool on my dairy farm. What we oppose is the negative advertising or the selling of fear. If producers are asked to give up a production efficiency, and if that efficiency nets them $3000 or $10,000 a year for their dairy farm&amp;nbsp; ... That's a lot of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthfarmfriendly.com/News/frustvenmilkmrkt-102606.html |title=Frustrations Vented Over Questionable Milk Marketing Practices ‚Äì October 26, 2006 |publisher=Earthfarmfriendly.com |date=26 October 2006 |accessdate=24 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511210359/http://www.earthfarmfriendly.com/News/frustvenmilkmrkt-102606.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This prohibition was to go into effect 1 January 2008, but after the comment period, the guidelines were adjusted to only ban "rBST-free" claims and instead allow claims that farmers had pledged not to use rBST and accompany such claims with a disclaimer such as, "No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and non-rbST-treated cows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08018/850269-85.stm | title = State reverses on dairy labeling, allows hormone claims | date = 18 January 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2008 | last = Malloy | first = D | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from milk producers and retailers==
In response to concerns from consumers and advocacy groups about milk from cows treated with rBST, some dairies, retailers, and restaurants have published policies on use of rBST in production of milk products they sell, while others offer some products or product lines that are labelled "rBST-free" or the like. Other dairies and industry groups have worked to assure the public that milk from rBST-treated cows is safe.

A '''Bundt cake''' {{IPAc-en|b| å|n|t}} is a [[cake]] that is baked in a '''Bundt pan''', shaping it into a distinctive ring shape. The shape is inspired by a traditional European cake known as {{lang|de|[[Gugelhupf]]}}, but Bundt cakes are not generally associated with any single recipe. The style of mold in [[North America]] was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s, after cookware manufacturer [[Nordic Ware]] trademarked the name "Bundt" and began producing Bundt pans from cast [[aluminum]]. Publicity from [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] saw the cakes gain widespread popularity.

==Etymology==
[[File:Babka, M√∫nich, Alemania, 2013-04-01, DD 01.JPG|thumb|[[Babka (cake)]] in a Bundt shape]]
The Bundt cake derives in part from a European [[brioche]]-like cake called {{lang|de|[[Gugelhupf]]}} which was particularly popular among [[Jews|Jewish]] communities in parts of [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Oxford Companion to Food

|first = Alan
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the southwest of Germany {{lang|de|Gugelhupf}} is traditionally known as {{lang|de|Bundkuchen}} ({{IPA-de|Ààb äntkuÀêxnÃ©}}), a name formed by joining the two words {{lang|de|Bund}} and {{lang|de|Kuchen}} (cake).&lt;ref name=wpost&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions differ as to the significance of the word {{lang|de|Bund}}. One possibility is that it means "bunch" or "bundle", and refers to the way the dough is bundled around the tubed center of the pan.&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt; In Dutch, the cake is called "tulband," which is Dutch for 'turban.' The pronunciation of the second part of this word is very similar to that of 'bundt.' Another source suggests that it describes the banded appearance given to the cake by the fluted sides of the pan, similar to a tied [[sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] or bundle of wheat.&lt;ref name=franklin&gt;{{cite book

Uses of the word ''bund'' outside of Europe to describe cakes can be found in [[American Jews|Jewish-American]] [[cookbook]]s from around the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=babette&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Napfkuchen-Form.jpg|thumb|left|Bundt-style pans in silicone and metal]]
Bundt cakes do not conform to any single recipe; instead, their characterizing feature is their shape. A Bundt pan generally has fluted or grooved sides, but its most defining design element is the central tube or "chimney" which leaves a cylindrical hole through the center of the cake. The design means that more of the mixture touches the surface of the pan than in a simple round pan, helping to provide faster and more even heat distribution during cooking.&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=fante&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.fantes.com/tube-pans.html
|title = Tube Pans
|accessdate = 20 December 2012
|publisher = Fante's
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape is similar to that of the earlier European {{lang|de|Gugelhupf}} or {{lang|de|Bundkuchen}}. A {{lang|de|Gugelhupf}} differs from contemporary Bundt-style cakes in that it follows a particular yeast-based recipe, with fruit and nuts, and is often deeper in shape and more decorative.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Also similar in shape is the Eastern European ''[[Babka (cake)|Babka]]'', dating from early 18th century [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twojaeuropa.pl/1441/il-bab--ciastko-o-niezwyklym-smaku-i-historii|title=Il Bab√† - ciastko o niezwyk≈Çym smaku i historii|date=17 March 2010|last=Berny|first=Iwona|language=Polish|trans-title=Babka: a cake with a unique flavor and history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there is no recipe for "Bundt cake". Anything can be baked in a Bundt-style pan, and is. Recipes range from ''Pine Nut and Chili'' cakes to ice cream and fruit concoctions. Bundt-style pan design has expanded beyond the original fluted ring to today's designs of skylines and cathedrals, all with the requisite hole in the center of the pan&lt;ref name=BundtBook/&gt; made by Nordic Ware and others.  Since a [[Torus|toroidal]] cake is rather difficult to [[Icing (food)|frost]], Bundt cakes are typically either dusted with powdered sugar, drizzle-glazed, or served undecorated. Recipes specifically designed for Bundt pans often have a baked-in filling; Bundt [[pound cake]]s are also common.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Since the name "Bundt" is a [[trademark]], similar pans are often sold as "fluted tube pans" or given other similar descriptive titles.&lt;ref name=fante/&gt; The trademark holder [[Nordic Ware]] only produces Bundt pans in aluminum, but similar fluted pans are available in other materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Napfkuchen-Form.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to popularity==
[[File:RainbowBundt.jpg|thumb|right|Rainbow Bundt cake, partially sliced]]
The people credited with popularizing the Bundt cake are American businessman [[H. David Dalquist]] and his brother Mark S. Dalquist {{citation needed|date=November 2013}}, who co-founded [[cookware]] company [[Nordic Ware]] based in [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]]. In the late 1940s,&lt;ref name=BundtBook&gt;{{cite book

|ISBN = 978-0-87351-585-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Joshua and Fannie Schanfield, friends and members of the Minneapolis Jewish-American [[Hadassah|Hadassah Society]] approached Dalquist asking if he could produce a modern version of a traditional cast iron {{lang|de|[[Gugelhupf]]}} dish.&lt;ref name=wpost/&gt; Dalquist and company engineer Don Nygren designed a cast aluminum version which Nordic Ware then made a small production run of in 1950.  In order to successfully trademark the pans, a "t" was added to the word "Bund".&lt;ref name=oklahoman/&gt; A number of the original Bundt pans now reside in the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] collection.&lt;ref name=startribune&gt;{{cite news

|last = McKinney

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the Bundt pan sold so poorly that Nordic Ware considered discontinuing it.&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt; The product received a boost when it was mentioned in the ''New Good Housekeeping Cookbook'' in 1963,&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but did not gain real popularity until 1966, when a Bundt cake called the "Tunnel of Fudge", baked by Ella Helfrich, took second place at the annual [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]] and won its baker $5,000.&lt;ref name=BundtBook/&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt; The resulting publicity resulted in more than 200,000 requests&lt;ref name=BundtBook/&gt; to Pillsbury for Bundt pans and soon led to the Bundt pan surpassing the tin [[Jell-O]] mold as the most-sold pan in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In the 1970s [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]] licensed the name Bundt from Nordic Ware and for a while sold a range of Bundt cake mixes.&lt;ref name=oklahoman/&gt;

To date more than 60 million Bundt pans have been sold by Nordic Ware across North America.&lt;ref name=nordic&gt;{{cite web

The '''Bureau of Ocean Energy Management''' (BOEM) is an agency within the [[United States Department of the Interior]], established in 2010 by Secretarial Order.&lt;ref name="SO3299"&gt;{{Citation|last=Salazar|first=Ken|authorlink=Ken Salazar|title=Secretarial Order N¬∫ 3299|url=http://www.doi.gov/deepwaterhorizon/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;PageID=32475|format=PDF|publisher=US Department of the Interior|accessdate=May 21, 2010|date=May 19, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520165825/http://www.doi.gov/deepwaterhorizon/loader.cfm?csModule=security%2Fgetfile&amp;PageID=32475#|archive-date=2010-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act]] (OCSLA) states: "...the outer Continental Shelf is a vital national resource reserve held by the Federal Government for the public, which should be made available for expeditious and orderly development, subject to environmental safeguards, in a manner which is consistent with the {{sic|mainta|inence}} of competition and other national needs."{{Attribution needed|date=July 2012}}

BOEM and its sister agency, the [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement]] are the agencies to which this responsibility is delegated. They exercise the oil, gas, and renewable energy-related management functions formerly under the purview of the [[Minerals Management Service]] (MMS). Specifically, BOEM activities involve resource evaluation, planning, and leasing.&lt;ref name="SO3299" /&gt;

==Directors==
The agency's first director, serving from June 2010 to May 2014, was Tommy Beaudreau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Directors|url=http://www.boem.gov/Past-Directors/|website=BOEM|publisher=BOEM|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second director was Abigail Ross Hopper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abigail Ross Hopper, Director|url=http://www.boem.gov/Director/|website=BOEM|publisher=BOEM|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the deputy director Walter Cruickshank serves as the acting director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deputy Director|url=http://www.boem.gov/Deputy-Director/|website=|publisher=BOEM|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ocean floor surveys==
A function inherited from the MMS is the review of nearly 1,700 planned wells and pipelines every year. The BOEM keeps records of shipwrecks, to ensure the Nation's important historical sites are protected. These shipwrecks, when over fifty years old, are considered National landmarks, and any new wells or pipelines have to be studied for their potential effect on archaeological sites on the outer continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4Uk3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Attakapas+Wildlife+Management+Area&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiax5Oez5zSAhUJ94MKHU4-A3EQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Attakapas%20Wildlife%20Management%20Area&amp;f=false Google books]: pp 3-179 &amp; 3-180 (table 3-39 and 3-40), ''Proposed Use of Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading Systems On the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf'' - Retrieved 2017-02-19&lt;/ref&gt; 

===List of shipwrecks===
The BOEM maintains a list of shipwrecks and the location.

===WW II===
There were over 100 attacks on ships in the Gulf by German u-boats. Several were listed by the MMS and maintained by the BOEM.

*SS Carrabulle (Built 1920, lost 1942-05-26), sunk by [[German submarine U-106 (1940)|German submarine U-106]]. 
*SS Amapala (Built 1924, lost 1942-05-16), sunk by German submarine U-507&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?14914 SS Amapala]- Retrieved 2017-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known German U-boat to be sunk in the Gulf is U-166. After sinking the SS Robert E. Lee the [[United States Navy]] patrol craft PC-566 reported hitting and sinking the submarine. This was questioned and the sinking was attributed to a [[United States Coast Guard]] [[Grumman G-44 Widgeon]], that reported an attack over 100 miles away, thought to be the U-166. In 2001 the wreckage of U-166 was identified near the wreckage of the Robert E. Lee and in 2014 the record was set straight that PC-566 actually sunk U-166. In 2014 the position, {{coord|28|37|N|90|45|W|dim:400000|display=inline,title}} was designated a [[war grave]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boem.gov/BOEM-Newsroom/Press-Releases/2001/010615-pdf.aspx ''MMS Ensures Nation's Historic Shipwrecks are Protected as Archaeologists Share in U-Boat Discovery'']- Retrieved 2017-02-19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{More footnotes|date=December 2012}}
A '''carriage''' is a [[wheel]]ed vehicle for people, usually [[horse-drawn]]; [[Litter (vehicle)|litters (palanquins)]] and sedan chairs are excluded, since they are wheelless vehicles. The carriage is especially designed for private passenger use, though some are also used to transport goods. A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage ‚Äì terms for such include [[stagecoach]], [[charabanc]] and [[bus|omnibus]].  It may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable or luxurious. Carriages normally have [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] using [[leaf spring]]s, elliptical springs (in the 19th century) or leather strapping.  Working vehicles such as the (four-wheeled) [[wagon]] and (two-wheeled) [[cart]] share important parts of the history of the carriage, as does too the fast (two-wheeled) [[chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarr, Laszlo. ''The History of the Carriage''. Arco Pub. Co, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piggott, Stuart. ''Wagon, Chariot and Carriage: Symbol the Status in the History of Transport''. Thames and Hudson, London, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Herrschaftliche Kutsche.JPG|thumb|Coach of an imperial family, c&amp;nbsp;1870]]

The word ''carriage'' (abbreviated ''carr'' or ''cge'') is from [[Old Northern French]] ''cariage'', to carry in a vehicle.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 1933: Car, Carriage&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''car'', then meaning a kind of two-wheeled cart for goods, also came from Old Northern French about the beginning of the 14th century&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; (probably derived from the [[Late Latin]] ''carro'', a car&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=On False Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=81|year=1855|issue=6|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;); it was also used for [[railway carriage]]s, and was extended to cover ''[[automobile]]'' around the end of the nineteenth century, when early models were called ''[[horseless carriage]]s''.

A carriage is sometimes called a ''team'', as in "horse and team". A carriage with its horse is a ''rig''.  An elegant horse-drawn carriage with its retinue of servants is an ''equipage''. A carriage together with the horses, harness and attendants is a ''turnout'' or ''setout''. A procession of carriages is a ''cavalcade''.

==History==

===Prehistory===
Some horsecarts found in [[Celts|Celtic]] graves show hints that their platforms were suspended elastically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Raimund Karl |title=√úberlegungen zum Verkehr in der eisenzeitlichen Keltik√© |trans-title=Deliberations on Traffic in the Ironage Celtic Culture |version= |format=.PDF |publisher=Universit√§t Wien |language=German |url=http://www.ausgegraben.org/modules/Static_Docs/data/WKS/WKS3.pdf |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411122510/http://www.ausgegraben.org/modules/Static_Docs/data/WKS/WKS3.pdf |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four-wheeled wagons were used in prehistoric Europe, and their form known from excavations suggests that the basic construction techniques of wheel and undercarriage (that survived until the age of the motor car) were established then.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Piggott, ''The Earliest Wheeled Transport'' (1983); C.F.E Pare, ''Wagons and Wagon-Graves of the Early Iron Age in Central Europe''. (Oxford, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chariot===
The earliest recorded sort of carriage was the [[chariot]], reaching Mesopotamia as early as 1900 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgFPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=earliest++carriage+was+the+chariot,used+in+Mesopotamia+in+1900+BC&amp;dq=earliest++carriage+was+the+chariot,used+in+Mesopotamia+in+1900+BC&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZuYWWy7PVAhUB1GMKHbTCBB8Q6AEILjAB|title=The history of the carriage|last=Tarr|first=L√°szl√≥|date=1969|publisher=Arco Pub. Co.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Used typically for warfare by Egyptians, the near Easterners and Europeans, it was essentially a two-wheeled light basin carrying one or two passengers, drawn by one to two horses.  The chariot was revolutionary and effective because it delivered fresh warriors to crucial areas of battle with swiftness.

===Roman carriage===
First century BC [[Roman Republic|Romans]] used sprung wagons for overland journeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jochen Garbsch |title=Restoration of a Roman travelling wagon and of a wagon from the Hallstadt bronze culture |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~arch/mitt/mitt040.htm |publisher=Leibniz-Rechenzentrum M√ºnchen |format=.HTML |language=German |date=June 1986 |accessdate=2008-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424224047/http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~arch/mitt/mitt040.htm |archivedate=2008-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Roman carriages employed some form of suspension on chains or leather straps, as indicated by carriage parts found in excavations.

===Ancient Chinese carriage===
In the kingdom of the Zhou Dynasty the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] were also known to have used carriages as transportation. With the decline of these civilizations these techniques almost disappeared.

===Medieval carriage===
[[File:Kobelwagen, Jean Le Tavernier, nach 1455.jpg|thumb|upright|Horse-drawn wagon, c. 1455]]
[[File:A two-tiered carriage drawn by four elephants.jpg|thumb|A two-tiered carriage drawn by four elephants]]
The medieval carriage was typically a four-wheeled wagon type, with a rounded top ('tilt') similar in appearance to the [[Conestoga Wagon]] familiar from the United States.  Sharing the traditional form of wheels and undercarriage known since the Bronze Age, it very likely also employed the pivoting fore-axle in continuity from the ancient world.  Suspension (on chains) is recorded in visual images and written accounts from the 14th century ('chars branlant' or rocking carriages), and was in widespread use by the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Munby" &gt;Julian Munby, ‚ÄòFrom Carriage to Coach: What Happened?‚Äô, in Robert Bork and Andrea Kann (eds) The art, science, and technology of medieval travel (Ashgate, 2008), pp.41‚Äì53.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carriages were largely used by royalty, aristocrats (and especially by women), and could be elaborately decorated and gilded.  These carriages were on four wheels often and were pulled by two to four horses depending on how they were decorated (elaborate decoration with gold lining made the carriage heavier).  Wood and iron were the primary requirements needed to build a carriage and carriages that were used by non-royalty were covered by plain leather.

Another form of carriage was the [[pageant wagon]] of the 14th century.  Historians debate on the structure and size of pageant wagons; however, they are generally miniature house-like structures that rest on four to six wheels depending on the size of the wagon.  The pageant wagon is significant because up until the 14th century most carriages were on two or 3 wheels; the chariot, rocking carriage, and baby carriage are two examples of carriages which pre-date the pageant wagon.  Historians also debate whether or not pageant wagons were built with pivotal axle systems, which allowed the wheels to turn.  Whether it was a four- or six-wheel pageant wagon, most historians maintain that pivotal axle systems were implemented on pageant wagons because many roads were often winding with some sharp turns.  Six wheel pageant wagons also represent another innovation in carriages; they were one of the first carriages to use multiple pivotal axles.  Pivotal axles were used on the front set of wheels and the middle set of wheels.  This allowed the horse to move freely and steer the carriage in accordance with the road or path.

===Coach===
{{Main|Coach (carriage)}}
[[File:Koets Brussel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.14|A Gala Coup√©, 18th century; [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], Brussels]]
One of the great innovations of the carriage was the invention of the suspended carriage or the ''chariot branlant'' (though whether this was a Roman or medieval innovation remains uncertain).  The 'chariot branlant' of medieval illustrations was suspended by chains rather than leather straps as had been believed.&lt;ref&gt;L√©on marquis De Laborde. ''Glossaire fran√ßais du Moyen Age''. Labitte, Paris, 1872. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert and Kann, Andrea (eds) ''The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel''. Ashgate Publishing, 2008, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chains provided a smoother ride in the chariot branlant because the compartment no longer rested on the turning axles. In the 15th century, carriages were made lighter and needed only one horse to haul the carriage. This carriage was designed and innovated in [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012. p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Both innovations appeared around the same time and historians believe that people began comparing the chariot branlant and the Hungarian light coach.  However, the earliest illustrations of the Hungarian 'Kochi-wagon' do not indicate any suspension, and often the use of three horses in harness.

Under King [[Mathias Corvinus]] (1458‚Äì90), who enjoyed fast travel, the Hungarians developed fast road transport, and the town of [[Kocs]] between [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] became an important post-town, and gave its name to the new vehicle type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED 1933|Coach}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian [[Coach (carriage)|coach]] was highly praised because it was capable of holding 8 men, used light wheels, could be towed by only one horse (it may have been suspended by leather straps, but this is a topic of debate).&lt;ref name="Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264"&gt;Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultimately it was the Hungarian coach that generated a greater buzz of conversation than the chariot branlant of [[France]] because it was a much smoother ride.&lt;ref name="Baofu, Peter 2012, p. 264"/&gt;  Henceforth, the Hungarian coach spread across Europe rather quickly, in part due to [[Ippolito d'Este of Ferrara]] (1479‚Äì1529), nephew of Mathias' queen [[Beatrix of Aragon]], who as a very junior Archbishopric of [[Esztergom]] developed a liking of Hungarian riding and took his carriage and driver back to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bork, Robert and Kann, Andrea (eds) ''The Art, Science, and Technology of Medieval Travel''. Ashgate Publishing, 2008. p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Around 1550 the 'coach' made its appearance throughout the major cities of Europe, and the new word entered the vocabulary of all their languages.&lt;ref&gt;Etymology for ''Coach'' in ''Oxford English Dictionary'', Second Edition. Oxford University Press, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the new 'coach' seems to have been a concept (fast road travel for men) as much as any particular type of vehicle, and there is no obvious change that accompanied the innovation.  As it moved throughout Europe in the late 16th century, the coach‚Äôs body structure was ultimately changed, from a round-top to the 'four-poster' carriages that became standard by c.1600.&lt;ref name="Munby" /&gt;

===Later development of the coach===
[[File:James Pollard - The London-Faringdon Coach passing Buckland House, Berkshire - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|The London-Farringdon coach, 1835]]
The coach had doors in the side, with an iron step protected by leather that became the "boot" in which servants might ride.  The driver sat on a seat at the front, and the most important occupant sat in the back facing forwards.  The earliest coaches can be seen at Veste Coburg, Lisbon, and the Moscow Kremlin, and they become a commonplace in European art.  It was not until the 17th century that further innovations with steel springs and glazing took place, and only in the 18th century, with better road surfaces, was there a major innovation with the introduction of the steel [[Spring (device)|C-spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Baofu, Peter. ''The Future of Post-Human Transportation'.' Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the 18th century that steering systems were truly improved. [[Erasmus Darwin]] was a young English doctor who was driving a carriage about 10,000 miles a year to visit patients all over England.  Darwin found two essential problems or shortcomings of the commonly used light carriage or Hungarian carriage.  First, the front wheels were turned by a pivoting front axle, which had been used for years, but these wheels were often quite small and hence the rider, carriage and horse felt the brunt of every bump on the road.  Secondly, he recognized the danger of overturning.

A pivoting front axle changes a carriage‚Äôs base from a rectangle to a triangle because the wheel on the inside of the turn is able to turn more sharply than the outside front wheel. Darwin proposed to fix these insufficiencies by proposing a principle in which the two front wheels turn about a centre that lies on the extended line of the back axle. This idea was later patented as [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackerman Steering]].  Darwin argued that carriages would then be easier to pull and less likely to overturn.

Carriage use in [[North America]] came with the establishment of European settlers.  Early colonial horse tracks quickly grew into roads especially as the colonists extended their territories southwest.  Colonists began using carts as these roads and trading increased between the north and south.  Eventually, carriages or coaches were sought to transport goods as well as people.  As in Europe, chariots, coaches and/or carriages were a mark of status.  The tobacco planters of the South were some of the first Americans to use the carriage as a form of human transportation.  As the tobacco farming industry grew in the southern colonies so did the frequency of carriages, coaches and wagons.  Upon the turn of the 18th century wheeled vehicle use in the colonies was at an all-time high.  Carriages, coaches and wagons were being taxed based on the number of wheels they had.  These taxes were implemented in the South primarily as the South had superior numbers of horses and wheeled vehicles when compared to the North.  Europe, however, still used carriage transportation far more often and on a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world.

Carriages and coaches began to disappear as use of steam propulsion began to generate more and more interest and research.  Steam power quickly won the battle against animal power as is evident by a newspaper article written in England in 1895 entitled "Horseflesh vs. Steam".&lt;ref&gt;Mechanical Road Carriages: Horseflesh V. Steam. The British Medical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1823 (Dec. 7, 1895), pp.&amp;nbsp;1434‚Äì1435. BMJ Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt;  The article highlights the death of the carriage as the means of transportation.

Nowadays, carriages are still used for day-to-day transport in the United States by some minority groups such as the [[Amish]]. They are also still used in the [[tourism]] as vehicles for [[sightseeing]] in cities such as [[Bruges]], [[Vienna]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].

The most complete working collection of carriages can be seen at the [[Royal Mews]] in London where a large selection of vehicles is in regular use.  These are supported by a staff of liveried coachmen, footmen and [[postillion]]s.  The horses earn their keep by supporting the work of the Royal Household, particularly during ceremonial events.  Horses pulling a large carriage known as a "covered brake" collect the Yeoman of the Guard in their distinctive red uniforms from St James's Palace for Investitures at Buckingham Palace; High Commissioners or Ambassadors are driven to their audiences with The Queen in [[landau (carriage)|landaus]]; visiting heads of state are transported to and from official arrival ceremonies and members of the Royal Family are driven in Royal Mews coaches during Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service at Windsor Castle and carriage processions at the beginning of each day of Royal Ascot.

==Construction==

===Body===
[[File:Elizabethboweslyonandkinggeorgeincanada.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|right|[[George VI]] and [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth]] in a landau with footmen and a postillion, riding on the near wheel horse, controlling both teams of horses. Canada 1939]]
Carriages may be enclosed or open, depending on the type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Horse Carriage Parts Horse Drawn Vehicle | url=http://www.liveryone.net/parts.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=2003-10-30 | accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top cover for the body of a carriage, called the ''head'' or ''hood'', is often flexible and designed to be folded back when desired. Such a folding top is called a ''bellows top'' or ''[[calash]]''. A ''hoopstick'' forms a light framing member for this kind of hood. The top, roof or second-story compartment of a closed carriage, especially a diligence, was called an ''imperial''. A closed carriage may have side windows called ''quarter lights'' (British) as well as windows in the doors, hence a "glass coach". On the forepart of an open carriage, a screen of wood or leather called a ''[[dashboard]]'' intercepts water, mud or snow thrown up by the heels of the horses. The dashboard or carriage top sometimes has a projecting sidepiece called a ''wing'' (British). A ''foot iron'' or ''footplate'' may serve as a carriage step.

A carriage driver sits on a ''box'' or ''perch'', usually elevated and small. When at the front it is known as a ''dickey box'', a term also used for a seat at the back for servants. A [[footman]] might use a small platform at the rear called a ''footboard'' or a seat called a ''[[rumble seat|rumble]]'' behind the body. Some carriages have a moveable seat called a ''jump seat''. Some seats had an attached backrest called a ''lazyback''.

The shafts of a carriage were called ''limbers'' in English dialect. ''Lancewood'', a tough elastic wood of various trees, was often used especially for carriage shafts. A ''holdback'', consisting of an iron catch on the shaft with a looped strap, enables a horse to back or hold back the vehicle. The end of the tongue of a carriage is suspended from the collars of the harness by a bar called the ''yoke''. At the end of a [[trace (tack)|trace]], a loop called a ''cockeye'' attaches to the carriage.

In some carriage types the body is suspended from several leather straps called ''braces'' or ''thoroughbraces'', attached to or serving as springs.

===Undergear===
Beneath the carriage body is the ''undergear'' or ''undercarriage'' (or simply ''carriage''), consisting of the running gear and chassis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | title=Basic Carriage Gear Horse Drawn Vehicles | url=http://www.liveryone.net/gear.shtml | publisher=Great Northern Livery Company, Inc. | date=2003-11-02 | accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wheels and axles, in distinction from the body, are the ''running gear''. The wheels revolve upon bearings or a spindle at the ends of a bar or beam called an ''axle'' or ''axletree''. Most carriages have either one or two axles. On a four-wheeled vehicle, the forward part of the running gear, or ''forecarriage'', is arranged to permit the front axle to turn independently of the fixed rear axle. In some carriages a '[[dropped axle]]', bent twice at a right angle near the ends, allows a low body with large wheels. A guard called a ''dirtboard'' keeps dirt from the axle arm.

Several structural members form parts of the chassis supporting the carriage body. The fore axletree and the splinter bar above it (supporting the springs) are united by a piece of wood or metal called a ''futchel'', which forms a socket for the pole that extends from the front axle. For strength and support, a rod called the ''backstay'' may extend from either end of the rear axle to the reach, the pole or rod joining the hind axle to the forward bolster above the front axle.

A skid called a ''drag'', ''dragshoe'', ''shoe'' or ''skidpan'' retards the motion of the wheels. A London patent of 1841 describes one such apparatus: An iron-shod beam, slightly longer than the radius of the wheel, is hinged under the axle so that when it is released to strike the ground the forward momentum of the vehicle wedges it against the axle. The original feature of this modification was that, instead of the usual practice of having to stop the carriage to retract the beam and so lose useful momentum, the chain holding it in place is released (from the driver's position) so that it is allowed  to rotate further in its backwards direction, releasing the axle. A system of "pendant-levers" and straps then allows the beam to return to its first position  and be ready for further use.&lt;ref&gt;Patent 9020, 7 July 1841, awarded to Thomas Fuller, a coach-builder of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A catch or block called a ''trigger'' may be used to hold a wheel on a declivity.

A horizontal wheel or segment of a wheel called a ''[[Fifth wheel coupling|fifth wheel]]'' sometimes forms an extended support to prevent the carriage from tipping; it consists of two parts rotating on each other about the kingbolt above the fore axle and beneath the body. A block of wood called a ''headblock'' might be placed between the fifth wheel and the forward spring.

=== Fittings ===
Many of these fittings were carried over to [[horseless carriage]]s and evolved into the modern elements of automobiles. During the [[Brass Era car|Brass Era]] they were often the same parts on either type of carriage (i.e., horse-drawn or horseless). 
* Upholstery (trimming): traditionally similar to the [[upholstery]] of [[furniture]]; evolved into car interior ulholstery such as [[car seat]]s and door trim panels
* Carriage lamps: typically [[oil lamp]]s for centuries, although [[carbide lamp]]s and battery-powered [[electric light|electric lamp]]s were also used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; evolved into car [[headlamp]]s
* Trunk: a [[trunk (luggage)|luggage trunk]] serving the same purpose as, and which gave its name to, later [[trunk (car)|car trunks]]
* [[Toolbox]]: a small box with enough [[hand tool]]s to make simple repairs on the roadside
* [[Blanket]]s: in winter, blankets for the driver and passengers and often [[horse blanket]]s as well
* [[Running board]]: a step to assist in climbing onto the carriage and also sometimes a place for [[standing passenger]]s
* [[Shovel]]: useful for mud and snow in the roadway, to free the carriage from being stuck; was especially important in the era when most roads were [[dirt road]]s, often with deep [[rut (roads)|ruts]]
* [[Whip#Buggy whip and coachwhip|Buggy whip or coachwhip]]: whips for the horses. For obvious reasons, this is one of the components of carriage equipment that did not carry over from horse-drawn carriages to horseless carriages, and that fact has made such whips one of the prototypical or stereotypical examples of products whose manufacture is subject to [[disruptive innovation]]

== Types ==
===Pony trap or horse trap===
[[File:Old horse cart at Snowshill Manor.jpg|thumb|right|An old horse trap at [[Snowshill Manor]]]]
A '''trap''', '''pony trap''' or '''horse trap''' is a light, often sporty, two-wheeled or sometimes four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage, accommodating usually two to four persons in various seating arrangements, such as face-to-face or back-to-back.

===Tonga/tanga (Indian horse carriage)===
{{Main|Tanga (carriage)}}

A '''tanga''' ([[Hindi]]: ‡§ü‡§æ‡§Å‡§ó‡§æ, [[Urdu]]: ŸπÿßŸÜ⁄Ø€Å, [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: ‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶æ) or '''Tonga''' is a light horse-drawn carriage used for transportation in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Bangladesh]]. Tangas are a popular mode of transportation because they are fun to ride in, and are usually cheaper to hire than a [[Taxicab|taxi]] or [[Auto rickshaw|rickshaw]]. However, in many cities, tangas are not allowed to use highways because of their slow pace. In [[Pakistan]], tangas are mainly found in the older parts of cities and towns, and are becoming less popular for utilitarian travel and more popular for pleasure. Tangas have become a traditional feature of [[weddings]] and other social functions in Pakistan, as well as in other nations. They are usually pulled by two horses, though some require only one. Others are designed for farm work. The room under the seats is sometimes used by the coachman (locally called "coach-waan") to keep his horse's food and sometimes to keep luggage if required.

Tangas are used for economic activity, mainly to carry heavy goods within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/transport/carts/30011.htm kamat's Potpourri: Carts of India ‚Äì Horse Pulled Carriage (Tonga)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tangas were the most common means of transport in urban India and Pakistan until the early 1980s. Although [[autorickshaw]]s have overtaken them in popularity, tangas are still common today in many cities and villages.

===Volante===
A '''volante''' is a two-wheeled, one- or two-passenger Spanish carriage formerly much used in [[Cuba]]. The axle was behind an open, hooded body. The carriage was driven by a rider on the horse.

===Araba===
{{Main|Araba (carriage)}}
&lt;!-- Missing image: [[File:Chevalier Auguste de Henikstein - Araba. Voiture de Constantinople.jpg|thumb|Araba, [[Ottoman Empire]], 1825]] --&gt;
An '''araba''' (from [[Arabic]]: ÿπÿ±ÿ®ÿ©, ''araba'' or {{lang-tr|araba}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/araba "araba."] Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary. MICRA, Inc. 28 Feb. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;) (also '''arba''' or '''aroba''') is a carriage (such as a [[Cabriolet (carriage)|cabriolet]] or [[coach (carriage)|coach]]), [[wagon]] or [[cart]] drawn by horses or oxen, used in [[Turkey]] and neighboring [[Middle East]]ern countries. It is usually heavy and without springs, and often covered.

===Words related to carriages===
The names of many of these have now passed into obscurity but some have been adopted to describe automotive [[car body style]]s:  ''coup√©,'' ''victoria,'' ''[[Brougham (car body)|brougham]],'' ''[[Landau (car)|landau]]'' and ''[[Landau (car)|landaulet]]'', ''cabriolet'' (giving us our ''cab''), ''[[Phaeton body|phaeton]],'' and ''[[limousine]]'' ‚Äì all these once denoted particular types of carriages.

A person whose business was to drive a carriage was a ''[[coachman]]''. A servant in livery called a ''[[footman]]'' or ''piquer'' formerly served in attendance upon a rider or was required to run before his master's carriage to clear the way. An attendant on horseback called an ''outrider'' often rode ahead of or next to a carriage. A ''carriage starter'' directed the flow of vehicles taking on passengers at the curbside. A ''hackneyman'' hired out horses and carriages. When hawking wares, a ''hawker'' was often assisted by a carriage.

Upper-class people of wealth and social position, those wealthy enough to keep carriages, were referred to as ''carriage folk'' or ''carriage trade''.

Carriage passengers often used a ''lap robe'' as a blanket or similar covering for their legs, lap and feet. A ''buffalo robe'', made from the hide of an [[American bison]] dressed with the hair on, was sometimes used as a carriage robe; it was commonly trimmed to rectangular shape and lined on the skin side with fabric. A ''carriage boot'', fur-trimmed for winter wear, was made usually of fabric with a fur or felt lining. A ''knee boot'' protected the knees from rain or splatter.

A [[horse]] especially bred for carriage use by appearance and stylish action is called a ''carriage horse''; one for use on a road is a ''road horse''. One such breed is the ''[[Cleveland Bay]]'', uniformly [[Bay (horse)|bay]] in color, of good conformation and strong constitution. Horses were broken in using a bodiless carriage frame called a ''break'' or ''brake''.

A ''[[carriage dog]]'' or ''coach dog'' is bred for running beside a carriage.

A roofed structure that extends from the entrance of a building over an adjacent driveway and that shelters callers as they get in or out of their vehicles is known as a ''carriage porch'' or ''[[porte cochere]]''. An outbuilding for a carriage is a ''coach house'', which was often combined with accommodation for a [[groom]] or other servants.

A ''[[livery stable]]'' kept horses and usually carriages for hire. A range of stables, usually with ''[[carriage house]]s'' (''remises'') and living quarters built around a yard, court or street, is called a ''[[mews]]''.

A kind of dynamometer called a ''peirameter'' indicates the power necessary to haul a carriage over a road or track.

==Competitive driving==
{{Main|Driving (horse)|Combined driving|Draft horse showing|Roadster (horse)}}
In most European and English-speaking countries, driving is a competitive equestrian sport. Many [[horse show]]s host driving competitions for a particular style of driving, breed of horse, or type of vehicle. Show vehicles are usually carriages, [[cart]]s, or [[horse and buggy|buggies]] and, occasionally, [[sulky|sulkies]] or [[wagon]]s. Modern high-technology carriages are made purely for competition by companies such as Bennington Carriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bennington.co.uk |title=Bennington Carriages homepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England.
Terminology varies: the simple, lightweight two- or four-wheeled show vehicle common in many nations is called a "cart" in the USA, but a "carriage" in Australia.

Internationally, there is intense competition in the all-round test of driving: [[combined driving]], also known as ''horse-driving trials'', an equestrian discipline regulated by the [[F√©d√©ration √âquestre Internationale]] (International Equestrian Federation) with national organizations representing each member country. World championships are conducted in alternate years, including single-horse, horse pairs and four-in-hand championships. The [[World Equestrian Games]], held at four-year intervals, also includes a four-in-hand competition.

For [[pony]] drivers, the World Combined Pony Championships are held every two years and include singles, pairs and four-in-hand events.

==Types of horse-drawn carriages==
[[File:Wien Stefansdom fiaker DSC02643.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.91|In Vienna, rentable [[Landau (carriage)|landau]]s called ''[[Fiacre (carriage)|Fiacre]]s'' carry tourists around the old city.]]

An almost bewildering variety of horse-drawn carriages existed. Arthur Ingram's ''Horse Drawn Vehicles since 1760 in Colour'' lists 325 types with a short description of each. By the early 19th century one's choice of carriage was only in part based on practicality and performance; it was also a status statement and subject to changing fashions. The types of carriage included the following:

[[File:Burj Khalifa window cleaning.jpg|thumb|Team of [[window cleaner]]s at the [[Burj Khalifa]] in Dubai]]  
A '''cleaner''' or '''cleaning operative''' is a type of industrial or [[domestic worker]] who cleans homes or commercial premises for [[payment]].  Cleaning Operatives may specialise in cleaning particular things or places, such as [[window cleaner]]s.  Cleaning operatives often work when the people who otherwise occupy the space are not around.  They may clean offices at night or houses during the workday. 

The 2000 film ''[[Bread and Roses (2000 film)|Bread and Roses]]'' by British director [[Ken Loach]] depicted the struggle of cleaners in [[Los Angeles, California]] to fight for better pay and working conditions, and the right to join a [[trades union|union]]. In an interview with the [[BBC]] in 2001, Loach stated that thousands of cleaners from around 30 countries have since contacted him with tales similar to the one told in the film.

The [[cleaning industry]] is quite big as there are different types of cleaning required depending on the shape and size of object or property. If you want to get an office space cleaned then you would require the services of a commercial cleaner whereas if you want to clean your house then you would require domestic cleaning services. Depending on the task, even these categories can be sub divided such as Bond cleaners, carpet cleaners, upholstery cleaners, window cleaners, car cleaning services etc. Different types of cleaners specialize in their own industry, you cannot ask a window cleaner to do a marvelous job at carpet cleaning. Some of the types of cleaners are mentioned below.

===Apartment/house cleaners===
These cleaning operatives are quite easy to find due to their large numbers, they are usually denoted as [[maid service]] providers, [[janitors]] and domestic cleaning operatives. These type of operatives specialize in [[house cleaning]] services such as spring cleaning, [[Damage deposit|bond]] (damage deposit) cleaning etc. Most of the house cleaning operatives are known to give good attention to details, but due to their large numbers it can be quite hard to find the right cleaning operative who is trustworthy and works effectively. The cost of this type of service depends on the demand for the service and the number of providers. In Australia, you can hire a household cleaner from anywhere between $20‚Äì$30 an hour. In countries like [[India]], [[China]], [[Philippines]] etc., where the labor rates are quite low, people can afford a full-time maid or domestic cleaner.

==Typical cleaning equipment==
The following are some items used by cleaning staff:

* [[Broom]]/[[Dustpan]]
* [[Bucket]]s with water/cleaning solution
* [[Cleaning agent]]s
* [[Floor polisher]]
* [[Garbage bag]]
* Hand [[feather duster]] and/or [[microfibre]] floor duster
* [[Mop]] and [[Mop bucket cart]]
* [[Towel]]s used to wipe desks
* [[Vacuum cleaner]]
* [[Wet floor sign]]

[[Image:CSO diagram US EPA.jpg|right|thumb|360px|'''Combined sewer system'''. During dry weather (and small storms), all flows are handled by the [[publicly owned treatment works]] (POTW).  During large storms, the relief structure allows some of the combined [[stormwater]] and [[sewage]] to be discharged untreated to an adjacent water body.]]
A '''combined sewer''' is a [[sewage]] collection system of pipes and tunnels designed to simultaneously collect [[surface runoff]] water in a shared system. This type of [[gravity sewer]] design is no longer used in almost every instance worldwide when constructing new sewer systems. Modern-day sewer designs exclude surface runoff from [[sanitary sewer]]s, but many older cities and towns continue to operate previously constructed combined sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |date=1972 |title=Wastewater Engineering |location=New York |publisher=McGraw‚ÄìHill |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined sewers can cause serious [[water pollution]] problems during '''combined sewer overflow''' ('''CSO''') events when combined sewage and surface runoff flows exceed the capacity of the [[sewage treatment]] plant, or of the maximum flow rate of the system which transmits the combined sources. In instances where exceptionally high surface runoff occurs (such as large rainstorms), the load on individual tributary branches of the sewer system may cause a back-up to a point where raw sewage flows out of input sources such a toilets, causing inhabited buildings to be flooded with a toxic sewage-runoff mixture, incurring massive financial burdens for cleanup and repair. When combined sewer systems experience these higher than normal throughputs, relief systems cause discharges containing human and industrial waste to flow into rivers, streams, or other bodies of water. Such events frequently cause both negative environmental and lifestyle consequences, including beach closures, contaminated shellfish unsafe for consumption, and contamination of drinking water sources, rendering them temporarily unsafe for drinking and requiring boiling before uses such as bathing or washing dishes.&lt;ref name="EPARTC"&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-833-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Recent archaeological discoveries have shown that some of the earliest sewer systems were developed 2500 BC in the ancient city of [[Harappa]]. The primitive sewers were carved in the ground alongside buildings. This discovery reveals the conceptual understanding of waste disposal by the early civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;handyrubbish.co.uk. [https://handyrubbish.co.uk/blog/brief-history-of-sewers-in-the-ancient-world.html "Brief History of Sewers in the Ancient World."]{{Better source|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest sewers were designed to carry street runoff away from inhabited areas and into surface waterways without treatment.  Open sewers, consisting of gutters and urban streambeds, were common worldwide before the 20th century. In the majority of developed countries, large efforts were made during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to cover the formerly open sewers, converting them to closed systems with cast iron, steel, or concrete pipes, masonry, and concrete arches. Most sewage collection systems of the 19th and early to mid 20th century used single-pipe systems that collect both sewage and [[urban runoff]] from streets and roofs. This type of collection system is referred to as a combined sewer system. The rationale for combining the two was that it would be cheaper to build just a single system.&lt;ref name="Burrian"&gt;{{cite report |authors=Burrian, Steven J., et al. |date=1999 |title=The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/2000E6J7.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA/600/JA-99/275}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Most cities at that time did not have [[sewage treatment]] plants, so there was no perceived public health advantage in constructing a separate "surface water sewerage" (UK terminology) or "[[storm drain|storm sewer]]" (US terminology) system.&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 2‚Äì3}}

When constructed, combined sewer systems were typically sized to carry three&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 2‚Äì4}} to 160 times the average dry weather sewage flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawler |first=Joseph C. |authorlink = |title =Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1969 |location = |page =136 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally infeasible to treat the volume of mixed sewage and surface runoff flowing in a combined sewer during peak runoff events caused by [[snowmelt]] or [[convective precipitation]]. As cities built sewage treatment plants, those plants were typically built to treat only the volume of sewage flowing during dry weather. Relief structures were installed in the collection system to bypass untreated sewage mixed with surface runoff during wet weather, protecting sewage treatment plants from damage caused if peak flows reached the [[headworks]].&lt;ref name=stpd&gt;{{cite book |last=Okun |first=Daniel A. |authorlink = |title =Sewage Treatment Plant Design |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1959 |location = |page =6 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combined sewer overflows (CSOs)==
[[File:Anacostia combined sewer outflow 2018.jpg|thumb|Combined sewer outflow into the [[Anacostia River]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
[[Image:Manhole Brighton.jpg|right|thumb|Photo of the interior of a combined sewer in [[Brighton, England]].]]

These relief structures, called '''storm-water regulators''' (in [[American English]] - or '''combined sewer overflows''' in [[British English]]) are constructed in combined sewer systems to divert flows in excess of the peak design flow of the sewage treatment plant.&lt;ref name=stpd/&gt; Combined sewers are built with control sections establishing stage-discharge or pressure differential-discharge relationships which may be either predicted or calibrated to divert flows in excess of sewage treatment plant capacity. A [[hydraulic jump|leaping weir]] may be used as a regulating device allowing typical dry-weather sewage flow rates to fall into an interceptor sewer to the sewage treatment plant, but causing a major portion of higher flow rates to leap over the interceptor into the diversion outfall. Alternatively, an orifice may be sized to accept the sewage treatment plant design capacity and cause excess flow to accumulate above the orifice until it overtops a side-overflow weir to the diversion outfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawler |first=Joseph C. |authorlink = |title =Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers |publisher =[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] and Water Pollution Control Federation |volume = |edition = |date =1969 |location = |pages =112‚Äì114 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSO statistics may be confusing because the term may describe either the number of events or the number of relief structure locations at which such events may occur. A CSO event, as the term is used in American English, occurs when mixed sewage and stormwater are bypassed from a combined sewer system control section into a river, stream, lake, or ocean through a designed diversion [[outfall]], but without treatment. Overflow frequency and duration varies both from system to system, and from outfall to outfall, within a single combined sewer system. Some CSO outfalls discharge infrequently, while others activate every time it rains.&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|pp. 2‚Äì3, 2‚Äì4}}

The storm water component contributes pollutants to CSO; but a major faction of pollution is the [[first foul flush]] of accumulated [[biofilm]] and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather [[wetted perimeter]] of combined sewers during peak flow [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/rrr/wiki-internal/files/sediment%20control.pdf |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |website=[[University of California Los Angeles]] |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each storm is different in the quantity and type of pollutants it contributes. For example, storms that occur in late summer, when it has not rained for a while, have the most pollutants. Pollutants like oil, grease, [[fecal coliform]] from pet and wildlife waste, and [[pesticide]]s get flushed into the sewer system. In cold weather areas, pollutants from cars, people and animals also accumulate on hard surfaces and grass during the winter and then are flushed into the sewer systems during heavy spring rains.

===Health impacts===
CSO discharges during heavy storms can cause serious water pollution problems. The discharges contain human and industrial waste, and can cause beach closings, restrictions on shellfish consumption and contamination of drinking water sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress on Impacts and Control of Combined Sewer Overflows and Sanitary Sewer Overflows; Fact Sheet |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 833-R-04-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to sanitary sewer overflows===
CSOs should not be confused with [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s. Sanitary sewer overflows are caused by sewer system obstructions, damage, or flows in excess of sewer capacity (rather than treatment plant capacity.)&lt;ref name="EPARTC"/&gt;{{rp|Ch.4}} Sanitary sewer overflows may occur at any low spot in the sewer system rather than at the CSO relief structures. Absence of a diversion outfall often causes sanitary sewer overflows to flood residential structures and/or flow over traveled road surfaces before reaching natural drainage channels. Sanitary sewer overflows may cause greater health risks and environmental damage than CSOs if they occur during dry weather when there is no precipitation runoff to dilute and flush away sewage pollutants.

===CSOs in the United States===
[[File:CSO map EPA 2008.jpg|thumb|Most of the US combined sewer systems are in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Great Lakes region|Great Lakes]] regions, and the [[Pacific Northwest]].]]
About 860 communities in the US have combined sewer systems, serving about 40&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/combined-sewer-overflow-frequent-questions |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Frequent Questions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pollutants from CSO discharges can include [[bacteria]] and other [[pathogen]]s, [[toxicity|toxic]] chemicals, and debris. These pollutants have also been linked with [[antimicrobial resistance]], posing serious public health concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neha.org/node/58616 |title=Using Multiple Antibiotic Resistance Profiles of Coliforms as a Tool to Investigate Combined Sewer Overflow Contamination |author=Dhiman, Gaurav |date=2016 |publisher=Journal of Environmental Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) issued a policy in 1994 requiring municipalities to make improvements to reduce or eliminate CSO-related pollution problems.&lt;ref name="CSO Policy"&gt;EPA (1994-04-19). [https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/owm0111.pdf "Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Control Policy."] ''[[Federal Register]]'', 59 FR 18688.&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed by the [[Clean Water Act#NPDES permits for point sources|National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)]] permit program. The policy defined water quality parameters for the safety of an ecosystem; it allowed for action that are site specific to control CSOs in most practical way for community; it made sure the CSO control is not beyond a community‚Äôs budget; and allowed water quality parameters to be flexible, based upon the site specific conditions. The CSO Control Policy required all states to have ‚Ä≥nine minimum controls‚Ä≥ in place by January 1, 1997, to decrease the effects of sewage overflow by making small improvements in existing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Perciasepe |first=Robert |date=1996-11-18 |title=January 1, 1997, Deadline for Nine Minimum Controls in Combined Sewer Overflow Control Policy (Memorandum) |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-cso-policy-memos |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 [[United States Congress|Congress]] amended the [[Clean Water Act]] to require the municipalities to comply with the EPA policy.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Wet Weather Quality Act of 2000, Section 112 of Division B, {{USPL|106|554}}, December 21, 2000. Added section 402(q) to Clean Water Act, {{USC|33|1342(q)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation of CSOs==
The United Kingdom [[Environment Agency]] identified unsatisfactory intermittent discharges and issued an Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring action to limit pollution from combined sewer overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thompsonrpm.com/screens/pdf/TRPM-TN002.pdf |title=Combined Sewer Overflows |publisher=Thompson Research‚ÄìProject Management Ltd |location=Stockton-on-Tees, UK |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111132442/http://www.thompsonrpm.com/screens/pdf/TRPM-TN002.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the [[Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment]] adopted a Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent including national standards to (1)&amp;nbsp;remove floating material from combined sewer overflows, (2)&amp;nbsp;prevent combined sewer overflows during dry weather, and (3)&amp;nbsp;prevent development or redevelopment from increasing frequency of combined sewer overflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2009-02-17 |title=Canada-wide Strategy for the Management of Municipal Wastewater Effluent |url=http://www.usatrenchless.com/wp-content/uploads/cda_wide_strategy_mwwe_final_e.pdf |publisher=Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipalities in the US have been undertaking projects to mitigate CSO since the 1990s. For example, prior to 1990, the quantity of untreated combined sewage discharged annually to lakes, rivers and streams in southeast [[Michigan]] was estimated at more than {{convert|30|e9USgal|m3}} per year. In 2005, with nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion of a planned $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion CSO investment put into operation, untreated discharges have been reduced by more than {{convert|20|e9USgal|m3}} per year. This investment that has yielded an 85 percent reduction in CSO has included numerous sewer separation, CSO storage and treatment facilities and wastewater treatment plant improvements constructed by local and regional governments.&lt;ref name="SEMCOG"&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2008 |title=Investment in Reducing Combined Sewer Overflows Pays Dividends |url=http://semcog.org/desktopmodules/SEMCOG.Publications/GetFile.ashx?filename=InvestmentInReducingCombinedSewerOverflowsPaysDividendsSeptember2008.pdf |publisher=Southeast Michigan Council of Governments |location=Detroit, MI |pages=1‚Äì6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other areas in the US are undertaking similar projects (see, for example, [[Environmental issues in Puget Sound#Combined Sewage Overflow (CSO) in the Puget Sound|in the Puget Sound]] of Washington).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2012 |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Control Program: Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/media/PDF/120521PR-SPU-CSO-FAQs.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515150901/http://www.seattle.gov/mayor/media/PDF/120521PR-SPU-CSO-FAQs.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-15 |publisher=Seattle Public Utilities |location=Seattle, WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cities like [[Pittsburgh]], [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City|New York]] are focusing on these projects partly because they are under federal consent decrees to solve their CSO issues. Both up-front penalties and stipulated penalties are utilized by EPA and state agencies to enforce CSO-mitigating initiatives and the efficiency of their schedules. Municipalities' sewage departments, engineering and design firms, and environmental organizations offer different approaches to potential solutions.

===Sewer separation===
Some US cities have undertaken sewer separation projects ‚Äî building a second piping system for all or part of the community. In many of these projects, cities have been able to separate only portions of their combined systems. High costs or physical limitations may preclude building a completely separate system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Management Fact Sheet: Sewer Separation |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sepa.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-99-041}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Washington, D.C.]] separated its sewers in four small neighborhoods at a cost of $11&amp;nbsp;million. (The project cost also includes improvements to the [[drinking water]] piping system.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2010 |title=DC Water Clean Rivers Project: Rock Creek Sewer Separation |url=http://www.dcwater.com/workzones/projects/pdfs/rock_creek_sewer_seperation_b.pdf |publisher=District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority (DCWASA) |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827005450/http://www.dcwater.com/workzones/projects/pdfs/rock_creek_sewer_seperation_b.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 2011 |title=Long Term Control Plan Consent Decree Status Report: Quarter No. 2 - 2011 |url=http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/2011Q2_LTCP_CD_Quarterly_Rpt.pdf |publisher=DCWASA |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004942/http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/2011Q2_LTCP_CD_Quarterly_Rpt.pdf |archive-date=2016-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CSO storage===
Another solution is to build a CSO storage facility, such as a tunnel that can store flow from many sewer connections. Because a tunnel can share capacity among several outfalls, it can reduce the total volume of storage that must be provided for a specific number of outfalls. Storage tunnels store combined sewage but do not treat it. When the storm is over, the flows are pumped out of the tunnel and sent to a wastewater treatment plant.&lt;ref name="SEMCOG" /&gt;  One of the main concerns with CSO storage is the time it is stored before it is released.  Without careful management of this time the water in the CSO storage facility runs the risk of going septic.{{clarify|date=February 2014}}{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Washington, D.C. is building underground storage capacity as its primary strategy to address CSOs. In 2011 the city began construction on a system of four deep storage tunnels, adjacent to the [[Anacostia River]], that will reduce overflows to the river by 98&amp;nbsp;percent, and 96&amp;nbsp;percent system-wide. The system will comprise over 18 miles of tunnels with a storage capacity of 157 million gallons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dcwater.com/clean-rivers-project |title=Clean Rivers Project |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=DCWASA |access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The city's overall "Clean Rivers" project, projected to cost $2.6 billion, includes other components, such as [[Combined sewer#Reducing stormwater flows|reducing stormwater flows]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=October 2011 |title=Clean Rivers Project News: Combined Sewer Overflow Control Activities |url=http://www.dcwater.com/news/publications/CSO_Oct_2011_web.pdf |publisher=DCWASA |id=Biannual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Boston CSO Storage Tunnel]] is a similar project, completed in 2011.

===Expanding sewage treatment capacity===
Some cities have expanded their basic sewage treatment capacity to handle some or all of the CSO volume. In 2002 litigation forced the city of [[Toledo, Ohio]] to double its treatment capacity and build a storage basin in order to eliminate most overflows. The city also agreed to study ways to reduce stormwater flows into the sewer system. (''See'' [[Combined sewer#Reducing stormwater flows|Reducing stormwater flows]].)&lt;ref&gt;EPA (2002-08-28). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/59f70abeaacc274885256c24005e6240?OpenDocument "United States and Ohio Reach Clean Water Act Settlement with City of Toledo, Ohio."] Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retention basins===
{{main article|Retention basin}}
Retention treatment basins or large concrete [[storage tank|tanks]] that store and treat combined sewage are another solution. These underground structures can range in storage and treatment capacity from {{convert|2|e6USgal|m3}} to {{convert|120|e6USgal|m3}} of combined sewage. While each facility is unique, a typical facility operation is as follows. Flows from the overloaded sewers are pumped into a basin that is divided into compartments. The [[first flush]] compartment captures and stores flows with the highest level of pollutants from the first part of a storm. These pollutants include [[motor oil]], sediment, [[road salt]], and [[lawn]] chemicals (pesticides and [[fertilizer]]s) that are picked up by the stormwater as it runs off roads and lawns. The flows from this compartment are stored and sent to the wastewater treatment plant when there is capacity in the interceptor sewer after the storm. The second compartment is a treatment or flow-through compartment. The flows are [[disinfection|disinfected]] by injecting [[sodium hypochlorite]], or bleach, as they enter this compartment. It then takes about 20‚Äë30&amp;nbsp;minutes for the flows to move to the end of the compartment. During this time, bacteria are killed and large solid materials settle out. At the end of the compartment, any remaining sanitary trash is skimmed off the top and the treated flows are discharged into the river or lake.&lt;ref name="SEMCOG" /&gt;

===Screening and disinfection facilities===
Screening and disinfection facilities treat CSO without ever storing it. Called "flow-through" facilities, they use fine screens to remove solids and sanitary trash from the combined sewage. Flows are injected with sodium hypochlorite for disinfection and mixed as they travel through a series of fine screens to remove debris. The fine screens have openings that range in size from 4 to 6&amp;nbsp;mm, or a little less than a quarter inch. The flow is sent through the facility at a rate that provides enough time for the sodium hypochlorite to kill bacteria. All of the materials removed by the screens are then sent to the sewage treatment plant through the interceptor sewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1999 |title=Combined Sewer Overflow Technology Fact Sheet: Screens |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/screens.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 832-F-99-040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing stormwater flows===
Communities may implement [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development]] techniques to reduce flows of stormwater into the collection system. This includes:
*constructing new and renovated streets, parking lots and sidewalks with interlocking stones, [[permeable paving]] and [[pervious concrete]]
*installing [[green roof]]s on buildings
*installing [[bioretention]] systems, also called [[rain garden]]s, in landscaped areas
*[[Rainwater harvesting]] equipment collects runoff from building roofs during wet weather for irrigating landscapes and gardens during dry weather
*[[Graywater]] collection and use on site reduces sewage discharges at all times

===Gray vs. green infrastructure===
CSO mitigating initiatives that are solely composed of sewer system reconstruction are referred to as gray infrastructure, while techniques like permeable pavement and rainwater harvesting are referred to as green infrastructure. Conflict often occurs between a municipality's sewage authority and its environmentally active organizations between gray and green infrastructural plans.{{citation needed |reason= What conflicts? Where and when? How were they resolved?|date=April 2013}}

The 2004 EPA ''Report to Congress'' on CSO's provides a review of available technologies to mitigate CSO impacts.&lt;ref name="EPARTC" /&gt;{{rp|Ch. 8}}

==New Approaches==

===Smart Infrastructure===
Recent technological advances in sensing and control have enabled the implementation of Real Time [[Decision Support Systems]] (RT-DSS) for CSO mitigation. Through the use of [[internet of things]] technology and [[cloud computing]], CSO events can now be mitigated by dynamically adjusting setpoints for movable gates, pump stations, and other actuated assets in sewers and storm water management systems. Similar technology, called [[adaptive traffic control]] is used to control the flow of vehicles through traffic lights. RT-DSS systems take advantage of storm temporal and spatial variability as well as varying concentration times due to diverse land uses across the sewershed to coordinate and optimize control assets. By maximizing storage and conveyance RT-DSS are able to minimize overflows using existing infrastructure. Successful implementations of RT-DSS have been carried out throughout the United States &lt;ref&gt;L. Montestruque, M. Lemmon (2015).

As a product of the [[Industrial Revolution]], many cities in Europe and North America grew in the 19th century, frequently leading to crowding and increasing concerns about [[public health]].&lt;ref name="Abe"&gt;Abell√°n, Javier (2017).

Pierson (1899). [https://books.google.com/books?id=jT81AAAAMAAJ ''The Separate System of Sewerage, Its Theory and Construction.''] (New York: Van Nostrand.)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|29‚Äì34|date=May 2009}} Initially these systems discharged sewage directly to [[surface water]]s without treatment.&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt; As [[water pollution|pollution of water bodies]] became a concern, cities added [[sewage treatment]] plants to their systems. Most cities in the Western world added more expensive systems for sewage treatment in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_v0WjdM6sLoC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=The Culture of Flushing: A Social and Legal History of Sewage|author=Benidickson, Jamie|year=2011|publisher=UBC Press|accessdate=2013-02-07|isbn=9780774841382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Britain was the first country to industrialize, it was also the first to experience the disastrous consequences of major [[urbanisation]] and was the first to construct a sewerage system as we know it today to mitigate the resultant unsanitary conditions.&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt; [[Joseph Bazalgette]] designed an extensive underground sewerage system that diverted waste to the [[Thames Estuary]], downstream of the main centre of population. Six main interceptor sewers, totalling almost 135 miles (217&amp;nbsp;km) in length, were constructed. The intercepting sewers, constructed between 1859 and 1865, were fed by 450 miles (720&amp;nbsp;km) of main sewers that, in turn, conveyed the contents of some 13,000 miles (21,000&amp;nbsp;km) of smaller local sewers.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, David C. and Chant, Colin (1999) ''European Cities and Technology'' (London: Routledge).&lt;/ref&gt; With only minor modifications, Bazalgette's engineering achievement remains the basis for sewerage design up into the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0gBwjLTUzEMC|title=100 Greatest Science Inventions of All Time|author=Kendall F. Haven|year=2006|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|pages=148‚Äì149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waster water in a better and healthier way since the Seine received up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. Between 1865 and 1920 [[Eug√®ne Belgrand|Eugene Belgrand]] led the development of a large scale system for water supply and wastewater management.&lt;ref name="Abe"/&gt; By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified.&lt;ref&gt;George Commair, "The Waste Water Network: and underground view of Paris," in Great Rivers History: Proceedings and Invited Papers for the EWRI Congress and History Symposium, May 17‚Äì19, 2009, Kansas City, Missouri, ed. Jerry R. Roger, (Reston: American Society of Civil Engineers, 2009), 91-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[Image:WaterPipeLarge.JPG|thumb|right|A combined sewer-pipe being laid by the city's sewerage company in Ghent, Belgium.]]
The image of the sewer recurs in European culture as they were often used as hiding places or routes of escape by the scorned or the hunted, including partisans and [[resistance movement|resistance fighters]] in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Fighting erupted in the sewers during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. The only survivors from the [[Warsaw Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Ghetto]] made their final escape through city sewers. Some have commented that the [[engraving]]s of imaginary [[prison]]s by [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] were inspired by the [[Cloaca Maxima]], one of the world's earliest sewers.

===Regulations===

====United Kingdom====
There is in the UK a legal difference between a storm sewer and a surface water sewer.  You do not have a right of connection to a storm-water overflow sewer under section 106 of the Water Industry Act.&lt;ref&gt;United Kingdom. Water Industry Act 1991, c. 56.
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1991/56/part/IV/chapter/II/crossheading/communication-of-drains-and-private-sewers-with-public-sewers Section 106, "Right to communicate with public sewers."] National Archives, UK. Accessed 2017-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These are normally the pipe line that discharges to a watercourse, downstream of a combined sewer overflow.  It takes the excess flow from a combined sewer. A surface water sewer conveys rainwater; legally you have a right of connection for your rainwater to this public sewer. A public storm water sewer can discharge to a public surface water, but not the other way around, without a legal change in sewer status by the water company.

===In fiction===
The theme of traveling through, hiding, or even residing in combined sewers is a common plot device in media. Famous examples of sewer dwelling are the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], Stephen King's ''[[It (1990 film)|It]]'', ''[[Les Miserables]]'', ''[[The Third Man]]'', ''[[Ladyhawke (film)|Ladyhawke]],'' ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1987 TV series)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[Jet Set Radio Future]]''. The [[Todd Strasser]] novel ''[[Todd Strasser#Y2K-9: the Dog Who Saved the World|Y2K-9: the Dog Who Saved the World]]'' is centered on a dog thwarting [[terroristic threat]]s to [[cyberterrorism|electronically sabotage]] American sewage treatment plants.

===Sewer alligators===
{{Main article|Sewer alligator}}
A well-known [[urban legend]], the sewer [[alligator]], is that of giant alligators or [[crocodile]]s residing in combined sewers, especially of major metropolitan areas. Two public sculptures in New York depict an alligator dragging a hapless victim into a [[manhole]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4111768 Subway Art: New York's Underground Treasures : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alligators have been known to get into combined storm sewers in the southeastern United States. [[Closed-circuit television]] by a sewer repair company captured an alligator in a combined storm sewer on tape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mzh1lhV_RXE YouTube&amp;nbsp;‚Äì Bad sewer pipes across America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19222">'''Customer to customer''' ('''C2C''') markets provide an innovative way to allow customers to interact with each other.  Traditional markets require business to customer relationships, in which a customer goes to the business in order to purchase a product or service. In customer to customer markets, the business facilitates an environment where customers can sell goods or services to each other.&lt;ref&gt;"Customer To Customer - C To C." investopedia.com. 2009. investopedia. 24 Apr 2009 &lt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of markets include [[Business-to-business|business to business]] (B2B) and [[Business-to-consumer|business to customer]] (B2C).&lt;ref&gt;Ky≈çkai, Nihon R≈çd≈ç . Migration and the labor market in Asia By Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Japan: OECD Publishing, 2003. Digital.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Consumer to consumer''' (or '''citizen-to-citizen''') '''[[electronic commerce]]''' involves the electronically facilitated transactions between consumers through some third party.  A common example is an [[online auction]], in which a consumer posts an item for sale and other consumers bid to purchase it; the third party generally charges a [[flat fee]] or [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]. The sites are only intermediaries, just there to match consumers. They do not have to check quality of the products being offered.

'''Consumer to consumer'''&lt;ref name = "multiple"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecommerce definition and types of ecommerce |url=http://www.digitsmith.com/ecommerce-definition.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('''C2C''') '''[[marketing]]''' is the creation of a product or service with the specific promotional strategy being for consumers to share that product or service with others as brand [[advocates]] based on the value of the product. The investment into conceptualising and developing a top of the line product or service that consumers are actively looking for is equitable to a retail pre-launch product awareness marketing.&lt;ref name = "multiple"/&gt;

== Origins ==
There are many different classifications of marketing. From Government to Business (G2B), Business to Business (B2B), Business to Consumer (B2C), to Customer to Customer (C2C). While many companies usually operate in one or more of these areas, Customer to Customer businesses operate only within that specific area. Customer to Customer marketing has become more popular recently with the advent of the internet. Companies such as [[Craigslist]], [[eBay]], and other classified and auction based sites have allowed for greater interaction between consumers, facilitating the Customer to Customer model. Furthermore, as it becomes more economical for individuals to network on the internet via social websites and individual content creation, this marketing model has been greatly leveraged by businesses and individuals alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b2b.salesandmarketing.ws/2005/10/internet-made-b2b-b2c-and-c2c.html|title=B2B: Internet Made B2B, B2C, and C2C : Web Marketing Business And B2C Consumer|work=salesandmarketing.ws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two implementations of customer to customer markets that are credited with its origin. These are classifieds and auctions.&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka , Kurihara, Nobuyoshi Yamori, and Sadayoshi Takaya. Global information technology and competitive financial alliances. Idea Group Inc , 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers and other similar publications were in frequent circulation and therefore were able to be used to facilitate a common need. Some people wanted things, other people had things and wanted to sell them. This was the birth of [[Classified advertising|classifieds]]. The use of classifieds is referred to as classified advertisement. Normally used in text based print, classified advertisement is a now a strong vertical market that allows customers to communicate their needs with each other. In 2003 US classifieds market totaled $30.00 billion for both newspapers and online classified ad services.

The oldest auction house is Stockholm Auction House (Stockholms Auktionsverk), which was established in Sweden in 1674. Auctions however, have been recorded as far back as 500 B.C. Deriving from the Latin word augƒìre, which means to "'increase' (or 'augment')".&lt;ref&gt;Krishna, Vijay. Auction Theory. Academic Press, 2002. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Auctions have since widely used a method of liquidating assets, and has evolved into many different variations. The most successful current form of auctions is based on the internet, such as eBay.

== Business model ==
Most C2C websites, such as eBay, have both streamlined and globalized traditional person-to-person trading, which was usually conducted through such forms as garage sales, collectibles shows, flea markets and more, with their web interface. This facilitates easy exploration for buyers and enables the sellers to immediately list an item for sale within minutes of registering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~magnus/ief248a/eBay/history.html 
&lt;/ref&gt;

When an item is listed on a C2C site, a nonrefundable insertion fee is charged based on the seller's opening bid on the item. Once the auction is completed, a final value fee is charged. This fee generally ranges from 1.25 percent to 5 percent of the final sale price.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allbusiness.com/articles/StartingBusiness/3251-25-1846.html
&lt;/ref&gt;

After the C2C site sets up the system in which bids could be placed, items can be put up for sale, transactions can be completed, seller fees are charged, and feedback can be left, while the C2C site stays in the background. For example, at the end of an auction, the C2C site notifies the buyer via e-mail that he or she has won. The C2C site also e-mails the seller to report who won and at what price the auction finished. At that point it's up to the seller and buyer to finish the transaction independently of the C2C site.

C2C sites make money by charging fees to sellers. Although it's free to shop and place bids, sellers place fees to list items for sale, add on promotional features, and successfully complete transactions.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/27/07645594/0764559427-1.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many C2C sites have expanded and developed existing product categories by introducing category-specific bulletin boards and chat rooms, integrating category-specific content, advertising its service in targeted publications and participating in targeted trade shows. eBay specifically has also broadened the range of products that it offers to facilitate trading on the site, including payment services, shipping services, authentication, appraisal, vehicle inspection and escrow services.

Specialty marketplaces have also been added to serve the specialized needs of buyers and sellers. For example, eBay Motors serves the automotive marketplace, including vehicles, parts and accessories; and Half.com (now closed) was focused on providing a fixed-price trading environment, initially for books music, videos and video games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.datamonitor.com/~a0cc46f9d7fd4f0690306302d1b790e6~/companies/info/pagecopy/SampleProfile.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

Many online auction sites use a system called PayPal for sellers to receive online payments securely and quickly. A traditional credit card is not required to use this site because PayPal can be linked directly to you bank account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/krause/EBAY_FA03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009122809/http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/krause/EBAY_FA03.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-09 |df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various platforms that Consumer-to-consumer e-commerce is taking place on, such as social media (e.g. Facebook), advertisement websites (e.g. Craigslist) and online auction sites (e.g. eBay). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yrj√∂l√§|first=Mika|last2=Rintam√§ki|first2=Timo|last3=Saarij√§rvi|first3=Hannu|last4=Joensuu|first4=Johanna|date=2017-05-27|title=Consumer-to-consumer e-commerce: outcomes and implications|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593969.2017.1314864|journal=The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research|volume=27|issue=3|pages=300‚Äì315|doi=10.1080/09593969.2017.1314864|issn=0959-3969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product or service ==

Consumer to Consumer transactions often involve products sold via either a classified or auction-like system. As such, the products and services bought and sold are usually varied in type and have a short development and sale cycle. Products sold may often be used or second-hand, since consumer to consumer sales are often facilitated through auction or classified sites.&lt;ref name="wiki.media-culture.org.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.media-culture.org.au/index.php/ECommerce_-_Consumer2Consumer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422212445/http://wiki.media-culture.org.au/index.php/ECommerce_-_Consumer2Consumer |archivedate=2009-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===

Since products are usually second-hand, surplus, or used there is seldom a long development cycle associated with the products that are marketed via this method. However, in the case of individuals who are looking to sell a product or service they have developed to be sold on the small-scale, there is a product development life cycle. However, even when a product goes through a development life cycle when marketed in this manner, seldom does traditional marketing research occur. Oftentimes individuals are looking to make a quick profit, and simply place their product in the market place in hopes that it will be sold.

== Communications ==

=== Advertising ===
Advertising is essential towards the success of any business. In the case of customer to customer marketing, advertising often relates to online auctions and listings. As opposed to the pricey costs to advertise in media such as newspapers and magazines, products are already being promoted and publicized once users decide to officially put them on the internet. Potential buyers will become aware of products or services by conducting searches on the websites. Aside from possible fees and commissions imposed by the auction or listing site, advertising in this market does not require a substantial amount of money.

=== Advantages ===
Customer to Customer marketing has become very popular in the recent years. Customers can directly contact sellers and eliminate the middle man. Moreover, anyone can now sell and advertise a product in the convenience of one's home ‚Äì enabling one to easily start a business. Therefore, a wide variety of products can often be found on auction sites such as eBay, including second-hand goods. Since majority of these sales occur over the internet, sellers can reach both national and international customers and greatly increase their market. Feedback on the purchased product is often requested to aid both the seller and potential customers. The actual buying and searching process is simplified and search costs, distribution costs, and inventory costs are all reduced. Moreover, the transactions occur at a swift rate with the use of online payment systems such as PayPal.

=== Disadvantages ===
Although online auctions allow sellers to display their products, there is often a fee associated with such exhibitions. Other times, websites may charge a commission when products are sold.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business.com/articles/what-matters-most-how-to-take-advantage-of-millennial-purchase-behavior/&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing use of online auctions, the number of internet-related auction frauds have also increased. For instance, a seller may create two accounts on an auction site. When an interested buyer bids for an item, the seller will use another account to bid on the same item and thus, increasing the price. Consequently, many users have purchased products at unnecessarily inflated prices.&lt;ref name="bileta.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bileta.ac.uk/Document%20Library/1/PayPal%20and%20eBay%20-%20The%20Legal%20Implications%20of%20the%20C2C%20Elctronic%20Commerce%20Model.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722042758/http://www.bileta.ac.uk/Document%20Library/1/PayPal%20and%20eBay%20-%20The%20Legal%20Implications%20of%20the%20C2C%20Elctronic%20Commerce%20Model.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Identity theft]] has become a rising issue. Scam artists often create sites with popular domain names such as "ebay" in order to attract unknowing eBay customers. These sites will ask for personal information including credit card numbers. Numerous cases have been documented in which users find unknown charges on their credit card statements and withdrawals in their bank statements after purchasing something online. Unfortunately, websites often have a liability statement claiming that they are not responsible for any losses or damages. Furthermore, illegal or restricted products and services have been found on auction sites. Anything from illegal drugs, pirated works, prayers, and even sex have appeared on such sites. Although most of these items are blacklisted, some still find their way onto the internet.&lt;ref name="bileta.ac.uk" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== E-Commerce ===

==== Internet auctions ====
Despite the success of eBay, numerous other online auction sites have either shut down or consolidated with other similar sites. Creating an innovative and efficient business model is vital towards success. Online auctions can be categorized into five main models: C2C, B2C, B2B, B2G, and G2P. C2C refers to customer to customer, B2C signifies business to customer, B2B refers to business to business, B2G signifies business to government, and G2P refers to government to public. In recent years, online auctions have even appealed to major businesses. For instance, Sears has reported selling items at higher prices on these auctions when compared to discounting them in stores.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OGT/is_1_3/ai_n8690385/&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of an online auction site largely depends on six variables: interactivity, product offering, level of trust, rate of growth and adoption, networking, level of commitment, and payment options. Interactions among users are crucial and thus, websites must be accessible and easily navigable. E-mails, community boards, and feedback all aid in increasing the interactivity. With the growing need for convenience, the variety of products offered can greatly attribute to the client basis. Especially with the growing number of online frauds, trust is essential in auction sites. Users must be guaranteed that their personal information will remain secured and that they will receive their purchased product in a perfect condition and in a timely manner. With the fast-paced advancements in technology, auction sites must respond to these changes by staying updated. Moreover, sites also need to constantly search for business opportunities in order to expand their market. A large network of users is also crucial. Having an array of different sellers, buyers, suppliers, and delivery agents will increase the number of users, which would also raise the level of interactivity. In addition, forming alliances with different partners will also aid in the site's success. The level of commitment in buyers and sellers also plays a role in the auction's success. Similar to the level of trust, buyers must be ensured that they receive their purchased item, and sellers must actually receive payment. Although most prefer speedy online transactions, it is beneficial to offer different payment options that will accommodate different buyers.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OGT/is_1_3/ai_n8690385/?tag=content;col1&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internet classifieds ====

Internet classifieds are another example of customer to customer marketing. An example of an internet classified company, is Craigslist. Craigslist utilizes the internet to attract a wide customer and buyer base which employs the website to list and sell items.

Since the customer to customer marketing strategy is strongly focused on serving the customer, the business model of Craigslist is simple: serve the customer first. Utilizing this model, Craigslist has developed into a prime example of a customer to customer driven 'machine', which focuses on the customer selling to the customer.

Revenues which support the company are derived through subsidiary channels, while maintaining the model and convenience of the site. In fact, Craigslist makes no money off the customer to customer interactions that occur on the classifieds of the website. All of their revenue is derived from portion of the website targeted at businesses. Thus, in other words, their revenue is derived solely from their business to customer model utilized by businesses to post jobs and hire new workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craigslist.org/about/press/craigslist.keeper|title=craigslist - about &gt; press &gt; craigslist keeper|work=craigslist.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, it becomes apparent that companies who focus on this particular model and, specifically classifieds, whether online or off, are often not focused on profit; but rather, on delivery of the service or product to ensure customer to customer interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/craigslist-meets-the-capitalists/|title=Craigslist meets the Capitalists|work=The New York Times|date=2006-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet classifieds sites such as OLX, Quikr, Loogga etc. are gaining prominence in emerging economies such as India, Brazil and Nigeria. OLX and Quikr recently enabled their users to sell cows and buffaloes in rural India &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tech/tech-news/Rural-India-selling-cows-buffaloes-on-OLX-Quikr/articleshow/20540762.cms|title=Rural India selling cows, buffaloes on OLX, Quikr|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
C2C marketing is of critical importance to retailers. When a shopper buys a product, if it can be shared with the shopper's friends, that drives significant traffic back to the customer site. Additionally, shoppers trust user generated recommendations much higher than recommendations pushed by the retailer. Retailers like [[CafePress]] have implemented C2C marketing on their website and companies like [[ShopSocially]] are building C2C marketing platforms for retailers. Recent trends by [[Facebook]] and Wavespot that leverage free WIFI at a local business are indicative of C2C marketing's importance in SMB space.

Most companies think of C2C marketing as the use of social media channels such as Facebook and Twitter. However, in many cases, the messaging tends to be business to consumer.

'''DO-160, Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures for Airborne Equipment''' is a standard for the environmental testing of avionics hardware. It is published by the [[RTCA, Incorporated|Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics]] (RTCA) and supersedes DO-138.

==Outline of contents==

===Introduction===
The DO-160 document was first published on February 28, 1975 to specify test conditions for the design of avionics electronic hardware in airborne systems. Since then the standard has undergone subsequent revisions up through Revision G.

===Purpose===
This document outlines a set of minimal standard environmental test conditions (categories) and corresponding test procedures for airborne equipment for the entire spectrum of aircraft from light general aviation aircraft and helicopters through the [[jumbo jets]] and [[supersonic transport]] categories of aircraft. The purpose of these tests is to provide a controlled (laboratory) means of assuring the performance characteristics of airborne equipment in environmental conditions similar of those which may be encountered in airborne operation of the equipment.
The standard environmental test conditions and test procedures contained within the standard, may be used in conjunction with applicable equipment performance standards, as a minimum specification under environmental conditions, which can ensure an adequate degree of confidence in performance during use aboard an air vehicle.
The Standard Includes Sections on:

[[File:Daylighting - Skylight.jpg|thumb|A [[skylight]] providing internal illumination]]

'''Daylighting''' is the practice of placing [[window]]s, skylights, other openings, and [[reflection (physics)|reflective]] surfaces so that [[sunlight]] (direct or indirect) can provide effective internal [[lighting]]. Particular attention is given to daylighting while designing a building when the aim is to maximize visual comfort or to reduce energy use. Energy savings can be achieved from the reduced use of artificial (electric) lighting or from [[passive solar]] heating. Artificial lighting energy use can be reduced by simply installing fewer electric lights where daylight is present or by automatically [[dimmer|dimming]]/switching off electric lights in response to the presence of daylight &amp;ndash; a process known as [[daylight harvesting]].

The amount of daylight received in an internal space can be analyzed by measuring [[illuminance]] on a grid or undertaking a [[daylight factor]] calculation. Computer programs such as [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]] allow an architect or engineer to quickly calculate benefits of a particular design. The human eye's response to light [[Weber‚ÄìFechner law#Vision|is non-linear]], so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter. 

The source of all [[daylight]] is the [[Sun]]. The proportion of direct to diffuse light impacts the amount and quality of daylight.&lt;ref name="Daylighting Handbook 1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reinhart |first=Christoph |date=2014 |title=Daylighting Handbook 1 |publisher=Christoph Reinhart |isbn=9780692203637}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Direct [[sunlight]]" reaches a site without being [[light scattering|scattered]] within [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Light that is scattered in the atmosphere is  ''[[diffuse sky radiation|diffused daylight]]''. Ground reflected light also contributes to the daylight. Each climate has different composition of these daylights and different [[cloud cover]]age, so daylighting strategies vary with site locations and climates. There is no direct sunlight on the polar-side wall (north-facing wall in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and south-facing wall in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]) of a building from the [[autumnal equinox]] to the [[spring equinox]] at latitudes north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and south of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]].&lt;ref name="The Science of Renewable Energy"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Spellman |first1=Frank |last2=Beiber |first2=Revonna |date=2011|title= The Science of Renewable Energy |publisher= CRC Press; 1 edition |isbn=1439825025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, houses were designed with minimal windows on the polar side, but more and larger windows on the equatorial-side (south-facing wall in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing wall in the Southern Hemisphere). Equatorial-side windows receive at least some direct sunlight on any sunny day of the year (except in the [[tropics]] in [[summer]]time), so they are effective at daylighting areas of the house adjacent to the windows. In  higher latitudes during [[winter solstice|midwinter]], light incidence is highly directional and casts long shadows. This may be partially ameliorated through [[light diffusion]], [[light tube|light pipes or tubes]], and through somewhat reflective internal surfaces. In fairly low latitudes in summertime, windows that face east and west and sometimes those that face toward the pole receive more sunlight than windows facing toward the equator.&lt;ref name="The Science of Renewable Energy"/&gt;

==Types==

===Windows===

}}
{{Main|Window}}

Windows are the most common way to admit daylight into a space. Their vertical orientation means that they selectively admit sunlight and diffuse daylight at different times of the day and year. Therefore, windows on multiple orientations must usually be combined to produce the right mix of light for the building, depending on the climate and latitude. There are three ways to improve the amount of light available from a window:&lt;ref name="Building for Energy Independence: Sun/Earth Buffering and Superinsulation"&gt;{{cite book |date=1983 |title= Building for Energy Independence: Sun/Earth Buffering and Superinsulation  |publisher= Community Builders |isbn= 0960442243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a) placing the window close to a light colored wall, (b) slanting the sides of window openings so the inner opening is larger than the outer opening, or (c) using a large light colored window-sill to project light into the room.

Different types and grades of [[glass]] and different window treatments can also affect the amount of light transmission through the windows. The type of [[Glazing (window)|glazing]] is an important issue, expressed by its VT coefficient (Visual Transmittance),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfrc.org/windowratings/Energy-ratings.html ‚ÄúWindow energy ratings"]; The National Fenestration Rating Council&lt;/ref&gt; also known as visual light transmittance (VLT). As the name suggests, this coefficient measures how much visible light is admitted by the window. A low VT (below 0.4) can reduce by half or more the light coming into a room. But be also aware of high VT glass: high VT numbers (say, above 0.60) can be a cause of glare. On the other hand, you should also take into account the undesirable effects of large windows.

Windows grade into translucent walls (below).

====Clerestory windows====
Another important element in creating daylighting is the use of [[clerestory]] windows. These are high, vertically placed windows. They can be used to increase direct solar gain when oriented towards the equator. When facing toward the sun, clerestories and other windows may admit unacceptable [[Glare (vision)|glare]]. In the case of a [[passive solar]] house, clerestories may provide a direct light path to polar-side (north in the northern hemisphere; south in the southern hemisphere) rooms that otherwise would not be illuminated. Alternatively, clerestories can be used to admit diffuse daylight (from the north in the northern hemisphere) that evenly illuminates a space such as a classroom or office.

Often, clerestory windows also shine onto interior wall surfaces painted white or another light color. These walls are placed so as to reflect indirect light to interior areas where it is needed. This method has the advantage of reducing the directionality of light to make it softer and more diffuse, reducing shadows.

====Sawtooth roof====
Another roof-angled glass alternative is a [[saw-tooth roof|sawtooth roof]] (found on older factories). Sawtooth roofs have vertical roof glass facing away from the equator side of the building to capture diffused light (not harsh direct equator-side solar gain).&lt;ref name="LG10"&gt;{{cite book |date=1999|title= CIBSE Lighting Guide 10: Daylighting and window design |publisher= CIBSE |isbn= 0-900953-98-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angled portion of the glass-support structure is opaque and well insulated with a cool roof and radiant barrier. The sawtooth roof's lighting concept partially reduces the summer "solar furnace" skylight problem, but still allows warm interior air to rise and touch the exterior roof glass in the cold winter, with significant undesirable heat transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = F. | last = Asdrubali | year = 2003 | title = Lighting Research and Technology: "Daylighting performance of sawtooth roofs of industrial buildings "| journal=Lighting Research and Technology | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 343‚Äì359 | doi = 10.1191/1365782803li094oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skylights===
[[File:Skylight w cuppola.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Modern [[skylight]]]]
{{Main|Skylight}}

Skylights are light transmitting fenestration (products filling openings in a building envelope which also includes windows, doors, etc.) forming all, or a portion of, the roof of a building space. Skylights are widely used in daylighting design in residential and commercial buildings, mainly because they are the most effective source of daylight on a unit area basis.

An alternative to a skylight is a [[roof lantern]]. A roof lantern is a daylighting [[cupola]] that sits above a roof, as opposed to a skylight which is fitted into a roof's construction. Roof lanterns serve as both an architectural feature and a method of introducing natural light into a space, and are typically wooden or metal structures with a number of glazed glass panels.{{Clear}}

===Atrium===
{{Main|Atrium (architecture)}}
An atrium is a large open space located within a building. It is often used to light a central circulation or public area by daylight admitted through a glass roof or wall. Atria provide some daylight to adjacent working areas, but the amount is often small and does not penetrate very far.&lt;ref name="The SLL Lighting Handbook"&gt;{{cite book |date=2009 |title= The SLL Lighting Handbook |publisher= Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers; 1st edition |isbn= 9781906846022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main function of an [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] is to provide a visual experience and a degree of contact with the outside for people in the working areas. The daylighting of successive storeys of rooms adjoining an atrium is interdependent and requires a balanced approach.&lt;ref name=" Daylighting in atrium buildings"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Littlefair |first1=P J |last2= Aizlewood |first2=M E |date=1998 |title=Daylighting in atrium buildings |publisher= BRE Information Paper IP3/98 |isbn=9781860811944}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light from the sky can easily penetrate the upper storeys but not the lower, which rely primarily on light reflected from internal surfaces of the atrium such as floor-reflected light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharples | first = S. | year = 1999 | title = Reflectance distributions and atrium daylight levels: a model study| journal= Lighting Research and Technology | volume = 31 | issue = 4| pages = 165‚Äì170 | doi = 10.1177/096032719903100405}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper stories need less window area than the lower ones, and if the atrium walls are light in color the upper walls will reflect light toward the lower stories.&lt;ref name="LG10"/&gt;

===Translucent walls===
[[File:Glass block wall on the campus of the University of Texas-El Paso LCCN2014631180.tif|thumb|Glass brick wall, outdoors]]

[[File:Interior Jacobsen House Bathroom Earthship 2009.JPG|thumb|left|Bottle wall]]
Walls made of [[glass brick]] are translucent to transparent. Traditionally, they are hollow and [[grout]]ed with a fine concrete grout, but some modern glass brick walls are solid cast glass&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2016/04/mvrdv-integrates-terra-cotta-brick-and-glass-for-a-facade-in-amsterdam/|title=MVRDV integrates terra-cotta brick and glass for a facade in Amsterdam - Archpaper.com|website=archpaper.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouted with a transparent glue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dezeen.com/2016/04/20/crystal-houses-amsterdam-chanel-store-mvrdv-glass-facade-technology/|title=MVRDV replaces traditional facade with glass bricks that are stronger than concrete|date=2016-04-20|work=Dezeen|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inhabitat.com/glass-bricks-stronger-than-concrete-clad-chanels-crystal-houses/|title=Glass bricks "stronger than concrete" clad Amsterdam's Crystal Houses|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the glue matches the [[refractive index]] of the glass, the wall can be fairly transparent.

Increasing the amount of concrete, bottle walls embed bottles that run right through the wall, transmitting light. Concrete walls with glass prisms running through them have also been made.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} With the advent of cheaper [[optical fiber]]s, [[translucent concrete|fiber-optic concrete]] walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Ndujiuba | first1 = C.U. | last2 = John | first2 = S.N. | last3 = Onasoga| first3 = Kayode | year = 2014 | title = Optic Fibericity - The New Era Lighting | journal = International Journal of Energy Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 69‚Äì74| doi = 10.5923/j.ijee.20140404.01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daylight (and shadow images) can then pass directly through a solid concrete wall, making it translucent; fiber optics will lead light around bends and over tens of meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tfod.in/art-design-articles/22/see-through-concrete-litracon|title=See-through concrete: LiTracon|author=|date=|website=Tfod.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically only a few percent of the light is transmitted (the percent transmittance is about half the percent of the surface that is fibers, and usually only ~5% fibers are used).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ijsrp.org/research-paper-1013/ijsrp-p2283.pdf|format=PDF|journal=International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications|volume=3|date=October 2013|issn=2250-3153|title=TRANSLUCENT CONCRETE|author1=SOUMYAJIT PAUL|author2=AVIK DUTTA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinberbest.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/Anilodic%2BDaylight%2BConcentrator%2Bof%2BStructural%2BTranslucent%2BConcrete%2BEnvelope_%2BBaofeng%2BHuang.pdf|format=PDF|title=Anidolic Daylight Concentrator of Structural Translucent Concrete Envelope|website=Sinberbest.berkeley.edu|accessdate=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both glass and concrete conduct heat fairly well, when solid, so none of these walls [[insulation value|insulate well]]. They are therefore often used outdoors, as a divider between two heated spaces (see images), or in very [[temperate climates]].

[[Greenhouse]] walls (and rooves) are made to transmit as much light and as little heat as possible. They use a variety of materials, and may be transparent or translucent.

===Remote distribution===
''See [[anidolic lighting]]''

It is possible to provide some daylight into spaces that have low possibility of windows or skylights through remote distribution devices such as mirrors, [[prism (optics)|prisms]], or [[light tube]]s. This is called [[anidolic lighting]], from [[nonimaging optics|anidolic (non-image-forming) optics]]. The non-linear response of the human eye to light means that spreading light to a broader area of a room makes the room appear brighter, and makes more of it usefully lit.

Remote daylight distribution systems have losses, and the further they have to transmit the daylight and the more convoluted the path, the greater the inefficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Littlefair |first=P.J. |year=1990 |title=Review Paper: Innovative daylighting: Review of systems and evaluation methods |journal=Lighting Research and Technology |volume=22 |pages=1‚Äì17 |doi= 10.1177/096032719002200101}}&lt;!--|accessdate=November 17, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of many remote distribution systems can also vary dramatically from clear to overcast skies. Nonetheless, where there is no other possibility of providing daylight to a space, remote distribution systems can be appreciated.&lt;ref name="The SLL Lighting Handbook"/&gt;

====Light reflectors and shelves====

{{See also|Architectural light shelf}}
Once used extensively in office buildings, the manually adjustable light reflector is seldom in use today having been supplanted by a combination of other methods in concert with artificial illumination. The reflector had found favor where the choices of artificial light provided poor illumination compared to modern electric lighting.

Light shelves are an effective way to enhance the lighting from windows on the equator-facing side of a structure, this effect being obtained by placing a white or reflective metal light shelf outside the window.&lt;ref name="The SLL Lighting Handbook"/&gt; Usually the window will be protected from direct summer season sun by a projecting eave. The light shelf projects beyond the shadow created by the eave and reflects sunlight upward to illuminate the ceiling. This reflected light can contain little heat content and the reflective illumination from the ceiling will typically reduce deep shadows, reducing the need for general illumination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = P. J. | last = Littlefair | year = 1995 | title = Light shelves: Computer assessment of daylighting | journal=Lighting Research and Technology | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 79‚Äì91 | doi = 10.1177/14771535950270020201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the cold winter, a natural light shelf is created when there is [[snow]] on the ground which makes it reflective. Low winter sun (see [[Sun path]]) reflects off the snow and increases solar gain through equator-facing glass by one- to two-thirds which brightly lights the ceiling of these rooms. Glare control (drapes) may be required.

====Prisms====
{{main|Prism lighting}}
[[File:Daylight Redirecting Film.jpg|thumb|Daylight redirecting film bending light upwards]]
The oldest use of prisms for daylighting may well be [[deck prism]]s, let into the decks of ships to transmit light below. Later, [[pavement light]]s or [[vault light]]s were used to light basement areas under sidewalks.&lt;ref name="glassian"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glassian.org/Prism/|title=Prism Glass {{!}} glassian|website=Glassian.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisms that used [[total internal reflection]] to throw light sideways, lighting the deeper portions of a room, later became popular. Early thick, slow-cooling cast glass prism tiles were often known as "luxfer tiles" after a major manufacturer.&lt;ref name=glassian/&gt; They were and are used in the upper portions of windows, and some believe that they contributed to the trend from dark, subdivided Victorian interiors to open-plan, light-coloured ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Daylight redirecting window film]] (DRF) is a thin plastic version of the old glass prism tiles. It can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Program-Areas/Energy-and-Water/Energy/Conservation-and-Efficiency/EW-201014|title=EW-201014 Fact Sheet|last=Noblis|website=Serdp-estcp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Light tube}}

Another type of device used is the light tube, also called a tubular daylighting device (TDD), which is placed into a roof and admits light to a focused area of the interior. These somewhat resemble recessed ceiling light fixtures. They do not allow as much heat transfer as skylights because they have less surface area.

TDDs use modern technology to transmit visible light through opaque walls and roofs. The tube itself is a passive component consisting of either a simple reflective interior coating or a light conducting fiber optic bundle. It is frequently capped with a transparent, roof-mounted dome "light collector" and terminated with a diffuser assembly that admits the daylight into interior spaces and distributes the available light energy evenly (or else efficiently if the use of the lit space is reasonably fixed, and the user desired one or more "bright-spots").

The tubular daylighting device was invented by [[Solatube|Solatube International]] in 1986 and brought to market first in Australia in 1991.{{dubious|date=October 2017}}

==Smart glass==
{{Main|Smart glass}}

Smart glass is the name given to a class of materials and devices that can be switched between a transparent state and a state which is opaque, translucent, reflective, or retro-reflective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baetens |first1=R. |last2=Jelle |first2=B. P. |last3=Gustavsen |first3=A. |title=Properties, requirements and possibilities of smart windows for dynamic daylight and solar energy control in buildings: A state-of-the-art review |journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=2010|volume=94|issue=2|pages=87‚Äì105|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2009.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; The switching is done by applying a voltage to the material, or by performing some simple mechanical operation. Windows, skylights, etc., that are made of smart glass can be used to adjust indoor lighting, compensating for changes of the brightness of the light outdoors and of the required brightness indoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=E.S.|last2=Tavil|first2=A. |title=Energy and visual comfort performance of electrochromic windows with overhangs |journal=Building and Environment|date=2007|volume=42|issue=6|pages=2439‚Äì2449|doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2006.04.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

===Heliostats===
The use of [[heliostat]]s, mirrors which are moved automatically to reflect sunlight in a constant direction as the sun moves across the sky, is gaining popularity as an energy-efficient method of lighting. A heliostat can be used to shine sunlight directly through a window or skylight, or into any arrangement of optical elements, such as light tubes, that distribute the light where it is needed. The image shows a mirror that rotates on a computer-controlled, motor-driven [[altazimuth mount]].

===Solar street lights===
[[Solar street light]]s raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid [[PV system]] charges a [[rechargeable battery]], which powers a fluorescent or [[LED lamp]] during the night. Solar street lights are [[stand-alone power system]]s, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly.

===Hybrid solar lighting===
{{main|Hybrid solar lighting}}

[[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] (ORNL) has developed a new alternative to skylights called hybrid solar lighting. This design uses a roof-mounted light collector, large-diameter [[Light tube#Optical fiber|optical fiber]], and modified efficient fluorescent lighting fixtures that have transparent rods connected to the optical fiber cables. Essentially no electricity is needed for daytime natural interior lighting.

Field tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 of the new HSL technology were promising, but the low-volume equipment production is still expensive. HSL should become more cost effective in the near future. A version that can withstand windstorms could begin to replace conventional commercial fluorescent lighting systems with improved implementations in 2008 and beyond. The U.S. 2007 Energy Bill provides funding for HSL R&amp;D, and multiple large commercial buildings are ready to fund further HSL application development and deployment.

At night, ORNL HSL uses variable-intensity fluorescent lighting electronic control ballasts. As the sunlight gradually decreases at sunset, the fluorescent fixture is gradually turned up to give a near-constant level of interior lighting from daylight until after it becomes dark outside.

HSL may soon become an option for commercial interior lighting. It can transmit about half of the direct sunlight it receives.&lt;ref name="hybrid lighting"&gt;{{cite web

==Solarium==
{{Main|Sunroom|Greenhouse}}

In a well-designed isolated solar gain building with a solarium, sunroom, greenhouse, etc., there is usually significant glass on the equator side. A large area of glass can also be added between the sun room and the interior living quarters. Low-cost, high-volume-produced patio door safety glass is an inexpensive way to accomplish this goal.

The doors used to enter a room should be opposite the sun room interior glass, so that a user can see outside immediately when entering most rooms. Halls should be minimized with open spaces used instead. If a hall is necessary for privacy or room isolation, inexpensive patio door safety glass can be placed on both sides of the hall. Drapes over the interior glass can be used to control lighting. Drapes can optionally be automated with sensor-based electric motor controls that are aware of room occupancy, daylight, interior temperature, and time of day. Passive solar buildings with no central air conditioning system need control mechanisms for hourly, daily, and seasonal, temperature-and-daylight variations. If the temperature is correct, and a room is unoccupied, the drapes can automatically close to reduce heat transfer in either direction.

To help distribute sun room daylight to the sides of rooms that are farthest from the equator, inexpensive ceiling-to-floor mirrors can be used.

Building codes require a second means of egress, in case of fire. Most designers use a door on one side of bedrooms, and an outside window, but west-side windows provide very-poor summer thermal performance. Instead of a west-facing window, designers use an R-13 foam-filled solid energy-efficient exterior door. It may have a glass storm door on the outside so that light can pass through when the inner door is opened. East/west glass doors and windows should be fully shaded top-to-bottom or a spectrally selective coating can be used to reduce solar gain.

==Design==
Architects and interior designers often use daylighting as one of design elements. Good daylighting requires attention to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of design.&lt;ref name="The SLL Lighting Handbook"/&gt;

===Qualitative===
Utilizing natural light is one of the design aspects in architecture; In 1929, the French architect, [[Le Corbusier]] said that "The history of architectural material... has been the endless struggle for light... in other words, the history of windows." As he emphasized in his architecture (such as [[Notre Dame du Haut]]), daylighting has been a major architectural design elements (See [[MIT Chapel]] and [[Church of the Light]] for examples). Not only the aesthetic aspects, the impact of daylighting on [[healthy building|human health]] and work performance is also considered as qualitative daylighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Aries | first1= M.B.C. | last2 = Aarts | first2 = M. P. J. | last3 = Van Hoof | first3 = J. | year = 2015 | title = Daylight and health: A review of the evidence and consequences for the built environment | journal = Lighting Research and Technology | volume = 47 | pages = 6‚Äì27 | doi = 10.1177/1477153513509258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current studies show that lighting conditions in workplaces contribute to a variety of factors related to work satisfaction, productivity and well-being and significantly higher visual acceptance scores under daylighting than electrical lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = A | last1 = Borisuit | first2 = F. | last2 = Linhart | year = 2015 | title = Effects of realistic office daylighting and electric lighting conditions on visual comfort, alertness and mood| journal=Lighting Research and Technology | volume = 47 | pages = 192‚Äì209 | doi = 10.1177/1477153514531518}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also shown that light has a direct effect on human health because of the way it influences the [[circadian rhythm|circadian rhythms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Figueiro | first1 = M.G. | last2 = Rea | first2 = M.S. | last3 = Bullough | first3 = J.D. | year = 2006 | title = Does architectural lighting contribute to breast cancer? | url = | journal = Journal of Carcinogenesis | volume = 5 | issue = 1| page = 20 | doi = 10.1186/1477-3163-5-20 | pmid = 16901343 | pmc=1557490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantitative===
A well daylit space needs both adequate lighting levels and light that is well distributed. In the current building industry, daylighting is considered a building performance measure in green building certification programs such as [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]. Illumination Engineering Society (IES) and the society of Light and Lighting (SLL) provide illuminance recommendation for each space type. How much daylighting contributes to the recommended lighting level determines daylighting performance of a building. There are two metrics that IES has approved to evaluate daylighting performance:  Spatial Daylight Autonomy(sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE). sDA is a metric describing annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels in interior environments.&lt;ref name=" LM-83-12"&gt;{{cite book | date=2013 |title= Approved Method: IES Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) |publisher= Illumination Engineering Society |isbn=9780879952723}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Daylight autonomy and LEED documentation sections for more details.

==Evaluation method==
===Field measurements===
In existing buildings, field measurements can be undertaken to evaluate daylighting performance. [[Illuminance]] measurements on a grid is a basic level to derive an average illuminance of a space. The spacing of the measurement points vary with project purposes. The height of these points depends on where the primary task is performed. In most office spaces, desk level (0.762m above the floor) will be measured. Based on measurements, average illuminance, maximum-to-minimum uniformity ratio, and average-to-minimum uniformity ratio will be calculated and compared to the recommended lighting level.&lt;ref name="Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings"&gt;{{cite book |date=2010 |title= Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings |publisher= American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, U.S. Green Building Council and The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers |isbn= 9781933742793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A diagnostic survey specific to lighting can be conducted to analyse the satisfaction of building occupants.&lt;ref name="Performance Measurement Protocols for Commercial Buildings"/&gt;

===Computational simulations===
Computational simulations can predict daylighting condition of a space much faster and more detailed than hand calculations or scale model testing.  The simulations allow for the effects of climate with hourly weather data from [[typical meteorological year]]. Computer models are available which can predict variations in internally reflected light. [[Radiosity (computer graphics)|Radiosity]] and [[ray-tracing]] are methods can deal with complex geometry, allow complex sky distributions and potentially produce photorealistic images. Radiosity methods assume all surfaces are perfectly diffusing to reduce computational times. Ray-tracing techniques have accuracy and image rendering capacity.&lt;ref name="LG10"/&gt;

==Autonomy==
Daylight autonomy is the percentage of time that daylight levels are above a specified target [[illuminance]] within a physical space or building.&lt;ref name="Reinhart"/&gt; The calculation is based on annual data and the predetermined lighting levels. The goal of the calculation is to determine how long an individual can work in a space without requiring electrical lighting, while also providing optimal visual and physical comfort.&lt;ref name="Reinhart"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reinhart |first=Christoph |last2=Mardaljevic |first2=John  |last3=Rogers |first3=Zach |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=Dynamic Daylight Performance Metrics for Sustainable Building Design |url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic256760.files/DynamicDaylightPerformanceMetricsInLeukos.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Leukos |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=7‚Äì31 |doi=10.1582/LEUKOS.2006.03.01.001 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daylight autonomy is beneficial when determining how daylight enters and illuminates a space. The drawback, however, is that there is no upper limit on [[luminance]] levels. Therefore, a space with a high internal heat gain deemed uncomfortable by occupants, would still perform well in the analysis. Achieving daylight autonomy requires an [[integrated design]] approach that guides the building form, siting, climate considerations, building components, lighting controls, and lighting design criteria.

===Continuous===
Continuous daylight autonomy, is similar to daylight autonomy but partial credit is attributed to time steps when the daylight illuminance lies below the minimum illuminance level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Jakubiec | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Reinhart | first2 = C.F. | year = 2012 | title = The 'adaptive zone' ‚Äì A concept for assessing discomfort glare throughout daylit spaces | journal = Lighting Research and Technology | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 149‚Äì170| doi = 10.1177/1477153511420097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the target illuminance is 400 [[lux]] and the calculated value is 200 lux, daylight autonomy would give zero credit, while continuous daylight autonomy would give 0.5 credit (200/400 = 0.5). The benefit of continuous daylight autonomy is that it does not give a hard threshold of acceptable illuminance. Instead, it addresses the transition area‚Äîallowing for realistic preferences within any given space. For example, office occupants usually prefer to work at daylight below the illuminance threshold since this level avoids potential [[glare (vision)|glare]] and excessive contrast.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Useful illuminance===
Useful daylight illuminance focuses on the direct sunlight that falls into a space. The useful daylight illuminance calculation is based on three factors‚Äîthe percentage of time a point is below, between, or above an illuminance value. The range for these factors is typically 100-2,000 lux. Useful daylight illuminance is similar to daylight autonomy but has the added benefit of addressing glare and thermal discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nabil |first=Azza |last2=Mardaljevic |first2=John |year=2006 |title=Useful daylight illuminances: A replacement for daylight factors |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1858‚Äì1866 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2006.03.013 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 10, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The upper threshold is used to determine when glare or thermal discomfort is occurring and may need resolution.

==LEED documentation==
The [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] 2009 daylighting standards were intended to connect building occupants with the outdoors through use of optimal daylighting techniques and technologies. According to these standards, the maximum value of 1 point can be achieved through four different approaches.  The first approach is a computer simulation to demonstrate, in clear sky conditions, the daylight illuminance levels 108-5,400 lux on, September 21 between 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Another prescriptive approach is a method that uses two types of side-lighting, and three types of top-lighting to determine if a minimum of 75% daylighting is achieved in the occupied spaces. A third approach uses indoor light measurements showing that between 108-5,400 lux have been achieved in the space. The last approach is a combination of the other three calculation methods to prove that the daylight illumination requirements are achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.usgbc.org/node/1732577?return=/credits/healthcare/v2009 |title = Daylight and views - daylight |publisher = USGBC |website = U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate= 10 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LEED 2009 documentation is based upon the [[daylight factor]] calculation. The daylight factor calculation is based on uniform overcast skies. It is most applicable in [[Northern Europe]] and parts of [[North America]].&lt;ref name="IESNA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rea |first=Mark |date=2000 |title=IESNA Lighting Handbook |edition=9th |publisher=Illuminating Engineering; 9 edition (July 2000) |isbn=0879951508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daylight factor is ‚Äúthe ratio of the illuminance at a point on a plane, generally the horizontal work plane, produced by the luminous flux received directly or indirectly at that point from a sky whose luminance distribution is known, to the illuminance on a horizontal plane produced by an unobstructed hemisphere of this same sky."&lt;ref name="IESNA" /&gt;

LEED v4 daylighting standards are the most current as of 2014. The new standards are similar to the old standards, but also intend to ‚Äúreinforce circadian rhythms, and reduce the use of electrical lighting by introducing daylight in the space.&lt;ref name="USGBCV4"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.usgbc.org/node/2614120?return=/credits/healthcare/v4 |title = Daylight |publisher = USGBC |website = U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate= 10 December 2014 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Two options exist for achieving the maximum value of these two most recent points.  One option is to use a computer simulation to demonstrate that a spatial daylight autonomy of 300 lux for at least 50% of the time, and an annual sunlight exposure of 1,000 lux for 250 occupied hours per year, exists in the space. Another option is to show that illuminance levels are between 300 lux and 3,000 lux between 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on a clear day at the equinox for 75% or 90% of the floor area in the space.&lt;ref name="USGBCV4" /&gt; The overall goal of the LEED v4 daylighting metrics is to analyze both the quantity and quality of the light, as well as to balance the use of glazing to ensure more light and less cooling load.

The '''flexibility‚Äìusability tradeoff''' is a [[design elements and principles|design principle]] maintaining that, as the [[flexibility (engineering)|flexibility]] of a system increases, its [[usability]] decreases. The tradeoff exists because accommodating flexibility requires satisfying a larger set of requirements, which results in complexity and usability compromises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinebach|first=Gerhard, and Subhrajit Guhathakurta, Hans Hagen|title=Visualizing Sustainable Planning|year=2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=3540882022|pages=256|url=https://www.amazon.com/Visualizing-Sustainable-Planning-X-media-publishing-Steinebach/dp/3540882022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design theory maintains that over their lifecycle, systems shift from supporting multiple uses inefficiently, towards efficiently supporting a single use as users' needs become more defined and better understood, both by themselves and designers.

When weighting the relative importance of flexibility versus usability, designers are advised to consider how well the needs of the user are understood. If user needs are well understood, designers should bias toward simple less-flexible systems. Otherwise, designers should create flexible designs that support multiple future applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=London|isbn=1592535879|pages=102‚Äì103|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GPS Tuner''' is the name of a software company based in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], and of a software product they make. The software is a tool intended for off-road navigation based on the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), where it is used to determine position while cycling, hiking, geocaching, boating, flying, driving, and many other outdoor sporting activities. It can be used by those with a [[GPS receiver]] alone, or in a [[smartphone]], [[Pocket PC]], or [[iPhone]]. Recently, the firm released a new version of its navigation software dedicated to [[electric bicycles]] named eBike Navigation. This new version includes a variety of battery management features like display for battery capacity, range, gear, power and battery consumption. EBike Navigation also offers assistance recommendations for optimizing battery capacity along with a real rage calculation based on terrain elevation and other variable conditions. In mid-2010, the firm released an iPhone app version of the software that included technology allowing off-road [[turn-by-turn navigation]].

== Functionality ==
Length units and map grids are selectable. Units include [[metric system|metric]], [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[nautical]]. Grids include 24 [[spatial referencing system|national grids]], such as [[WGS-84]], British ([[OSGB36]]), [[NAD27]], [[NAD83]].

Mapping supports [[JPG]] files as maps, calibration desktop software program, auto map loading feature, zoom and pan by pen or joystick, flexible layer and track/route display, distance measuring and route defining manually by drawing on maps. The map can also be blank.

For navigation, the digital compass has a real time rotating [[compass]] with a target arrow. The target arrow points to a defined target coordinate. Any waypoint, trackpoint, or point of map can be selected as target, with six different types of compass views, 38 selectable compass tools, voice navigation and next turn indication for routes. The trip computer monitors whole trips, with options to save, load and reset. It has 31 selectable trip computer tools, a graph for altitude and speed, selectable tool window size, and can push track data into trip computer to get a full track analysis.

Waypoints, [[point of interest]] (POI) support [[GPS eXchange Format]] (GPX), [[LOC record|LOC]], [[Keyhole Markup Language]] (KML) files. Track, route supports GPX, [[GPS Exchange Format#Data types|TRK]], KML files, and tracking recording by configurable auto, time, or distance interval. Waypoints and tracks can be viewed in [[Google Earth]] directly, with KML export/import. Flexible waypoint management, convert track to route and reverse route direction.

It can do [[NMEA 0183|NMEA]] recording, playback (with selectable speed), and can jump to any position in NMEA files, skipping unneeded data.

Position sharing allows user positions to be shared in real time with other users, which position is also displayed. All user positions can be monitored in a web browser, suitable for precise personal and [[vehicle tracking system|vehicle tracking]].

== Vector and raster graphics ==
GPS navigation applications use vector-based maps called [[vector graphics]]. This map type contains objects such as points of interest, city names, and street names, which are stored in data tables inside the map itself. GPS Tuner uses such vector map data, combined with [[raster graphics]] based maps.

Custom user maps can be created and calibrated by users, or pre-calibrated maps can be downloaded from many free websites. As pictures, the maps need no updating until any elements of the picture map change, such as street positions, new roads are added, etc. POIs are not built into the pictures, and are instead maintained in a separate vector file database.

The '''German Institute of Food Technologies''' (ger. ''Deutsches Institut f√ºr Lebensmitteltechnik e.V.'' - DIL) is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] and self-financing research institute supported by more than 120 members from fields of food production, [[mechanical engineering]], [[process engineering]] and [[metrology]].
The DIL was founded in 1983 and is situated in the [[Osnabr√ºck (district)|county of Osnabr√ºck]], one of the regions with the highest numbers of full-time employees and highest density of food industry enterprises in Germany.&lt;ref name="eng"&gt;DIL Business [http://www.dil-ev.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/dil-eng.pdf Statistics] Accessed on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The research focus of the DIL is to develop innovative methods for [[food production]], [[quality assurance]] and [[process optimization]]. Beneficiaries of new insights in food technology are small and medium-sized enterprises. Stated as main objective is the improvement of efficiency and increase of competitiveness of companies from the food industry.

According to own sources, the institute finances itself by 90% through external funds, out of which 55% are used to cooperate directly with members of the DIL.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071128134744/http://www.dil-ev.de/staticsite/staticsite.php?menuid=4&amp;topmenu=4&amp;keepmenu=inactive DIL Introduction] Accessed on 22 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In May 1985, a new building was planned for the DIL in the [[Klaus von Klitzing|Professor-von-Klitzing]] Street, where the foundation stone was laid on September 1985 by [[Birgit Breuel]], who was Secretary of Commerce then. The [[Minister-President of Lower Saxony]] at that time, [[Ernst Albrecht (politician)|Ernst Albrecht]], inaugurated the new building at the turn of the year 1986/1987.

In 1988, the institute was renamed into its present name, "''German Institute of Food Technologies''", and its legal form was changed from membership cooperation to registered association.&lt;ref name="PDF"&gt;CDL Lower Saxony [http://cdl.niedersachsen.de/blob/images/C28785004_L20.pdf Scientific Commission of Lower Saxony about the DIL]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 Mai 2009, the foundation stone for the expansion of the DIL building was laid by Friedrich-Otto Ripke, the Secretary of State for agriculture, nutrition, and consumer protection.
The former Minister-President of Lower Saxony [[Christian Wulff]] and Hans-Heinrich Ehlen were thanked for their personal contribution to the grant which enables the German Institute of Food Technologies to cooperate and link itself with further research institutes in the county.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="15euro"&gt;DIL Investment [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/servicemenucontainer/servicemenu/news-detail/article/15-millionen-euro-investition-im-artland/16.html - ‚Ç¨ 15 million investment for Artland municipality] Accessed on 22 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of DIL's agenda for 2015, the current building had to be expanded.  The state of Lower Saxony had agreed to support the [[Artland|Artland municipality]] with a subsidy of ‚Ç¨15 million to enable local agribusinesses and food production companies to develop their international competitiveness.&lt;ref name="PDF"/&gt;

==Business divisions==

===Product innovation===
New trends in markets and direct orders from companies serve as drive and guideline to develop appealing, healthy food products for all market segments: confectionery, baked goods, dairy and meat products, snacks and convenience products. The development process is also governed by a comprehensive analytical characterization of the structure of ingredients. Physical analysis in thermal, rheological and physiochemical tests enable possibilities to identify and characterize microstructures such as foams, emulsions and suspensions.&lt;ref name="dil2"&gt;DIL Business [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/business-fields/product-development.html Business Fields Product development] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process technology===
The focus of this business field is set to investigate in more efficient methods to process food production. Main goals include energy reduction, automation of technical processes and the use of new technologies to transform materials.
The following areas are highlights of the process development:
* [[Pulsed Electric Field Processing]]
* [[Food extrusion|Extrusion]]
* [[High pressure food preservation|High Pressure Processing]]
* [[Ultrasound]]/Shockwave Technology
* Application of [[supercritical fluid]]s &lt;ref name="dil3"&gt;DIL Business [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/business-fields/process-development.html Business Fields Process development] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food safety===
Products are tested upon their safety to avoid unforeseen incidents such as contamination of food. Raw material but also final products are being tested according to legal requirements and regulations in order to be safe for the consumer.
Main areas of focus are [[quality management]], chemical- and microbiological analysis. Although the food producer alone carries the responsibility for the production of safe food and the implementation of the necessary measures, the DIL can support food producers through quality controls and seminars about hygiene management.&lt;ref name="comp32"&gt;DIL Business Fields [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/business-fields/safety.html Business Fields Food safety] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center of Food Physics===
The Center of Food Physics (ZLP) is the latest business division of the DIL ; it started operation in mid-2011. On behalf of its customers, the ZLP investigates the relationship between structure and function and transfers its findings on structure formation mechanisms into process technology. The scale-up of technical and industrial applications is conducted in cooperation with other DIL divisions in order to be able to process complex R&amp;D tasks for its customers effectively and to a high level. While chemical analysis is concerned with the determination of the quality and quantity of substances and material systems, physical analysis applies expert knowledge, advanced measuring and examination methods and tailormade
analysis concepts to characterize materials and material systems. Since structures are the key to understanding properties, this area is of particular importance. The work of the ZLP is methodology-oriented, which means that the central elements are the development and application of measuring techniques for physical characterization. The measuring methods will then be adapted to the respective material systems. The existing expertise and the available measuring and examination systems of the industry and other research institutes can thereby be offered as a service to minimize the gap between research and application.&lt;ref name="service"&gt;DIL Annual Report [http://www.dil-ev.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pics/mitgliedschaft/Downloads/Jahresbericht_2011/DIL_Jahresbericht_Annual_report_2011.pdf]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Accessed on 11 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Bioeconomy===
Since 2012, the Bio-Economy division has been a new research focus at DIL. It serves as an interface between research platforms and business divisions. Cross-thematic and cross-sectoral research activities have been established to promote the structural change from an oil-based to a bio-based industry along with major opportunities for growth and employment. At the same time, international responsibility needs to be taken on the issues of the global food supply, the biomass-based supply of raw materials and energy, and climate and environmental protection. DIL is continually working to pave the way for bio-based food production. As part of these efforts, natural resources shall be used and new ways of using renewable raw materials are to be developed. This will be made possible through the development of new, bio-based production processes. This objective not only serves to preserve our living space, but also improves product quality and is good for our health. The division has its own research projects planned for 2013.

===Structure and functionality===
The quality of food is determined by their structure. Therefore, an optimization of food structures leads an improvement of long-term quality of food. Based on test on structure generation and the interdependency with the quality of food the DIL tries to increase the shelf-life of products.&lt;ref name="compe"&gt;DIL Research [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/expertise/structure-and-functionality.html Structure &amp; Functionality] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proteintechnology===
When the Bio-Economy division was founded in 2012, it was accompanied by an extensive realignment and expansion of the research platforms. As a result, meat technology was removed from the Process Technology business division, the biotechnology focus was placed on enzyme and raw material research, and a new research platform was founded for feed technology. Together, these three areas comprise the Protein Technology research division. These newly created capacities are the key to an integrated approach to global problems in the area of Bio-Economy.

===Robotics===
New application areas for robotics are being researched, far away from the traditional image of robotics where robots are mostly used for packing processes. Safe and hygienic handling of unpacked and packed food products are main highlight in this field. Through cooperation with food producers, robotics engineers and manufacturers the DIL establishes new functions for robotics.&lt;ref name="compe2"&gt;DIL Research [http://www.dil-ev.de/en/expertise/robotics.html Robotics] Accessed on 23 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process analysis===
The optimization of existing (production) processes always increases the competitiveness of the entrepreneur. The implementation of advanced process analysis into existing systems allows the performance of the plants to be optimized further. On a daily basis sensor technology provides new and improved options for the collection of measuring data. Processing data can consequently be compiled with much higher precision and at shorter intervals. This allows the optimization of production parameters such as quality, pieces/minute, reject rate ‚Äì no matter whether it's anticipatory (e.g. by assessing the products introduced into the process) or downstream (e.g. control at the end of each process stage). This is where the value of the information becomes most visible. Many production plants are still not yet operating to their performance capabilities. There are many possibilities for process analysis to further improve the quality achieved so far.&lt;ref name="service"/&gt;

==Cooperations==

The German Institute of Food Technologies functions as one of the main coordinating bodies.&lt;ref name="fhosna"&gt;University of Applied Sciences Osnabr√ºck [http://www.fh-osnabrueck.de/722+M5ade6d7b14f.html New cooperation with DIL] Accessed on 24 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
Along with the [[University of Groningen]], the Netherlands and the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] (TNO), the DIL founded the ICCF (International Competence Center Food and Research Development) as research collaboration. This project was established to link closer cooperation and integration between the German and Dutch parts of the [[Ems Dollart Region]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;
The German Institute of Food Technologies operates worldwide with customers from Japan, China, India, Australia and the USA. Among DIL's customers are [[Multinational corporation|global players]] such as [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]], [[General Mills]] and [[Barilla Group|Barilla]].&lt;ref name="brochure"/&gt;

===HighTech Europe===
[[Image:Hightech Europe logo.png|thumb|right|200px|Official logo of HighTech Europe]]
HighTech Europe is an initiative of European research organizations, industrial associations and enterprises with the goal of setting up a European Institute of Food Technology in order to share competences and knowledge of research available in Europe and to strengthen the resident industry for global competition. Long-term goal of the network of excellence is to achieve a long-lasting integration of the European R&amp;D activities into high-tech food processing.

The network is coordinated by the DIL and sponsored by the 7th EU Framework Programme EU research sponsoring. Currently, the network counts 22 members, 21 being from Europe and one from Oceania. Project aims have been implemented by creating and applying various knowledge transfer tools. Network partners identified potential innovations from the biotechnology, nanotechnology, information- and communication technology and other areas to be used by food industry especially small and medium enterprises. Result is a unique database for the food processing sector, the Food Technology Innovation Portal (www.foodtech-portal.eu). Further results and network activities are available on the project website.&lt;ref name="dilhichtech"&gt;HighTech Europe {{cite web |url=http://www.hightecheurope.eu/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160108072229/http%3A//www.hightecheurope.eu/ |archivedate=8 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}.

The M circle with M = 0.45 is highlighted in red and intercepts the Nyquist plot at frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega \approx \pm 1.64&lt;/math&gt;.]]
'''Hall circles''' (also known as M-circles and N-circles) are a graphical tool in [[control theory]] used to obtain values of a [[closed-loop transfer function]] from the [[Nyquist-plot|Nyquist plot]] (or the [[Nichols plot]]) of the associated open-loop transfer function. Hall circles have been introduced in control theory by Albert C. Hall in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857968901|title=The analysis and synthesis of linear servomechanisms|last=C.|first=Hall, Albert|date=1943|publisher=Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=9780262080736|location=Cambridge|oclc=857968901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction ==
Consider a closed-loop linear control system with open-loop transfer function given by [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt;G(s)&lt;/math&gt; and with a unit gain in the feedback loop. The closed-loop transfer function is given by &lt;math display="inline"&gt; T(s) = \frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)} &lt;/math&gt;. 

To check the stability of ''T''(''s''), it is possible to use the Nyquist stability criterion with the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function ''G''(''s''). Note, however, that only the Nyquist plot of ''G''(''s'') does not give the actual values of ''T''(''s''). To get this information from the G(s)-plane, Hall proposed to construct the [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that ''T''(''s'') has constant magnitude and the also the locus of points in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that ''T''(''s'') has constant phase angle.

Given a positive real value ''M'' representing a fixed magnitude, and denoting G(s) by ''z'', the points satisfying  &lt;math display="block"&gt; M = |T(s)| = \frac{|G(s)|}{|1+G(s)|} = \frac{|z|}{|1+z|} &lt;/math&gt;are given by the points ''z'' in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that the ratio of the distance between ''z'' and 0 and the distance between ''z'' and -1 is equal to ''M''. The points ''z'' satisfying this locus condition are [[circles of Apollonius]], and this locus is known in the context of control systems as ''M-circles''.

Given a positive real value ''N'' representing a phase angle, the points satisfying &lt;math display="block"&gt; N = \arg \left[\frac{G(s)}{1+G(s)}\right] = \arg[G(s)] - \arg[1+G(s)] = \arg[z] - \arg[1+z] &lt;/math&gt;are given by the points z in the ''G''(''s'')-plane such that the angle between -1 and z and the angle between 0 and z is constant. In other words, the angle opposed to the line segment between -1 and 0 must be constant. This implies that the points z satisfying this locus condition are arcs of circles,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/inscribed.shtml|title=Munching on Inscribed Angles|last=|first=|date=|website=cut-the-knot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this locus is known in the context of control systems as ''N-circles''.

== Usage ==
[[File:Nichols_chart.svg|thumb|Nichols plot of the transfer function 1/s(1+s)(1+2s) along with the modified M and N circles.]]
To use the Hall circles, a plot of M and N circles is done over the Nyquist plot of the open-loop transfer function. The points of the intersection between these graphics give the corresponding value of the closed-loop transfer function.

Hall circles are also used with the [[Nichols plot]] and in this setting, are also known as Nichols chart. Rather than overlaying directly the Hall circles over the Nichols plot, the points of the circles are transferred to a new coordinate system where the ordinate is given by &lt;math&gt; 20 \log_{10}(|G(s)|) &lt;/math&gt; and the abscissa is given by &lt;math&gt; \arg(G(s))&lt;/math&gt;. The advantage of using Nichols chart is that adjusting the gain of the open loop transfer function directly reflects in up and down translation of the Nichols plot in the chart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17125">A '''high-field domain''' is a band of elevated field orthogonal to the equi-current lines and seen in photoconductive {{math|CdS}} and monochromatic light at the band edge as dark band was discovered by B√∂er,&lt;ref name="Boer1959"&gt;Karl W. B√∂er, Z. Physik 155, 184 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Franz-Keldysh effect]]. Such domains must appear&lt;ref name="Boer1959" /&gt; whenever the conductivity decreases stronger than linearly. This can be caused by the field dependence of the carrier density, as observed in copper-doped {{math|CdS}} caused by Frenkel Poole excitation of holes, causing faster electron recombination, known as field quenching.&lt;ref name="BoerDussel1967"&gt;Karl W. B√∂er and G. A. Dussel Phys. Rev. 154, 291 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; These high-field domains, now referred to as [[high-field domain#B√∂er domains|B√∂er domains]], or by field dependence of the mobility,&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. B√∂er Monatsber. d. Deutsch Akadem. d. Wissensch. 1, 325 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; caused by excitation of electrons into higher conduction bands with lower mobility as observed in {{math|GaAs}}, called the [[Gunn effect]].&lt;ref&gt;J.B.Gunn  Solid  State Commun. 1, 88 (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Kroemer, Proceedings IEEE 52, 1230 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; The high-field domains can be identified by periodical field oscillations between high (the domain) and low values, as shown in Fig. 1.&lt;ref name="Canta1993"&gt;Cantapediera, I.R., et al. Phys. Rev. B48, 12278 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pco-gunn-diode-fig-time.jpg|thumb|left|Fig. 1 Periodic current oscillation in a Gunn diode.&lt;ref name="Canta1993" /&gt;]]

Many other crystals show such domains by typical current oscillations. The high-field domains in copper doped {{math|CdS}} can be easily observed by the [[Franz-Keldysh effect]] as stationary, adjacent to the cathode&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968"&gt;Karl W. B√∂er and P. Voss, Phys. Rev. 171, 899 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2"&gt;Karl W. B√∂er and P. Voss, phys. status solidi 28, 355 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; or moving.&lt;ref name="Schoell1978"&gt;E. Schoell,Non-equilibrium Phase Transitions in Semiconductors, Springer, Berlin (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw1987"&gt;M.P. Shaw, V.V. Mitin, and H.L. Grubin The Physics of Instabilities in Solid State Electerronic Devices Plenum Press New York (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;  These are analyzed as another example below.

Theory: Stationary high-field domains can be analyzed  from the transport- and Poisson equations:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dn}{dx}=\frac{e}{kT}\left (\frac{j}{e\mu}-nF\right )&lt;/math&gt; {{pad|2em}} and {{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;\frac{dF}{dx}=\frac{e}{\epsilon\epsilon_0}\left (n-n_a\right )&lt;/math&gt;

The projection of any solution curves into an arbitrary {{math|&lt;var&gt;nF&lt;/var&gt;}} plane can be filled with direction arrows at any point of this plane. Two auxiliary curves for which {{math|&lt;var&gt;dn/dx&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}}, called {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;)}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;dF/dx&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}} called {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;)}} divide this plane into four quadrants with the same type of directions. This is shown in Fig. 2(left) in a double logarithmic representation.&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968" /&gt;
Any solution of an {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}}-type semiconductor with blocking cathode must start at the boundary density {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;var&gt;c&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} that is below the density in the bulk, and approaches the singular point at which {{math|&lt;var&gt;dn/dx&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} &lt;var&gt;dF/dx&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}}, that is in the bulk where both {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} and {{math|&lt;var&gt;F&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} are constant. The solution curve represents a [[schottky contact|Schottky-blocking contact]] as shown in Fig. 2(B), curve (a).&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt;

When this point coincides with the boundary density {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, a high-field domain solution (b) develops.&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt;

}}

When {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} decreases at higher fields due to field-quenching cause by [[Poole-Frenkel effect|Poole-Frenkel]] excitation of holes from Coulomb attractive hole traps, that consequently enhances electron recombination through recombination centers, and thereby deforms the {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} curve at higher fields as shown in Fig. 2(B). When the bias is increased the current curve {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} is shifted upwards and to the right, and when it crosses {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;)}} again, it produces a second singular point II. With further increased bias this singular point II reaches the value of the boundary density {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the solution curve changes from a monotonic increasing Schottky-solution, to a high-field domain, curve (b): that remains constant near the cathode, and then changes within a few [[Debye length]]s to approach the constant value in the bulk, near the singular point I. The width of the domain increases with bias (Fig. 3a), while the current remains constant (Fig. 3c).&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt; The domain is visible as dark part in the transmission picture through the {{math|CdS}} platelett, extending from the cathode as shown in Fig. 3a. The field in the domain can be obtained from the slope of the domain that increases with bias (Fig. 3b).&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt;

When, with further increased bias the domain fills the entire sample,then it flips to an anode adjacent high-field domain (Fig. 4b). The field at the cathode is now much higher than for the cathode adjacent domain (Fig. 4b and c), while the current still remains essentially constant (Fig. 4c).&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968" /&gt;

'''High-field domains to determine the [[work function]] of blocking contacts'''

Since the high field domain starts at the electron density given by the work-function at the cathode and pulls the [[Schottky barrier]] open to a constant field in the domain, this [[work function]] can be determined precisely, and it can be used as a tool to determine the changes of the [[work function]], as it varies depending on external parameters. As an example, it can be shown that it depends on the optical excitation in a photoconductor (See Fig. 5).&lt;ref name="Stirn1973"&gt;R. J. Stirn, K. W. B√∂er, and G. A. Dussel, Phys. Rev. B 7.4, 1443 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:4(C) Work function as function of the light intensity for different cathode metals.jpg|frame|left|Fig. 5 (a) [[Work function]] as function of the light intensity for different cathode metals.&lt;ref name="Stirn1973" /&gt;]]

'''High-field domains as tools to measure the electron density in the field quenched branch and of the electron mobility as a function of the temperature'''
[[File:5 Shadow band within a photoconductor changes conductivity and field within the Band.jpg|frame|right|Fig. 6 Shadow band within a photoconductor changes conductivity and field within the Band and thereby the boundary density at the right side of the band, i.e., it acts as a pseudo-cathode&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt; with the high-field domain starting at the anode-side of the pseudo-cathode.]]

The high-field domain is determined by the boundary density at the cathode and the field within the domain. A shadow band in front of the cathode acts as a pseudo-cathode, as it reduces the electron density within the shadow (Fig. 6).&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt; This can be used as an experimental tool to change the boundary density as a function of the light intensity within the shadow.

This permits to measure directly the electron density in the field-quenched range, using different pseudo-electron densities, causing a shift of the singular point, and measuring the domain field.&lt;ref name="BoerVoss1968-2" /&gt;

The electron [[Hall mobility#Hall mobility|Hall mobility]] can be measured by placing the {{math|CdS}} platelett in a magnet and applying a bias sufficient to create a high-field domain. When the domain is extended to include the Hall electrodes one can determine the [[Hall mobility#Hall mobility|Hall mobility]] within the domain. Different fields in the high-field domain are achieved by using different samples or different cathode metals.&lt;ref name="BoerBogus1968"&gt;K. W. B√∂er and K. Bogus, Phys. Rev. 186, 793 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stationary domains to explain efficiency improvement of {{math|CdTe}} solar cells with a thin {{math|CdS}} cover layer'''

The application of a 200√Ö thick copper doped layer of {{math|CdS}} on top of a typically 2 Œºm thick {{math|CdTe}} solar cell, increases the [[open circuit voltage]] substantially, so that it can reach the theoretical limit of the band gap of the {{math|CdTe}}-emitter when extrapolated to 0 {{math|K}}.
This improvement can be explained by limiting the field in the {{math|CdS}} side of the junction when it reaches the critical value for a high-field domain to appear and thereby limits the maximum junction field to the domain field of typical 50 {{math|kV/cm}}.&lt;ref name="BoerHansch1959"&gt;K. W. B√∂er, H. J.

'''Moving high-field domains in copper-doped {{math|CdS}} with a small circular cathode'''

The domains started from the cathode, separates and, with increasing bias increases its radius. When the anode is reached the ring disappeared and a new domain grows from the cathode. The process repeated itself with a period of 10 sec (Fig. 7).&lt;ref name="Boer1959" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boer2011"&gt;K.W.

Such undeformed moving domains in crystals with slit electrodes are bands parallel to the electrodes, and seen by the oscillating field, when plotted in a {{math|x,F,t}} diagram give the optical impression of bifurcation (Fig. 8).&lt;ref name="Canta1993" /&gt;

Such moving high-field domains are measured in p-Ge with (a) local voltage (b) field- and (c) carrier density oscillation (Fig. 9).&lt;ref name="Kahn1991"&gt;Kahn, A. M. et al., Phys. Rev. B 43, 9742 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

Undeformed moving high-field domains and domains with deformation (Chaos) are observed in many other crystals,&lt;ref name="Schoell2001"&gt;Eckehard Schoell, Non-linear SpatioTemporal Dynamics and Chaos in Semiconductors Cambridge University Press, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and also in nanocrystals&lt;ref&gt;K.N. Akkeseev et al. Phys. Rev. B 52,7849 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; or superlatices.&lt;ref&gt;L.L. Bonilla et al. Solid State E 140,161 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, because of the small size they can only be analyzed by the changing shape of the current-voltage characteristics.

{{Anchor|B√∂er domains}}'''B√∂er domains'''

The high-field domains were renamed B√∂er domains at the 50th anniversary of their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Thiessen, Phys. stat. sol. (2011) {{DOI|10.1002/pssb.20146605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|The Benefits of the High-Field Domains}}'''The Benefits of the High-Field Domains'''

Copper-doped photoconductive CdS shows high-field domains when at sufficient bias and with blocking contacts these domains remain attached to the contacts. The field within the domain is constant and the current is by drift only. With increased bias the domain  width increases. When it reaches both electrodes the entire crystal becomes space-charge free (this is one more example at which an interaction vanishes: for the interaction of electrons with phonons, superconductivity results; from the interaction of photons with phonons, lasers can be produced). This gives the opportunity to measure the spectral distribution of defect levels free of interaction of the broadening electric field surrounding the defects. A first example is shown by the extremely sharp quenching spectrum of a CdS crystal that has been inverted to become p-type with a high-field-domain (Fig. 10)

[[File:High field domain signal.png|thumb|Fig. 10 Electron-photo quenching signal (shown in red) in a p-type ultra-pure CdS crystal. The insert show the spectral distribution of the monochromator used that has no anomalies in the range of the signal.&lt;ref name="Boer:2015"&gt;B√∂er, K. W. (2015), The importance of gold-electrode-adjacent stationary high-field B√∂er domains for the photoconductivity of CdS. Ann. Phys., 527: 378‚Äì395. {{DOI|10.1002/andp.201500115}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another benefit of the high-field domain is the direct connection of any p-type emitter through a copper-doped thin CdS layer directly to an electron-blocking electrode through which the holes are extracted, and  the open circuit voltage is increased to approach the theoretical limit of the band gap or the emitter at 0K. Because in the CdS the hole current is now carried by drift only, we can finally draw the band model of a typical solar cell. e.g. the CdS/CdTe cell as given in Fig. 11.
For the first time we can replace the estimate of the band connection of abrupt hetero-junctions from the difference  of electron affinities by calculating it from the continuity of the majority carrier current, with the only small discontinuity left by the difference of the effective masses of the carriers at the different carrier bands.

'''IPtronics''' was a [[fabless semiconductor company]] headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Its products include [[integrated circuits]] for parallel [[optical interconnect]] applications intended for the computer, storage and communication industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=22274761|title=IPtronics: Private Company Information|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fibresystems.org/cws/product/P000008928|title=IPtronics Enables 40GE, 100GE and Beyond‚Ä¶|publisher=FiberSystems.org |date=December 16, 2008|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPtronics' design center is certified by [[STMicroelectronics]], which is also their [[semiconductor foundry]] partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://iptronics.com/36958/Partners/|title=IPtronics: About Us: Partners| publisher=IPtronics |accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, IPtronics was acquired by [[Mellanox Technologies]].&lt;ref name="mellanox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/mellanox-technologies-ltd-announces-definitive-agreement-to-acquire-iptronics-as-20130604-00196 | title= Mellanox Technologies Ltd.

==History==

IPtronics was founded in 2003 and built up by former directors, managers and engineers from Giga A/S, which was acquired by [[Intel Corporation]] in 2000 for $1.25 billion USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.eu/206800294|title=News|publisher=www.eetimes.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Intel-to-buy-Giga-for-1.25-billion/2100-12_3-265102.html|title=Intel to buy Giga for $1.25 billion |publisher=CNET |date=March 15, 2000|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2013, it was announced that IPtronics was acquired by [[Mellanox Technologies]] at a total cash purchase price of approximately $47.5 million, subject to certain adjustments.&lt;ref name="mellanox" /&gt;

===Founders and staff===

Three former Giga employees, Niels Finseth, Steen Bak Christensen, and Eivind Johansen, co-founded IPtronics. Giga A/S specialized in products for [[telecommunication]] and [[data communication]] applications, as for example [[OC-48]] and [[OC-192]].  Finseth was previously an engineering manager, responsible for all 10&amp;nbsp;[[Gbit/s]] IC product development. Mr. Christensen was also previously an engineering manager, responsible for all 2.5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s development. Johansen was a co-founder of Giga (1987) as well, serving as the technical director until the acquisition by Intel, followed by a CTO position at Intel's Optical Component Division (OCD) and being appointed Intel Fellow in 2001, a corporate VP position for his technical leadership in [[optical communication]]. In May 2004, Henning Lysdal was recruited as COO, previously high-speed [[PHY]] development manager at Intel OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opticalkeyhole.com/eventtext.asp?ID=75465&amp;pd=2/20/2008&amp;bhcp=1|title=IPtronics, supplier of silicon for parallel optical interconnects, raises $10.25m in series B funding round|publisher=Optical Key Hole|date=February 19, 2008|accessdate=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysdal later became VP of engineering after hiring a dedicated director of operations. Two former colleagues from Giga/Intel, who were at that time CEOs in their respective Danish electronic companies, were recruited to IPtronics. Steen Gundersen came from a position as the CEO of Alight Technologies and Jesper Wolf Bek came from a position as the CEO of Kaleido Technology.

In the beginning, the founders worked together in the garage of Steen Bak Christensen in Roskilde. As the first employee was hired in February 2005, IPtronics moved into new premises outside Roskilde.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IPtronics, supplier of silicon for parallel optical interconnects, raises $10.25m in series B funding round|url=http://www.opticalkeyhole.com/eventtext.asp?ID=75465&amp;pd=2/20/2008&amp;bhcp=1|publisher=Optical Keyhole|date=February 20, 2008|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Giga had customer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business.dk/finans/giga-venner-satser-paa-lave-ny-giga|title=Giga-venner satser p√• at lave ny Giga|publisher=Business.dk|date=February 19, 2008|accessdate=July 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- need to translate into non-promotional language please --&gt;

In 2006, Intel closed its Danish office, which resulted in even more new electronics start-ups in [[Copenhagen metropolitan area]] as well as many employees joining already existing companies such as IPtronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ue.dk/nyhedsarkiv/5921.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719132508/http://www.ue.dk/nyhedsarkiv/5921.aspx |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several new additions to the staff from 2008 and beyond have a different background than from Giga or Intel, such as Navid Ostadian-Binai.
During 2006, the company appointed J√∏rgen Bardenfleth as chairman of the board of directors. Bardenfleth is the country general manager of [[Microsoft]] Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.globalisering.dk/multimedia/Jorgen_Bardenfleth.pdf|title=J√∏rgen Bardenfleth - Adm.

===Early products===

The company's first customer was [[CERN]], the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The IPtronics chips were produced with [[TriQuint Semiconductor]]'s [[GaAs]] foundry process technology. These devices are being used as front-end electronics for Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC), a gaseous
[[particle detector]] capable of sub-nanosecond time resolution on very large areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS125397+07-Oct-2008+BW20081007 | work=Reuters | title=TriQuint Powered Integrated Circuits Used in "Big Bang" Experiment at CERN Facility | date=October 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2005, IPtronics started developing optical interconnects in a collaboration with NEC Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.opticalkeyhole.com/eventtext.asp?ID=62503&amp;pd=10/13/2006&amp;bhcp=1|publisher=Optical KeyHole | title=IPtronics, developing optical interconnect products, closes $2m in second round funding| date=October 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.iptronics.com/37345/NEC+and+IPtronics+cooperate+on+tiny+optical+module|publisher=IPtronics | title=IPtronics cooperate with NEC on tiny optical module - IPtronics enables low power modules| date=October 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===

During the summer of 2008, IPtronics opened its North American office in [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091015030656/http://www.iptronics.com/37456/IPtronics%20Incorporated/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, IPtronics joined the [[InfiniBand Trade Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=InfiniBand Trade Association: Member roster|url=http://www.infinibandta.org/content/pages.php?pg=about_us_roster|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/04/prweb3929424.htm|title=InfiniBand Trade Association (IBTA) Announces Release of New Publication: Introduction to InfiniBand for End Users|publisher=[[PRWeb]]|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which promoted [[InfiniBand]] technology. 
IPtronics announced it would offer low power and high volume products.&lt;ref name="iptronicsparalleloptics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iptronics.com/37770/IPtronics%20Offers%20low%20cost%20Silicon%20for%20Parallel%20Optics/|title=IPtronics Offers low cost Silicon for Parallel Optics - IPtronics adds solutions for the growing Low Cost and HDMI market in Asia|date=June 2010|publisher=IPtronics|accessdate=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPtronics later also joined the associations, [[Optical Internetworking Forum]] and [[PCI-SIG|Peripheral Component Interconnect Special Interest Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oiforum.com/|title=Optical Internetworking Forum|publisher=Optical Internetworking Forum|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcisig.com/membership/about_us/membership_roster/|title=PCI-SIG Membership Roster|publisher=PCI-SIG|accessdate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

This technology enables parallel optical interconnect systems that computer manufactures have begun to adopt in order to overcome the physical constraints from using copper-based connections over high speed interfaces and [[backplanes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fibresystems.org/cws/article/newsfeed/32972] {{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commsdesign.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206800904&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parallel optical interface|Parallel optics]] is introduced to be able to simultaneously transmit and receive data at high [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidths]] over multiple fibers, initially implemented in supercomputers and servers followed by an upcoming introduction into consumer electronics.&lt;ref name="iptronics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|title=Parallel Optical Interconnects|last=Bek|first=Jesper|date=2008-06-09|publisher=IPtronics|accessdate=2010-04-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305124306/http://www.iptronics.com/36209/Optical%20interconnects.html|archivedate=2011-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, IPtronics announced it had reached a shipment milestone, passing 1 million ICs, and the company states the majority is shipped to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iptronics.com/38122/IPtronics%20Reaches%20Shipment%20Milestone%20/|title=IPtronics Reaches Shipment Milestone - IPtronics passed the 1M units Shipped Mark in June 2011 |last=Bek|first=Jesper|date=2011-06-16|publisher=IPtronics|accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active optical cables===

Late 2007, IPtronics started shipping 4-channel and 12-channel [[chipset]]s capable of operating at a minimum of 10&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s per channel, primarily targeting data center and supercomputer applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.eu/germany/212901320|title=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chipset consists of a VCSEL driver and a Transimpedance amplifier (TIA). The company also states to have qualified solder bump versions of the same two chipsets to be used for [[flip chip]] mounting, the preferred assembly technology in high-volume production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.interconnectionworld.com/index/display/article-display/355756/articles/connector-specifier/industry-news/2009/03/iptronics-unveils-high-volume-flip-chip-solutions-for-40-120-gigabit-sec-apps.html|title=IPtronics unveils high volume 'flip chip' solutions for 40-, 120-Gigabit/sec apps|publisher=Interconnection World|date=March 10, 2009|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early 2010, IPtronics announced 16&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s versions of their 4- and 12-channel VCSEL drivers and TIAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lightwaveonline.com/equipment-design/news/IPtronics-offers-silicon-for-16-Gbps-per-channel-parallel-optics--87006737.html|title=IPtronics offers silicon for 16-Gbps per channel parallel optics|publisher=[[LightWave]]|date=March 8, 2010|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iptronics.com/37829/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713053957/http://www.iptronics.com/37829/ |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company announced in June 2010 it would address the market for "lower rates", especially driven by [[HDMI]] cables, at higher volumes, and a lower cost structure than active optical cables for InfiniBand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lightwaveonline.com/equipment-design/news/IPtronics-targets-low-cost-HDMI-with-parallel-optics-drivers-and-TIAs-96327159.html|title=IPtronics targets low-cost, HDMI with parallel optics drivers and TIAs|publisher=[[LightWave]]|date=June 14, 2010|accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2010 China International Optoelectronic Exposition and European Conference and Exhibition on Optical Communication, the company presented a demonstration of their optical HDMI by transmitting signals from a [[Blu-ray]] DVD player to a [[LCD television]], targeted for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.iptronics.com/35527/ | work=IPtronics | title=IPtronics adds solutions for the growing Low Cost and HDMI market in Asia | date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, IPtronics released a new 4-channel chipset for pluggable module applications, and the company claims to have reduced the power consumption compared to their first-generation 4-channel chipset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://iptronics.com/38122/IPtronics%20Releases%20New%204ch%20chip%20set%20/ | work=IPtronics | title=IPtronics Offers New 4ch silicon | date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic aperture radar===
{{main article|Synthetic aperture radar}}

[[Synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) is a form of [[radar]] in which sophisticated processing of radar data is used to produce a very narrow effective beam. It can be used to form images of relatively immobile targets; moving targets can be blurred or displaced in the formed images. SAR is a form of active remote sensing ‚Äì the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] transmits radiation that is reflected from the image area, as opposed to passive sensing, where the reflection is detected from ambient illumination. SAR image acquisition is therefore independent of natural illumination and images can be taken at night. Radar uses [[electromagnetic radiation]] at [[microwave]] frequencies; the atmospheric absorption at typical radar wavelengths is very low, meaning observations are not prevented by cloud cover.

===Phase===
{{main article|Phase (waves)}}
[[File:Phase shift.svg|thumb|left|Phase difference]]

SAR makes use of the [[amplitude]] and the absolute [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of the return signal data. In contrast, interferometry uses differential phase of the reflected radiation, either from multiple passes along the same trajectory and/or from multiple displaced phase centers (antennas) on a single pass. Since the outgoing wave is produced by the satellite, the phase is known, and can be compared to the phase of the return signal. The phase of the return wave depends on the distance to the ground, since the path length to the ground and back will consist of a number of whole [[wavelengths]] plus some fraction of a wavelength. This is observable as a [[Phase (waves)#Phase difference|phase difference]] or phase shift in the returning wave. The total distance to the satellite (i.e., the number of whole wavelengths) is known based on the time that it takes for the energy to make the round trip back to the satellite‚Äîbut it is the extra fraction of a wavelength that is of particular interest and is measured to great accuracy.

In practice, the phase of the return signal is affected by several factors, which together can make the absolute phase return in any SAR data collection essentially arbitrary, with no correlation from pixel to pixel. To get any useful information from the phase, some of these effects must be isolated and removed. Interferometry uses two images of the same area taken from the same position (or, for topographic applications, slightly different positions) and finds the difference in phase between them, producing an image known as an interferogram. This is measured in [[radian]]s of phase difference and, because of the cyclic nature of phase, is recorded as repeating fringes that each represent a full 2œÄ cycle.{{clear}}

=== Factors affecting phase ===
{{further|Reflection (physics)|topography}}
The most important factor affecting the phase is the interaction with the ground surface. The phase of the wave may change on [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], depending on the properties of the material. The reflected signal back from any one pixel is the summed contribution to the phase from many smaller 'targets' in that ground area, each with different [[dielectric]] properties and distances from the satellite, meaning the returned signal is arbitrary and completely uncorrelated with that from adjacent pixels. Importantly though, it is consistent ‚Äì provided nothing on the ground changes the contributions from each target should sum identically each time, and hence be removed from the interferogram.

Once the ground effects have been removed, the major signal present in the interferogram is a contribution from orbital effects. For interferometry to work, the satellites must be as close as possible to the same spatial position when the images are acquired. This means that images from two satellite platforms with different orbits cannot be compared, and for a given satellite data from the same orbital track must be used. In practice the perpendicular distance between them, known as the ''baseline'', is often known to within a few centimetres but can only be controlled on a scale of tens to hundreds of metres. This slight difference causes a regular difference in phase that changes smoothly across the interferogram and can be modelled and removed.
[[File:SAR Kilauea topo interferogram.jpg|thumb|Corresponding interferogram of [[Kƒ´lauea]], showing topographic fringes (NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]
The slight difference in satellite position also alters the distortion caused by [[topography]], meaning an extra phase difference is introduced by a [[stereoscopic]] effect. The longer the baseline, the smaller the topographic height needed to produce a fringe of phase change ‚Äì known as the ''altitude of ambiguity''. This effect can be exploited to calculate the topographic height, and used to produce a [[digital elevation model]] (DEM).

If the height of the topography is already known, the topographic phase contribution can be calculated and removed. This has traditionally been done in two ways. In the ''two-pass'' method, elevation data from an externally derived [[digital elevation model|DEM]] is used in conjunction with the orbital information to calculate the phase contribution. In the ''three-pass'' method two images acquired a short time apart are used to create an interferogram, which is assumed to have no deformation signal and therefore represent the topographic contribution. This interferogram is then subtracted from a third image with a longer time separation to give the residual phase due to deformation.

Once the ground, orbital and topographic contributions have been removed the interferogram contains the deformation signal, along with any remaining noise (see [[#Difficulties|Difficulties]] below). The signal measured in the interferogram represents the change in phase caused by an increase or decrease in distance from the ground pixel to the satellite, therefore only the component of the ground motion parallel to the satellite line of sight vector will cause a phase difference to be observed. For sensors like [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]] with a small [[angle of incidence (optics)|incidence angle]] this measures vertical motion well, but is insensitive to horizontal motion perpendicular to the line of sight (approximately north-south). It also means that vertical motion and components of horizontal motion parallel to the plane of the line of sight (approximately east-west) cannot be separately resolved.

One fringe of phase difference is generated by a ground motion of half the radar wavelength, since this corresponds to a whole wavelength increase in the two-way travel distance. Phase shifts are only resolvable relative to other points in the interferogram. Absolute deformation can be inferred by assuming one area in the interferogram (for example a point away from expected deformation sources) experienced no deformation, or by using a ground control ([[GPS]] or similar) to establish the absolute movement of a point.

=== Difficulties ===
A variety of factors govern the choice of images which can be used for interferometry. The simplest is data availability ‚Äì radar instruments used for interferometry commonly don't operate continuously, acquiring data only when programmed to do so. For future requirements it may be possible to request acquisition of data, but for many areas of the world archived data may be sparse. Data availability is further constrained by baseline criteria. Availability of a suitable DEM may also be a factor for two-pass InSAR; commonly 90&amp;nbsp;m [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission|SRTM]] data may be available for many areas, but at high latitudes or in areas of [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission#No-data areas|poor coverage]] alternative datasets must be found.

A fundamental requirement of the removal of the ground signal is that the sum of phase contributions from the individual targets within the pixel remains constant between the two images and is completely removed. However, there are several factors that can cause this criterion to fail. Firstly the two images must be accurately [[Image registration|co-registered]] to a sub-pixel level to ensure that the same ground targets are contributing to that pixel. There is also a geometric constraint on the maximum length of the baseline ‚Äì the difference in viewing angles must not cause phase to change over the width of one pixel by more than a wavelength. The effects of topography also influence the condition, and baselines need to be shorter if terrain gradients are high. Where co-registration is poor or the maximum baseline is exceeded the pixel phase will become incoherent ‚Äì the phase becomes essentially random from pixel to pixel rather than varying smoothly, and the area appears noisy. This is also true for anything else that changes the contributions to the phase within each pixel, for example changes to the ground targets in each pixel caused by vegetation growth, landslides, agriculture or snow cover.

Another source of error present in most interferograms is caused by the propagation of the waves through the atmosphere. If the wave travelled through a vacuum it should theoretically be possible (subject to sufficient accuracy of timing) to use the two-way travel-time of the wave in combination with the phase to calculate the exact distance to the ground. However, the velocity of the wave through the atmosphere is lower than the [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]], and depends on air temperature, pressure and the [[partial pressure]] of water vapour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Zebker |first=H.A. |last2=Rosen |first2=P.A. |last3=Hensley |first3=S. |year=1997 |title=Atmospheric effects in interferometric synthetic aperture radar surface deformation and topographic maps |periodical=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=102 |pages=7547‚Äì7563|doi=10.1029/96JB03804 |bibcode=1997JGR...102.7547Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this unknown phase delay that prevents the integer number of wavelengths being calculated. If the atmosphere was horizontally [[homogeneous]] over the length scale of an interferogram and vertically over that of the topography then the effect would simply be a constant phase difference between the two images which, since phase difference is measured relative to other points in the interferogram, would not contribute to the signal. However, the atmosphere is laterally [[heterogeneous]] on length scales both larger and smaller than typical deformation signals. This spurious signal can appear completely unrelated to the surface features of the image, however, in other cases the atmospheric phase delay is caused by vertical inhomogeneity at low altitudes and this may result in fringes appearing to correspond with the topography.

=== Persistent Scatterer InSAR ===
{{further|Scattering}}
Persistent or Permanent Scatterer techniques are a relatively recent development from conventional InSAR, and rely on studying pixels which remain coherent over a sequence of interferograms. In 1999, researchers at [[Politecnico di Milano]], Italy, developed a new multi-image approach in which one searches the stack of images for objects on the ground providing consistent and stable radar reflections back to the satellite. These objects could be the size of a pixel or, more commonly, sub-pixel sized, and are present in every image in the stack. That specific implementation is patented.

Some research centres and companies, were inspired to develop variations of their own algorithms which would also overcome InSAR's limitations. In scientific literature, these techniques are collectively referred to as Persistent Scatterer Interferometry or PSI techniques. The term Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) was proposed by European Space Agency (ESA) to define the second generation of radar interferometry techniques. This term is nowadays commonly accepted by scientific and the end user community.

Commonly such techniques are most useful in urban areas with lots of permanent structures, for example the PSI studies of European geohazard sites undertaken by the Terrafirma project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrafirma.eu.com/ |title=Terrafirma.eu.com: A pan-European ground hazard information service |accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Terrafirma project provides a ground motion hazard information service, distributed throughout Europe via national geological surveys and institutions. The objective of this service is to help save lives, improve safety, and reduce economic loss through the use of state-of-the-art PSI information. Over the last 9 years this service has supplied information relating to urban subsidence and uplift, slope stability and landslides, seismic and volcanic deformation, coastlines and flood plains.

== Producing interferograms ==
{{further|interferogram}}
The processing chain used to produce interferograms varies according to the software used and the precise application but will usually include some combination of the following steps.

Two SAR images are required to produce an interferogram; these may be obtained pre-processed, or produced from raw data by the user prior to InSAR processing. The two images must first be [[Image registration|co-registered]], using a [[correlation]] procedure to find the offset and difference in geometry between the two amplitude images. One SAR image is then [[Resampling (bitmap)|re-sampled]] to match the geometry of the other, meaning each [[pixel]] represents the same ground area in both images. The interferogram is then formed by [[cross product|cross-multiplication]] of each pixel in the two images, and the interferometric phase due to the [[reference ellipsoid|curvature of the Earth]] is removed, a process referred to as flattening. For deformation applications a DEM can be used in conjunction with the baseline data to simulate the contribution of the topography to the interferometric phase, this can then be removed from the interferogram.

Once the basic interferogram has been produced, it is commonly [[filter (signal processing)|filtered]] using an adaptive power-spectrum filter to amplify the phase signal. For most quantitative applications the consecutive fringes present in the interferogram will then have to be ''unwrapped'', which involves interpolating over the 0 to 2œÄ phase jumps to produce a continuous deformation field. At some point, before or after unwrapping, incoherent areas of the image may be masked out. The final processing stage involves [[geocoding]] the image, which resamples the interferogram from the acquisition geometry (related to direction of satellite path) into the desired [[geographic projection]].

[[File:Seasat.jpg|right|thumb|Seasat (NASA/JPL-Caltech)]]

==== Spaceborne ====
Early exploitation of satellite-based InSAR included use of [[Seasat]] data in the 1980s, but the potential of the technique was expanded in the 1990s, with the launch of [[ERS-1]] (1991), [[JERS-1]] (1992), [[RADARSAT-1]] and [[ERS-2]] (1995). These platforms provided the stable, well-defined orbits and short baselines necessary for InSAR. More recently, the 11-day NASA STS-99 mission in February 2000 used a SAR antenna mounted on the [[space shuttle]] to gather data for the [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]]. In 2002 [[ESA]] launched the ASAR instrument, designed as a successor to ERS, aboard [[Envisat]]. While the majority of InSAR to date has utilised the C-band sensors, recent missions such as the [[Advanced Land Observation Satellite|ALOS PALSAR]], [[TerraSAR-X]] and [[COSMO-SkyMed]] are expanding the available data in the L- and X-band.

Most recently, ESA launched [[Sentinel-1A]] and [[Sentinel-1B]] ‚Äì two C-band sensors. Together, they provide InSAR coverage on a global scale and on a 6-day repeat cycle.

==== Airborne ====
{{expand section|date=August 2013}}
Airborne InSAR data acquisition systems are built by companies such as the American [[Intermap]], the German [[AeroSensing]], and the Brazilian [[OrbiSat]].&lt;ref&gt;http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/2003/07/01/flights-of-innovation/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Terrestrial or ground-based ====
[[Image:Deformation.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A deformation plot showing slope instability using Terrestrial InSAR]]

Terrestrial or ground-based SAR Interferometry (GBInSAR or TInSAR) is a remote sensing technique for the displacement monitoring of slopes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.groundprobe.com/CMS/Plugins/WhitePaper/files/1351640818-2011_09_09-Slope-Stability-Radars-Compared.pdf | last = Longstaff | first = I.D. | year = 2011 | title = Comparing real beam and synthetic aperture techniques for Slope Stability Radar | journal = Whitepaper, University of Queensland, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; rock scarps, volcanoes, landslides, buildings, infrastructures etc. This technique is based on the same operational principles of the Satellite SAR Interferometry, but the Synthetic Aperture of the Radar (SAR) is obtained by an antenna moving on a rail instead of a satellite moving around an orbit. SAR technique allows 2D radar image of the investigated scenario to be achieved, with a high range resolution (along the instrumental line of sight) and cross-range resolution (along the scan direction). Two antennas respectively emit and receive microwave signals and, by calculating the phase difference between two measurements taken in two different times, it is possible to compute the displacement of all the pixels of the SAR image. The accuracy in the displacement measurement is of the same order of magnitude as the EM wavelength and depends also on the specific local and atmospheric conditions.

In particular the 1999 [[1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake|Izmit]] and 2003 [[Bam, Iran#2003 earthquake|Bam]] earthquakes were extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaEO/SEMLD1W4QWD_index_0.html|title=Envisat's rainbow vision detects ground moving at pace fingernails grow|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=2007-03-22|publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth.esa.int/ers/article_archive/izmit_1999.html|title=The Izmit Earthquake of 17 August 1999 in Turkey|accessdate=2007-03-22|publisher=European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; InSAR can also be used to monitor creep and strain accumulation on [[Fault (geology)|faults]].

=== Volcanic ===
InSAR can be used in a variety of [[volcanic]] settings, including deformation associated with [[eruption]]s, inter-eruption strain caused by changes in [[magma]] distribution at depth, [[gravitational]] spreading of volcanic edifices, and volcano-tectonic deformation signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wadge |first=G. |year=2003 |title=A strategy for the observation of volcanism on Earth from space |periodical=Phil.

Ground [[subsidence]] from a variety of causes has been successfully measured using InSAR, in particular subsidence caused by oil or water extraction from underground reservoirs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tom√°s | first1 = R. | last2 = M√°rquez | first2 = Y. | last3 = Lopez-Sanchez | first3 = J.M. | last4 = Delgado | first4 = J. | last5 = Blanco | first5 = P. | last6 = Mallorqu√≠ | first6 = J.J. | last7 = Mart√≠nez | first7 = M. | last8 = Herrera | first8 = G. | last9 = Mulas | first9 = J. | year = 2005 | title = Mapping ground subsidence induced by aquifer overexploitation using advanced Differential SAR Interferometry: Vega Media of the Segura River (SE Spain) case study | url = | journal = Remote Sensing of Environment | volume = 98 | issue = 2‚Äì3| pages = 269‚Äì283 | doi=10.1016/j.rse.2005.08.003| bibcode = 2005RSEnv..98..269T | hdl = 2117/13208 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subsurface [[mining]] and collapse of old mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrera |first=G. |last2=Tom√°s |first2=R. |last3=Lopez-Sanchez |first3=J.M. |last4=Delgado |first4=J. |last5=Mallorqui |first5=J.J. |last6=Duque |first6=S. |last7=Mulas |first7=J. |year=2007 |title=Advanced DInSAR analysis on mining areas: La Union case study (Murcia, SE Spain) |journal=[[Engineering Geology (journal)|Engineering Geology]] |volume=90 |issue=3‚Äì4 |pages=148‚Äì159 |doi=10.1016/j.enggeo.2007.01.001 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, InSAR has become an indispensable tool to satisfactorily address many subsidence studies.

=== Landslides ===
Although InSAR technique can present some limitations when applied to landslides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colesanti | first1 = C. | last2 = Wasowski | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Investigating landslides with space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry | url = | journal = Engineering Geology | volume = 88 | issue = 3‚Äì4| pages = 173‚Äì199 | doi = 10.1016/j.enggeo.2006.09.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it can also be used for monitoring landscape features such as [[landslides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eomd.esa.int/booklets/booklet183.asp|title=Ground motion|publisher=European Space Agency|accessdate=2007-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080521090818/http://www.eomd.esa.int/booklets/booklet183.asp|archivedate=2008-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrera |first=G. |last2=Tom√°s |first2=R. |last3=Vicente |first3=F. |last4=Lopez-Sanchez |first4=J.M. |last5=Mallorqu√≠ |first5=J.J. |last6=Mulas |first6=J. |date=October 2010 |title=Mapping ground movements in open pit mining areas using differential SAR interferometry |journal=[[International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences]] |volume=47 |issue=7 |pages=1114‚Äì1125 |doi=10.1016/j.ijrmms.2010.07.006 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tom√°s | first1 = R. | last2 = Li | first2 = Z. | last3 = Liu | first3 = P. | last4 = Singleton | first4 = A. | last5 = Hoey | first5 = T. | last6 = Cheng | first6 = X. | year = 2014 | title = Spatiotemporal characteristics of the Huangtupo landslide in the Three Gorges region (China) constrained by radar interferometry | url = | journal = Geophysical Journal International | volume = 197 | issue = | pages = 213‚Äì232 | doi = 10.1093/gji/ggu017 | bibcode = 2014GeoJI.197..213T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ice flow ===
Glacial motion and deformation have been successfully measured using satellite interferometry. The technique allows remote, high-resolution measurement of changes in glacial structure, ice flow, and shifts in ice dynamics, all of which agree closely with ground observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Goldstein |first=R.M. |last2=Engelhardt |first2=H. |last3=Kamb |first3=B. |last4=Frolich |first4=R.

=== Infrastructure and building monitoring ===
InSAR can also be used to monitor the stability of built structures,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tom√°s |first=R. |last2=Garc√≠a-Barba |first2=J. |last3=Cano |first3=M. |last4=Sanabria |first4=M.P. |last5=Ivorra |first5=S. |last6=Duro |first6=J. |last7=Herrera |first7=G. |date=November 2012 |title=Subsidence damage assessment of a gothic church using Differential Interferometry and field data |journal=[[Structural Health Monitoring]] |volume=11 |number=6 |pages=751‚Äì762 |doi=10.1177/1475921712451953 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially Very High Resolution SAR data (such as derived from the TerraSAR-X StripMap mode or COSMO-Skymed HIMAGE mode) are suitable for this task.

=== DEM generation ===

Interferograms can be used to produce [[digital elevation map]]s (DEMs) using the [[stereoscopic]] effect caused by slight differences in observation position between the two images. When using two images produced by the same sensor with a separation in time, it must be assumed other phase contributions (for example from deformation or atmospheric effects) are minimal. In 1995 the two [[European Remote-Sensing Satellite|ERS]] satellites flew in tandem with a one-day separation for this purpose. A second approach is to use two antennas mounted some distance apart on the same platform, and acquire the images at the same time, which ensures no atmospheric or deformation signals are present. This approach was followed by NASA's [[SRTM]] mission aboard the [[space shuttle]] in 2000. InSAR-derived DEMs can be used for later two-pass deformation studies, or for use in other geophysical applications.

'''Japan Remote Control Co., Ltd.''' (Êó•Êú¨ÈÅ†ÈöîÂà∂Âæ°Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ; ''Nippon Enkaku Seigyo Kabushiki Gaisha'')  (commonly called saurce Propo, source Racing, or hum) was a [[Japan]]ese manufacturer of popular [[radio control]] devices including [[transmitter]]s, [[receiver (radio)|receivers]], [[Servomechanism|servo]]s, electronics, programmable robots and [[model aircraft]]. JR has ceased production of RC equipment. http://www.jramericas.com/news_feed.php?#newsid70

==Overview==

Unique to JR Propo's radios is the company's patented '''ABC&amp;W''' technology, or  '''Automatic Blocking Circuit with Window.'''  Simply put, this system rapidly reroutes incoming signals through a series of ever-smaller electronic "windows," effectively blocking out spurious signals which cause radio "glitching".  Any signal that does get through the system is filtered before being sent to the servos all without noticeable lag or delay.  If the signal is unable to be processed, it is rejected, again without noticeable reaction.

Competing brands of radio control systems include, [[Spektrum RC]], [[Sanwa Electronic|Sanwa]], [[Futaba Corporation|Futaba]], [[Hitec]], [[KO Propo]], Acoms and [[Multiplex Modelsport]].

'''KeeLoq''' is a proprietary hardware-dedicated [[block cipher]] that uses a [[NLFSR|non-linear feedback shift register]] (NLFSR).  The uni-directional command transfer protocol was designed by Frederick Bruwer of Nanoteq (Pty) Ltd., the cryptographic algorithm was created by Gideon Kuhn at the University of Pretoria, and the silicon implementation was by Willem Smit at Nanoteq Pty Ltd ([[South Africa]]) in the mid-1980s.  KeeLoq was sold to [[Microchip Technology|Microchip Technology Inc]] in 1995 for $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent | country=US| number=5517187 | status=patent | title=Microchips and remote control devices comprising same |assign1=Microchip Technology Inc | invent1=Bruwer, Frederick J.| invent2=Smit, Willem |invent3= Kuhn, Gideon J. | gdate=1996-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in "[[Hopping code|code hopping]]" encoders and decoders such as NTQ105/106/115/125D/129D, HCS101/2XX/3XX/4XX/5XX and MCS31X2. KeeLoq is or was used in many [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry systems]] by such companies as [[Chrysler]], [[Daewoo]], [[Fiat]], [[General Motors|GM]], [[Honda]], [[Toyota]], [[Volvo]], [[Volkswagen Group]], Clifford, Shurlok, and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]].&lt;ref&gt;Some evidence that [[Chrysler]] indeed uses KeeLoq can be found in [https://archive.org/details/tps_episode_04 (this video)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:–ö–æ–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞.png|thumb|KeeLoq Encryption]]
KeeLoq "code hopping" encoders encrypt a 0-filled 32-bit block with KeeLoq cipher to produce a 32-bit "[[hopping code]]".  A 32-bit [[initialization vector]] is linearly added ([[XOR]]ed) to the 32 [[least significant bit]]s of the [[key (cryptography)|key]] prior to [[encryption]] and after [[decryption]].

KeeLoq cipher accepts 64-bit keys and encrypts 32-bit blocks by executing its single-bit NLFSR for 528 rounds. The NLFSR feedback function is &lt;code&gt;0x3A5C742E&lt;/code&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;F(a,b,c,d,e) = d \oplus e \oplus ac \oplus ae \oplus bc \oplus be \oplus cd \oplus de \oplus ade \oplus ace \oplus abd \oplus abc&lt;/math&gt;
KeeLoq uses bits 1, 9, 20, 26 and 31 of the NLFSR state as its inputs during encryption and bits 0, 8, 19, 25 and 30 during decryption. Its output is linearly combined (XORed) with two of the bits of the NLFSR state (bits 0 and 16 on encryption and bits 31 and 15 on decryption) and with a key bit (bit 0 of the key state on encryption and bit 15 of the key state on decryption) and is fed back into the NLFSR state on every round.

== Attacks ==

===Replay attack===
For simplicity, individual "code hopping" implementations do not use [[cryptographic nonce]]s, and [[clock drift]] excludes the possibility of using [[timestamping]]. This makes the protocol inherently vulnerable to [[replay attack]]s: For example, by jamming the channel while intercepting the code, a thief can obtain a code that may still be usable at a later stage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.scs.carleton.ca/~barbeau/Honours/Spencer_Whyte.pdf Analysis of RF Remote Security Using Software Defined Radio]&lt;/ref&gt; This sort of "code grabber,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microchip.com/stellent/idcplg?IdcService=SS_GET_PAGE&amp;nodeId=2075&amp;param=en001022#P108_5361 stating, "It is a simple matter to build a circuit to record such transmissions for reply at the later time. Such a system is known as a code or key grabber."&lt;/ref&gt; while theoretically interesting, does not appear to be widely used by car thieves.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snopes.com/autos/techno/lockcode.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed description of an inexpensive prototype device designed and built by [[Samy Kamkar]] to exploit this technique appeared in 2015.  The device about the size of a wallet could be concealed on or near a locked vehicle to capture a single keyless entry code to be used at a later time to unlock the vehicle.  The device transmits a jamming signal to block the vehicle's reception of rolling code signals from the owner's fob, while recording these signals from both of his two attempts needed to unlock the vehicle.  The recorded first code is forwarded to the vehicle only when the owner makes the second attempt, while the recorded second code is retained for future use.&lt;ref name="RollinCode"&gt;{{cite news | title=A hacker made a $30 gadget that can unlock many cars that have keyless entry | url=http://www.techinsider.io/samy-kamkar-keyless-entry-car-hack-2015-8 | work=[[Tech Insider]] | first=Cadie | last=Thompson | date=2015-08-06 | accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A demonstration was announced for [[DEF CON]] 23.&lt;ref name="DC23"&gt;{{cite web | title=Drive It Like You Hacked It: New Attacks and Tools to Wirelessly Steal Cars | url=https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-23/dc-23-speakers.html#Kamkar | work=[[DEF CON]] 23 | first=Samy | last=Kamkar | date=2015-08-07 | accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryptanalysis===
[[File:–î–µ–∫–æ–¥–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∫–∞.png|thumb|KeeLoq Decryption]]
KeeLoq was first [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyzed]] by Andrey Bogdanov using sliding techniques and efficient [[linear approximation]]s. [[Nicolas Courtois]] attacked KeeLoq using sliding and algebraic methods. The attacks by Bogdanov and Courtois do not pose any threat to the actual implementations that seem to be much more vulnerable to simple [[brute force attack|brute-force]] of the [[key space (cryptography)|key space]] that is reduced in all the code-hopping implementations of the [[cipher]] known to date. Some KeeLoq "code grabbers" use [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]]-based devices to break KeeLoq-based keys by brute force within about two weeks due to the reduced key length in the real world implementations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 2007, researchers in the [[COSIC]] group at the university at [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]], (K.U.Leuven) in cooperation with colleagues from [[Israel]] found a new attack against the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/keeloq/ How To Steal Cars ‚Äî A Practical Attack on KeeLoq&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Using the details of the algorithm that were leaked in 2006, the researchers started to analyze the weaknesses.  After determining the part of the key common to cars of a specific model, the unique bits of the key can be cracked with only sniffed communication between the key and the car.

If a 60-bit seed is being used, an attacker would require approximately 100 days of processing on a dedicated parallel [[brute force attack]]ing machine before the system is broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/SHARCS/record2.pdf|title=Cryptanalysis of KeeLoq with COPACOBANA|publisher=SHARCS 2009 Conference|author1=Martin Novotny |author2=Timo Kasper |pages=159‚Äì164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Side-channel attacks===
In March 2008, researchers from the Chair for Embedded Security of [[Ruhr University Bochum]], Germany, presented a [[Cryptanalysis#Partial breaks|complete break]] of remote keyless entry systems based on the KeeLoq RFID technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emsec.rub.de/keeloq A complete break of the KeeLoq access control system]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bochum"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/058.pdf|title=Physical Cryptanalysis of KeeLoq Code Hopping Applications|date=2008-02-29|accessdate=2009-03-22|publisher=Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany|author1=Thomas Eisenbarth |author2=Timo Kasper |author3=Amir Moradi |author4=Christof Paar |author5=Mahmoud Salmasizadeh |author6=Mohammad T. Manzuri Shalmani }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their attack works on all known car and building access control systems that rely on the KeeLoq cipher.

The attack by the Bochum team allows recovering the secret cryptographic [[key (cryptography)|key]]s embedded in both the receiver and the remote control. It is based on measuring the electric power consumption of a device during an encryption. Applying what is called [[Side channel attack|side-channel analysis]] methods to the power traces, the researchers can extract the manufacturer key from the receivers, which can be regarded as a master key for generating valid keys for the remote controls of one particular manufacturer. Unlike the cryptanalytic attack described above which requires about 65536 chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and days of calculation on a PC to recover the key, the side-channel attack can also be applied to the so-called KeeLoq Code Hopping mode of operation (a.k.a. [[rolling code]]) that is widely used for keyless entry systems (cars, garages, buildings, etc.).

The most devastating practical consequence of the side-channel analysis is an attack in which an attacker, having previously learned the system's master key, can clone any legitimate encoder by intercepting only two messages from this encoder from a distance of up to {{Convert|100|m|ft}}.  Another attack allows one to reset the internal counter of the receiver (garage door, car door, etc.), which makes it impossible for a legitimate user to open the door.&lt;ref name="Kasper"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| url=http://www-brs.ub.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/netahtml/HSS/Diss/KasperTimo/diss.pdf| title=Security Analysis of Pervasive Wireless Devices‚ÄîPhysical and Protocol Attacks in Practice| date=November 2012| accessdate=2015-08-11|publisher=[[Ruhr University Bochum]], Germany| first=Timo| last=Kasper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1828">The '''Mark 21 nuclear bomb''' was a [[United States]] nuclear [[gravity bomb]] first produced in 1955. It was based on the TX-21 "Shrimp" prototype that had been detonated during the [[Castle Bravo]] test in March 1954. While most of the [[Operation Castle]] tests were intended to evaluate weapons intended for immediate stockpile, or which were already available for use as part of the Emergency Capability Program, Castle Bravo was intended to test a design which would drastically reduce the size and costs of the first generation of air-droppable atomic weapons (the [[Mark 14 nuclear bomb|Mk 14]], [[Mark 17 nuclear bomb|Mk 17]] &amp; [[Mark 24 nuclear bomb|Mk 24]]). At {{convert|12|ft|6|in}} long, {{convert|56|in|m|2}} in diameter, and weighing {{convert|15000|lb|kg|-2}}, the Mk-21 was half the length and one-third the weight of the Mk-17/24 weapons it replaced.  Its minimum yield was specified at four [[megatons]].

Quantity production of the Mk-21 started in December 1955 and ran until July 1956. Three marks were produced; the Mk-21C was proof tested as the [[Operation Redwing]] Navajo shot, with a yield of 4.5 megatons. Starting in June 1957 all Mk-21 bombs were converted to the more powerful [[Mark 36 nuclear bomb|Mk-36]], which was removed from service in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html Nuclear Weapon Archive: List of All U.S. Nuclear Weapons]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1678">In [[telecommunication]], a '''master station''' is a station that controls or coordinates the activities of other stations in the system.

Examples:
*In a [[data network]], the control station may designate a master station to ensure [[data transfer]] to one or more slave stations.&lt;ref name=FS1037C&gt;[[Federal Standard 1037C]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such a master station controls one or more [[data link]]s of the data [[communications network]] at any given instant. The assignment of master status to a given station is temporary and is controlled by the control station according to the procedures set forth in the operational [[Communications protocol|protocol]]. Master status is normally conferred upon a station so that it may transmit a [[message]], but a station need not have a [[message]] to send to be designated the master station.
* In navigation systems using precise [[time dissemination]], the master station is a station that has the [[clock]] that is used to synchronize the clocks of subordinate stations.&lt;ref name=FS1037C/&gt;
* In [[basic mode link control]], the master station is a data station that has accepted an invitation to ensure a [[data transfer]] to one or more slave stations.&lt;ref name=FS1037C/&gt;  At a given instant, there can be only one master station on a data link.

==Operation modes==
In data transmission, a master station can be set to not wait for a reply from a slave station after transmitting each message or [[transmission block]]. In this case the station is said to be in "continuous operation".&lt;ref&gt;Federal Standard 1037C, entry for "Continuous operation".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15916">'''Methanogenesis''' or '''biomethanation''' is the formation of [[methane]] by [[microbe]]s known as [[methanogen]]s. Organisms capable of producing methane have been identified only from the [[Domain (biology)|domain]] [[Archaea]], a group [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] distinct from both [[eukaryote]]s and [[bacteria]], although many live in close association with anaerobic bacteria. The production of methane is an important and widespread form of microbial [[metabolism]].

==Biochemistry==
[[File:Methanogenesis cycle.png|thumb|320px|Cycle for methanogenesis, showing intermediates.]]

Methanogenesis in microbes is a form of [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name=RT&gt;{{cite journal|author=Thauer, R. K.|title=Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson|journal=Microbiology|year=1998|volume=144|pages=2377‚Äì2406|doi=10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methanogens do not use oxygen to respire; in fact, oxygen inhibits the growth of methanogens.  The terminal [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptor]] in methanogenesis is not oxygen, but carbon.  The carbon can occur in a small number of organic compounds, all with low molecular weights.  The two best described pathways involve the use of [[acetic acid]] or inorganic [[carbon dioxide]] as terminal electron acceptors:
:{{CO2|link=yes}} + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ‚Üí [[Methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH ‚Üí CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

During anaerobic respiration of carbohydrates, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acetate are formed in a ratio of 2:1 or lower, so H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes only ca. 33% to methanogenesis, with acetate contributing the greater proportion. In some circumstances, for instance in the [[rumen]], where acetate is largely absorbed into the bloodstream of the host, the contribution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanogenesis is greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Rolf|date=1999|title=Contribution of hydrogen to methane production and control of hydrogen concentrations in methanogenic soils and sediments|url=http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/3/193.abstract|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=28|pages=193‚Äì202|doi=10.1016/s0168-6496(98)00086-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, depending on pH and temperature, methanogenesis has been shown to use carbon from other small organic compounds, such as [[formic acid]] (formate), [[methanol]], [[methylamines]], [[tetramethylammonium]], [[dimethyl sulfide]], and [[methanethiol]].  The catabolism of the methyl compounds is mediated by methyl transferases to give methyl coenzyme M.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt;

===Proposed mechanism===
The biochemistry of methanogenesis involves the following coenzymes and cofactors: [[Coenzyme F420|F420]], [[coenzyme B]], [[coenzyme M]], [[methanofuran]], and [[methanopterin]].

The mechanism for the conversion of {{chem|CH|3|‚ÄìS}} bond into methane involves a ternary complex of methyl coenzyme M and coenzyme B fit into a channel terminated by the axial site on nickel of the cofactor F430.  One proposed mechanism invokes electron transfer from Ni(I) (to give Ni(II)), which initiates formation of {{chem|CH|4}}.  Coupling of the coenzyme M [[thiyl radical]] (RS&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;) with HS coenzyme B releases a proton and re-reduces Ni(II) by one-electron, regenerating Ni(I).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Finazzo C, Harmer J, Bauer C, etal |title=Coenzyme B induced coordination of coenzyme M via its thiol group to Ni(I) of F&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; in active methyl-coenzyme M reductase |journal=J.

===Reverse methanogenesis===
Some organisms can oxidize methane, functionally reversing the process of methanogenesis, also referred to as the [[anaerobic oxidation of methane]] (AOM). Organisms performing AOM have been found in multiple marine and freshwater environments including methane seeps, hydrothermal vents, coastal sediments and sulfate-methane transition zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruff|first=S.

===Importance in carbon cycle===
Methanogenesis is the final step in the decay of organic matter.  During the decay process, [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptors]] (such as [[oxygen]], [[ferric]] [[iron]], [[sulfate]], and [[nitrate]]) become depleted, while [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon dioxide]] accumulate.  Light organics produced by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also accumulate.  During advanced stages of organic decay, all electron acceptors become depleted except carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is a product of most catabolic processes, so it is not depleted like other potential electron acceptors.

Only methanogenesis and fermentation can occur in the absence of electron acceptors other than carbon.  Fermentation only allows the breakdown of larger organic compounds, and produces small organic compounds.  Methanogenesis effectively removes the semi-final products of decay: hydrogen, small organics, and carbon dioxide.  Without methanogenesis, a great deal of carbon (in the form of fermentation products) would accumulate in anaerobic environments.

==Natural occurrence==

===In ruminants===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1898 Testing Sheep for Methane Production.jpg|thumb|Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), [[CSIRO]]]]
[[Enteric fermentation]] occurs in the gut of some animals, especially ruminants. In the [[rumen]], anaerobic organisms, including methanogens, digest cellulose into forms nutritious to the animal.  Without these microorganisms, animals such as cattle would not be able to consume grasses. The useful products of methanogenesis are absorbed by the gut, but methane is released from the animal mainly by belching (eructation). The average cow emits around 250 liters of methane per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/innovations/stories/s1159618.htm ''Radio Australia'': "Innovations ‚Äì Methane In Agriculture."] 15 August  2004. Retrieved 28 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, ruminants contribute about 25% of anthropogenic [[methane emissions]]. One method of methane production control in ruminants is by feeding them [[3-Nitrooxypropanol|3-nitrooxypropanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Hristov, A. N., et al., "An inhibitor persistently decreased enteric methane emission from dairy cows with no negative effect on milk production", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015, volume 112, 10663-10668. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.1504124112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Some humans produce [[flatulence|flatus]] that contains methane.  In one study of the [[feces]] of nine adults, five of the samples contained [[archaea]] capable of producing methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Miller TL|author2=Wolin MJ |author3=de Macario EC |author4=Macario AJ | title=Isolation of Methanobrevibacter smithii from human feces| journal=Appl Environ Microbiol| year=1982| volume=43| pages=227‚Äì32 |pmid=6798932 |pmc=241804 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6798932| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar results are found in samples of gas obtained from within the [[rectum]].

Even among humans whose flatus does contain methane, the amount is in the range of 10% or less of the total amount of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In plants===
Many experiments have suggested that [[leaf]] tissues of living plants emit methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kepler F, etal | title = ''Methane emissions from terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions'' | journal = Nature | year = 2006 | volume = 439 | issue = 7073 | pmid = 16407949| pages = 187&amp;ndash;191 | doi=  10.1038/nature04420 | bibcode=2006Natur.439..187K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has indicated that the plants are not actually generating methane; they are just absorbing methane from the soil and then emitting it through their leaf tissues.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/114/1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
Methanogens are observed in anoxic soil environments, contributing to the degradation of organic matter.  This organic matter may be placed by humans through landfill, buried as sediment on the bottom of lakes or oceans as sediments, and as residual organic matter from sediments that have formed into sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Le Mer, J.|author2=Roger, P.|title=Production, oxidation, Emission and Consumption of Methane by Soils: A Review|journal=European Journal of Soil Biology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=25‚Äì50|doi=10.1016/S1164-5563(01)01067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in global warming==
[[Atmospheric methane]] is an important [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[global warming potential]] 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (averaged over 100 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-2-5.html |contribution=Global Warming Potentials |title=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007  |year=2007 |accessdate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and methanogenesis in [[livestock]] and the decay of organic material is thus a considerable contributor to global warming. It may not be a net contributor in the sense that it works on organic material which used up atmospheric carbon dioxide when it was created, but its overall effect is to convert the carbon dioxide into methane which is a much more potent greenhouse gas.

Methanogenesis can also be beneficially exploited, to treat [[organic waste]], to produce useful compounds, and the methane can be collected and used as [[biogas]], a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-07/news/60902488_1_wet-waste-waste-management-household-waste|title=After Freedom Park, waste to light up Gandhinagar in Bengaluru

==Extra-terrestrial life==
{{See also|Methane#Extraterrestrial methane}}
The presence of atmospheric methane has a role in the scientific search for [[extra-terrestrial life]]. The justification is that methane in the atmosphere will eventually dissipate, unless something is replenishing it. If methane is detected (by using a [[spectrometer]] for example) this may indicate that life is, or recently was, present.
This was debated&lt;ref&gt;BBC article about methane as sign of life http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4295475.stm&lt;/ref&gt; when methane was discovered in the Martian atmosphere by M.J. Mumma of NASA's Goddard Flight Center, and verified by the [[Mars Express Orbiter]] (2004)&lt;ref&gt;European Space Agency, Methane in Martian Atmosphere http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMZ0B57ESD_0.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s atmosphere by the [[Huygens probe]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Space.Com article about methane on Huygens http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_huygens_update_050127.html&lt;/ref&gt; This debate was furthered with the discovery of 'transient', 'spikes of methane' on Mars by the [[Curiosity Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11297326/Life-on-Mars-Nasa-finds-first-hint-of-alien-life.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that [[atmospheric methane]] can come from volcanoes or other fissures in the planet's crust and that without an [[isotopic signature]], the origin or source may be difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist article about atmospheric methane https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7059&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Article about methane as sign of life http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1007_041007_mars_methane.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2017, NASA confirmed that the dive of the [[Cassini‚ÄìHuygens|Cassini orbiter]] spacecraft on 28 October 2015 discovered the [[Enceladus]] plume which has all the ingredients for methanogenesis-based life forms to feed from. Previous results, published in March 2015, suggested hot water is interacting with rock beneath the sea; the new findings support that conclusion and add that the rock appears to be reacting chemically. From these observations scientists have determined that nearly 98 percent of the gas in the plume is water, about 1 percent is hydrogen and the rest is a mixture of other molecules including carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system|title=NASA Missions Provide New Insights into 'Ocean Worlds'|last=Northon|first=Karen|date=2017-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moon Ribas''' (born 24 May 1985)&lt;ref&gt;Registre ''El Maresme'' N√∫mero 503, Verano 1985&lt;/ref&gt; is a Spanish [[avant-garde art]]ist and [[cyborg]] activist best known for developing and implanting an online seismic sensor in her elbow that allows her to feel earthquakes through vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Gabriella [http://www.hopesandfears.com/hopes/future/technology/216729-the-woman-who-can-feel-every-earthquake-in-the-world.html "The woman who can feel every earthquake in the world"], "[[Hopes&amp;Fears]]", 17 de octubre 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Her choreography works are based on the exploration of new movements developed by the addition of new senses or sensory extensions to the dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Ploeger, Lieke. [http://researchkb.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/republica-2013-insideout/ "Re:publica 2013: In/sideout"], Research in the National Library of the Netherlands, 22 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, international media have described her as the world's first cyborg woman or the world's first female [[Cyborg art|cyborg artist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nadja Sayej [https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8q8e4a/the-worlds-first-cyborg-artist-can-detect-earthquakes-with-her-arm "World's first cyborg artist can detect earthquakes"], [[Vice]], 2016&lt;/ref&gt; She is the co-founder of the [[Cyborg Foundation]], an international organisation that encourages humans to become cyborgs and promotes cyborgism as an art movement&lt;ref&gt;Garc√≠a, F.C.

== Career and works==
Moon Ribas grew up in [[Matar√≥]] (Spain) and moved to England at the age of 18 where she studied experimental dance and graduated in choreography at [[Dartington College of Arts]] (England) and Movement Research at SNDO [[Theaterschool]] (Amsterdam).&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/www.anticteatre.com/docs/revistaantic02 "Neil Harbisson, Moon Ribas"] ''Revista Antic Teatre'' p.52-53, Diciembre 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During her studies she began to explore the possibilities of sensory extensions by applying technology to her body.&lt;ref&gt;Angelis, Emma. [http://www.thefashionglobe.com/neil-harbisson "From Human to Cyborg"], FGMagizine, 27 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seismic Sense===
In 2013, Moon developed a sensor that vibrates whenever there's an earthquake in the planet.&lt;ref&gt;Bandzimiera, Krystian. [http://mb.mercedes-benz.com/en_MT/3313/because-cyborgs-can-dream-too-2/ "Because Cyborgs Can Dream Too"], Mercedes-Benz mb!, 29 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The sensor, which is permanently attached to her elbow, vibrates in different levels depending on the intensity of each earthquakes and is wirelessly connected to online seismographs, which means she can feel earthquakes from all over the world regardless of where she is.&lt;ref&gt;Delatte, Marta. [http://www.playgroundmag.net/musica/articulos-de-musica/entrevistas-musicales/sentirse-tecnologia-la-cibernetica-y-el-futuro-de-la-sensualidad "Sentirse tecnolog√≠a: la cibern√©tica y el futuro de la sensualidad"], Playground, 20 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Moon has been wearing the sensor permanently since March 2013 and has used her seismic sense to create dance pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/moon-ribas-cyborg-smart-creativity/index.html|title=The cyborg dancer who can detect earthquakes|date=2018-10-23|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Waiting for Earthquakes'' is a solo dance performance where the dancer stands still until an earthquake is felt. The choreography depends on the earthquakes felt during the duration of the performance and the intensity of the dancer's movements depend on the magnitude of each earthquake (which can be felt from 1.0 in the [[Richter Scale]]). If there are no earthquakes during the time of performance the dancer will not dance.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Sally. [http://nautil.us/issue/1/what-makes-you-so-special/encounters-with-the-posthuman "Encounters with the Posthuman"], Nautilus, 29 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was premiered on 28 March 2013 at Nau Ivanow, Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eventot.com/waiting-for-earthquakes/1562134 "Waiting for Earthquakes"], Eventot, 28 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kaleidoscopic Vision===
Moon's first sensory experiment was in 2007 when she created and wore a pair of kaleidoscopic glasses for three months.&lt;ref&gt;Bojka [http://www.lupiga.com/vijesti/index.php?id=4932 "Katalonci "ƒçudnim zvukovima" odredili boju Zagreba"] ''Lupiga'', 29 de noviembre de 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The glasses only allowed her to see colour, no shape. The lack of shape perception increased not only her sense of colour discrimination but also her detection of movement. Any slight change of colour in her field of vision indicated that something had moved.&lt;ref&gt;Solon, Olivia. [https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/30/cyborg-foundation "The Cyborg Foundation: we urge you to become part-machine"], [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], 30 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; During the three-month period, Moon visited several cities in Europe and met people without ever seeing their faces.&lt;ref&gt;Markoviƒá, Stjepan. [http://www.24sata.hr/news/prvi-sluzbeni-covjek-kiborg-cuje-trideset-i-sest-boja/41616/ "Prvi sluzbeni covjek kiborg cuje trideset i sest boja"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206204952/http://www.24sata.hr/news/prvi-sluzbeni-covjek-kiborg-cuje-trideset-i-sest-boja/41616/ |date=6 February 2010 }} ''[[24sata (Croatia)]]'' pp.12-13, 17 de diciembre de 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speedborg===

In 2008, Moon created a speedometer glove that allowed her to perceive the exact speed of any movement around her through vibrations on her hand. She wore the glove for several months and was able to sense different speeds depending on the vibration intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Bj√∂rg, Johanna [http://www.goodlifer.com/2013/01/human-cyborg-project-wins-grand-prize-in-filmmaker-competition/ "Human Cyborg Project Wins Grand Prize in Filmmaker Competition"], Goodlifer, 28 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; She later transformed the glove into a pair of earrings that vibrated whenever there was presence around her.&lt;ref&gt;M√ºgge, Marvin. [http://www.weltenschummler.com/tech-science/rp13-how-to-become-a-cyborg/ "How to become a cyborg"], Weltenschummler, 8 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Moon travelled around Europe with her speedborg earrings to find out what the average walking speed of citizens was in different cities. ''The Speeds of Europe'' is a video dance that shows the results of her research; Londoners and Stockholm citizens for example walk at a similar average speed of approximately 6.1 km/h whereas people in Rome and Oslo walk at an average speed of 4 km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campus-party.eu/2012/special-Activities.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141122035148/http%3A//www.campus%2Dparty.eu/2012/special%2DActivities.html |archivedate=22 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, Moon was able to detect not only the exact speed of any person walking in front of her but also her own speed.&lt;ref&gt;Pau, Merce. [http://www.lavanguardia.com/estilos-de-vida/20140228/54401807489/medio-humano-medio-maquina.html "Medio humano, medio maquina"], [[La Vanguardia]], 28 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing her own speed allowed her to create ''Green Lights'' a piece choreographed in relation to a set of 8 traffic lights: by learning the traffic light timings of Barcelona's [[Rambla de Catalunya]] avenue and by measuring the distance between each traffic light, she calculated the speed she had to walk to avoid red traffic lights and was able to get from one end to the other end of the avenue without stops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtve.es/television/20120611/documentos-tv-ciborgs-muy-humanos/534009.shtml "Documentos TV"], [[Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola]], 11 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===360¬∞ Perception===
In 2010, Moon explored the possibilities of sensing movement behind her by turning the speedborg earrings around. The earrings allowed her to perceive if presence was behind her.&lt;ref&gt;Oremus, Will. [http://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/digital-living/8429729/Choose-Your-Own-Sixth-Sense "Choose your own sixth sense"], Stuff.co.nz, 15 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The earrings were developed further by students from [[La Salle (Barcelona)|La Salle]] (Barcelona) by adding 4 extra sensors in order to gain 360¬∞ perception of movement through vibrations around the head.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p014nk5w "What if... we could all become cyborgs?", [[BBC World Service]], 25 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyborg Foundation==
In 2010, Moon Ribas and [[Neil Harbisson]] created the [[Cyborg Foundation]] (and an offshoot of it called the Cyborg Arts organization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/moon-ribas-cyborg-smart-creativity/index.html|title=The cyborg dancer who can detect earthquakes|date=2018-10-23|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;), an international organisation that encourages humans to become cyborgs.&lt;ref&gt;Redacci√≥n [http://elcomercio.pe/tecnologia/721054/noticia-fundacion-se-dedica-convertir-humanos-ciborgs "Una fundaci√≥n se dedica a convertir humanos en ciborgs"] ''[[El Comercio (Peru)]]'', 1 de marzo de 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of the organisation are: to extend human senses and abilities by creating and applying cybernetic extension to the body, to promote cyborgism as an art movement, and to defend cyborg rights.&lt;ref&gt;Merchant, Brian.

A '''Nixie tube''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|Àà|n|…™|k|.|s|iÀê|}} {{respell|NIK|see}}), or '''cold cathode display''',&lt;ref name=Vintagecalculators&gt;[http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/calculator_displays.html#ColdCathode Calculator Displays&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822171631/http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/calculator_displays.html |date=2013-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[electronics|electronic]] device for [[display device|displaying numerals or other information]] using [[glow discharge]].

[[File:Inside the nixie tube vnutri u nei neonka.jpg|thumb|Inside a Nixie tube]]
The glass tube contains a wire-mesh [[anode]] and multiple [[cathode]]s, shaped like [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system|numerals]] or other symbols. Applying power to one cathode surrounds it with an orange [[glow discharge]]. The tube is filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly [[neon]] and often a little [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[argon]], in a [[Penning mixture]].&lt;ref name="Weston 1968 334"&gt;{{Harv|Weston|1968|p=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Bylander|1979|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it resembles a [[vacuum tube]] in appearance, its operation does not depend on [[thermionic emission]] of [[electron]]s from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a [[cold cathode|cold-cathode]] tube (a form of [[gas-filled tube]]), and is a variant of the [[neon lamp]]. Such tubes rarely exceed 40&amp;nbsp;¬∞C (104&amp;nbsp;¬∞F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature.&lt;ref name="Bylander 1979 60"&gt;{{Harv|Bylander|1979|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vacuum fluorescent display]]s from the same era use completely different technology‚Äîthey have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, not to be confused with a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.

==History==
[[Image:NixieFrequencyCounter.jpg|thumb|right|Systron-Donner frequency counter from 1973 with Nixie-tube display]]
The early Nixie displays were made by a small vacuum tube manufacturer called Haydu Brothers Laboratories, and introduced in 1955&lt;ref&gt;'Solid State Devices--Instruments' article by S. Runyon in ''Electronic Design'' magazine vol. 24, 23 November 1972, p. 102, via Electronic Inventions and Discoveries: Electronics from its Earliest Beginnings to the Present Day, 4th Ed., Geoffrey William Arnold Dummer, 1997, {{ISBN|0-7503-0376-X}}, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Burroughs Corporation]], who purchased Haydu. The name ''Nixie'' was derived by Burroughs from "NIX I", an abbreviation of "Numeric Indicator eXperimental No. 1",&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;''[[Scientific American]]'', June 1973, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; although this may have been a [[backronym]] designed to justify the evocation of [[Neck (water spirit)|the mythical creature with this name]]. Hundreds of variations of this design were manufactured by many firms, from the 1950s until the 1990s. The Burroughs Corporation introduced "Nixie" and owned the name ''Nixie'' as a [[trademark]]. Nixie-like displays made by other firms had trademarked names including ''Digitron'', ''Inditron'' and ''Numicator''. A proper generic term is ''cold cathode neon readout tube'', though the phrase ''Nixie tube'' quickly entered the vernacular as a generic name.

Burroughs even had another Haydu tube that could operate as a [[Counter (digital)|digital counter]] and directly drive a Nixie tube for display. This was called a "Trochotron", in later form known as the "Beam-X Switch" counter tube; another name was "magnetron beam-switching tube", referring to their derivation from a [[magnetron|split-anode magnetron]]. Trochotrons were used in the [[UNIVAC 1101]] computer, as well as in clocks and frequency counters.

The first trochotrons were surrounded by a hollow cylindrical magnet, with poles at the ends. The field inside the magnet had essentially-parallel lines of force, parallel to the axis of the tube. It was a thermionic vacuum tube; inside were a central cathode, ten anodes, and ten "spade" electrodes. The magnetic field and voltages applied to the electrodes made the electrons form a thick sheet (as in a cavity magnetron) that went to only one anode. Applying a pulse with specified width and voltages to the spades made the sheet advance to the next anode, where it stayed until the next advance pulse. Count direction was determined by the direction of the magnetic field, and as such was not reversible. A later form of trochotron called a Beam-X Switch replaced the large, heavy external cylindrical magnet with ten small internal metal-alloy rod magnets which also served as electrodes.

[[Image:In 19a.jpg|thumb|right|150px|This –ò–ù-19–ê Nixie tube displays symbols, including % and ¬∞C]]
Glow-transfer counting tubes, similar in essential function to the trochotrons, had a glow discharge on one of a number of main cathodes, visible through the top of the glass envelope. Most used a neon-based gas mixture and counted in base-10, but faster types were based on argon, hydrogen, or other gases, and for timekeeping and similar applications a few base-12 types were available. Sets of "guide" cathodes (usually two sets, but some types had one or three) between the indicating cathodes moved the glow in steps to the next main cathode. Types with two or three sets of guide cathodes could count in either direction. A well-known trade name for glow-transfer counter tubes in the [[United Kingdom]] was [[Dekatron]]. Types with connections to each individual indicating cathode, which enabled presetting the tube's state to any value (in contrast to simpler types which could only be directly reset to zero or a small subset of their total number of states), were trade named ''Selectron'' tubes.

Devices that functioned in the same way as Nixie tubes were patented in the 1930s, and the first mass-produced display tubes were introduced in 1954 by National Union Co. under the brand name Inditron. However, their construction was cruder, their average lifetime was shorter, and they failed to find many applications due to their complex periphery.

== Design ==
The most common form of Nixie tube has ten cathodes in the shapes of the numerals 0 to 9 (and occasionally a decimal point or two), but there are also types that show various letters, signs and symbols. Because the numbers and other characters are arranged one behind another, each character appears at a different depth, giving Nixie based displays a distinct appearance. A related device is the '''pixie tube''', which uses a [[stencil]] mask with numeral-shaped holes instead of shaped cathodes. Some Russian Nixies, e.g. the IN-14, used an upside-down digit 2 as the digit 5, presumably to save manufacturing costs as there is no obvious technical or aesthetic reason.

Each cathode can be made to glow in the characteristic neon red-orange color by applying about 170 [[volt]]s [[direct current|DC]] at a few [[ampere|milliamperes]] between a cathode and the anode. The current limiting is normally implemented as an anode [[resistor]] of a few tens of thousands of [[ohm]]s. Nixies exhibit [[negative resistance]] and will maintain their glow at typically 20 V to 30 V below the strike voltage. Some color variation can be observed between types, caused by differences in the gas mixtures used. Longer-life tubes that were manufactured later in the Nixie timeline have mercury added to reduce [[sputtering]]&lt;ref name="Bylander 1979 60"/&gt; resulting in a blue or purple tinge to the emitted light. In some cases, these colors are filtered out by a red or orange filter coating on the glass.

One advantage of the Nixie tube is that its cathodes are typographically designed, shaped for legibility. In most types, they are not placed in numerical sequence from back to front, but arranged so that cathodes in front obscure the lit cathode minimally. One such arrangement is 6 7 5 8 4 3 9 2 0 1 from front (6) to back (1).&lt;ref name="nixieclock home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KD7LMO Overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ad7zj.net/kd7lmo/ground_nixie_clock.html |title=KD7LMO - Nixie Tube Clock - Overview |website=ad7zj.net |date=2014-01-17 |access-date=2017-09-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714192451/http://ad7zj.net/kd7lmo/ground_nixie_clock.html |archivedate=2017-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russian NH-12A &amp; NH-12B tubes use the number arrangement 1 6 2 7 5 0 4 9 8 3 from back to front, with the 5 being an upside down 2.  The 12B tubes feature a bottom far left decimal point between the numbers 8 and 3.

==Applications and lifetime==
[[Image:ZM1210-operating edit2.jpg|thumb|upright|The stacked digit arrangement in a Nixie tube is visible in this (stripped) ZM1210]]
[[Image:NL5441NixieTubes.JPG|thumb|right|Pair of NL-5441 Nixie display tubes]]
Nixies were used as numeric displays in early digital [[voltmeter]]s, [[multimeter]]s, [[frequency counter]]s and many other types of technical equipment. They also appeared in costly digital time displays used in research and military establishments, and in many early electronic desktop [[calculator]]s, including the first: the Sumlock-Comptometer ''[[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA Mk VII]]'' of 1961 and even the first [[TSPS|electronic telephone switchboards]]. Later [[alphanumeric]] versions in [[fourteen segment display]] format found use in airport arrival/departure signs and [[Financial quote|stock ticker]] displays. Some [[elevator]]s used Nixies to display floor numbers.

Average longevity of Nixie tubes varied from about 5,000 hours for the earliest types, to as high as 200,000 hours or more for some of the last types to be introduced. There is no formal definition as to what constitutes "end of life" for Nixies, mechanical failure excepted. Some sources&lt;ref name="Weston 1968 334"/&gt; suggest that incomplete glow coverage of a glyph ("[[Hot cathode#Failure modes|cathode poisoning]]") or appearance of glow elsewhere in the tube would not be acceptable.

Nixie tubes are susceptible to multiple failure modes, including
* simple breakage,
* cracks and [[hermetic seal]] leaks allowing the atmosphere to enter,
* [[Hot cathode#Failure modes|cathode poisoning]] preventing part or all of one or more characters from illuminating,
* increased striking voltage causing flicker or failure to light,
* [[sputtering]] of electrode metal onto the glass envelope blocking the cathodes from view,
* internal open or short circuits which may be due to physical abuse or sputtering.

Driving Nixies outside of their specified electrical parameters will accelerate their demise, especially excess current, which increases sputtering of the electrodes. A few extreme examples of sputtering have even resulted in complete disintegration of Nixie-tube cathodes.

Cathode poisoning can be abated by limiting current through the tubes to significantly below their maximum rating,&lt;ref name="KD7LMO Hardware"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ad7zj.net/kd7lmo/ground_nixie_clock_hardware.html |title=KD7LMO - Nixie Tube Clock - Hardware |website=ad7zj.net |date=2014-01-17 |access-date=2017-09-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621191026/http://ad7zj.net/kd7lmo/ground_nixie_clock_hardware.html |archivedate=2017-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of Nixie tubes constructed from materials that avoid the effect (e.g. by being free of silicates and aluminum), or by programming devices to periodically cycle through all digits so that seldom-displayed ones get activated.&lt;ref name="nixieclock manual"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chronotronix V300 Nixie Tube Clock User Manual |page=6 |website=nixieclock.net |url=http://www.nixieclock.net/manuals/Manual_V400_English.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105191449/http://www.nixieclock.net/manuals/Manual_V400_English.pdf |archive-date=2012-01-05 |access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As testament to their longevity, and that of the equipment which incorporated them, {{as of|2006|lc=y}} several suppliers still provide common Nixie tube types as replacement parts, new in original packaging.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Equipment with Nixie-tube displays in excellent working condition is still plentiful, though much of it has been in frequent use for 30‚Äì40 years or more. Such items can easily be found as surplus and obtained at very little expense. In the former Soviet Union, Nixies were still being manufactured in volume in the 1980s, so Russian and Eastern European Nixies are still available.

== Alternatives and successors ==
Other numeric-display technologies concurrently in use included backlit columnar transparencies ("thermometer displays"), light pipes, rear-projection and edge-lit [[lightguide display]]s (all using individual [[incandescent light bulb|incandescent]] or [[neon lamp|neon]] light bulbs for illumination), [[Numitron]] incandescent filament readouts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decodesystems.com/numitron.html Numitron Readout] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019102215/http://www.decodesystems.com/numitron.html |date=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Panaplex seven-segment displays, and [[vacuum fluorescent display]] tubes. Before Nixie tubes became prominent, most numeric displays were electromechanical, using stepping mechanisms to display digits either directly by use of cylinders bearing printed numerals attached to their rotors, or indirectly by wiring the outputs of [[stepping switch]]es to indicator bulbs. Later, a few vintage clocks even used a form of stepping switch to drive Nixie tubes.

Nixie tubes were superseded in the 1970s by [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFDs), often in the form of [[seven-segment display]]s. The VFD uses a hot filament to emit electrons, a control grid and phosphor-coated anodes (similar to a [[cathode ray tube]]) shaped to represent segments of a digit, pixels of a graphical display, or complete letters, symbols, or words. Whereas Nixies typically require 180 volts to illuminate, VFDs only require relatively low voltages to operate, making them easier and cheaper to use. VFDs have a simple internal structure, resulting in a bright, sharp, and unobstructed image.  Unlike Nixies, the glass envelope of a VFD is evacuated rather than being filled with a specific mixture of gases at low pressure.

Specialized high-voltage driver chips such as the [[7400 series|7441/74141]] were available to drive Nixies. LEDs are better suited to the low voltages that [[integrated circuit]]s used, which was an advantage for devices such as pocket calculators, digital watches, and handheld digital measurement instruments. Also, LEDs are much smaller and sturdier, without a fragile glass envelope. LEDs use less power than VFDs or Nixie tubes with the same function.

Citing dissatisfaction with the aesthetics of modern digital displays and a nostalgic fondness for the styling of obsolete technology, significant numbers of electronics enthusiasts in recent years have shown interest in reviving Nixies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The largest Nixie tubes known to be in the hands of collectors, the [[Okaya tubes|Rodan]] CD47/GR-414 (220&amp;nbsp;mm &amp;#91;8.7 in&amp;#93; tall),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/data/cd47-gr414.htm Rodan CD47 tube] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024112730/http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/data/cd47-gr414.htm |date=2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been sold for hundreds of dollars each, but said Nixies are extremely rare. Prices for other large Nixies displaying digits over 25&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;in) tall have risen by double, triple or more between 1998 and 2005.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

There have also been some attempts to make new Nixie tubes, the most successful of which is that of Dalibor Farny, a programmer and electrical engineer from the Czech Republic. His efforts began in February 2012, and by the end of 2014, Dalibor had created his first marketable Nixie tube, the R|Z568M (whose "R" stands for "resurrection"),&lt;ref name="Dalibor Farny website"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daliborfarny.com/r-z568m-nixie-tube/|title=R{{!}}Z568M Nixie Tube {{!}} Nixie clocks at DaliborFarny.com|website=www.daliborfarny.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-14|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606081900/http://www.daliborfarny.com/r-z568m-nixie-tube/|archivedate=2017-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he still sells on his website for $145 USD.&lt;ref name="Dalibor Farny website"/&gt;

In addition to the tube itself, another important consideration is the relatively high-voltage circuitry necessary to drive the tube. The original [[7400 series]] drivers integrated circuits such as the 74141 [[binary-coded decimal|BCD]] decoder driver have long since been out of production and are rarer than [[New old stock|NOS]] tubes. Only "Integral" in [[Belarus]] lists the 74141&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integral.by/en/products/in74xxxn-d-series?product=3608|title=IN74141N|publisher=Integral|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114235521/http://www.integral.by/en/products/in74xxxn-d-series?product=3608|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its Soviet equivalent, the K155ID1 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integral.by/ru/products/ttl-seriya-k155-ekf155?product=1601|title=–ö155–ò–î1|trans-title=K155ID1|language=ru|publisher=Integral|accessdate=19 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916081837/http://integral.by/ru/products/ttl-seriya-k155-ekf155?product=1601|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as still in production. However modern [[bipolar transistor]]s with high voltage ratings are now available cheaply, such as MPSA92 or MPSA42 ‚Äì an unusual example where an original IC design has been replaced by discrete transistors.

'''Optical sorting''' (sometimes called '''digital sorting''') is the automated process of [[sorting]] solid products using [[cameras]] and/or [[lasers]].

Depending on the types of sensors used and the software-driven intelligence of the [[image processing]] system, optical sorters can recognize objects' color, size, shape, structural properties and chemical composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sun|first=Da-Wen|title=Computer Vision Technology for Food Quality Evaluation|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-373642-0|pages=600|url=http://www.elsevier.com/books/computer-vision-technology-for-food-quality-evaluation/sun/978-0-12-373642-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sorter compares objects to user-defined accept/reject criteria to identify and remove defective products and foreign material (FM) from the production line, or to separate product of different grades or types of materials.

[[File:SortingPotatoStrips.jpg|thumb|Optical sorting achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes.]]  
Optical sorters are in widespread use in the [[food industry]] worldwide, with the highest adoption in processing harvested foods such as potatoes, fruits, vegetables and nuts where it achieves non-destructive, 100 percent inspection in-line at full production volumes. The technology is also used in [[pharmaceutical manufacturing]] and [[nutraceutical]] manufacturing, tobacco processing, [[waste recycling]] and other industries. Compared to manual sorting, which is subjective and inconsistent, optical sorting helps improve product quality, maximize throughput and increase yields while reducing labor costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Joseph Irudayaraj|Irudayaraj]]|first=Joseph|title=Nondestructive Testing of Food Quality|year=2008|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-8138-2885-5|pages=384|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0813828856.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The sorting system ==

In general, optical sorters feature four major components: the feed system, the optical system, image processing software and the separation system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=M|title=Detecting Foreign Bodies in Food|year=2004|publisher=Woodhead Publishing Ltd.|isbn=1 85573 729 9|pages=328|url=http://www.woodheadpublishing.com/en/book.aspx?bookID=614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The objective of the feed system is to spread product into a uniform monolayer so products are presented to the optical system evenly, without clumps, at a constant velocity. The optical system includes lights and sensors housed above and/or below the flow of the objects being inspected. The image processing system compares objects to user-defined accept/reject thresholds to classify objects and actuate the separation system. The separation system, usually compressed air for small products and mechanical devices for larger products like whole potatoes, pinpoints objects while in-air and deflects the objects to remove into a reject chute while good product continues along its normal trajectory.

The ideal sorter depends on the application, with the product's characteristics and the user's objectives determining the ideal sensors, software-driven capabilities and mechanical platform.

== Sensors ==
Optical sorters require a compatible combination of light and sensors to illuminate objects and capture images of the objects before the images can be processed and accept/reject decisions made.

There are camera sorters, laser sorters and sorters that feature a combination of cameras and lasers on one platform. Lights, cameras, lasers and laser sensors can be designed to function within visible light wavelengths as well as the infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) [[spectrum]]s. The optimal wavelengths for each application maximize the contrast between the objects to be separated. Cameras and laser sensors can differ in spatial resolution, with higher resolutions enabling the sorter to detect and remove smaller defects.

=== Cameras ===

[[File:SortingGreenBeans.jpg|thumb|Shape sorting enables the detection of same-color defects and foreign material]] Monochromatic cameras detect shades of gray from black to white and can be effective when sorting products with high-contrast defects.

Sophisticated color cameras with high color resolution are capable of detecting millions of colors to better distinguish more subtle color defects. [[Trichromatic]] color cameras (also called three-channel cameras) divide light into three bands, which can include red, green and/or blue within the visible spectrum as well as IR and UV.

Coupled with intelligent software, sorters that feature cameras are capable of recognizing each object's color, size and shape as well as the color, size, shape and location of a defect on a product. Some intelligent sorters even allow the user to define a defective product based on the total defective surface area of any given object. They use high beam infrared laser beams to show the laser on the beam.

=== Lasers ===

While cameras capture product information based primarily on material reflectance, lasers and their sensors are able to interrogate a material's structural properties in addition to determining differences in color. This structural property inspection capability makes lasers ideal for detecting a wide range of organic and inorganic foreign material such as insects, glass, metal, sticks, rocks and plastic, even if they are the same color as the good product, and for separating various materials at waste recycling facilities.

Lasers can be designed to operate within specific wavelengths of light, within the visible spectrums and beyond. For example, lasers can detect chlorophyll by stimulating fluorescence using specific wavelengths, a process that is very effective for removing foreign material from green vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Hong|title=Automatic sorting of Chinese jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill. cv. 'hongxing') using chlorophyll fluorescence and support vector machine|journal=Journal of Food Engineering|date=December 2010|volume=101|pages=402‚Äì408|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0260877410003754|doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2010.07.028|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Camera/laser combinations ===

Sorters equipped with cameras and lasers on one platform are generally capable of identifying the widest variety of attributes. Cameras are often better at recognizing color, size and shape while laser sensors identify differences in structural properties to maximize foreign material detection and removal. 
 
=== Hyperspectral imaging ===

[[File:Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips.jpg|thumb|Hyperspectral image of "sugar end" potato strips shows invisible defects]] Driven by the need to solve previously impossible sorting challenges, a new generation of sorters that feature [[multispectral]] and [[hyperspectral imaging]] systems are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgstaller|first=Markus|author2=Groinig, Marcus|title=Spectral Imaging Sorts 'Sugar-End' Defects|journal=Vision Systems Design|date=February 2012|url=http://www.vision-systems.com/articles/print/volume-17/issue-2/features/spectral-imaging-sorts-sugar-end-defects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like trichromatic cameras, multispectral and hyperspectral cameras collect data from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Unlike trichromatic cameras, which divide light into three bands, hyperspectral systems can divide light into hundreds of narrow bands over a continuous range that covers a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the three data points per pixel collected by trichromatic cameras, hyperspectral cameras can collect hundreds of data points per pixel, which are combined to create a unique [[spectral signature]] (also called a fingerprint) for each object. When complemented by capable software intelligence, a hyperspectral sorter processes those fingerprints to enable sorting on the chemical composition of the product. This is an emerging area of [[chemometrics]].

== Software-driven intelligence ==
Once the sensors capture the object's response to the energy source, image processing takes over to manipulate the raw data to extract and categorize information about specific features. As raw data flows from the sensors, the definitions of good and bad flow from the user who sets the accept/reject thresholds. The art and science of image processing lies in developing [[algorithms]] that maximize the effectiveness of the sorter while presenting a simple user-interface to the operator.

Object-based recognition is a classic example of software-driven intelligence. It allows the user to define a defective product based on where a defect lies on the product and/or the total defective surface area of an object. It offers more control in defining a wider range of defective products, and if used to control the sorter's ejection system, it improves the accuracy of ejecting defective products, which improves product quality and increases yields.

New software-driven capabilities are constantly being developed to address the specific needs of various applications. As computing hardware becomes more powerful, new software-driven advancements become possible. Some of these advancements enhance the effectiveness of sorters to achieve better results while others enable completely new sorting decisions to be made.

== Platforms ==
The considerations that determine the ideal platform for a specific application include the nature of the product ‚Äì large or small, wet or dry, fragile or unbreakable, round or easy to stabilize ‚Äì and the user's objectives. In general, products smaller than a grain of rice and as large as whole potatoes can be sorted. Throughputs range from less than 2 metric tons of product per hour on low-capacity sorters to more than 35 metric tons of product per hour on high-capacity sorters.

=== Channel sorters ===

The simplest optical sorters are channel sorters, a type of [[color sorter]] that can be effective for products that are small, hard and dry with a consistent size and shape such as rice and seeds. For these products, channel sorters offer an affordable solution and ease of use with a small footprint. Channel sorters feature monochromatic or color cameras and remove defects and foreign material based only on differences in color.

For products that are soft or wet or non-homogenous, which cannot be handled by a channel sorter, and for processors that want more control over the quality of their product, freefall sorters (also called waterfall or gravity-fed sorters), chute-fed sorters or belt sorters are ideal. These more sophisticated sorters often feature advanced cameras and/or lasers that, when complemented by capable software intelligence, detect objects' size, shape, color, structural properties and chemical composition.

=== Freefall and chute-fed sorters ===

As the names imply, freefall sorters inspect product in-air during the freefall, while chute-fed sorters stabilize product on a chute prior to in-air inspection. The major advantages of freefall and chute-fed sorters, compared to belt sorters, are a lower price point, smaller footprint and the absence of moving parts, which contributes to low maintenance. These sorters are often most suitable for nuts and berries as well as a frozen and dried fruits, vegetables, potato strips and seafood, in addition to waste recycling applications that require mid-volume throughputs.

=== Belt Sorters ===

[[File:SortingPeas.jpg|thumb|Optical sorters can function within visible light wavelengths as well as the IR and UV spectrums]] Belt sorting platforms are often preferred for higher capacity applications such as vegetable and potato products prior to canning, freezing or drying, most fresh cut produce and wet fruits as well as waste recycling. Belt sorters stabilize product on a conveyor belt prior to inspection. Some belt sorters inspect product on the belt from the top only while others also launch product off the belt for in-air inspection from the bottom. Belt sorters can be designed to achieve traditional two-way sorting or can be equipped with two ejector systems and three outfeed streams to achieve three-way sorting.

=== ADR systems ===

A fifth type of sorting platform, called an automated defect removal (ADR) system, is specifically for potato strips (French fries). Unlike other sorters that eject products with defects from the production line, ADR systems identify defects and actually cut the defects from the strips. In conjunction with a mechanical nubbin grader that follows the ADR, this combination is essentially another type of optical sorting system because it uses optical sensors to identify and remove defects.

=== Single-file inspection systems ===

The platforms described above all operate in bulk mode, without needing to single-file product prior to inspection. In contrast, a sixth type of platform, used in the pharmaceutical industry, is a single-file optical inspection system. Although these sorters are effective in detecting and removing foreign tablets and capsules and defects based on differences in size, shape and color, they have not been widely adopted due to the high capital costs, low throughput and slow changeover, compared to the belt sorters for tablets, capsules and softgels.

=== Mechanical graders ===

For products that require sorting only by size, mechanical grading systems that don't utilize sensors or image processing systems are often highly effective. These mechanical grading systems are sometimes referred to as sorting systems, but should not be confused with optical sorters that feature sensors and image processing systems.

'''Pohang University of Science and Technology''' ('''POSTECH''') is a [[private university|private]] [[research university]] in [[Pohang]], [[South Korea]] dedicated to research and education in [[science]] and [[technology]].

In 2012-2014, the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' ranked POSTECH 1st in its "100 Under 50 Young Universities" rankings. Since its establishment, POSTECH has been maintaining its prestige and reputation as one of the most prominent young [[Research university|research universities]] in the world, being 83rd overall in the [[QS World University Rankings]] 2019&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019&lt;/ref&gt; and 12th best in [[QS World University Rankings|QS Asia University Ranking]] 2017-2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction ==

=== History===
POSTECH was established in 1986 in Pohang, Korea by [[POSCO]], one of the world's leading steel companies, for the purpose of providing advanced education for budding engineers and laying the groundwork for future technological development.&lt;ref name="elibrary.worldbank.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2357|title=The Road to Academic Excellence: The Making of World-Class Research Universities|work=The World Bank September 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of POSCO and the founding chairman of POSTECH, [[Park Tae-joon]] realized the need for Korea to educate their youth in science and technology to ensure Korea's position in the high technology arena. Park wanted to use the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) as a model for POSTECH and visited the university on a business trip to Los Angeles in 1985. He noted characteristics of Caltech and requested to the POSTECH founding team to establish a contemporary research university that had: a low student-faculty ratio, a greater proportion of graduate students to undergraduates, a low net education cost, student on-campus housing, and a high-quality campus environment. These features represented a drastic departure from the Korean universities of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="elibrary.worldbank.org"/&gt;

POSCO organized a task force on February 21, 1984 made up of POSCO employees selected by the company. Construction work began on August 17, 1985. On May 4, 1986, British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] visited POSTECH and donated an [[Inmos]] [[transputer]], one of the leading edge computer parts at the time. The first matriculation ceremony was held on March 5, 1987. A group of 249 freshmen were selected from the top one percent of all graduating seniors in Korea to be taught by an international faculty recruited by POSTECH founding president Hogil Kim and POSTECH task force head manager Dai Kong Lee. The first degree awarding ceremony was on February 20, 1991. Diplomas were awarded to 146 graduating seniors, 123 (84%) of whom went on to pursue graduate studies. The remaining 23 graduates were employed by the nation's major corporations including POSCO, [[Samsung]], [[LG]], and [[Hyundai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Self-portrait of Postechians |last=Cho |first=Seihon |year=2006 |publisher=POSTECH Audio-Visual Office |location=Pohang |accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate translational research and active academia-industry collaboration, POSTECH hosted POSCO's Research Institute of Science and Technology (RIST) on campus.  In 1994, POSTECH set up the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), a 3rd-generation synchrotron light source and now a national facility. Currently, the 4th-generation light source X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) is under construction (to be completed in 2015) at the cost of US$400 million, which will be the third one in the world and will open up new frontiers and research areas in life sciences, materials, chemistry, and physics.

The Library shares materials with industrial-educational-research cooperation and is part of an intercollegiate data exchange program with approximately 150 other research and educational institutions throughout the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://library.postech.ac.kr/htdocs/introduction/introduction.php?command=DETAIL | title=Introduction | publisher=Tae-Joon Park Digital Library | year=2005 | accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart campus===
POSTECH operates a Smart Campus where the scientific and technological information of the world is accessible anywhere on campus using different types of smart phones and mobile devices as well as laptops. In 2010, for the first time among Korean universities, POSTECH implemented a Desktop Cloud Service, providing a convenient and secure computing environment. However, as of 2018, many of the previously implemented technological services (e.g. campus smartphone applications, university website, university online portal, etc) are defective as they have not been since updated, and are only accessible through Internet Explorer. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwhome.postech.ac.kr/web/eng/eclf_01_07|title=Smart Campus|work=POSTECH Website|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On-campus dormitories and family housing===
POSTECH offers students living on-campus in affordable dormitories and apartments for married graduate students. The student housing complex is composed of 23 five-story student dormitories, one 13-story undergraduate student dormitory, and 4 graduate student apartments. All POSTECH undergraduate students are required to live in one of the on-campus dormitories and many graduate students prefer to stay on campus, either in the student dormitories or in one of the four high-rise graduate student apartments.

===Gymnasium and sports complex===
POSTECH has a range of sports facilities, from a gymnasium equipped with racquetball, basketball and badminton courts to POSPLEX, a sports center with a swimming pool, a fitness center and an indoor golf driving range, and outdoor sports fields for tennis, futsal, and soccer.

==="First bilingual campus in Korea"===
In March 2010, POSTECH declared the initiation of a bilingual campus. However, as of 2018, the vast majority of notices and announcements are made only in Korean. Most major official events (e.g., commencement) are also only run in Korean. While course catalogs list courses as taught in English, many professors decide to teach in Korean because international members represent only a minority of the classroom. The rising consensus from international students reveals the difficulty of living and studying as a non-Korean speaker at POSTECH.

==Academics==

===Admissions===
POSTECH admits approximately 300 undergraduate students each year. POSTECH received 1,987 applicants for freshman admission and admitted 323 for the 2014 school year. POSTECH provides the highest educational investment and the most per-student scholarship support in Korea, allowing students from all economic backgrounds the opportunity to obtain a POSTECH education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/09/23/2008092361008.html|title=POSTECH Spent Most Money on Students|work=The Chosun Ilbo September 23, 2008|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Graduate admissions====
A growing number of international students attend POSTECH as it expands its recruiting efforts abroad. POSTECH offers full tuition fellowships to excellent graduate students from the following countries: Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Thailand, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. However, the international program still lacks proper care and attention to the well-being and integration of international students into POSTECH, as the university's cultural and social norms are not suited for an international community. Growing reports indicate the wide spread presence of racism, sexism, and discrimination against international students.  

All graduate students receive a small teaching assistant scholarships and the university provides the Tae-Joon Park Graduate Fellowship, which provides the highest level of scholarship (approximately 25 million South Korean won) to about 50 top graduate students each year. The POSCO Fellowship is available for students recommended by a POSTECH departmental committee and then selected by the POSCO TJ Park Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admission.postech.ac.kr/linkUsen.do?f=sub4-1|title=POSTECH Graduate Admissions Costs and Financial Aid|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; POSTECH offers a one-time settlement grant of approximately $1,500 USD to all incoming international graduate students during the first semester of enrollment. As of 2018, graduate students will receive a sum balance of approximately $153 USD per month from the teaching assistant scholarship to pay for food and living expenses. 

Graduate students have the option of enrolling in the MS-Ph.D. integrated program. Under this program, students can work towards a Ph.D. degree after passing the Ph.D. qualifying exam without going through the MS program. Ph.D. applicants must have earned a master's degree before enrolling at POSTECH.

===Undergraduate education===

The undergraduate research program provides students with opportunities to participate in research under the guidance and mentorship of professors. Scholarships are offered to encourage student participation in research. In several departments such as Chemistry and Mathematics, it is mandatory for all students to participate in the undergraduate research program.

Courses and activities on entrepreneurship are available, and efforts to strengthen the entrepreneurial spirit and start-up support are being developed including club activities, start-up prep group, training on patents, and leave of absence for creating a new venture.

Through the Science &amp; Technology Core (STC), courses that extend beyond departmental boundaries, students are allowed to take classes in different departments for an interdisciplinary and broad academic foundation.

POSTECH operates the Residential College program for all freshmen and sophomores. Opportunities for personal development, social and cultural experiences, extracurricular group activities, and volunteer opportunities are occasionally available for students to participate in and enhance their undergraduate experience.

====Cultural programs====

==Research==
Four research centers of the [[Institute for Basic Science]] (IBS), which were recently established by the Korean government to promote research in basic sciences, are located at POSTECH. Four scientists and their teams in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry and life sciences are currently carrying out research on campus.

===Research institutes and infrastructure===

====Pohang Light Source (PLS-II)====
The 3rd generation light source at POSTECH is the 5th in the world and the only synchrotron radiation accelerator in Korea. This national research facility enables studies on various structural characteristics of materials using light. The facility is utilized in various basic science to high-tech industrial research. Its performance improvement to PLS-II was successfully completed in 2012. Thousands of users visit yearly to conduct their research using PLS-ll.

====4th generation light source====
The 4th generation light source (PAL-XFEL), which is operational since 2015, is 10 billion times brighter than the 3rd generation light source. PAL-XFEL will generate new knowledge and discoveries in almost all technical and scientific disciplines including medicine, pharmaceutics, chemistry, material science, nanotechnology, power engineering and electronics.

====Max Planck POSTECH/Korea Research Initiative====
The [[Max Planck Society]] of Germany and POSTECH established two Max Planck Centers at POSTECH: the Max Planck-POSTECH Center for Attosecond Science and the Max Planck-POSTECH Center for Complex Phase Materials. This collaboration is not only a testament to POSTECH's internationally renowned research excellence but, with the introduction of advanced research institute operation and management methods, also lays a foundation for the further strengthening Korea's competitiveness in basic science research.

====POSTECH Biotech Center====
The POSTECH Biotech Center was founded in 2000 with the goal of becoming the hub of biotechnology research and business development (R&amp;BD). The primary goal of the POSTECH Biotech Center is to incubate disruptive technologies in biotechnology areas for the development of immunology, pharmaceuticals, and nanobiotechnology. The Center has been participating actively in academia-industry collaboration both nationally and internationally.

====National Institute for Nanomaterials Technology====
The National Institute for Nanomaterials Technology, a core research center for advancement and commercialization of nanotechnology, is developing the next-generation semiconductor and display materials, etc. The Institute provides technical support and assistance to industry, from research and development to commercialization. The Institute also supports and enables POSTECH researchers to actively carry out nanotechnology and other related areas.

====C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; (Creative„ÉªCollaborative„ÉªCultivating„ÉªConvergence„ÉªCenter)====
C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; plays a pivotal role in catalyzing world-first convergence education and research, and fostering future global leaders with a creative and challenging spirit. C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; was named after Creative, Collaborative, Cultivating, Convergence, and Center. C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; has 7-stories with a size of 16,000 square meters per floor. The construction of C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; came at an investment of 31.5 billion won. Construction began in October 2013 and its inauguration ceremony was held on January 30, 2015.

The first three floors of C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is filled by the Department of Creative IT Engineering (CiTE) and the POSETCH Future IT Innovation Laboratory (i-Lab). CiTE and i-Lab use interdisciplinary-oriented education and innovative research. The remaining three floors house POSTECH research teams that work for POSTECH's strategic promotion of research areas and subjects with huge growth potential. A modern open-space design allows various research teams to rearrange work areas freely to facilitate and promote dynamic collaboration.

The POSCO Pohang Center for Creative Economy occupies the 5th floor of C&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. The Center, led by POSCO, was established to maintain the competitiveness of the steel industry, promote source technology development, and nurture regionally-based "hidden champions" to vitalize venture businesses.&lt;br&gt;
==Distinguished Faculties and Alumni==

==Student life==
===Sunrise Festival===
Since 1987, POSTECH has hosted the annual Sunrise Festival to celebrate the spirit of unity and harmony of the POSTECH members and the local community. It is run in mid-May for three days immediately after the midterm of the spring semester. This festival is financially supported by the university, and is prepared by the entire student body and the POSTECH Student Club Association. Participants at the festival can enjoy movies, performances, singing contests, quiz shows, as well as traditional Korean drinks sold at cafes, beer gardens, and food stalls set up by student clubs.

===POSTECH-KAIST Science War===
Science War is an event held together by [[KAIST]] and Pohang University of Science and Technology every year in the fall. The first tournament was held in 2002 at [[KAIST]]. Every year since, both schools held it alternately. The competition name is determined depending by the home university. If held at [[KAIST]], it is called "Pocajeon"; at the Pohang University of Science and Technology, it is called "Kapojeon". Events include football, baseball, basketball, athletics and hacking competitions, League of Legend, and a science quiz.

===Hyungsan Academic Festival===
The Hyungsan Academic Festival, organized by the Federation of Student Circles, takes place at the end of October after the midterm of the second semester. Originally designed to provide venues for academic presentations by students' circles and departments, this festival now provides various programs including sports competition, plays and movie festivals, as well as academic conferences.

In the application of [[integrated circuits]], '''process control monitoring''' (PCM) is the procedure followed to obtain detailed information about the process used.

PCM is associated with designing and fabricating special structures that can monitor technology specific parameters such as V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; in [[CMOS]] and V&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt; in bipolars. These structures are placed across the wafer at specific locations along with the chip produced so that a closer look into the process variation is possible.

'''Replication''' in [[computing]] involves sharing information so as to ensure consistency between redundant resources, such as [[software]] or [[computer hardware|hardware]] components, to improve reliability, [[fault-tolerance]], or accessibility.

== {{Anchor|MASTER-ELECTION}}Terminology ==
Replication in computing can refer to:
* ''data replication'', where the same data is stored on multiple [[data storage device|storage device]]s
* ''computation replication'', where the same computing task is executed many times.  Computational tasks may be:
** ''replicated in space'', where tasks are executed on separate devices
** ''replicated in time'', where tasks are executed repeatedly on a single device

Replication in space or in time is often linked to scheduling algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;Mansouri, Najme, GholamHosein Dastghaibyfard, and Ehsan Mansouri. "Combination of data replication and scheduling algorithm for improving data availability in Data Grids." Journal of Network and Computer Applications (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to a replicated entity is typically uniform with access to a single non-replicated entity. The replication itself should be [[transparency (human-computer interaction)|transparent]] to an external user. In a failure scenario, a [[failover]] of replicas should be hidden as much as possible with respect to [[quality of service]] (QoS).&lt;ref&gt;V. Andronikou, K. Mamouras, K. Tserpes, D. Kyriazis, T. Varvarigou, ''Dynamic QoS-aware Data Replication in Grid Environments'', Elsevier Future Generation Computer Systems - The International Journal of Grid Computing and eScience, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer scientists further describe replication as being either:
* ''active replication'', which is performed by processing the same request at every replica
* ''passive replication'', which involves processing every request on a single replica and transferring the result to the other replicas

When one master replica is designated to process all the requests, the system is using a primary-backup or [[Master-slave (computers)|master-slave]] scheme, which is predominant in [[high-availability cluster]]s. In comparison, if any replica can process a request and distribute a new state, the system is using a multi-primary or [[Multi-master replication|multi-master]] scheme. In the latter case, some form of [[distributed concurrency control]] must be used, such as a [[distributed lock manager]].

[[load balancing (computing)|Load balancing]] differs from task replication, since it distributes a load of different computations across machines, and allows a single computation to be dropped in case of failure. Load balancing, however, sometimes uses data replication (especially multi-master replication) internally, to distribute its data among machines.

[[Backup]] differs from replication in that the saved copy of data remains unchanged for a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zerto.com/replication/backup-and-replication-what-is-the-difference/|title=Backup and Replication: What is the Difference?|last=|first=|date=February 6, 2012|website=Zerto|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replicas, on the other hand, undergo frequent updates and quickly lose any historical state. Replication is one of the oldest and most important topics in the overall area of [[distributed computing|distributed systems]].

Data replication and computation replication both require processes to handle incoming events. Processes for data replication are passive and operate only to maintain the stored data, reply to read requests and apply updates. Computation replication is usually performed to provide fault-tolerance, and take over an operation if one component fails. In both cases, the underlying needs are to ensure that the replicas see the same events in equivalent orders, so that they stay in consistent states and any replica can respond to queries.

=== Replication models in distributed systems ===
Three widely cited models exist for data replication, each having its own properties and performance:
* ''Transactional replication'' ‚Äì used for replicating [[transactional data]], such as a database. The [[one-copy serializability]] model is employed, which defines valid outcomes of a transaction on replicated data in accordance with the overall [[ACID]] (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) properties that transactional systems seek to guarantee.
* ''[[State machine replication]]'' ‚Äì assumes that the replicated process is a [[deterministic finite automaton]] and that [[atomic broadcast]] of every event is possible. It is based on [[Consensus (computer science)|distributed consensus]] and has a great deal in common with the transactional replication model. This is sometimes mistakenly used as a synonym of active replication. State machine replication is usually implemented by a replicated log consisting of multiple subsequent rounds of the [[Paxos algorithm]]. This was popularized by Google's Chubby system, and is the core behind the open-source [[Keyspace (data store)|Keyspace data store]].&lt;ref name=keyspace&gt;
{{cite web | accessdate=2010-04-18 | year = 2009 | url=http://scalien.com/whitepapers |
title=Keyspace: A Consistently Replicated, Highly-Available Key-Value Store | author=Marton Trencseni, Attila Gazso}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chubby&gt;
{{cite web | accessdate=2010-04-18 | year=2006 | url=http://labs.google.com/papers/chubby.html | title=The Chubby Lock Service for Loosely-Coupled Distributed Systems | author=Mike Burrows | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209225931/http://labs.google.com/papers/chubby.html | archivedate=2010-02-09 | df= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Virtual synchrony]]'' ‚Äì involves a group of processes which cooperate to replicate in-memory data or to coordinate actions. The model defines a distributed entity called a ''process group''. A process can join a group and is provided with a checkpoint containing the current state of the data replicated by group members. Processes can then send multicasts to the group and will see incoming multicasts in the identical order. Membership changes are handled as a special multicast that delivers a new "membership view" to the processes in the group.

== {{Anchor|DATABASE}}Database replication ==
[[Database]] replication can be used on many [[database management system]]s (DBMS), usually with a master-slave relationship between the original and the copies. The master logs the updates, which then ripple through to the slaves. Each slave outputs a message stating that it has received the update successfully, thus allowing the sending of subsequent updates.

In [[Multi-master replication]], updates can be submitted to any database node, and then ripple through to other servers. This is often desired but introduces substantially increased costs and complexity which may make it impractical in some situations. The most common challenge that exists in multi-master replication is transactional conflict prevention or resolution. Most synchronous (or eager) replication solutions perform conflict prevention, while asynchronous (or lazy) solutions have to perform conflict resolution. For instance, if the same record is changed on two nodes simultaneously, an eager replication system would detect the conflict before confirming the commit and abort one of the transactions. A [[lazy replication]] system would allow both transactions to commit and run a conflict resolution during resynchronization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conflict Resolution|url=http://www.ittia.com/html/ittia-db-docs/users-guide/replication.html#conflict-resolution|publisher=ITTIA|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of such a conflict may be based on a timestamp of the transaction, on the hierarchy of the origin nodes or on much more complex logic, which decides consistently across all nodes.

Database replication becomes more complex when it scales up, which is usually described in two dimensions: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal scale-up has more data replicas, while vertical scale-up has data replicas located at greater physical distances. Problems raised by horizontal scale-up can be alleviated by a multi-layer multi-view access protocol. The early problems of vertical scale-up have largely been addressed by improving Internet reliability and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

When data is replicated between database servers, so that the information remains consistent throughout the database system and users cannot tell or even know which server in the DBMS they are using, the system is said to exhibit replication transparency.

== Disk storage replication ==
[[File:Storage replication.png|thumb|Storage replication]]
Active (real-time) storage replication is usually implemented by distributing updates of a [[block device]] to several physical [[hard disk]]s. This way, any [[file system]] supported by the [[operating system]] can be replicated without modification, as the file system code works on a level above the block device driver layer. It is implemented either in hardware (in a [[disk array controller]]) or in software (in a [[device driver]]).

The most basic method is [[disk mirroring]], typical for locally connected disks. The storage industry narrows the definitions, so ''mirroring'' is a local (short-distance) operation. A replication is extendable across a [[computer network]], so that the disks can be located in physically distant locations, and the master-slave database replication model is usually applied. The purpose of replication is to prevent damage from failures or [[Disaster Recovery|disaster]]s that may occur in one location ‚Äì or in case such events do occur, to improve the ability to recover data. For replication, latency is the key factor because it determines either how far apart the sites can be or the type of replication that can be employed.

The main characteristic of such cross-site replication is how write operations are handled, through either ''synchronous'' or ''asynchronous'' replication. The main difference is that synchronous replication needs to wait for the destination server in any write operation.

[[Synchronization|Synchronous]] replication guarantees "zero data loss" by the means of [[atomic operation|atomic]] write operations, where the write operation is not considered complete until acknowledged by both the local and remote storage. Most applications wait for a write transaction to complete before proceeding with further work, hence overall performance decreases considerably. Inherently, performance drops proportionally to distance, as minimum [[latency (engineering)|latency]] is dictated by the [[speed of light]]. For 10&amp;nbsp;km distance, the fastest possible roundtrip takes 67 Œºs, whereas an entire local cached write completes in about 10‚Äì20 Œºs.

In [[Asynchronous I/O|Asynchronous]] replication, the write operation is considered complete as soon as local storage acknowledges it. Remote storage is updated with a small [[lag]]. Performance is greatly increased, but in case of a local storage failure, the remote storage is not guaranteed to have the current copy of data (the most recent data may be lost).

Semi-synchronous replication typically considers a write operation complete when acknowledged by local storage and received or logged by the remote server. The actual remote write is performed asynchronously, resulting in better performance but remote storage will lag behind the local storage, so that there is no guarantee of durability (i.e.: seamless transparency) in the case of local storage failure.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Point-in-time replication produces periodic [[snapshot (computer storage)|snapshot]]s which are replicated instead of primary storage. This is intended to replicate only the changed data instead of the entire volume. As less information is replicated using this method, replication can occur over less-expensive bandwidth links such as iSCSI or T1 instead of fiber optic lines.

=== Implementations ===
{{Main|distributed fault-tolerant file systems|distributed parallel fault-tolerant file systems}}
Many [[distributed filesystem]]s use replication to ensure fault tolerance and avoid a single point of failure.

Many commercial synchronous replication systems do not freeze when the remote replica fails or loses connection ‚Äì¬†behaviour which guarantees zero data loss ‚Äì but proceed to operate locally, losing the desired zero [[recovery point objective]].

Techniques of [[WAN optimization|wide-area network (WAN) optimization]] can be applied to address the limits imposed by latency.

== File-based replication ==
File-based replication conducts data replication at the logical level (i.e.: individual data files) rather than at the storage block level. There are many different ways of performing this, which almost exclusively rely on software.

=== Capture with a kernel driver ===
A [[kernel driver]] (specifically a [[filter driver]]) can be used to intercept calls to the filesystem functions, capturing any activity as it occurs. This utilises the same type of technology that real-time active virus checkers employ. At this level, logical file operations are captured like file open, write, delete, etc. The kernel driver transmits these commands to another process, generally over a network to a different machine, which will mimic the operations of the source machine. Like block-level storage replication, the file-level replication allows both synchronous and asynchronous modes. In synchronous mode, write operations on the source machine are held and not allowed to occur until the destination machine has acknowledged the successful replication. Synchronous mode is less common with file replication products although a few solutions exist.

File-level replication solutions allow for informed decisions about replication based on the location and type of the file. For example, temporary files or parts of a filesystem that hold no business value could be excluded. The data transmitted can also be more granular; if an application writes 100 bytes, only the 100 bytes are transmitted instead of a complete disk block (generally 4096 bytes). This substantially reduces the amount of data sent from the source machine and the storage burden on the destination machine.

Drawbacks of this software-only solution include the requirement for implementation and maintenance on the operating system level, and an increased burden on the machine's processing power.

==== File system journal replication ====
Similarly to database [[transaction log]]s, many [[file system]]s have the ability to [[Journaling file system|journal]] their activity. The journal can be sent to another machine, either periodically or in real time by streaming. On the replica side, the journal can be used to play back file system modifications.

One of the notable implementations is [[Microsoft]]'s [[System Center Data Protection Manager]] (DPM), released in 2005, which performs periodic updates but does not offer real-time replication.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Batch replication ===
This is the process of comparing the source and destination file systems and ensuring that the destination matches the source. The key benefit is that such solutions are generally free or inexpensive. The downside is that the process of synchronizing them is quite system-intensive, and consequently this process generally runs infrequently.

One of the notable implementations is [[rsync]].

== Distributed shared memory replication ==
{{expand section|date=November 2018}}
Another example of using replication appears in [[distributed shared memory]] systems, where many nodes of the system share the same page of memory. This usually means that each node has a separate copy (replica) of this page.

== Primary-backup and multi-primary replication ==
Many classical approaches to replication are based on a primary-backup model where one device or process has unilateral control over one or more other processes or devices. For example, the primary might perform some computation, streaming a log of updates to a backup (standby) process, which can then take over if the primary fails. This approach is common for replicating databases, despite the risk that if a portion of the log is lost during a failure, the backup might not be in a state identical to the primary, and transactions could then be lost.

A weakness of primary-backup schemes is that only one is actually performing operations. Fault-tolerance is gained, but the identical backup system doubles the costs. For this reason, starting {{circa|1985}}, the distributed systems research community began to explore alternative methods of replicating data. An outgrowth of this work was the emergence of schemes in which a group of replicas could cooperate, with each process acting as a backup while also handling a share of the workload.

Computer scientist [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]] analyzed multi-primary replication schemes under the transactional model and published a widely cited paper skeptical of the approach "The Dangers of Replication and a Solution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/~gray/replicas.ps The Dangers of Replication and a Solution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the 1999 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data: SIGMOD '99'', Philadelphia, PA, US; June 1‚Äì3, 1999, Volume 28; p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that unless the data splits in some natural way so that the database can be treated as ''n'' {{math|n}} disjoint sub-databases, concurrency control conflicts will result in seriously degraded performance and the group of replicas will probably slow as a function of ''n''. Gray suggested that the most common approaches are likely to result in degradation that scales as ''O(n¬≥)''.  His solution, which is to partition the data, is only viable in situations where data actually has a natural partitioning key.

In the 1985‚Äì1987, the [[virtual synchrony]] model was proposed and emerged as a widely adopted standard (it was used in the Isis Toolkit, Horus, Transis, Ensemble, Totem, [[Spread Toolkit|Spread]], C-Ensemble, Phoenix and Quicksilver systems, and is the basis for the CORBA fault-tolerant computing standard). Virtual synchrony permits a multi-primary approach in which a group of processes cooperates to parallelize some aspects of request processing. The scheme can only be used for some forms of in-memory data, but can provide linear speedups in the size of the group.

A number of modern products support similar schemes. For example, the Spread Toolkit supports this same virtual synchrony model and can be used to implement a multi-primary replication scheme; it would also be possible to use C-Ensemble or Quicksilver in this manner. [[WANdisco]] permits active replication where every node on a network is an exact copy or replica and hence every node on the network is active at one time; this scheme is optimized for use in a [[wide area network]] (WAN).

A '''SIM box''' (also called a '''SIM bank''') is device used as part of a [[VoIP gateway]] installation. It contains a number of [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]], which are linked to the gateway but housed and stored separately from it. A SIM box can have SIM cards of different mobile operators installed, permitting it to operate with several [[GSM gateway]]s located in different places.{{citation-needed|date=October 2015}}

==Usage and detection==
[[File:Scheme of VoIP call with Sim box.png|thumb|Scheme of VoIP call with SIM box and gateway]]
The SIM box operator can route [[international call]]s through the VoIP connection and connect the call as local traffic, allowing the box's operator to bypass international rates and often undercut prices charged by local [[mobile network operator]]s.&lt;ref name="purgefraud"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://purgefraud.com/fraudpedia/bypass_fraud.php | title=How Bypass Fraud Works | work=PurgeFraud.com | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VibeGhana" /&gt; 

This business model of operation is very common around the world and is usually legal, as it simply uses the internet to piggyback calls to a local area and using a private exchange to route the call back to the mobile network. However, many companies, such as Verizon, provide strong lobbying forces to local governments to ban the use of SIM pools. Another reason is the lack of control of the users, i.e. Knowing who called whom? Creating a serious privacy challenge to the users, where (local) governments want to know who made certain calls to whom and from where. One such example is the country of Ghana, where government has banned the use of SIM boxes. &lt;ref name="VibeGhana"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vibeghana.com/2015/01/26/ghana-loses-33million-dollars-through-sim-box-fraud/ | title=Ghana loses 33million dollars through SIM BOX fraud | work=vibeghana.com | date=26 January 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myjoyonline"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2015/January-26th/former-greeda-boss-dr-tweneboah-arrested-for-sim-box-fraud.php | title=Former GREDA boss Tweneboah arrested for SIM box fraud | work=MyJoyOnline.com | date=26 January 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call Quality==
As the normal mobile network are sometimes using a very outdated and low quality sound codecs (such as the GSM HR and FR codecs), a SIM box may provide local quality with superior sound quality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5866">'''Safe household water storage''' is a critical component of a Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS) system being promoted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) worldwide in areas that do not have piped drinking water. In these areas it is not uncommon for drinking water to be stored in a pot, jar, crock or other container in the home. Even if this drinking water was of acceptable microbiological quality initially, it can become contaminated from dirty hands and utensils, such as dirty dippers and cups. Drinking water containers with "narrow dispensers are key" to keeping water from being contaminated while being stored in the home.&lt;ref&gt;

All types of 'safe household water storage must be used with water from known clean sources or with water having received prior efficacious treatment.

==Examples of containers==
*[[Solar Cookers International]] (SCI) has incorporated the '''Safe Household Water Storage''' container in their water pasteurization programs in [[Kenya]].  They are part of a ''safe water package''  that consists of a [[CooKit]] solar cooker, a black pot, a [[Water Pasteurization Indicator]] (WAPI), and a '''Safe Household Water Storage''' container.&lt;ref&gt;

  | date = November 2007 
  | url = http://solarcooking.org/newsletters/scrnov07.htm#Kenya
  | accessdate = 3 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The containers are handmade out of clay by local artisans. Their design incorporates a small opening at the top to help prevent children from dipping cups and possibly dirty hands into the drinking water. There is a spigot at the bottom.  "Unfortunately, the spigot is almost as expensive as the container itself." In total each cost about 450 KSh ([[Kenya Shilling]]s) or about US$6.00. The unglazed clay container helps to keep the water naturally somewhat cool in dry climates because a very small amount of the water is absorbed by the container and then evaporates.

==Background==
The [[United Nations| United Nations']] ''Millennium Declaration'' adopted by its General Assembly in September 2000 set [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) that have a purpose of significantly reducing the proportion of people in the world in extreme poverty. Resolution 19 specifically states with respect to drinking water, "To halve, by the year 2015...the proportion of the world's people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water".&lt;ref&gt;

One way that the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has supported the safe drinking water goal is with its Household Water Treatment and Safe Storage (HWTS) program which targets people that are not connected to community water systems. Their website states that improved HWTS techniques can dramatically improve drinking water quality and reduce diarrhoeal diseases for those that must rely on unsafe water supplies.  It reminds us that there are 1.6 million diarrhoeal deaths per year related to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene and that these are mostly of children under 5 years old.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Spherical surface acoustic wave sensors''' use a type of [[surface acoustic wave]] (SAW) that travels along the surface of a [[Transmission medium|medium]] exhibiting [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] with exponentially decaying [[amplitude]] along depth. MEMS-IDT technology allows the use of SAW waves to sense various gases. Sensitivity up to 10 ppm of [[hydrogen]] using a spherical Ball SAW device is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of 20th International Congress on Acoustics, ICA 2010 23‚Äì27 August 2010, Sydney, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Conventional planar SAW sensors are based on principle that the [[parameter]]s such as amplitude, speed and phase of Surface acoustic wave changes on adsorption of gas molecules. Limitation of planar SAW based sensors is that the change in above mentioned parameters is very small due to limited path offered to Surface acoustic wave by planar sensor. In case of Spherical sensors surface acoustic wave make several round trips along the equator of a ball as shown in fig, which offer longer paths to Surface acoustic wave hence even smaller change in parameters is amplified with multiple turns, which increases the sensitivity of the sensor considerably.

'''Steorn Ltd''' {{IPAc-en|Àà|s|t|j|…îr|n}} was a small, private [[Research and development|technology development]] company based in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In August 2006, it announced that it had developed a technology to provide "free, clean, and constant energy" via an apparent [[perpetual motion machine]], something which is contrary to the law of [[conservation of energy]], a fundamental principle of physics.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

Steorn challenged the [[scientific community]] to investigate their claim&lt;ref name="econ-ad" /&gt; and, in December 2006, said that it had chosen a jury of scientists to do so.&lt;ref name="jury-selection" /&gt; In June 2009 the jury gave its unanimous verdict that Steorn had not demonstrated the production of energy.&lt;ref name="irish-times-24062009" /&gt;

Steorn gave two public demonstrations of their technology. In the first demonstration, in July 2007 at the [[Kinetica Museum]] in London, the device failed to work.&lt;ref name="BTJuly2007" /&gt; The second demonstration, which ran from December 2009 to February 2010 at the [[Waterways Visitor Centre]] in Dublin, involved a motor powered by a battery and provided no independent evidence that excess energy was being generated.&lt;ref name="ZDNews151209" /&gt;  It was dismissed by the press as an attempt to build a [[perpetual motion]] machine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldacre |first=Ben |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jul/07/badscience.uknews |title=Perpetual motion goes into reverse|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=7 July 2007|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a publicity stunt.&lt;ref name="houston" /&gt;

In November 2016, the company laid off its staff, closed its facility, and prepared for [[liquidation]].&lt;ref name=Whyte&gt;{{cite news|first=Barry |last=Whyte |url=https://www.businesspost.ie/business/power-off-steorn-finally-energy-e23-million-funding-370313 |title=Power Off: Steorn finally out of energy after ‚Ç¨23 million in funding |work=[[The Sunday Business Post]] |date=13 Nov 2016| accessdate=13 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrier&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Ferrier |url=http://dispatchesfromthefuture.com/2016/11/steorn-liquidates/ |title=Steorn Liquidates |website=dispatchesfromthefuture.com |date=13 Nov 2016| accessdate=14 Nov 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in October 2001, their website stated that they were a "specialist service company providing programme management and technical assessment advice for European companies engaging in [[Electronic commerce|e-commerce]] projects". Steorn is a [[Old Norse language|Norse]] word meaning to guide or manage.

In May 2006, ''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'' reported that Steorn was a former [[dot-com company]] which was developing a microgenerator product based on the same principle as [[Automatic watch|self-winding watches]], as well as creating [[e-commerce]] websites for customers. The company had also recently raised about ‚Ç¨2.5 million from investors and was three years into a four-year development plan for its microgenerator technology.&lt;ref name="IEpost060521"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steorn said that they would seek no further funding while attempting to prove their free-energy claim in order to demonstrate their genuine desire for validation.&lt;ref name="SunTrib10082008" /&gt;

===Liquidation===
In June 2016, the company informed shareholders that it had failed to meet expectations, that company founder Shaun (Se√°n) McCarthy was being replaced as CEO, and that operating costs were nearly ‚Ç¨1 million per year.&lt;ref name=Whyte /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrier /&gt; After investments totaling nearly ‚Ç¨23 million over a ten-year period, in November 2016 the company shut down and laid off its staff, due to a lack of additional funding to continue operations.&lt;ref name=Whyte /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferrier /&gt;

==Free energy claim==
In August 2006, Steorn placed an advertisement in ''[[The Economist]]'' saying that they had developed a technology that produced "free, clean and constant energy".&lt;ref name="econ-ad"&gt;{{cite web

| title = Copy of Steorn advertisement featured in The Economist, hosted by dispatchesfromthefuture.com

| last=Boggan}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these scientists would talk to the media, and Steorn suggested that this was because they did not want to become embroiled in a controversy.&lt;ref name="GdnUK-Aug25" /&gt;

===Views on the technology===
No specific details of the workings of the claimed technology were made public. McCarthy stated in a 2006 [[Radio Telef√≠s √âireann|RT√â]] radio interview, "What we have developed is a way to construct [[magnetic field]]s so that when you travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy".&lt;ref name="yahh"&gt;

 | archivedate = 3 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the [[Australian Skeptics]] has pointed out that Steorn is "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy"&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; while [[Martin Fleischmann]] says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.&lt;ref name="GdnUK-Aug25" /&gt;

Following a meeting between McCarthy and Professor Sir [[Eric Ash]] in July 2007, Ash reported that "the ''Orbo'' is a mechanical device which uses powerful magnets on the rim of a rotor and further magnets on an outer shell."&lt;ref name="EAsh"&gt;

Ash said that there was no comparison with religious dogma since there is no flexibility in choosing to accept that energy is always conserved.&lt;ref name="EAsh"/&gt; Rejecting conservation of energy would undermine all science and technology.&lt;ref name="EAsh"/&gt; Ash also formed the opinion that McCarthy was truly convinced in the validity of his invention but that this conviction was a case of "prolonged self-deception."&lt;ref name="EAsh" /&gt;

Many people have accused Steorn of engaging in a [[publicity stunt]] although Steorn denied such accusations.&lt;ref name="bbc-podsblogs"&gt;{{cite web

It stands to reason that Steorn has retooled as a Web marketing company and is using the "free energy" promotion as a platform to show future clients how it can leverage print advertising and a slick Web site to promote their products and ideas".&lt;ref name="houston"&gt;

===Jury process===
In its advertisement in ''The Economist'', Steorn challenged scientists to form an independent jury to test their technology and publish the results.&lt;ref name="SNewsJan07"&gt;

In June 2009 the jury announced its unanimous verdict that "Steorn's attempts to demonstrate the claim have not shown the production of energy.  The jury is therefore ceasing work".&lt;ref name="irish-times-24062009" /&gt; Dick Ahlstrom, writing in the ''[[Irish Times]]'', concluded from this that Steorn's technology did not work.&lt;ref name="irish-times-24062009" /&gt; Steorn responded by saying that because of difficulties in implementing the technology the focus of the process had been on providing the jury with test data on magnetic effects for study. Steorn also said that these difficulties had been resolved and disputed its jury's findings.&lt;ref name="irish-times-24062009" /&gt;

===Demonstrations===
[[File:Steorn cancellation.jpg|thumb|A notice at the Kinetica Museum announcing the cancellation of the public demonstration]]
On 4 July 2007, the technology was to be displayed at the Kinetica Museum, [[Old Spitalfields Market|Spitalfields Market]], [[London]]. A unit constructed of clear plastic was prepared so that the arrangement of magnets could be seen and to demonstrate that the device operated without external power sources.&lt;ref name="BTJuly2007"&gt;

A second demonstration ran between 15 December 2009 and February 2010 at the [[Waterways Visitor Centre]] in Dublin, and was [[Streaming media|streamed]] via Steorn's website.&lt;ref name="ZD141209"&gt;{{cite web

On 1 April 2010 Steorn opened an online development community, called the Steorn Knowledge Development Base (SKDB), which they said would explain their technology. Access was available only under licence on payment of a fee.&lt;ref name="IEpost100606"&gt;{{cite web

In May 2015, Steorn put an "Orbo PowerCube" on display behind the bar of a pub in Dublin. The PowerCube was a small box which the pub website claimed contained a "perpetual motion motor" which required no external power source. The cube was shown charging a [[mobile phone]]. Steorn claimed to be performing some "basic field trials" in undisclosed locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/self-charging-battery-causes-a-stir-in-dublin-pub-test-1.2211622 | title=Self-charging battery causes a stir in Dublin pub test | publisher=Irish Times | date=14 May 2015 | accessdate=17 June 2015 | author=Boran, Marie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Additional TAG Details=The economic data, while beneficially in more detail than in its parent article, is probably excessive--&gt;

The '''Stored Energy at Sea (StEnSEA)''' project is a new pump storage system designed to store significant quantities of electrical energy offshore. After research and development, it was tested on a model scale in November 2016. It is designed to link in well with offshore wind platforms and their issues caused by electrical production fluctuations. It works by water flowing into a container, at significant pressure, thus driving a turbine. If there is spare electricity the water can be pumped out, allowing electricity to be generated at a time of increased need.

==Development history==
In 2011, the physics Prof. Dr Horst Schmidt-B√∂cking ([[Goethe University Frankfurt]]) and Dr Gerhard Luther ([[Saarland University]]) had the idea of a new pump storage system, which should be placed on the sea bed. This system would use the high water pressure at great water depths to store electricity in hollow bodies.

Shortly, after their idea was published on the first of April 2011 in the newspaper [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], a consortium of the ''Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology'' and the construction company ''Hochtief AG'' was set up. In collaboration they conducted a first preliminary sketch, which proved the feasibility of the pump storage concept. Subsequently, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy supported the development and testing of the new concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energiespeicher von morgen wird erstmals im Bodensee getestet|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.batterien.fraunhofer.de/de/presse/presse_2016_11_2.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2018-06-14|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=2016-11-08|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical principle ==
The functionality of a seawater pressure storage power plant is based on usual [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity|pumped-hydro storage plants]]. A hollow concrete sphere with an integrated [[Pump as turbine|pump-turbine]] will be installed on the bottom of the sea. Compared to well known pumped-hydro storage plants, the sea that surrounds the sphere, represents the upper water basin. The hollow sphere represents the lower water basin. The StEnSea concept uses the high water pressure difference between the hollow sphere and the surrounding sea, which is about 75 bar (‚âà1 bar per 10 meters).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In case of overproduction of adjacent energy sources such as [[wind turbine]]s or [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] systems, the pump-turbine will be enabled to pump water from the cavity against the pressure into the surrounding sea.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iee.fraunhofer.de/de/projekte/suche/laufende/stensea-storing-energy-at-sea.html|title=STENSEA ‚Äì Storing Energy at Sea|last=|first=|date=|website=Fraunhofer Institute for Energy Economics and Energy System Technology|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An empty hollow sphere means a fully charged storage system. When electricity is needed, water from the surrounding sea is guided through the [[turbine]] into the cavity, generating electricity. The higher the pressure difference between hollow sphere and the surrounding sea, the higher the energy yield during discharging. While discharging the hollow sphere a vacuum will be created inside. To avoid [[cavitation]], the pump turbines and all other electrical components are placed in a centrally mounted cylinder. An [[Feed pump|auxiliary feed pump]] in the bottom of the cylinder is required to fill the cylinder with water and produces an inside pressure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

"Both pumps require an input pressure above the net positive suction head to avoid cavitation while pumping water from the inner volume into the cylinder or from the cylinder out of the sphere. As the pressure difference for the additional pump is much lower than for the pump turbine the required input pressure is lower as well. The input pressure of both pumps is given by the water column above them. For the additional pump this is the water column in the sphere and for the pump turbine it is the water column in the cylinder."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puchta|first=M.|last2=Bard|first2=J.|last3=Dick|first3=C.|last4=Hau|first4=D.|last5=Krautkremer|first5=B.|last6=Thalemann|first6=F.|last7=Hahn|first7=H.|date=December 2017|title=Development and testing of a novel offshore pumped storage concept for storing energy at sea -StEnSea|url=|journal=Journal of Energy Storage|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|volume=14|pages= 271|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The maximum capacity for the hollow concrete sphere depends on the total pump-turbine efficiency, the installation depth and the inner volume.

&lt;math&gt;C_{max}=\frac{\rho_{water} \cdot \eta_{turb} \cdot d \cdot g \cdot V_{inner}}{3,69E9}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hahn|first=H.|last2=Hau|first2=D.|last3=Dick|first3=C.|last4=Puchta|first4=M.|date=2017-05-24|title=Techno-economic assessment of a subsea energy storage technology for power balancing services|url=|journal=Energy|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|volume=133|pages= 122‚Äì125|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stored energy is proportional to the ambient pressure in the depths of the sea. Problems considered during the construction of the hollow sphere were choosing a construction-type that withstands the high water-pressure and which is heavy enough to keep the [[buoyancy]] force lower than the [[Gravity|gravitational force]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=A.|last2=Glowienka|first2=S.|last3=Meyer|first3=J.|date=July‚ÄìAugust 2013|title=StEnSea - Die bauliche Konzeption eines Tiefsee-Energiespeichers|url=|journal=Bauingenieur|volume=88|pages=291‚Äì293|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the spherical construction with an inner diameter of 28.6 meter and a 2.72 meter thick wall made of normal watertight [[concrete]].

=== Pilot test ===
For the proof of feasibility under real conditions and the acquisition of measurement data, the Fraunhofer engineers started the implementation of a pilot project. Therefore, a needed pilot hollow sphere was constructed by Hochtief Solutions AG in a scale of 1:10, with an outer diameter of three meters, an inner volume of eight m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is made of concrete.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puchta|first=M.|last2=Bard|first2=J.|last3=Dick|first3=C.|last4=Hau|first4=D.|last5=Krautkremer|first5=B.|last6=Thalemann|first6=F.|last7=Hahn|first7=H.|date=December 2017|title=Development and testing of a novel offshore pumped storage concept for storing energy at sea - Stensea|url=|journal=Journal of Energy Storage|publisher=Elsevier Ltd.|volume=14|pages= 271‚Äì273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 9, 2016 it was installed in the [[lake Constance]] at a depth of 100 meters and tested for four weeks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

During the test phase, the engineers were able to successfully store energy and operate the system in different operating modes. Another important question, that has been investigated, is whether or not a pressure equalization line to the surface is required. In case of application without the compensating cable, a reduction of costs and expense would be possible. The pilot test revealed, that both operation variants work and would be possible to run.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forschung-energiespeicher.info/aktuelles/aktuelles-einzelansicht/2/Das_System_laesst_sich_flexibel_einsetzen-1/|title=Das System l√§sst sich flexibel einsetzen|last=|first=|date=2017-01-09|website=Energiespeicher - Forschungsinitiative der Bundesregierung|publisher=FIZ Karlsruhe ‚Äì Leibniz-Institut f√ºr Informationsinfrastruktur GmbH|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next step, a possible test location in the sea for the carrying out of a demonstration project is to be scrutinized. Then a sphere with the planned demonstration diameter of 30 meters should be built and installed at a suitable location in the sea. Possible places of installation situated near a coast would be for example the [[Norwegian trench]] or some Spanish sea areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.faz.net/1.4526014|title=Speicher-Versuchsanlage: Forscher geben dem Bodensee die Kugel|last=K√ºffner|first=Georg|date=2016-11-18|work=Frankfurter Allgemeine|access-date=2018-06-18|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, partners from the industry financing half of the project must be found, in order to receive further public funding from the BMWi. Because the total costs for the demonstration project are estimated at a low double-digit million euro amount.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/speichermoeglichkeit-fuer-strom-im-bodensee-getestet-14908039.html?GEPC=s13|title=Das Geheimnis der hohlen Betonkugel|last=Preuss|first=Susanne|date=2017-03-04|website=Frankfurter Allgemeine|language=de|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential installation sites==
The identification of potential installation sites was undertaken in three consecutive steps. At first, the designation of several arguments depicting the quality of a potential location were determined. Besides the installation depth, which is the main factor involved, variables like slope, geomorphology, distance to a possible grid connection point as well as to bases for servicing and set-up, marine reserves and the requirement for power storage in the surroundings were taken into account.

In the following step, specific values were assigned to the hard parameters, which are required for the use of the technology. Many of these values were determined in a previous feasibility analysis, a few had to be assessed by using comparable applications from different offshore industries. The installation depth of the concrete sphere should be 600-800m below the sea level and have an angle of inclination of less than or equal to 1¬∞. In addition, it is required to reach the next grid connection point within one hundred kilometres as well as a basis, from which maintenance and repair measures can be carried out. Furthermore, an installation basis should not be more than 500&amp;nbsp;km away and areas with inappropriate geomorphology for example canyons were excluded.

Finally, a global location analysis, based on geo-datasets and the above defined restrictions, was carried out with a [[Geographic information system|Geographical Information System]] (GIS). In order to make a statement about the potential storage capacities, the resulting areas were assigned to the [[Exclusive economic zone|Exclusive Economic Zones]] (EEZ) of the affected states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those and the corresponding capacities for storing electricity are displayed in the table below.

==Economic assessment of StEnSea==
StEnSea is a modular high capacity energy storage technology. It's profitability depends on installed units (concrete hollows) per facility (causing [[Economies of scale|scale effects]]), on the realized [[Arbitrage pricing theory|arbitrages]] on the energy market and it depends on the operating hours per year.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As well as on the investment and operation cost.

In the following chart the relevant economic parameters for an economic assessment are pictured. 800 to 1000 full operation cycles per annum are required.

For the operation and management of a storage farm, personal expenditure is based on of 0.5 - 2 staff per storage farm, depending on the farm capacity. Labor costs of 70 k‚Ç¨ per year and member of staff are used for the calculation. The price arbitrage is set to be 6 ‚Ç¨ct per kWh for the economic assessment, resulting from an average electricity purchase price of 2 ‚Ç¨ct per kWh and an average sale price of 8 ‚Ç¨ct kWh. This price arbitrage includes the purchase of other services such as the provision of positive or negative balance power, frequency control or reactive power, all of which are not separately considered in the calculations. Planning and approval costs include costs for the site evaluation (as prerequisite for the permission), power plant certification, as well as the project development and management.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Depending on the number of storage units per farm, the unit specific costs for planning and approval vary in the range from 1,070 mio.‚Ç¨ at 120 units to 1,74 mio.‚Ç¨ at 5 units. Also the annuities depend directly on the number of installed units.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; With 120 units an annuity of 544k‚Ç¨ can be achieved, while only a 232k‚Ç¨ annuity with 5 installed units only is possible.

=== Ecological effects ===
This energy storage solution is not only a chance for the problem of the wind industry in storing energy but is also ecologically harmless. Due to the main components of the construction (primary steal, concrete for the hollow and cables for the connection) the risks for the eco-system are minimal. To avoid sea animals being sucked into the turbine a fine meshed grid is installed. In addition the flow speed of the water rushing into the hollow is kept low.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Media coverage ==
A video post on the public television station ZDF called the hollow concrete balls a ‚Äúpossible solution to store solar and wind energy‚Äù. The gained data helped to understand the project better. For further tests on a bigger scale Christian Dick, also member oft the Fraunhofer IEE team, thinks about constructing a big concrete hollow upon the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/heute-sendungen/stromspeicher-betonkugel-100.html|title=Betonkugeln als Stromspeicher|last=|first=|date=2017-03-27|work=|access-date=2018-06-21|publisher=ZDF heute|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV station ZDF nano produced a documentary about the field study StEnSea in lake ‚ÄúBodensee‚Äù. Christian Dick was cited that ‚Äúthe ball exactly worked like it was supposed to work‚Äù. The most important finding was that an air-connection to the surface is not needed, reducing the technical effort significantly. Project leader Matthias Puchta from Fraunhofer IEE said ‚Äúby pumping out the water we created a nearly total vacuum. Demonstrating that was very exciting, because nobody was able to do that before by using this technology. We showed it works.‚Äù For maintenance and possible technical problems the technology will be located in a cylinder, easy to recover and maintain with a robotic submarine. After all this technology could be ‚Äúa mosaic of our future energy supply".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdf.de/wissen/nano/nano-vom-27-maerz-2017-100.html|title=nano vom 27. M√§rz 2017|last=|first=|date=2017-03-27|work=|access-date=2018-06-21|publisher=ZDF nano|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This opinion was shared by Swiss radio channel SRF as they reported about the project as a ‚Äúpotentially path-breaking experiment‚Äù. Thanks to the successful project in lake ‚ÄúBodensee‚Äù, where energy was fed in a test grid and drawn from it, the team is looking forward into taking the next step: Installing a concrete ball of a diameter 10 times higher than the pilot project (30 meters). Due to Germany's too shallow coastlines the country drops out as a site for further projects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In return the Spanish coastline offers good conditions for a long-term-project. This long-term-project should last between three and five years under real-life conditions and is supposed to gain the data for the subsequent commercialization. This energy storage solution is not only a chance for the problem of the wind industry in storing energy but is also ecologically harmless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.srf.ch/sendungen/info-3/betonkugel-als-zwischenspeicher-fuer-windenergie|title=Betonkugel als Zwischenspeicher f√ºr Windenergie?|last=|first=|date=2017-03-03|work=Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen (SRF)|access-date=2018-06-21|language=de-CH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that the technology of StEnSea could be also interesting for Offshore-Wind-Parks. The economically efficient storage of surplus energy is one of the key tasks for the grid and the energy market, as more and more renewables are taken into the system. Therefore, the technology's role in reorganizing the energy system can be crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/technik/bodensee-strom-laesst-sich-bei-test-in-betonkugel-speichern-a-1137243.html|title=Test im Bodensee gegl√ºckt: Riesige Betonkugel speichert Energie|date=2017-03-03|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of [[e-commerce]] platforms fall into several industry classifications based upon their licensing model, sales scenario and data exchange.

== Types of licensing models ==

=== On-premises e-commerce ===
On-premises e-commerce software usually requires initial one time purchase investment in terms of licensing fees. Also, it implies extra costs related to hardware and installation services as well as data migration and on-going maintenance fees that are usually charged on a yearly basis for software updates and support.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Advantages:
# Easily customizable;
# Data security;
# High performance;

Disadvantages:
# Large initial investment;
# Self-maintenance;
# Technical knowledge

=== Software as a service (SaaS) E-commerce ===
Software as a Service (SaaS)- is a cloud based delivery model in which applications are hosted and managed in a service provider's data center, paid for on a subscription basis and accessed via a browser over an internet connection.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Advantages:
# Affordable low-cost solution;
# Hosted/upgraded by E-commerce provider;
# Easily scalable
# High availability

Disadvantages:
# Limited integration with back-end systems;
# Limited control over the system;

=== Fully Managed (FM) E-commerce ===
Fully Managed (FM) E-commerce - is the next step of [[Platform as a service|Platform as a Service]] (PaaS). As a basis, PaaS consists of e-commerce software and hardware hosting. In addition to this, fully managed e-commerce solutions provide services like product picture taking, image editing, data management, customer support, marketing consulting.{{cn|date=January 2018}} FM E-Commerce is offered to brick-and-mortar stores as a B2B solution to help them start selling online quickly and at low cost. The licensing model is usually based on the sales volume.

=== Open source E-commerce ===
Open source e-Commerce is a free of charge platform that doesn‚Äôt imply licenses fee. Furthermore, open source users are also responsible for installing, maintaining, securing and configuring the software on their own servers. In order to set up an open source platform, basic technical expertise is required in the areas of web design and development.  Software products that are distributed as open source are generally free, and users can access and modify the source code.

Advantages:
# Free of charge system;
# Wide variety of available addons/plugins/extensions;
# Better flexibility with a customizable source code;

Disadvantages:
# More technical knowledge required;
# Performance depends on hosting costs
# No standard integration with back-end system;

'''YDS''' is a [[scheduling algorithm]] for [[Dynamic frequency scaling|dynamic speed scaling processors]] which minimizes the total energy consumption. It was named after and developed by Yao et al.&lt;ref&gt;F.F. Yao, A.J. Demers and S. Shenker. A scheduling model for reduced [[CPU]] energy. Proc. 36th IEEE [[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] , 374‚Äì382, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; There is both an online and an offline version of the algorithm.

==Offline Algorithm==
Definitions:
* There is a set of n Jobs &lt;math&gt;J := J_1, ..., J_n&lt;/math&gt;, where each job &lt;math&gt;J_i&lt;/math&gt; has a release time &lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt;, deadline &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt; and a processing volume &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a certain time interval.
* Also we have &lt;math&gt;\Delta_I = \frac{1}{|I|} \sum_{J_i \in S_I} w_i&lt;/math&gt;, the work density in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;.
* And finally &lt;math&gt;S_I \in J&lt;/math&gt; is the set of Jobs that must be processed in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, that means Jobs with &lt;math&gt;[r_i, d_i] \in I&lt;/math&gt;.

The algorithm then works as follows:
&lt;code&gt;
:While &lt;math&gt;J \neq \{\}&lt;/math&gt;
::Determine the time interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of maximum density &lt;math&gt;\Delta_I&lt;/math&gt;.
::In &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; process the jobs of &lt;math&gt;S_I&lt;/math&gt; at speed &lt;math&gt;\Delta_I&lt;/math&gt; according to [[Earliest_deadline_first_scheduling|EDF]]
::Set &lt;math&gt;J := J \setminus S_I&lt;/math&gt;. 
::Remove &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; from the time horizon and update the release times and deadlines of unscheduled jobs accordingly.
:end While
&lt;/code&gt;

In other terms it's a [[recursive algorithm]] that will follow these steps until all jobs are scheduled:

# Calculate all intensities for all possible combinations of intervals. This means that for every start time and end time combination the intensity of work is calculated. For this the times of all jobs whose arrival time and deadline lie inside the interval are added and divided by the interval length. To speed up the process, only combinations of arrival times and later deadlines need to be considered, as times without arrival of a process or deadline can be shrunk to a smaller interval with the same processes, thus increasing intensity, and negative intervals are invalid. Then the maximum intensity interval is selected. In case of multiple equally intense intervals, one can be chosen at will, as intensities of non-overlapping intervals do not influence each other, and removing a part of an interval will not change the intensity of the rest, as processes are removed proportionally.
# The processes inside this interval are scheduled using Earliest Deadline First, meaning that the job inside this interval whose deadline will arrive soonest is scheduled first, and so on. The jobs are executed at the above calculated intensity to fit all jobs inside the interval.
# The interval is removed from the timeline, as no more calculations can be scheduled here. To simplify further calculations, all arrival times and deadlines of remaining jobs are recalculated to omit already occupied times. For example, assume a job &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with arrival time &lt;math&gt;a_A = 0&lt;/math&gt;, deadline &lt;math&gt;d_A = 10&lt;/math&gt; and a workload &lt;math&gt;w_A = 5&lt;/math&gt;, and a job &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_B = 5&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d_B = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_B = 4&lt;/math&gt;. Assume the previous interval was from time &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;8&lt;/math&gt;. To omit this interval the times of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; need to be adjusted; workloads are unaffected, as no work has been done for either &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;a_A&lt;/math&gt; stays the same, as it's unaffected by later omissions. &lt;math&gt;d_A&lt;/math&gt;, however, needs to be changed to &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;10 - (8 - 3) = 5&lt;/math&gt;. This is the time job &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; has left before its deadline. The arrival time &lt;math&gt;a_B&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;, as it would have been inside the removed interval. &lt;math&gt;d_B&lt;/math&gt; also becomes &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;, as the time left after the removed interval is &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. It is important, however, to remember the actual arrival and deadline times for later assembly of the scheduling.
# Repeat steps 1-3 until all jobs have been scheduled.
# Assemble jobs into final scheduling according to their allotted time intervals. Remember, though, that an interval may be split in two by another interval calculated earlier.

For any Job instance, the algorithm computes an optimal schedule minimizing the total energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Albers
