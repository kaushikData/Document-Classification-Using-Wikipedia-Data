'''Akhter Hameed Khan''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|اختر حمید خان}}}}, pronounced {{IPA-hns|ˈəxt̪ər ɦəˈmiːd̪ ˈxaːn|}}; 15 July 1914 – 9 October 1999) was a Pakistani [[:Category:Development|development practitioner]] and [[social scientist]]. He promoted participatory [[rural development]] in Pakistan and other developing countries, and widely advocated community participation in development. His particular contribution was the establishment of a comprehensive project for rural development, the [[Comilla Model]] (1959). It earned him the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] from the [[Philippines]] and an honorary [[Doctorate of law]] from [[Michigan State University]].

In the 1980s he started a bottom-up [[community development]] initiative of [[Orangi Pilot Project]], based in the outskirts of [[Karachi]], which became a model of participatory development initiatives. He also directed many programmes, from microcredit to self-finance and from housing provision to [[family planning]], for rural communities and urban [[slum]]s. It earned him international recognition and [[Civil decorations of Pakistan|high honours]] in Pakistan. Khan was fluent in at least seven languages and dialects. Apart from many scholarly books and articles, he also published a collection of poems and [[Travel literature|travelogues]] in [[Urdu]].

==Early life==
Khan was born on 15 July 1914 in [[Agra, Uttar Pradesh|Agra]]. He was among the four sons and three daughters of Khansaahib Ameer Ahmed Khan and Mehmoodah Begum.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a [[police inspector]], was inspired by the reformist thinking of [[Syed Ahmed Khan]]. In his early age, Khan's mother introduced him to the poetry of [[Maulana Hali]] and [[Muhammad Iqbal]], the [[sermon]]s of [[Abul Kalam Azad]], and the [[Sufi]]st philosophy of [[Rumi]]. This upbringing influenced his interest in historical as well as contemporary social, economic, and political affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan (1996), pp. xiii–xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan attended Government High School at Jalam ([[Uttar Pradesh]]), and completed his education in 1930 at Agra College where he studied English literature and history. He read English literature, history, and philosophy for a Bachelor of Arts degree at [[Meerut College]] in 1932. At that point, his mother was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. She died in the same year at the age of 36.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), pp. 339–340.&lt;/ref&gt; Khan continued his studies and was awarded a [[Master of Arts]] in English Literature from [[Agra University]] in 1934. He worked as a lecturer at Meerut College before joining the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the ICS training, he was sent to read literature and history at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], England. During the stay, he developed a close friendship with [[Choudhary Rahmat Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest daughter of [[Allama Mashriqi]]) in 1940. Together, they had three daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), pp. 342–43.&lt;/ref&gt; During his ICS career, Khan worked as [[District collector|collector]] of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of [[East Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 347.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bengal famine of 1943]] and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, "I realised that if I did not escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig."&lt;ref&gt;BARD (1983), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, he was influenced by the philosophy of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] and [[Allama Mashriqi|Mashriqi]], and joined the [[Khaksars|Khaksar Movement]]. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to [[Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hussain, I (2006). ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090912183723/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/061224/dmag14.htm "A cause worth serving"]''. ''DAWN Magazine''. 24 December. Retrieved on 22 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Khan, "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.&amp;nbsp;... when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished."&lt;ref&gt;Khan (1996), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next two years, Khan worked in Mamoola village near [[Aligarh]] as a labourer and [[locksmith]], an experience that provided him with firsthand knowledge of the problems and issues of rural communities. In 1947, he took up a teaching position at the [[Jamia Millia Islamia|Jamia Millia, Delhi]], where he worked for three years. In 1950, Khan migrated to [[Pakistan]] to teach at [[Islamia Science College (Karachi)|Islamia College, Karachi]]. In the same year, he was invited by the [[Government of Pakistan]] to take charge as [[Principal (university)|Principal]] of [[Comilla Victoria College]] in [[East Pakistan]], a position he held until 1958. During this time (1950–58) he also served as President of the East Pakistan Non-Government Teachers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural development initiatives==
During his tenure as principal of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed a special interest in [[grassroots]] actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme.&lt;ref&gt;V-AID was a government level attempt to promote citizens participation in the sphere of rural development in East and West Pakistan. It was launched in 1953 with technical assistance from the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited to the training of villagers.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri (1969), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he went to [[Michigan State University]] to acquire education and training in rural development.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Stavis |first = Benedict |date = December 1985 |title = Review |journal = Pacific Affairs |publisher=University of British Columbia |volume = 58 |issue = 4 |pages = 727–728 |doi = 10.2307/2758513 |jstor = 2758513}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, he received a [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary [[Doctorate of law]] by Michigan State University.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), pp. 370–74.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at [[Woodrow Wilson School]], [[Princeton University]], based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with [[Arthur Lewis (economist)|Arthur Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), pp. 350–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to East Pakistan, Khan remained attached to the Comilla Project until 1971 when East Pakistan became Bangladesh. Eventually, Khan moved to Pakistan. PARD was renamed as [[Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development]] (BARD).&lt;ref&gt;Khan spent a significant part of his life in Comilla. His residence was located in the Ranir Dighir Par area of the town, adjacent to Victoria College where he taught for a long time. As a gesture of respect for his contributions to the community, the Comilla-Kotbari road in Bangladesh was named after him.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advisory roles==
Following his move to Pakistan, Khan was asked to implement the Comilla Model in rural settlements of North-West Frontier Province (now [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]), [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], and [[Sindh]]. He declined the offer on the grounds that the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development, such as participatory irrigation management.&lt;ref name="nrsp"&gt;NRSP (2000), pp. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as a research fellow at the [[University of Agriculture, Faisalabad]] from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at [[Karachi University]] from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a visiting professor in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the Rural Development Academy at [[Bogra]] in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, [[Peshawar]], on the Daudzai Integrated Rural Development Programme. He also travelled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant on rural development programmes across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he was appointed as a [[World Bank]] consultant to survey rural development situations in [[Java]], Indonesia. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at [[Lund University]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), pp. 352–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Khan moved to [[Karachi]] and started working on the improvement of sanitary conditions in Karachi suburbs. He laid the foundations of the [[Orangi Pilot Project]] for the largest [[squatter]] community of [[Orangi]] in the city. He remained associated with this project until his death in 1999. Meanwhile, he maintained his support for rural communities around Karachi, and also helped to develop the [[Aga Khan Rural Support Programme]].&lt;ref name="nrsp" /&gt; OPP became a model for participatory bottom-up development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Uphoff, Norman (2001) ''Dr Akhter Hameed Khan: An Appreciation''. Published in Yousaf (2003), pp. 409–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major development programmes==

===Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project===
{{Main|Comilla Model}}

The [[Comilla Model]] (1959) was Khan's initiative in response to the failure of a Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) programme that was launched in 1953 in East and West Pakistan with technical assistance from the US government. V-AID remained a government-level attempt to promote citizen participation in the sphere of [[rural development]].&lt;ref&gt;Bhuiyani, A.H.A. et al. (2005). [http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=293101 Developmentalism as a Disciplinary Strategy in Bangladesh]. ''Modern Asian Studies'' Vol. 39, No. 2. pp. 349–368. Retrieved on 3 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Khan launched the project in 1959 on his return from Michigan, and developed a methodology of implementation in the areas of agricultural and rural development on the principle of grassroots-level participation.&lt;ref&gt;Raper (1970), p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the aim was to provide a development model of programmes and institutions that could be replicated across the country. Advisory support in this respect was provided by experts from Harvard and Michigan State Universities, the [[Ford Foundation]], and [[USAID]].&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), pp. 370–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Practical help was also sought from Japan to improve the local farming techniques.&lt;ref&gt;This helped to raise the annual yield of rice crops from 20 [[maunds]] (about 750&amp;nbsp;kilograms) per acre to 60 maunds (2,240&amp;nbsp;kilograms) per acre (Yousaf 2003, p. 371)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comilla Model simultaneously addressed the problems that were caused by the inadequacy of both local infrastructure and institutions through a range of integrated programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, A.R. (1979). [http://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeewdevel/v_3A7_3Ay_3A1979_3Ai_3A4-5_3Ap_3A397-422.htm The Comilla model and the integrated rural development programme of Bangladesh: An experiment in `cooperative capitalism'].

Retrieved on 6 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives included the establishment of: a training and development centre; a road-drainage embankment works programme; a decentralized, small scale irrigation programme; and, a two-tiered cooperative system with primary cooperatives operating in the villages, and federations operating at [[sub-district]] level.&lt;ref&gt;BARD (1983), Vol. II, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Khan's departure from Comilla, the cooperative's model failed in independent Bangladesh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Karim |first=M.

The model actually fell prey to the ineffective internal and external controls, stagnation, and diversion of funds.&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhury (1990), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the subsequent scholars and practitioners in microfinance, such as [[Muhammad Yunus]] of [[Grameen Bank]] and [[Fazle Hasan Abed]] of [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], to abandon the cooperative approach in favour of more centralised control and service delivery structures. The new strategy targeted the poorest villagers, while excluding the 'less poor'.&lt;ref&gt;Dowla and Barua (2006), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Khan's leadership skills during the course of his association with the project remained a source of inspiration for these leaders, as well as other participatory development initiatives in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Valsan (2005), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tahmina, Q.A.

===Orangi Pilot Project===
{{Main|Orangi Pilot Project}}

The Orangi poverty alleviation project (known as the [[Orangi Pilot Project]], or OPP) was initiated by Khan as an NGO in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;NGO Profile (1995), [http://eau.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/7/2/227 Orangi Pilot Project], ''Environment and Urbanization'', Vol. 7, No. 2. pp. 227–37.

At that time, it was the largest of the city's approximately 650&amp;nbsp;low-income [[squatter]] settlements (known as ''katchi abadi''). The locality was first developed in 1963 as a government township of {{convert|5|km2|acre|0}}. The influx of migrants after the creation of Bangladesh swelled the settlement to about one million people crowded over an area of more than {{convert|32|km2|acre|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;WRI (1996).

Comparing the OPP with Comilla project, Akhter Hameed Khan once commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Orangi Pilot Project was very different from the Comilla Academy. OPP was a private body, dependent for its small fixed budget on another NGO. The vast resources and support of the government, Harvard advisors, MSU, and Ford Foundation was missing. OPP possessed no authority, no sanctions. It may observe and investigate but it could only advise, not enforce.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20090917182312/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/lgrd-division/media/ncrd/intro.html Introduction about Late Dr. Akhter Hameed Khan]'' at [[Government of Pakistan]] website. Retrieved on 22 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The successful OPP model became an inspiration for other municipalities around the country. In 1999, Khan helped to create [[Lodhran]] Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its scope to the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider [[Civic engagement|civic]] co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;Hasan (2002), pp. 199–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of OPP did come at a cost for Dr Khan as his liberal views and self-help initiatives were questioned and criticised by certain interest groups. At two occasions, he was accused of blasphemy.&lt;ref name="serendip" /&gt; However, all allegations against him were acquitted by the courts of law and cleared by independent religious scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGASA330081994/ |title=Pakistan: Use and abuse of the blasphemy laws |date=27 July 1994 |website=Amnesty International |archive-url=https://archive.li/20070901033942/http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGASA330081994/ |archive-date=1 September 2007 |access-date=19 February 2010}} AI Index: ASA 33/008/1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1999, Khan was visiting his family in the United States when he suffered from [[Renal failure|kidney failure]]. He died of [[myocardial infarction]] on 9 October in [[Indianapolis]] at the age of 85. His body was flown to Karachi on 15 October, where he was buried on the grounds of the OPP office compound.&lt;ref&gt;Yousaf (2003), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan's ideology and leadership skills were a source of inspiration for his students and colleagues, and continue to serve as guiding principles even after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Sobhan, R. (2006).

[[File:Cole Thomas The dream of the architect 210 Sun Unedited.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[The Architect's Dream]]'' by Thomas Cole (1840) shows a vision of buildings in the historical styles of the Western tradition, from Ancient Egypt through to Classical Revival]]
An '''architectural style''' is characterized by the features that make a building or other structure notable or historically identifiable. A style may include such elements as [[wikt:form|form]], method of [[construction]], [[building materials]], and regional character. Most [[architecture]] can be classified within a chronology of styles which changes over time reflecting changing fashions, beliefs and religions, or the emergence of new ideas, technology, or materials which make new styles possible.

Styles therefore emerge from the history of a society. They are documented in the subject of [[architectural history]]. At any time several styles may be fashionable, and when a style changes it usually does so gradually, as architects learn and adapt to new ideas. The new style is sometimes only a rebellion against an existing style, such as [[post-modernism]] (meaning "after modernism"), which has in recent years{{Clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} found its own language and split into a number of styles which have acquired other names.

Styles often spread to other places, so that the style at its source continues to develop in new ways while other countries follow with their own twist. For instance, [[Renaissance]] ideas emerged in Italy around 1425 and spread to all of Europe over the next 200 years, with the French, Belgian, German, English, and Spanish Renaissances showing recognisably the same style, but with unique characteristics. A style may also spread through [[colonialism]], either by foreign colonies learning from their home country, or by settlers moving to a new land. One example is the [[Spanish missions in California]], brought by Spanish priests in the late 18th century and built in [[Architecture of the California missions|a unique style]].

After a style has gone out of fashion, revivals and re-interpretations may occur. For instance, [[classicism]] has been revived many times and found new life as [[neoclassicism]]. Each time it is revived, it is different. The Spanish mission style was revived 100 years later as the [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]], and that soon evolved into the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]].

[[Vernacular architecture]] works slightly differently and is listed separately. It is the native method of construction used by local people, usually using labour-intensive methods and local materials, and usually for small structures such as rural cottages. It varies from region to region even within a country, and takes mini account of national styles or technology. As western society has developed, vernacular styles have mostly become outmoded due to new technology and to national building standards.

== History of the concept of architectural style ==
Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]]. Important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continued the debate into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe architectural styles, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting. Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction. A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131-136; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; and a reaction against the emphasis on style developing; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135-136&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mannerism ==
{{Main|Mannerism|Renaissance architecture#Mannerism|Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland}}
[[File:Entrance of Colditz Castle chapel.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The rhyolitic [[tuff]] portal of the "church house" at [[Colditz Castle]], [[Saxony]], designed by Andreas Walther II (1584), is an example of the exuberance of "Antwerp Mannerism".]]
[[File:Ratusz9 zam.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Town Hall of [[Zamość]] by [[Bernardo Morando]].]]
While many architectural styles explore harmonious ideals, Mannerism wants to take style a step further and explores the [[aesthetics]] of hyperbole and exaggeration.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich, E H. The Story of Art London:Phaidon Press Ltd, {{ISBN|0-7148-3247-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mannerism is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerism favours compositional tension and instability rather than balance and clarity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of Mannerism, and the phases within it, continues to be the subject of debate among art historians.

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]]&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281-5&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles. A center of Mannerist design was [[Antwerp]] during its 16th-century boom. Through Antwerp, [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance and Mannerist style]]s were widely introduced in England, Germany, and northern and eastern Europe in general. Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.
During the Mannerist Renaissance period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564), who is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ascom B8050''', usually known by the name '''QuickFare''', is an early example of a passenger-operated railway ticket issuing system, consisting of a series of broadly identical machines installed at British railway stations from 1989 onwards.  The machines allow passengers to buy the most popular types of ticket themselves, without having to go to a booking office, and are therefore useful at unstaffed, partly staffed or busy stations.  All QuickFare machines have now been replaced by more modern technology.

==Origins==
The system had its origins in various rudimentary computer-based systems developed for [[British Rail]] in the early and mid-1980s, both by Ascom Autelca and by other companies.  These were classified by British Rail under the general acronym '''POTIS''' ('''P'''assenger '''O'''perated '''T'''icket '''I'''ssuing '''S'''ystem).
* Ascom Autelca developed the '''Agiticket B100''' in 1983; this was used for a short time at [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]]
* '''Crouzet''' (manufacturers of the ticket machines on the [[Tyne &amp; Wear Metro]], and the system used until recently on the [[Glasgow Subway]]) supplied some machines for trial in 1987
* '''Westinghouse''' did the same in 1987
* '''[[Thorn EMI]]''', makers of the [[APTIS]] and [[PORTIS/SPORTIS]] systems, tried out a passenger-operated equivalent in 1989

[http://railticketsillustrated.digimig.co.uk/c417623.html Illustrations of these early tickets]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

The tickets were printed on simple card stock with no [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] on the reverse - so data was merely printed on the front, not separately encoded as well.

Autelca AG developed the '''B8011''' and '''B8020''' machines from the B100 Agiticket.  A wider range of tickets could be purchased from these: a row of 32 buttons was programmed with various combinations of destination and ticket type (for example, "Child Single to Gatwick Airport" or "Adult Cheap Day Return to Brighton").  Coins were inserted by the passenger after the appropriate button was pressed, and tickets and change were collected from a hatch at the bottom.  A separate button could be pressed to cancel the transaction at any stage.  Many of these features were carried forward to the B8050 machine.

[http://railticketsillustrated.digimig.co.uk/p11386508.html A B8011 ticket]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;br&gt; [http://railticketsillustrated.digimig.co.uk/p14001626.html A B8011 machine, showing many similarities to the B8050]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

The '''B100''' machine was the intermediate stage between the B8011/B8020 (which were essentially identical) and the B8050.  Although most were found in the former [[Network SouthEast]] (NSE) area, a few persisted in urban areas elsewhere in England until around 2000.  Such machines are believed to have been moved from NSE stations when they were supplanted by B8050s, being reprogrammed with different destination and fare information accordingly.

==Introduction of the B8050==
[[File:Ascom B8050 Quickfare Machine at Wareham Station (2006).jpg|thumb|right|A "QuickFare" machine at [[Wareham railway station|Wareham]] in Dorset.  This is the version with a more limited range of destinations, selected from the 40 green buttons in the centre.]]

After the B8050 was developed, it was chosen by the [[Network SouthEast]] sector of [[British Rail]] as the standard self-service ticket issuing system.  There were 2 variants of the B8050 machine which had either 40 or 92 destination buttons. It was decided that a large number of machines should be provided, with almost every station having at least one and major commuter and terminal stations having many.  The following stations, for example, had at least eight separate machines at some point - in some cases, for many years:

{| class="wikitable"

|[[London Victoria station|London Victoria]]

|-
|}

Existing B100 machines at NSE stations were replaced on a rolling basis between 1990 and 1994.  In some cases, usually for a short time only, both types of machine would be in place simultaneously at a given station.

==Details of the machine==
B8050 machines offer a wider range of journey combinations than their predecessors, as they have separate sets of buttons for destinations and ticket types.  A set of machines was produced with 92 destination buttons, arranged in four columns of 23, and 18 ticket type buttons in a single column.  Another set of machines was manufactured with a restricted set of destination buttons (40, in four columns of ten) but the same 18 ticket type buttons.  In all cases, a "Cancel" button is available as well.  Destination buttons are green, while those for the ticket type are yellow and the "Cancel" button is red.

===Ticket Stock===
Tickets are credit card sized with square corners.  They are printed on a continuous roll of ticket stock, which is aligned within the machine by way of a rectangular notch a quarter of the way down each ticket on the left-hand side.  The machine cuts off each individual ticket from the roll after the printing process finishes, after which they drop into a large plastic-fronted hatch at the bottom (along with any change).

The tickets have orange bands at the top and bottom, in common with the stock used for travel tickets in other British railway ticket issuing systems.  In British Rail days, they were identified by batch reference BR 3595/3; this changed to RSP 3595/3 after privatisation, following the creation of [[Rail Settlement Plan|Rail Settlement Plan Ltd]] to administer the ticketing and revenue allocation systems of the post-privatisation rail network.  Machines on the [[South West Trains]] network sometimes use stock with reference RSP 3595/30; a [[Value added tax|VAT]] number is printed on the reverse of these, above the batch reference.

===Destinations===
Before the machine or machines at a given station were installed, an analysis was undertaken of the most popular destinations for tickets bought from that station (or, strictly speaking, tickets issued ''with that station as an origin point'' - encompassing tickets bought at the station's ticket office, if applicable; those issued on trains by conductors using [[PORTIS/SPORTIS|SPORTIS]] machines; and those issued remotely).  It is believed that these statistics were used in conjunction with a more long-term forecast of the most likely destinations passengers would choose, in order to establish a set of destinations to be programmed into the machine.  It was not straightforward to delete, add or change destinations once they had been set: as well as the manual reprogramming required, the station names were displayed to the passenger in the form of sheets of paper pre-printed with the relevant names and aligned (behind clear plastic panels) with the buttons.  These had to be reprinted whenever any details changed.  As a result, it was relatively rare for the range of destinations to change.

At most stations, the range provided was largely appropriate, with all nearby stations and more distant larger places being available.  There was usually a reasonable balance between places served by regular direct train services and more "unusual" locations.  However, this was not always the case: a notable example was [[Portslade railway station|Portslade]], near Brighton, which offered Wimbledon, more than 50 miles and at least one change of train away, but not [[Fishersgate railway station|Fishersgate]] - the next stop.

At many [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] stations north of London ([[West Hampstead railway station#|West Hampstead Thameslink]] to [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]]), the machines were installed with many destinations in the Catford/Bromley South/Orpington areas of south-east London, because at the time these places were served by direct Thameslink services running via the [[Catford Loop Line]].  Soon afterwards, in the early 1990s, the Thameslink service pattern was considerably altered, with services south of London being concentrated on south-west London and Surrey in addition to the [[Brighton Main Line]].  Machines at affected stations were not updated with more appropriate destinations (such as [[Sutton railway station (London)|Sutton]]), and retained the incongruous south-east London destinations until the removal of the machines in late 2006.

All stations in the Network SouthEast area offered the London "[[Station groups|station group]]" and the [[Travelcard|One Day Travelcard]].  Many also featured Gatwick Airport - an important destination throughout the year, with a larger proportion of journeys than usual happening at times such as very early morning or late evening, when booking offices are more likely to be shut.

===Ticket types===
Eighteen "ticket type" buttons were provided on all machines at the time of manufacture, but in most cases a number of those have been left blank and non-functioning, albeit with the ability to be programmed with a "ticket type" if necessary.  Typical combinations available are:
* First Class Adult Day Single
* Standard Class Adult Day Single
* Standard Class Adult Day Return
* Standard Class Child Day Single
* Standard Class Child Day Return
* [[Young Persons Railcard]] holder Day Single
* [[Young Persons Railcard]] holder Day Return
* [[Senior Railcard]] holder Day Single
* [[Senior Railcard]] holder Day Return
* [[Network Railcard]] holder Day Single
* [[Network Railcard]] holder Day Return
* Seven Day Season Ticket (''as mentioned below'')

Machines are time-sensitive.  Thus, all Day Return buttons issue a Cheap Day Return (reduced-fare off-peak ticket) at the appropriate times of day; and tickets with [[Concessionary Fares on the British railway network#Railcards|Railcard]] discounts do not become available until the time from which the Railcard is valid.  Messages concerning the validity or otherwise of tickets appear in a green LCD panel below the "Amount to pay" display.

===Other tickets===
All machines offer Seven Day Season Tickets, printed on separate dedicated ticket stock (batch reference BR 3595/4, and later RSP 3595/4) with dark green upper and lower bands, a white box in which "SEASON" or "TRAVELCARD" would be printed by the machine, and an area for the passenger's [[Travelcard#Photocards|Photocard number]] to be entered manually.  Because the machines take cash only and Season Tickets are expensive compared to ordinary travel tickets, it is relatively unusual to see an issued Season Ticket.

In addition, some machines have buttons (usually in the "destinations" section) for one or more of the following:
* Daily and/or Weekly Car Park tickets
* [[Platform ticket]]s (''rare, and mostly in the early years'')
* The Greater Manchester Rail Ranger, a one-day multi-journey ticket for use in the [[Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive|GMPTE]] area (''at Manchester area machines'') [http://railticketsillustrated.digimig.co.uk/p8264231.html]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

Receipts are not issued in any format.

===Remaining Machines===
There are very few Ascom B8050 QuickFare machines left on the National Rail network. There are at least three machines still in use by [[Island Line Trains]], on the [[Isle of Wight]], at [[Ryde Pier Head railway station|Ryde Pier Head]], [[Ryde Esplanade railway station|Ryde Esplanade]] and [[Shanklin railway station|Shanklin]]. One at the back entrance to [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street station]], that had been out-of-use for at least a year, was eventually removed February 2009.

'''''bit-tech''''' is an [[online magazine]] for computer hardware enthusiasts, gamers and case modders, based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It was founded in 2000, became a fully professional online publication in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Wil. [http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2005/06/03/bit_tech_giant_leap/1 bit-tech takes a giant leap], bit-tech.net, 3 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emeran, Riyad [http://www.trustedreviews.com/home/news/2005/06/01/TrustedReviews-and-Bit-Tech-Get-It-Together/p1 TrustedReviews and bit-tech Get It Together], TrustedReviews, 1 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and announced its acquisition by [[Dennis Publishing]] in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Smalley [http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2008/10/20/dennis-publishing-acquires-bit-tech/1], bit-tech.net, 20 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Publishing then partnered the site with existing monthly publication [[Custom PC]] magazine, making Bit-Tech the online version of the magazine. At this point the two editorial teams were totally integrated. However, due to a restructure in January 2012 the website and magazine now have separate editors again, although several of the writers still contribute material to both publications. It is now owned by The Media Team.

The website caters specifically for the computer hardware enthusiast market, providing [[reviews]] and [[Article (publishing)|articles]] on higher end hardware and games. Bit-Tech is also prominent in the [[Case modding|custom case modding]] scene, providing a focus point for professional and amateur case modders.  Much of the site’s content and writing style revolve around this particular reader-base, and its regular readers have been responsible for some of the most well known case mods, such as Orac3 and the Blackmesa HL2 mod.

==History==
Originally bit-tech.net was designed to be a small site where people who were interested in [[case modding]] could see new ideas from the team and discuss them in the forums, due to the relatively small presence of modding at the time.

It has since diversified and, along with the trend-setting case mods, bit-tech now also features detailed reviews of [[computer hardware]] and [[video game]]s, industry news and editorials. There is now increased coverage of console games, though PC games are still the major focus.

[[Wil Harris]] was Editor-in-Chief of bit-tech for almost six years and in February 2007, he announced that he was stepping down&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Wil. [http://www.bit-tech.net/news/2007/02/09/changing_times_at_bit-tech/1 Changing times at bit-tech], bit-tech.net, 9 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/en/inquirer/news/2007/02/08/bit-tech-supremo-steps-down-shockaat Bit-tech supremo steps down, shocka]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, The Inquirer, 8 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the end of March 2007 to move onto a fresh challenge. At the time, Wil's successor was not announced and it was not until April 2007&lt;ref&gt;Smalley, Tim. [http://www.bit-tech.net/columns/2007/04/06/bit-tech_the_next_generation/1 Bit-tech: The Next Generation], bit-tech.net, 6 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that Tim Smalley announced that he would be taking over as Editor with immediate effect. After Tim had successfully led the site to acquisition by Dennis Publishing in October 2008, he integrated it into the new owner's technology portfolio and then stood down as Editor in April 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/blog/2010/04/08/and-it-s-goodbye-from-me/ And It's Goodbye From Me] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106223945/http://www.bit-tech.net/blog/2010/04/08/and-it-s-goodbye-from-me/ |date=6 November 2016 }}, Tim Smalley, bit-tech.net 8 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; after launching a new consumer technology website at Dennis, [http://www.expertreviews.co.uk Expert Reviews], at the start of the year. Alex Watson took over as bit-tech's Editor with immediate effect and was replaced by former deputy editor of Custom PC James Gorbold in December 2010. In January 2012, Dennis publishing restructured the editorial team and Simon Brew took on the role of managing editor of the site. In February 2013, Simon Brew stepped down and Dennis publishing appointed Edward Chester as Editor.

In April 2014 bit-tech was acquired by David Ross, who operates HEXUS and BOXFX as brands.

==Modding Content==
''bit-tech'' first became widely known for its community of PC case modders who would re-shape and decorate PC hardware into a variety of more creative forms. Although the site has since expanded to include hardware and games reviews, it still runs regular modding coverage including the very popular Mod of the Month and Mod of the Year competitions and regular project articles. In 2012, ''bit-tech'' launched the Case Mod Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2012/01/24/bit-tech-case-mod-index/1]&lt;/ref&gt; - an ever-growing database of computer mods, sorted by case manufacturers such as Cooler Master or SilverStone. You're able to see all computer mods based on a specific case, as well as browse dozens of completed projects.

''bit-tech'' has been host to some of the most popular and striking mods on the Internet, including the BlackMesa Mod&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2004/05/25/blackmesa/1 BlackMesa Mod]&lt;/ref&gt; (currently on show at [[Valve]]), Cygnus X1,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/case-mod/2009/12/14/cygnus-x1-by-attila-lukacs-oldnewby/1]&lt;/ref&gt;  Anemone Mod,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=45895 |title=Anemone Mod |access-date=2 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185151/http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=45895 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Macro Black&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2005/09/01/macro_black/1 Macro Black]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lian-Li GOO Mod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/modding/2002/06/23/lian_li_goo_style/7 GOO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Games Reviews==
''bit-tech'' uses an arguably more in-depth review model than many other review sites and has a strong focus on PC titles, though console and handheld reviews are increasingly common. Video game reviews do not just provide a commentary of gameplay but also include graphical analysis and a breakdown of how the game will look on different hardware. This review model means that video game reviews are typically much longer than reviews from other sites, though console reviews are a more traditional length.

''bit-tech'' employs a percentage scoring system with 'Approved' and 'Premium' awards. Unlike many review sites, ''bit-tech'' uses the full range of this scale and scores poor games harshly, with 50% used to represent average games. While the writing style of the site often leans towards [[New Games Journalism]], this has mostly been downplayed since the site was bought by Dennis Publishing and the current writing style is similar to that of partnered magazine, [[Custom PC Magazine]] as the site and magazine are written by the same editorial team.

Recently the site has moved to embrace the [[indie games]] community and has run several features exploring and supporting this side of the PC industry. Several prominent independent developers, including [[Introversion Software]] and writers from [[Free Radical Design]] have written columns for the site which explore a number of issues in and around the games industry.

In 2011 bit-tech's games section was rebranded as [[bit-gamer]] and now sits alongside the main site as a separate games website.

She retired from NASA in September 2005 then served as president and CEO of [[Museum of Flight|The Museum of Flight]] until April 2010. From January 2013 - December 2015, Dr. Dunbar lead the University of Houston's STEM Center (science, technology, engineering and math) and was a faculty member in the Cullen College of Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/news-events/stories/2013/january/01242013DunbarSTEM|title=Retired Astronaut, Engineer Bonnie Dunbar to Lead UH STEM Center|website=www.uh.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, she is a professor of aerospace engineering at Texas A&amp;M University and serves as Director of the Institute for Engineering Education and Innovation (IEEI), a joint entity in the Texas A&amp;M Engineering Experiment Station (TEES) and the Dwight Look College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University.

==Early life==
Dunbar was born in [[Sunnyside, Washington]].  In 1967, she graduated from Sunnyside High School, Sunnyside, Washington. Following graduation in 1971 from the University of Washington, Dunbar worked for Boeing Computer Services for two years as a systems analyst. From 1973 to 1975, she conducted research for her master's thesis in the field of [[mechanism (science)|mechanisms]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] of [[ionic diffusion]] in [[sodium beta-alumina]]. She is a member of [[Kappa Delta]] Sorority.

In 1975, she was invited to participate in research at the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]], Harwell near [[Oxford, England]], as a visiting scientist. Her work there involved the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates. Following her work in England, she accepted a senior research engineer position with Rockwell International Space Division in [[Downey, California]]. Her responsibilities there included developing equipment and processes for the manufacture of the [[Space Shuttle]] thermal protection system in [[Palmdale, California]]. She also represented Rockwell International as a member of the [[Dr. Kraft Ehricke]] evaluation committee on prospective space industrialization concepts. Dunbar completed her doctorate at the [[University of Houston]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. Her multi-disciplinary dissertation ([[materials science]] and [[physiology]]) involved evaluating the effects of simulated space flight on bone strength and fracture toughness. These results were correlated to alterations in hormonal and metabolic activity. Dr. Dunbar has served as an adjunct assistant professor in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Houston.

Dunbar is a private pilot with over 200 hours in single engine land aircraft, has logged more than 700 hours flying time in [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] jets as a back-seater, and has over 100 hours as co-pilot in a [[Cessna Citation]] jet. She was married to fellow astronaut [[Ronald M. Sega]].&lt;ref name="expedition16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/cs-080408-expedition16-spaceflight-family.html|title=For New Station Commander, Spaceflight is All in the Family|accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA career==
Dunbar accepted a position as a payload officer/[[flight controller]] at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] in 1978. She served as a [[Flight controller|guidance and navigation officer/flight controller]] for the [[Skylab]] reentry mission in 1979 and was subsequently designated project officer/payload officer for the integration of several Space Shuttle payloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/dunbar.html|title=Astronaut Bio: Bonnie Dunbar (9/2005)|website=www.jsc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de//bios/astronauts/english/dunbar_bonnie.htm|title=Astronaut Biography: Bonnie Dunbar|first=Joachim|last=Becker|website=www.spacefacts.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunbar became a [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] in August 1981. Her technical assignments have included assisting in the verification of Shuttle flight software at the [[Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory]] (SAIL), serving as a member of the Flight Crew Equipment Control Board, participation as a member of the Astronaut Office Science Support Group, supporting operational development of the remote manipulator system (RMS). She has served as chief of the Mission Development Branch, as the Astronaut Office interface for "secondary" payloads, and as lead for the Science Support Group. In 1993, Dr. Dunbar served as Deputy Associate Administrator, Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences, NASA Headquarters, [[Washington, D.C.]] In February 1994, she traveled to Star City, Russia, where she spent 13-months training as a back-up crew member for a 3-month flight on the Russian Space Station, [[Mir]]. In March 1995, she was certified by the Russian Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center as qualified to fly on long duration Mir Space Station flights. From October 1995 to November 1996, she was detailed to the NASA JSC Mission Operations Directorate as Assistant Director where she was responsible for chairing the [[International Space Station]] Training Readiness Reviews, and facilitating Russian/American operations and training strategies.

A veteran of five space flights, Dunbar has logged more than 1,208 hours (50 days) in space. She served as a mission specialist on [[STS-61-A]] in 1985, [[STS-32]] in 1990, and [[STS-71]] in 1995, and was the Payload Commander on [[STS-50]] in 1992, and [[STS-89]] in 1998.

==Spaceflight experience==
[[STS-61-A]] ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (October 30-November 6, 1985), was the West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, the largest to fly in space, and was also the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials science, biology, and navigation. During the flight, Dunbar was responsible for operating [[Spacelab]] and its subsystems and performing a variety of experiments. Her mission training included six months of experiment training in Germany, France, Switzerland, and The Netherlands. STS-61-A launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]], and returned to land at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], [[California]]. Mission duration was 7 days, 44 minutes 51 seconds, traveling 2.5 million miles in 111 orbits of the [[Earth]].

[[STS-32]] ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'' (January 9–20, 1990), launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to a night landing at Edwards Air Base in California. During the flight, the crew successfully deployed the Syncom IV-F5 satellite, and retrieved the 21,400-pound Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) using the RMS. They also operated a variety of middeck experiments including the Microgravity Disturbance Experiment (MDE) using the Fluids Experiment Apparatus (FEA), Protein Crystal Growth (PCG), American Flight Echocardiograph (AFE), Latitude/Longitude Locator (L3), Mesoscale Lightning Experiment (MLE), Characterization of Neurospora Circadian Rhythms (CNCR), and the IMAX Camera.  Dunbar was principal investigator for the MDE/FEA Experiment. Additionally, numerous medical test objectives, including in-flight lower body negative pressure (LBNP), in-flight aerobic exercise and muscle performance were conducted to evaluate human adaptation to extended duration missions. Mission duration was 10 days, 21 hours, 01 minute, 38 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 173 orbits of the Earth.

[[STS-50]] ''Columbia'' (June 25 to July 9, 1992).  Dunbar was the Payload Commander on STS-50, the United States Microgravity Lab-1 mission which was dedicated to microgravity fluid physics and materials science. Over 30 experiments sponsored by over 100 investigators were housed in the Spacelab in the Shuttle's Payload Bay. A payload crew of four operated around-the-clock for 13 days performing experiments in scientific disciplines such as protein crystal growth, electronic and infrared detector crystal growth, surface tension physics, zeolite crystal growth, and human physiology. Mission duration was 13 days, 19 hours, 30 minutes and 4 seconds, traveling 5.7 million miles in 221 orbits of the Earth.

[[STS-71]] ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' (June 27 to July 7, 1995), was the first [[Space Shuttle]] mission to dock with the Russian Space Station Mir, and involved an exchange of crews. The ''Atlantis'' was modified to carry a docking system compatible with the Russian Mir Space Station.  Dunbar served as MS-3 on this flight which also carried a Spacelab module in the payload bay in which the crew performed medical evaluations on the returning Mir crew. These evaluations included ascertaining the effects of weightlessness on the cardio/vascular system, the bone/muscle system, the immune system, and the cardio/pulmonary system. Mission duration was 9 days, 19 hours, 23 minutes and 8 seconds, traveling 4.1 million miles in 153 orbits of the earth.

[[STS-89]] ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' (January 22–31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'' to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered [[Andy Thomas]] to Mir and returned with [[David Wolf (astronaut)|David Wolf]]. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth.

LoJack Corporation was founded in 1986 in [[Medfield, Massachusetts]], by William Reagan, a former Medfield police commissioner.&lt;ref name=twice1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twice.com/industry/lojack-founder-william-reagan-78-passes-away-7983 |title=LoJack Founder William Reagan, 78, Passes Away|website=twice.com |date=2013-07-08 |accessdate=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reagan had patented the LoJack system in 1979, and chose its name to imply the opposite of "hijack". The system used a hidden car-mounted transceiver, and a tracking computer installed in police cars and aircraft, operating on a dedicated tracking frequency set aside by the Federal Communications Commission. Reagan served as the company's first CEO and Chairman.&lt;ref name=twice1/&gt;

In 1998, the company began offering its tracking system to the heavy machinery and construction industry, including entering into an agreement with [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/lojack-corporation-history/|title=LoJack Corporation History|website=fundinguniverse.com|date= |accessdate=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''chip heater''' is a single point, tankless, domestic [[Water heating|hot water]] system popular in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] from the 1880s until the 1960s. Examples of this form of domestic water heating are still in current use.

The chip heater consisted of a cylindrical unit with a [[Firebox (steam engine)|fire box]] and [[flue]], through which a water pipe was run. Water was drawn from a cold water tank and circulated through the fire box. When heated, the water was drawn off to the area where it was used, typically in a bath or shower. There often was an ash box under the fire box, which allowed air under the fire, as well as various [[Damper (flow)|dampers]] in the flue.

The fire box was relatively small and fed by [[tinder]], such as newspaper, [[Conifer cone|pine cones]], small twigs or chips from a wood heap. The use of "chips" from the wood pile gave the chip heater its name.

Water had to be run at a trickle in order to heat up to a desirable temperature. The rate of combustion was controlled by the flues and the ash box. With lots of fuel and open flues the water could boil quickly, which was not a desirable result. With practice the correct combination of fuel, flue settings and water flow could result in enough hot water for a shower or bath in approximately 20 minutes.

==History==
The chip heater is embedded in Australian and New Zealand [[social history]] as many people can remember using one or someone who had one. The precise history of the chip heater is unclear.

The original idea surely must be derived from vertical steam boilers. [[Miles Lewis]] notes that the "instantaneous water heaters," which were being sold by Douglas &amp; Sons of Melbourne by 1888 were probably chip heaters. In 1892, an advertisement in Melbourne promised that Fischer's Patent Bath Heater could be heated with wood in three minutes at the cost of one [[Farthing (British coin)|farthing]].

Catalogs from the [[National Radiator Company Limited|National Radiator Company]] between 1913 and 1919, which were marketed in Australia, do not show chip heaters. This suggests that the chip heater was a local innovation.

==Variants==
The chip heater was very similar to the gas and [[kerosene]] powered “geyser” hot water heaters popular in Australian suburban residences from the 1920s. The main difference was the fuel source. The Australian producer [[Metters Limited]] supplied gas geysers for city clients (who had access to gas) and chip heaters for country clients.

==Manufacturers==
There were a number of manufacturers and brands. According to Professor Miles Lewis, the early twentieth century brands included the Royal, Little Hero, Silver Ace, Kangaroo, Empire and Little Wonder. Peter Wood recalls a “Torrens” brand being popular in Adelaide.

Metters had a variety of chip heaters in its 1936 catalog, including oil and kerosene-powered chip heaters. Metters claimed a flow of 2 gallons of “very hot water” per minute.

[[File:US Navy 040616-N-4973G-031 Disbursing Clerk 2nd Class Danielle King of Newport News, Va., electronically counts money in the disbursing office aboard USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74).jpg|thumb|A U.S. Navy Disbursing Clerk using a [[Cummins Allison]] JetScan to count [[United States twenty-dollar bill]]s.]]
A '''currency-counting machine''' is a [[machine]] that counts [[money]]—either stacks of [[banknote]]s or loose collections of [[coin]]s. Counters may be purely mechanical or use electronic components. The machines typically provide a total count of all money, or count off specific batch sizes for wrapping and storage.

Currency counters are commonly used in [[vending machines]] to determine what amount of money has been deposited by customers.

In some modern [[automated teller machine]]s, currency counters allow for [[cash]] [[deposit account|deposit]]s without [[envelope]]s, since they can identify which bills have been inserted instead of just how many. The [[End-user|user]] is given the chance to review the automatic counter's idea of the quantity and kinds of the inserted banknotes before the deposit is complete.

== Banknote-only counters ==
Basic [[banknote counter]]s provide a total count of the notes in the supply hopper. More advanced counters can identify different bill denominations to provide a total currency value of mixed banknotes, including those that are upside down. Some banknote counters can also detect [[counterfeit money|counterfeit]] bills either magnetically and/or using [[blacklight]]. Blacklight (UV) based detectors exploit the fact that in many countries, real banknotes have fluorescent symbols on them that only show under a black light. Also, the paper used for printing money does not contain any of the brightening agents which make commercially available papers fluoresce under black light. Both features make counterfeit notes both easier to detect and more difficult to successfully produce.

A stack of bills are placed in a compartment of the machine, and then one bill at a time is mechanically pulled through the machine.  By counting the number of times a beam of light is interrupted, the machine can count the bills.  By comparing an image of each bill to [[pattern recognition]] criteria, the machine can figure out the denominations of the bills and how much genuine money was placed in the compartment.

==Banknote and coin counters==

Fully electronic counters that are able to count batches of notes or of coins without having to process them individually, were introduced in Great Britain in 1980 and are now widely used by banks, retailers and food service outlets in many parts of the world. They are faster and more versatile than the traditional notes-only &amp; coins-only equipments, but cannot detect counterfeits.

== Coin sorter ==
A coin sorter is a device which sorts a random collection of coins into separate bins for various denominations. Coin sorters are typically specific to the currency of certain countries due to different currencies often issuing similarly sized coins of different value. A sorter usually makes no attempt at counting, providing only collections of uncounted coins to be separately passed through a counter.

== Coin counter ==
The phrase ''coin counter'' may refer to a device which both sorts and counts coins at the same time, or only counts presorted coins that are all the same size..

A typical counter of presorted coins uses a bowl with flat spinning disc at the bottom to distribute coins around the bowl perimeter. An opening in the edge of the bowl is only wide enough to accept one coin at a time. Coins either pass through a light-beam counter, or are pushed through a spring-loaded cam that only accepts one coin at a time.

==Invention==
The first ever recorded currency-counting machine was invented in 1958 in China, created by a small-time banker Zhi Tian Sie, who entered it in a contest. He won 3rd place. Zhi died at the age of 30 and his model was lost until recently rediscovered by the EPR when tearing down his home.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10734">In [[semiconductor physics]], the [[band gap]] of a [[semiconductor]] is of two types, a '''direct band gap''' or an '''indirect band gap'''.   The minimal-energy state in the [[conduction band]] and the maximal-energy state in the [[valence band]] are each characterized by a certain [[crystal momentum]] (k-vector) in the [[Brillouin zone]]. If the k-vectors are the same, it is called a "direct gap". If they are different, it is called an "indirect gap". The band gap is called "direct" if the [[crystal momentum]] of electrons and holes is the same in both the [[conduction band]] and the [[valence band]]; an electron can directly emit a photon. In an "indirect" gap, a photon cannot be emitted because the electron must pass through an intermediate state and transfer momentum to the crystal lattice. 

Examples of direct bandgap material includes some III-V materials such as [[InAs]], [[GaAs]]. Indirect bandgap materials include [[Silicon|Si]], [[Germanium|Ge]]. Some III-V materials are indirect bandgap as well, for example [[AlSb]].

==Implications for radiative recombination==
{{see also|Radiative recombination}}

Interactions among [[electron]]s, [[electron hole|holes]], [[phonon]]s, [[photon]]s, and other particles are required to satisfy [[conservation of energy]] and [[crystal momentum]] (i.e., conservation of total k-vector). A photon with an energy near a semiconductor band gap has almost zero momentum. One important process is called [[radiative recombination]], where an electron in the conduction band annihilates a hole in the valence band, releasing the excess energy as a photon. This is possible in a direct band gap semiconductor if the electron has a k-vector near the conduction band minima (the hole will share the same k-vector), but not possible in an indirect band gap semiconductor, as photons cannot carry crystal momentum, and thus conservation of crystal momentum would be violated. For radiative recombination to occur in an indirect band gap material, the process must also involve the absorption or emission of a [[phonon]], where the phonon momentum equals the difference between the electron and hole momentum. (It can also, instead, involve a [[crystallographic defect]], which performs essentially the same role.) The involvement of the phonon makes this process much less likely to occur in a given span of time, which is why ''radiative recombination is far slower in indirect band gap materials than direct band gap ones''. This is why [[Light-emitting diode|light-emitting]] and [[laser diode]]s are almost always made of direct band gap materials, and not indirect band gap ones like [[silicon]].

The fact that radiative recombination is slow in indirect band gap materials also means that, under most circumstances, radiative recombinations will be a small proportion of total recombinations, with most recombinations being non-radiative, taking place at point defects or at grain boundaries. However, if the excited electrons are prevented from reaching these recombination places, they have no choice but to eventually fall back into the valence band by radiative recombination. This can be done by creating a [[dislocation]] loop in the material. At the edge of the loop, the planes above and beneath the "dislocation disk" are pulled apart, creating a negative pressure, which raises the energy of the conduction band substantially, with the result that the electrons cannot pass this edge. Provided that the area directly above the dislocation loop is defect-free (no non-radiative recombination possible), the electrons will fall back into the valence shell by radiative recombination, thus emitting light. This is the principle on which "DELEDs" (Dislocation Engineered LEDs) are based.

==Implications for light absorption==

The exact reverse of radiative recombination is light absorption. For the same reason as above, light with a photon energy close to the band gap can penetrate much farther before being absorbed in an indirect band gap material than a direct band gap one (at least insofar as the light absorption is due to exciting electrons across the band gap).

This fact is very important for [[photovoltaics]] (solar cells). Silicon is the most common solar-cell material, despite the fact that it is indirect-gap and therefore does not absorb light very well. Silicon solar cells are typically hundreds of [[micron]]s thick; if it was much thinner, much of the light (particularly in the infrared) would simply pass through. By comparison, [[thin-film solar cell]]s are made of direct band gap materials (such as [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] or [[CZTS]]), which absorb the light in a much thinner region, and consequently can be made with a very thin active layer (often less than 1 micron thick).

The absorption spectrum of an indirect band gap material usually depends more on temperature than that of a direct material, because at low temperatures there are fewer phonons, and therefore it is less likely that a photon and phonon can be simultaneously absorbed to create an indirect transition. For example, silicon is opaque to visible light at room temperature, but transparent to red light at [[liquid helium]] temperatures, because red photons can only be absorbed in an indirect transition.

===Formulae for absorption===

A common and simple method for determining whether a band gap is direct or indirect uses [[absorption spectroscopy]]. By plotting certain powers of the [[absorption coefficient]] against photon energy, one can normally tell both what value the band gap has, and whether or not it is direct.

For a direct band gap, the [[absorption coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is related to light frequency according to the following formula:&lt;ref&gt;''Optoelectronics'', by E. Rosencher, 2002, equation (7.25).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pankove has the same equation, but with an apparently different prefactor &lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt;. However, in the Pankove version, the units / dimensional analysis appears not to work out.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx A^*\sqrt{h\nu - E_{\text{g}}}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;A^*=\frac{q^2 x_{vc}^2 (2m_{\text{r}})^{3/2}}{\lambda_0 \epsilon_0 \hbar^3 n}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absorption coefficient]], a function of light frequency
*&lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is light frequency
*&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is [[Planck's constant]] (&lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of a [[photon]] with frequency &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is [[reduced Planck's constant]] (&lt;math&gt;\hbar=h/2\pi&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{g}}&lt;/math&gt; is the band gap energy
*&lt;math&gt;A^*&lt;/math&gt; is a certain frequency-independent constant, with formula above
*&lt;math&gt;m_{\text{r}}=\frac{m_{\text{h}}^* m_{\text{e}}^*}{m_{\text{h}}^* + m_{\text{e}}^*}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{e}}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_{\text{h}}^*&lt;/math&gt; are the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]es of the electron and hole, respectively (&lt;math&gt;m_{\text{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is called a "[[reduced mass]]")
*&lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the [[elementary charge]]
*&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the (real) [[index of refraction]]
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]]
*&lt;math&gt;x_{vc}&lt;/math&gt; is a "matrix element", with units of length and typical value the same order of magnitude as the [[lattice constant]].

This formula is valid only for light with photon energy larger, but not too much larger, than the band gap (more specifically, this formula assumes the bands are approximately parabolic), and ignores all other sources of absorption other than the band-to-band absorption in question, as well as the electrical attraction between the newly created electron and hole (see [[exciton]]). It is also invalid in the case that the direct transition is [[forbidden transition|forbidden]], or in the case that many of the valence band states are empty or conduction band states are full.&lt;ref name=Pankove&gt;J.I. Pankove, ''Optical Processes in Semiconductors''. Dover, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, for an indirect band gap, the formula is:&lt;ref name=Pankove/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \propto \frac{(h\nu-E_{\text{g}}+E_{\text{p}})^2}{\exp(\frac{E_{\text{p}}}{kT})-1} + \frac{(h\nu-E_{\text{g}}-E_{\text{p}})^2}{1-\exp(-\frac{E_{\text{p}}}{kT})}&lt;/math&gt;
where:
*&lt;math&gt;E_{\text{p}}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy of the [[phonon]] that assists in the transition
*&lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]]
*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermodynamic temperature]]

(This formula involves the same approximations mentioned above.)

Therefore, if a plot of &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;\alpha^2&lt;/math&gt; forms a straight line, it can normally be inferred that there is a direct band gap, measurable by extrapolating the straight line to the &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt; axis. On the other hand, if a plot of &lt;math&gt;h\nu&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt; forms a straight line, it can normally be inferred that there is an indirect band gap, measurable by extrapolating the straight line to the &lt;math&gt;\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt; axis (assuming &lt;math&gt;E_{\text{p}}\approx 0&lt;/math&gt;).

==Other aspects==

In some materials with an indirect gap, the value of the gap is negative. The top of the valence band is higher than the bottom of the conduction band in energy. Such materials are known as [[semimetal]]s.

'''Electrolier''' was the name for a fixture, usually pendent from the ceiling, for holding electric [[Lamp (fixture)|lamp]]s. The word is analogous to [[chandelier]], from which it was formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Electrolier |volume=9 |page=217 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a fine poetical if somewhat confusing description of such a lamp in a Metropolitan Railway ("Early Electric") station dining room, see Sir John Betjeman's poem "The Metropolitan Railway - Baker Street Station Buffet" from his collection "A Few Late Chrysanthemums" (1954): 
"Early Electric! With what radiant hope / Men formed this many-branched '''electrolier''', / Twisted the flex around the iron rope / And let the dazzling vacuum globes hang clear, / And then with hearts the rich contrivance fill’d / Of copper, beaten by the Bromsgrove Guild."

{{merge|Fragrance extraction|date=February 2018}}
An '''extract''' is a substance made by [[extraction (chemistry)|extracting]] a part of a [[raw material]], often by using a [[solvent]] such as [[ethanol]] or [[water]].  Extracts may be sold as [[tincture]]s, [[Absolute (perfumery)|absolutes]] or in powder form.

The [[Aroma compound|aromatic principles]] of many spices, nuts, herbs, fruits, etc., and some flowers, are marketed as extracts, among the best known of true extracts being [[almond]], [[cinnamon]], [[cloves]], [[ginger]], [[lemon]], [[nutmeg]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[peppermint]], [[pistachio]], [[rose]], [[spearmint]], [[vanilla]], [[Violet (plant)|violet]], and [[wintergreen]].

==Extraction techniques==
The majority of natural essences are obtained by extracting the [[essential oil]] from the [[blossoms]], fruit, roots, etc., or the whole plants, through four techniques:

* [[Fruit press|Expression]] when the oil is very plentiful and easily obtained, as in lemon peel.
* [[Steeping|Absorption]] is generally accomplished by steeping in alcohol, as vanilla beans.
* [[Maceration (food)|Maceration]] is used to create smaller bits of the whole, as in making peppermint extract, etc.
* [[Distillation]] is used with maceration, but in many cases, it requires expert chemical knowledge and the erection of costly stills.

The distinctive flavors of nearly all fruits, in the popular acceptance of the word, are desirable adjuncts to many food preparations, but only a few are practical sources of sufficiently concentrated flavor extract. The most important among those that lend themselves to "pure" extract manufacture include lemons, oranges, and vanilla beans.
[[File:Ghazan. Extraction pot.JPG|thumb|Traditional extraction pot in Iran]]

==Artificial extracts==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The majority of concentrated fruit flavors such as banana, cherry, peach, pineapple, raspberry and strawberry, are produced by combining a variety of [[ester]]s with special oils. The desired colors are generally obtained by the use of [[dye]]s. Among the esters most generally employed are [[ethyl acetate]] and [[ethyl butyrate]]. The chief factors in the production of artificial banana, pineapple, and strawberry extract are [[amyl acetate]] and [[amyl butyrate]].

Artificial extracts generally do not possess the delicacy of natural fruit flavor, but usually taste sufficiently similar to be useful when true essences are unobtainable or too expensive.

'''Extraordinary magnetoresistance''' (EMR) is a geometrical [[magnetoresistance]] effect discovered in 2000, where the change in electrical resistance upon the application of a large magnetic field can be greater than 1,000,000% at room temperature (orders of magnitude greater than other magnetoresistance effects such as [[Giant magnetoresistance|GMR]] and [[Colossal magnetoresistance|CMR]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first1=S.

Without a magnetic field the system is in a low-resistance state with most of the current flow directed through the metallic region. Upon the application of a large magnetic field the system switches to a state of much higher electrical resistance, due to the [[Hall effect|Hall angle]] approaching 90°, with the current flow inside the metallic region dramatically reduced. The effect is influenced greatly by the system geometry, with an enhancement of over four orders of magnitude shown to be possible with an alternative branched geometry.&lt;ref&gt;T. H. Hewett and F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7794">A '''field-programmable object array''' ('''FPOA''') is a class of programmable logic device designed to be modified or programmed after manufacturing. They are designed to bridge the gap between ASIC and FPGA. They contain a grid of programmable silicon objects. Arrix range of FPOA contained three types of silicon objects [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic logic units]] (ALUs), [[Register file|register files]] (RFs) and [[Multiply–accumulate operation|multiply-and-accumulate]] units (MACs). Both the objects and interconnects are [[Programmable logic device|programmable]].

==Motivation and history==
The device was intended{{By whom|date=September 2018}} to bridge the gap between [[Field-programmable gate array|field-programmable gate arrays]] (FPGAs) and [[Application-specific integrated circuit|application-specific integrated circuits]] (ASICs). The design goal was to combine the [[Reconfigurable computing|programmability]] of FPGAs and the performance of ASICs. FPGAs, although programmable, lack performance; they may only be [[Clock rate|clocked]] to few hundreds of [[megahertz]] and most FPGAs operated below 100&amp;nbsp;MHz.{{When|date=October 2018}}  FPGAs did not offer deterministic timing and the maximum operating frequency depends on the design. ASICs offered good performance but they could not be modified and they were very costly. The FPOA had a programmable architecture deterministic timing and gigahertz performance. The FPOA was designed by Douglas Pihl who had this idea when working on a [[DARPA]] funded project.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.edn.com/design/test-and-measurement/4379581/Computational-vision-Testing-MathStar-s-field-programmable-object-arrays "Computational vision: Testing MathStar’s field-programmable object arrays"]. EDN Networks,August 14, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[MathStar]] in 1997 to manufacture FPOAs and the idea was [[Patent|patented]] in 2004. The first FPOA prototypes were made in 2005 and first batch of FPOA chips were [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricated]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:FPOA architecture illustration.png|400px|thumb|float|Simplified illustration of FPOA architecture.The area between the rectangles forms peripheral circuitry and the oval around the object interface it to the rest of FPOA]]
FPOAs have a core grid of silicon objects or core objects. These objects are connected through a synchronous interconnect. Each core object also has a supporting structures for clock synchronization,BIST and the like .The core is surrounded by  peripheral circuitry that contains memory and I/O. An interface circuitry connects the objects to rest of FPOA. Exact number of each type of object and its arrangement are specific to a given family. There are two types of communication: nearest member and "party-line". Nearest member is used to connect a core to nearest core object and party line is used to connect remote objects. There are 8 nearest neighbor interconnects per object and offers transmission speed on one object hop per clock cycle. There are 10 party line interconnect per object that offers transmission speed of four object hops per clock cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==Applications==
FPOAs may be used almost anywhere an FPGA is used, broadly in all [[hardware acceleration]] tasks including [[digital signal processing]], medical imaging, computer vision, speech recognition, cryptography, [[bioinformatics]], [[Hardware emulation|computer hardware emulation]], and [[Avionics|aerospace]]. Since FPOAs are build around fast and optimized silicon objects they offer higher performance in [[Flat-field correction|flat field error correction]], [[fast Fourier transform]] computation, [[medical imaging]], [[machine vision]], [[Image processing|image encoding and decoding]], video encoding and decoding and [[AI accelerator|artificial intelligence acceleration]] to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Development on FPOA==
In FPOA we work at silicon object level a higher level than the gate level used in FPGA. This eases the learning curve and also speeds up development. Programming is done in System C. The Arrix Family released in 2006 was supported by FPOA design software, which enabled designers to create, verify, program and debug their algorithms on the devices.Summit Design's Visual Elite tool was used for behavioural simulation. MathStar's COAST (COnnection and ASsignment Tool) offered a graphical environment for floor-planning and placement it compiled to an intermediate code that maps to hardware resources. The Object compiler generated the file to be loaded into the FPGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Image:Field dressing a deer.jpg|thumb|[[Deer hunting|Deer hunter]] in the state of Michigan in the [[United States]] field dressing a [[deer]]]]

'''Field dressing''' is the process of removing the internal organs of hunted game, and is a necessary step in preserving meat from animals harvested in the wild.  Field dressing must be done as soon as possible in order to ensure rapid body heat loss, and prevent bacteria from growing on the surface of the carcass.  Field dressing helps maintain the overall quality of the meat. It also makes it considerably easier for a hunter to carry larger game from the hunt area.

== Tools ==
[[File:Fisherman gutting the fish.jpg|thumb|upright|Fisherman field dressing fish in Los [[Los Puertos de Altagracia|Los Puertos de Altagracia, Venezuela]]]] 
Most hunters use a sharp knife to accomplish their purpose.  Other tools can be used such as axes or saws. However, the fact that harvesting locations are generally in remote areas makes the transporting and use of larger tools impractical.

Using a knife specifically designed for field dressing and the use of surgical gloves can greatly aid in sanitation.

== Risk of disease ==
[[Chronic wasting disease]] (CWD) is a rare neurological disease and has been found in a minute percentage of deer and elk in certain geographical areas in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. Although there have been reports in the popular press of humans being affected by CWD, a study by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) suggests that "[m]ore epidemiologic and laboratory studies are needed to monitor the possibility of such transmissions."&lt;ref name=human&gt;

 | pmc=3323184
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The epidemiologcial study further concludes that, "[a]s a precaution, hunters should avoid eating deer and elk tissues known to harbor the CWD agent (e.g., [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], [[eyes]], [[spleen]], [[tonsils]], [[lymph nodes]]) from areas where CWD has been identified."&lt;ref name=human/&gt; Tests have also been developed to check for the presence of CWD.

A '''grid leak detector''' is an electronic circuit that [[demodulation|demodulates]] an amplitude modulated alternating current and [[amplifier|amplifies]] the recovered modulating voltage. The circuit utilizes the non-linear cathode to control grid conduction characteristic and the amplification factor of a vacuum tube&lt;ref name="Cruft"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n727   Cruft Electronics Staff, ''Electronic Circuits and Tubes'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1947, p. 705]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;H. A. Robinson, "The Operating Characteristics of Vacuum Tube Detectors", Part I, ''[[QST]]'', vol. XIV, no. 8, p. 23, Aug. 1930&lt;/ref&gt;. Invented by [[Lee De Forest]] around 1912, it was used as the [[detector (radio)|detector]] (demodulator) in the first vacuum tube [[radio receiver]]s until the 1930s.

== History ==
[[File:TRF Schematic.jpg|thumb|alt=Schematic diagram shows six vacuum tubes|A TRF receiver using a grid leak detector (V1).]]
Early applications of triode tubes (''Audions'') as detectors usually did not include a resistor in the grid circuit&lt;ref name="navywireless1911"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/manualofwireless00robirich#page/124/mode/2up CDR S. S. Robison, ''Manual of Wireless Telegraphy for the use of Naval Electricians'', Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute, 1911, p.125]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thermionictubesi00scotrich#page/118 J. Scott-Taggart, ''Thermionic Tubes in Radio Telegraphy and Telephony'', London, UK: The Wireless Press LTD, 1921, p. 118]&lt;/ref&gt;. First use of a resistance to discharge the grid condenser in a vacuum tube [[Detector_(radio)|detector]]  circuit may have been by Sewall Cabot in 1906. Cabot wrote that he made a pencil mark to discharge the grid condenser, after finding that touching the grid terminal of the tube would cause the detector to resume operation after having stopped&lt;ref name="Cabot"&gt;S. Cabot, "Detection - Grid or Plate", ''[[QST]]'', vol. XI, no. 3, p. 30, Mar. 1927&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Edwin H. Armstrong, in 1915, describes the use of "a resistance of several hundred thousand ohms placed across the grid condenser" for the purpose of discharging the grid condenser&lt;ref&gt;E. H. Armstrong, "Some Recent Developments in the Audion Receiver", ''Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 215-247, Sept. 1915&lt;/ref&gt;.
The heyday for grid leak [[Detector (radio)|detectors]] was the 1920s, when battery operated, multiple dial [[tuned radio frequency receiver]]s using low amplification factor [[triode]]s with directly heated [[hot cathode|cathodes]] were the contemporary technology.  The Zenith Models 11, 12, and 14 are examples of these kinds of radios.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nostalgiaair.org/PagesByModel/848/M0040848.pdf Schematics of Zenith models 11, 12 and 14.]  Three battery-operated [[Zenith Electronics|Zenith]] grid leak models of the 1920s.&lt;/ref&gt;  When screen-grid tubes became available for new designs in 1927, most manufacturers switched to [[Plate detector (radio)|plate detector]]s&lt;ref&gt;E. P. Wenaas, ''Radiola: the Golden Age of RCA, 1919 - 1929'', Chandler, AZ: Sonoran Publishing LLC, 2007, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;, and later to [[envelope_detector|diode detector]]s. 
The grid leak detector has been popular for many years with amateur radio operators and shortwave listeners who construct their own receivers.

==Functional overview==
The stage performs two functions:
* Detection: The control grid and cathode operate as a diode. At small radio frequency signal (carrier) amplitudes, square-law detection takes place due to non-linear curvature of the grid current versus grid voltage characteristic&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n727 Cruft Electronics Staff, P. 705]&lt;/ref&gt;. Detection transitions at larger carrier amplitudes to large-signal detection behavior due to unilateral conduction from the cathode to grid&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj7p.org/Manuals/PDFs/Books/Sturley_1.pdf K. R. Sturley, ''Radio Receiver Design'' (Part I), New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1947, p. 377]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n727 Cruft Electronics Staff, P. 706]&lt;/ref&gt;.

* Amplification: The varying direct current (dc) voltage of the grid acts to control the plate current. The voltage of the recovered modulating signal is increased in the plate circuit, resulting in the grid leak detector producing greater audio frequency output than a diode detector, at small input signal levels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Radio Amateur's Handbook|year=1978|publisher=The American Radio Relay League|page=241|edition=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The plate current includes the radio frequency component of the received signal, which is made use of in [[Regenerative circuit|regenerative]] receiver designs.

== Operation ==
The control grid and cathode are operated as a diode while at the same time the control grid voltage exerts its usual influence on the electron stream from cathode to plate.

In the circuit, a capacitor (the ''grid condenser'') couples a radio frequency signal (the carrier) to the control grid of an electron tube&lt;ref name="Reyner"&gt;J. H. Reyner, "Grid Rectification. A Critical Examination of the Method", ''Experimental Wireless'', vol. 1, no. 9, pp. 512-520, Jun. 1924&lt;/ref&gt;. The capacitor also facilitates development of dc voltage on the grid. The impedance of the capacitor is small at the carrier frequency and high at the modulating frequencies&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CommunicationEngineering/Everitt-CommunicationEngineering W. L. Everitt, ''Communication Engineering'', 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1937, p. 418]&lt;/ref&gt;.

A resistor (the ''grid leak'') is connected either in parallel with the capacitor or from the grid to the cathode. The resistor permits dc charge to "leak" from the capacitor&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thermionictubesi00scotrich#page/118 J. Scott-Taggart, p. 119]&lt;/ref&gt; and is utilized in setting up the grid bias&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thermionictubesi00scotrich#page/124 J. Scott-Taggart, p. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;.

At small carrier signal levels, the grid to cathode space exhibits non-linear resistance. Grid current occurs during 360 degrees of the carrier frequency cycle. The grid current increases more during the positive excursions of the carrier voltage than it decreases during the negative excursions, due to the parabolic grid current versus grid voltage curve in this region&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesunderl00unitrich#page/478/mode/2up Signal Corps U.S. Army, ''The Principles Underlying Radio Communication'', 2nd ed. Washington, DC: U.S.G.P.O., 1922, p. 478]&lt;/ref&gt;. This asymmetrical grid current develops a dc grid voltage that includes the modulation frequencies&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Designers_Handbook_Robert_Landee_Donovan_Davis_Albert_Albrecht_1957#page/n439/mode/2up Landee, Davis, Albrecht, ''Electronic Designers' Handbook'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1957, pp. 7-103 - 7-108]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cruft_01"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n715 Cruft Electronics Staff, pp. 693 - 703]&lt;/ref&gt;. In this region of operation, the demodulated signal is developed in series with the dynamic grid resistance &lt;math&gt;Rg&lt;/math&gt;, which is typically in the range of 50,000 to 250,000 ohms&lt;ref name="Terman"&gt;F. E. Terman, "Some Principles of Grid-Leak Grid-Condenser Detection", ''Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers'', Vol. 16, No. 10, Oct. 1928, pp. 1384-1397&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everitt419"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CommunicationEngineering/Everitt-CommunicationEngineering#page/n429/mode/2up W. L. Everitt, pp. 419-420]&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;math&gt;Rg&lt;/math&gt; and the grid leak resistance along with the grid condenser and the grid capacitance form a low pass filter that determines the audio frequency bandwidth at the grid&lt;ref name="Terman"/&gt;.

At carrier signal levels large enough to make conduction from cathode to grid cease during the negative excursions of the carrier, the detection action is that of a linear diode detector&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n697 Cruft Electronics Staff, p. 675]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Designers_Handbook_Robert_Landee_Donovan_Davis_Albert_Albrecht_1957#page/n443 Landee et al., p. 7-107]&lt;/ref&gt;. Grid current occurs only on the positive peaks of the carrier frequency cycle. The coupling capacitor will acquire a dc charge due to the rectifying action of the cathode to grid path&lt;ref&gt;W. L. Everitt, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;. The capacitor discharges through the resistor (thus ''grid leak'') during the time that the carrier voltage is decreasing&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesunderl00unitrich#page/476/mode/2up Signal Corps U.S. Army, p. 476]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n701 Cruft Electronics Staff, p. 679]&lt;/ref&gt;. The dc grid voltage will vary with the modulation envelope of an amplitude modulated signal&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n703 Cruft Electronics Staff, p. 681]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The plate current is passed through a load impedance chosen to produce the desired amplification in conjunction with the tube characteristics.  In non-regenerative receivers, a capacitor of low impedance at the carrier frequency is connected from the plate to cathode to prevent amplification of the carrier frequency&lt;ref name="KR2"&gt;K. R. Sturley, pp. 379-380&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Design ==
The capacitance of the grid condenser is chosen to be around ten times the grid input capacitance and is typically 100 to 300 picofarads (pF), with the smaller value for screen grid and pentode tubes&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Terman"/&gt;.

The resistance and electrical connection of the grid leak along with the grid current determine the grid [[Biasing#Vacuum_tubes_(thermionic_valves)|bias]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/thermionictubesi00scotrich#page/124 J. Scott-Taggart, p. 125]&lt;/ref&gt;. For operation of the detector at maximum sensitivity, the bias is placed near the point on the grid current versus grid voltage curve where maximum rectification effect occurs, which is the point of maximum rate of change of slope of the curve&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.15834/page/n187 A.

X, no. 12, pp. 14-17, Dec. 1926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/PrinciplesOfRadioCommunication#page/n471/mode/1up J. H. Morecroft, ''Principles of Radio Communication'', New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1921, p. 455]&lt;/ref&gt;. If a dc path is provided from the grid leak to an indirectly heated cathode or to the negative end of a directly heated cathode, negative [[Biasing#Vacuum_tubes_(thermionic_valves)|initial velocity]] grid bias is produced relative to the cathode determined by the product of the grid leak resistance and the grid current&lt;ref name="Giacoletto_1977"&gt;{{cite book |author-first=Lawrence Joseph |author-last=Giacoletto |title=Electronics Designers' Handbook |location=New York |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |date=1977 |page=9-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomer_1960"&gt;{{cite book |author-first= Robert B. |author-last=Tomer |title=Getting the Most Out of Vacuum Tubes |location=Indianapolis |publisher=[[Howard W.

For certain directly heated cathode tubes, the optimum grid bias is at a positive voltage relative to the negative end of the cathode. For these tubes, a dc path is provided from the grid leak to the positive side of the cathode or the positive side of the "A" battery; providing a positive [[Biasing#Vacuum_tubes_(thermionic_valves)|fixed bias]] voltage at the grid determined by the dc grid current and the resistance of the grid leak&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/The_RCA_Radiotron_Manual_-10_1933#page/n25 RCA, ''The RCA Radiotron Manual'', Technical Series R-10, Radio Corporation of America, p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LP"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesunderl00unitrich#page/476/mode/2up Signal Corps U.S. Army, p. 477]&lt;/ref&gt;.

As the resistance of the grid leak is increased, the grid resistance &lt;math&gt;Rg&lt;/math&gt; increases and the audio frequency bandwidth at the grid decreases, for a given grid condenser capacitance&lt;ref name="Terman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Everitt419"/&gt;.

The dc voltage at the plate is chosen for operation of the tube at the same plate current usually used in amplifier operation and is typically less than 100 volts&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/The_RCA_Radiotron_Manual_-10_1933#page/n25 RCA, ''The RCA Radiotron Manual'', Technical Series R-10, Radio Corporation of America, pp. 22-23, 25, 33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/RCA_All_Metal_Radio_Tubes_1935/page/n9 RCA Radiotron Division, ''New All-Metal Radio Tubes'', RCA Manufacturing Co., Inc., 1935, pp. 6-7]&lt;/ref&gt;.

The grid leak detector can be optimized for maximum input signal capability rather than detection sensitivity, in which case the time constant of the grid leak and condenser must be shorter than the period of the highest audio frequency to be reproduced&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Zepler_1943_The_Technique_of_Radio_Design#page/n269/mode/2up E.

Zepler, p. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Effect of tube type==

Tetrode and pentode tubes provide significantly higher grid input impedance than triodes, resulting in less loading of the circuit providing the signal to the detector&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Sturley, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;. Tetrode and pentode tubes also produce significantly higher audio frequency output amplitude at small carrier input signal levels (around one volt or less) in grid leak detector applications than triodes&lt;ref name="Robinson02"&gt;H. A. Robinson, "The Operating Characteristics of Vacuum Tube Detectors", Part II, ''[[QST]]'', vol. XIV, no. 9, p. 42, Sept. 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Rydberg, J. W. Doty, "The Superiority of Screen-Grid Detectors", ''[[QST]]'', vol. XIV, no. 4, p. 43, Apr. 1930&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Advantages ==

* The grid leak detector potentially offers greater economy than use of separate diode and amplifier tubes.
* At small input signal levels, the circuit produces higher output amplitude than a simple diode detector.

==Disadvantages==

One potential disadvantage of the grid leak detector, primarily in non-regenerative circuits, is that of the load it can present to the preceding circuit&lt;ref name="KR2" /&gt;. The radio frequency input impedance of the grid leak detector is dominated by the tube's grid input impedance, which can be on the order of 6000 ohms or less for triodes, depending on tube characteristics and signal frequency. Other disadvantages are that it can produce more distortion and is less suitable for input signal voltages over a volt or two than the plate detector or diode detector&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Zepler, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;H. A. Robinson, Part I, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16248">A '''Human Resource Management System''' or HRIS (Human Resource Information System) is a form of HR software that combines a number of systems and processes to ensure the easy management of human resources, business processes and data. Human Resources software is used by businesses to combine a number of necessary HR functions, such as storing employee data, managing payrolls, recruitment processes, benefits administration, and keeping track of attendance records. It ensures everyday Human Resources processes are manageable and easy to access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://introductiontohumanresourcemanagementsystem.wordpress.com |title=What is HR Management System}}&lt;/ref&gt; It merges human resources as a discipline and, in particular, its basic HR activities and processes with the information technology field, whereas the programming of data processing systems evolved into standardized routines and packages of [[enterprise resource planning|Enterprise Resource Planning]] (ERP) software. On the whole, these ERP systems have their origin from software that integrates information from different applications into one universal database. The linkage of its financial and human resource modules through one database is the most important distinction to the individually and proprietarily developed predecessors, which makes this software application both rigid and flexible.

Human Resource Information Systems provide a means of acquiring, storing, analyzing and distributing information to various stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chugh |first1=Ritesh |title=Role of Human Resource Information Systems in an Educational Organization |journal=Journal of Advanced Management Science |date=June 2014 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=149–153 |doi=10.12720/joams.2.2.149-153 |url=http://www.joams.com/index.php?m=content&amp;c=index&amp;a=show&amp;catid=37&amp;id=132 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRIS enable improvement in traditional processes and enhance strategic decision-making.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wave of technological advancement has revolutionized each and every space of life today, and HR in its entirety was not left untouched. Early systems were narrow in scope, typically focused on a single task, such as improving the payroll process or tracking employees' work hours. Today's systems cover the full spectrum of tasks associated with Human Resources departments, including tracking and improving process efficiency, managing organizational hierarchy, and simplifying financial transactions of all types. In short, as the role of Human Resources departments expanded in complexity, HR technology systems evolved to fit these needs.

==History==
===The emergence of Human Resources Management Software===
The trend of [[Payroll automation|automating payroll]] and workforce management processes began during the 1970s when due to limited technology and [[Mainframe computer]]s, companies were still relying on manual entry to conduct employee evaluation and to digitize reporting.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The first [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system which integrated [[Human resources|HR]] functions was [[SAP R/2]] (later to be replaced by R/3 and S/4hana), introduced in 1979. This system gave users the possibility to combine corporate data in real time, and regulate processes from a single mainframe environment. Many of today’s popular HR systems still offer considerable ERP and payroll functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Human Resource Software and its effects on your HR department – what to expect|url=http://www.unicornhro.com/articles/human-resource-software-and-its-effects-on-your-hr-department--what-to-expect|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''unicornhro.com'' |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first completely HR-centered client-server system for the enterprise market was [[PeopleSoft]], released in 1987 and later bought by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. (In the UK 'Compel' was released by CIPHR in 1983 as a dedicated HR Management System). Hosted and updated by clients, PeopleSoft replaced the mainframe environment concept and gained a huge popularity that preserved it on the scene for many years to come. The system is still active today, while Oracle has also developed multiple similar [[Business process management|BPM]] systems to automate essential corporate operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oracle PeopleSoft Applications|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/peoplesoft-enterprise/overview/index.html|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''oracle.com'' |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web-Based Human Resources Management Software===
Beginning with the late 1990s, HR vendors started offering cloud-hosted HR solutions to make this technology more accessible to small and remote teams. Instead of a client-server, companies began using online accounts on web-based portals to access their employees’ performance, and track accomplishments regardless of their location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Introduction to the History of HR Software|url=http://comparecamp.com/introduction-history-hr-software/|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''comparecamp.com'' |date=21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of 2000 marked a new and advantageous concept in HR development. More and more systems were tackling specific tasks such as recruitment or benefits administration, including best of breed systems that replaced the one-size-fits-all ERP + HR formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Best-of-Breed|url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/best-of-breed/|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''gartner.com'' |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile Human Resources Management Software===
In 2014, companies used the benefits from the cloud hosting milestone to transfer HR functionality on mobile devices. Ever since popular vendors have been releasing special Android and iPad/iPhone applications to meet the needs of all teams and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Heinen, {{cite news|title=Top 5 Benefits of Mobile HR Solutions|url=http://hrchitect.com/top-5-benefits-of-mobile-hr-solutions/|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''hrchitect.com'' |date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent developments of Human Resources Management Software===
In 2015, HR software users got acquainted with [[gamification]] technology namely systems that attach an entertaining dimension to traditional HR operations, and motivate employees to perform better by awarding them with badges and bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne Meister,{{cite news|title=Future Of Work: Using Gamification For Human Resources|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2015/03/30/future-of-work-using-gamification-for-human-resources/|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''forbes.com'' |date=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular innovation related to specialized HR systems is video hiring, as most providers embed web conferencing widgets in their products, allowing managers to locate and attract talents without geographical limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=12 Benefits of Video Interviewing|url=http://www.corporate-eye.com/main/benefits-video-interviewing/|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''corporate-eye.com'' |date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, Human Resources Management software is expected to reinvent its capacity, boost efficiency with more personalized and candidate-centric recruiting, streamlined interfaces, and automation of more HR-related processes that are currently performed manually.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Bersin,{{cite news|title=The HR Software Market Reinvents Itself|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbersin/2016/07/18/the-hr-software-market-reinvents-itself/#1d639cb44930|accessdate=27 January 2017 |publisher=''forbes.com'' |date=18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
The function of human resources departments is administrative and common to all organizations. Organizations may have formalized selection, evaluation, and payroll processes. Management of "[[human capital]]" progressed to an imperative and complex process. The HR function consists of tracking existing employee data which traditionally includes personal histories, skills, capabilities, accomplishments, and salary. To reduce the manual workload of these administrative activities, organizations began to electronically automate many of these processes by introducing specialized human resource management systems. HR executives rely on internal or external IT professionals to develop and maintain an integrated HRMS. Before [[client–server]] architectures evolved in the late 1980s, many HR automation processes were relegated to mainframe computers that could handle large amounts of data transactions. In consequence of the high capital investment necessary to buy or program proprietary software, these internally developed HRMS were limited to organizations that possessed a large amount of capital. The advent of client-server, [[application service provider]], and [[software as a service]] (SaaS) or human resource management systems enabled higher administrative control of such systems. Currently, human resource management systems encompass:

# Retaining
# [[Recruitment|Hiring]]
# Onboarding
# [[Management|Administration]]
# Managing payroll
# HR [[planning]]
# Recruiting/[[Learning management system|Learning management]]
# [[Performance management]]
# [[Employee self-service (web-based application)|Employee self-service]]
# Scheduling
# Absence management
# [[Analytics]]
# Employee Reassign module
# Grievance handling by following precedents
  
The '''payroll module''' automates the pay process by gathering data on employee time and attendance, calculating various deductions and taxes, and generating periodic pay cheques and employee tax reports. Data is generally fed from the human resources and timekeeping modules to calculate automatic deposit and manual cheque writing capabilities. This module can encompass all employee-related transactions as well as integrate with existing financial management systems.
   
The '''time and attendance module''' gathers standardized time and work related efforts. The most advanced modules provide broad flexibility in data collection methods, labor distribution capabilities and data analysis features. Cost analysis and efficiency metrics are the primary functions.
   
The '''benefits administration module''' provides a system for organizations to administer and track employee participation in benefits programs. These typically encompass insurance, compensation, profit sharing, and retirement.
   
The '''HR management module''' is a component covering many other HR aspects from application to retirement. The system records basic demographic and address data, selection, training and development, capabilities and skills management, compensation planning records and other related activities. Leading edge systems provide the ability to "read" applications and enter relevant data to applicable database fields, notify employers and provide position management and position control. Human resource management function involves the recruitment, placement, evaluation, compensation, and development of the employees of an organization. Initially, businesses used computer-based information systems to:
* produce paychecks and payroll reports;
* maintain personnel records;
* pursue [[talent management]].

Online '''recruiting''' has become one of the primary methods employed by HR departments to garner potential candidates for available positions within an organization. [[Talent management system]]s, or recruitment modules,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrmsworld.com/hrms-for-recruitment.html|title=HRMS for recruitment: everything you need to know|website=www.hrmsworld.com|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer an integrated hiring solution for HRMS which typically encompass:
* analyzing personnel usage within an organization;
* identifying potential applicants;
* recruiting through company-facing listings;
* recruiting through online recruiting sites or publications that market to both recruiters and applicants;
* analytics within the hiring process (time to hire, source of hire, turnover);
* compliance management to ensure job ads and candidate onboarding follows government regulations.

The significant cost incurred in maintaining an organized recruitment effort, cross-posting within and across general or industry-specific job boards and maintaining a competitive exposure of availabilities has given rise to the development of a dedicated [[applicant tracking system]] (ATS) module.

The '''training module''' provides a system for organizations to administer and track employee training and development efforts. The system, normally called a "learning management system" (LMS) if a standalone product, allows HR to track education, qualifications, and skills of the employees, as well as outlining what training courses, books, CDs, web-based learning or materials are available to develop which skills. Courses can then be offered in date specific sessions, with delegates and training resources being mapped and managed within the same system. Sophisticated LMSs allow managers to approve training, budgets, and calendars alongside performance management and appraisal metrics.

The '''employee self-service module''' allows employees to query HR related data and perform some HR transactions over the system. Employees may query their attendance record from the system without asking the information from HR personnel. The module also lets supervisors approve O.T. requests from their subordinates through the system without overloading the task on HR department.
     
Many organizations have gone beyond the traditional functions and developed human resource management information systems, which support recruitment, selection, hiring, job placement, performance appraisals, employee benefit analysis, health, safety, and security, while others integrate an outsourced applicant tracking system that encompasses a subset of the above.

&lt;!--{Sentence fragment; needs to be fleshed out or removed.}
Assigning Responsibilities
Communication between the Employees.
--&gt;
The '''Analytics''' module enables organizations to extend the value of an HRMS implementation by extracting HR related data for use with other business intelligence platforms. For example, organizations combine HR metrics with other business data to identify trends and anomalies in headcount in order to better predict the impact of employee turnover on future output.

There are now many types of HRMS or HRIS, some of which are typically local-machine-based software packages; the other main type is an online cloud-based system that can be accessed via a web browser.

The '''Staff Training Module''' enables organizations the ability to enter, track and manage employee and staff training. Each type of activity can be recorded together with the additional data. The performance of each employee or staff member is then stored and can be accessed via the '''Analytics''' module.

Employee Re-Assign module is a recent additional functionality of HRMS. This module has the functions of Transfer, Promotion, Pay revision, Re-designation, Deputation, Confirmation, Pay mode change and Letter Form.

'''Hydrogenation''' – meaning, to treat with [[hydrogen]] – is a [[chemical reaction]] between molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and another compound or element, usually in the presence of a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] such as [[nickel]], [[palladium]] or [[platinum]]. The process is commonly employed to [[redox|reduce]] or [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturate]] [[organic compound]]s. Hydrogenation typically constitutes the addition of pairs of [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s to a molecule, often an [[alkene]]. [[Catalyst]]s are required for the reaction to be usable; non-catalytic hydrogenation takes place only at very high temperatures. Hydrogenation reduces [[Double bond|double]] and [[Triple bond|triple]] bonds in [[hydrocarbon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hudlický|first=Miloš|title=Reductions in Organic Chemistry|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|year=1996|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=429|isbn=0-8412-3344-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
It has three components, the [[saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] substrate, the hydrogen (or hydrogen source) and, invariably, a catalyst. The [[redox|reduction]] reaction is carried out at different temperatures and pressures depending upon the substrate and the activity of the catalyst.

===Related or competing reactions===
The same catalysts and conditions that are used for hydrogenation reactions can also lead to isomerization of the alkenes from cis to trans.  This process is of great interest because hydrogenation technology generates most of the [[trans fat]] in foods (see {{section link||Food industry}} below). A reaction where bonds are broken while hydrogen is added is called [[hydrogenolysis]], a reaction that may occur to carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] or [[halogen]]) bonds.  Some hydrogenations of polar bonds are accompanied by hydrogenolysis.

===Hydrogen sources===
For hydrogenation, the obvious source of hydrogen is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas itself, which is typically available commercially within the storage medium of a pressurized cylinder. The hydrogenation process often uses greater than 1 atmosphere of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, usually conveyed from the cylinders and sometimes augmented by "booster pumps". Gaseous hydrogen is produced industrially from hydrocarbons by the process known as [[steam reforming]].&lt;ref name=Rylander&gt;Paul N. Rylander, "Hydrogenation and Dehydrogenation" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a13_487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For many applications, hydrogen is transferred from donor molecules such as formic acid, isopropanol, and dihydroanthracene. These hydrogen donors undergo [[dehydrogenation]] to, respectively, carbon dioxide, acetone, and anthracene.  These processes are called [[transfer hydrogenation]]s.

===Substrates===
An important characteristic of alkene and alkyne hydrogenations, both the homogeneously and heterogeneously catalyzed versions, is that hydrogen addition occurs with "[[syn addition]]", with hydrogen entering from the least hindered side.&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Organic Chemistry'' Jerry March 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction can be performed on a variety of different [[functional group]]s.

===Catalysts===
With rare exceptions, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is unreactive toward organic compounds in the absence of metal catalysts. The unsaturated substrate is [[chemisorption|chemisorbed]] onto the catalyst, with most sites covered by the substrate. In heterogeneous catalysts, hydrogen forms surface hydrides (M-H) from which hydrogens can be transferred to the chemisorbed substrate. Platinum, palladium, [[Rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation|rhodium]], and ruthenium form highly active catalysts, which operate at lower temperatures and lower pressures of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Non-precious metal catalysts, especially those based on nickel (such as [[Raney nickel]] and [[Urushibara nickel]]) have also been developed as economical alternatives, but they are often slower or require higher temperatures. The trade-off is activity (speed of reaction) vs. cost of the catalyst and cost of the apparatus required for use of high pressures. Notice that the Raney-nickel catalysed hydrogenations require high pressures:&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=C. F. H. Allen and James VanAllan|title=m-Toylybenzylamine|collvol=3|collvolpages=827|year=1955 |prep=CV3P0827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=A. B. Mekler, S. Ramachandran, S. Swaminathan, and Melvin S. Newman|title=2-Methyl-1,3-Cyclohexanedione|collvol=5|collvolpages=743|year=1973|prep=CV5P0743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalysts are usually classified into two broad classes: [[homogeneous catalyst]]s and [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s. Homogeneous catalysts dissolve in the solvent that contains the unsaturated substrate. Heterogeneous catalysts are solids that are suspended in the same solvent with the substrate or are treated with gaseous substrate.

====Homogeneous catalysts====
Some well known homogeneous catalysts are indicated below.  These are [[coordination complex]]es that activate both the unsaturated substrate and the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Most typically, these complexes contain platinum group metals, especially Rh and Ir.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
{{clear left}}
[[File:RevisedCatCycle.png|thumbnail|right|hydrogenation of propylene with Wilkinson's catalyst]]

Homogeneous catalysts are also used in asymmetric synthesis by the hydrogenation of prochiral substrates.  An early demonstration of this approach was the Rh-catalyzed hydrogenation of enamides as precursors to the drug L-DOPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knowles|first1=W. S.|title=Application of organometallic catalysis to the commercial production of L-DOPA|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|date=March 1986|volume=63|issue=3|pages=222|doi=10.1021/ed063p222|bibcode=1986JChEd..63..222K}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve asymmetric reduction, these catalyst are made chiral by use of chiral diphosphine ligands.&lt;ref name="Textbook" /&gt; Rhodium catalyzed hydrogenation has also been used in the herbicide production of S-metolachlor, which uses a Josiphos type ligand (called Xyliphos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaser|first1=Hans-Ulrich|last2=Pugin|first2=Benoît|last3=Spindler|first3=Felix|last4=Thommen|first4=Marc|title=From a Chiral Switch to a Ligand Portfolio for Asymmetric Catalysis|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|date=December 2007|volume=40|issue=12|pages=1240–1250|doi=10.1021/ar7001057}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In principle asymmetric hydrogenation can be catalyzed by chiral heterogeneous catalysts,&lt;ref name=Mallet&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr0683663 | title = Asymmetric Catalysis at Chiral Metal Surfaces | year = 2007 | last1 = Mallat | first1 = T. | last2 = Orglmeister | first2 = E. | last3 = Baiker | first3 = A. | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 107 | issue = 11 | pages = 4863–90 | pmid = 17927256}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this approach remains more of a curiosity than a useful technology.

====Heterogeneous catalysts====
Heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation are more common industrially. In industry, precious metal hydrogenation catalysts are deposited from solution as a fine powder on the support, which is a cheap, bulky, porous, usually granular material, such as [[activated carbon]], [[alumina]], [[calcium carbonate]] or [[barium sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alfa.com/en/platinum-heterogeneous-catalysts/|title=Platinum Heterogeneous Catalysts - Alfa Aesar|author=|date=|website=www.alfa.com|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180118181608/https://www.alfa.com/en/platinum-heterogeneous-catalysts/|archivedate=18 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, platinum on carbon is produced by reduction of [[chloroplatinic acid]] ''in situ'' in carbon. Examples of these catalysts are 5% [[ruthenium]] on [[activated carbon]], or 1% [[platinum]] on [[alumina]]. Base metal catalysts, such as [[Raney nickel]], are typically much cheaper and do not need a support. Also, in the laboratory, unsupported (massive) precious metal catalysts such as [[platinum black]] are still used, despite the cost.

As in homogeneous catalysts, the activity is adjusted through changes in the environment around the metal, i.e. the [[coordination sphere]]. Different [[miller index|faces]] of a crystalline heterogeneous catalyst display distinct activities, for example. This can be modified by mixing metals or using different preparation techniques. Similarly, heterogeneous catalysts are affected by their supports.

In many cases, highly empirical modifications involve selective "poisons". Thus, a carefully chosen catalyst can be used to hydrogenate some functional groups without affecting others, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings, or the selective hydrogenation of [[alkynes]] to alkenes using [[Lindlar catalyst|Lindlar's catalyst]]. For example, when the catalyst [[palladium]] is placed on [[barium sulfate]] and then treated with [[quinoline]], the resulting catalyst reduces alkynes only as far as alkenes. The Lindlar catalyst has been applied to the conversion of [[phenylacetylene]] to [[styrene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth|author=H. Lindlar and R.

===Transfer hydrogenation===
[[File:THintermed.png|thumb|300px|right|The [[transition state]] of two transfer-hydrogenation reactions from ruthenium-hydride complexes onto carbonyls]]
[[Transfer hydrogenation]] uses other hydrogen donor molecules in place of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; itself. These reactants, which can also serve as [[solvent]]s for the reaction, include [[hydrazine]], [[Dialin|dihydronaphthalene]], dihydroanthracene, [[isopropanol]], and [[formic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;van Es, T.; Staskun, B. "Aldehydes from Aromatic Nitriles: 4-Formylbenzenesulfonamide" ''[[Org. Synth.]]'', Coll. Vol. 6, p. 631 (1988). ([http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0631 Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223200/http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep.asp?prep=cv6p0631 |date=2007-09-27 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction involves an outer-sphere mechanism.

In [[organic synthesis]], transfer hydrogenation is useful for the asymmetric reduction of polar unsaturated substrates, such as [[ketone]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, and [[imine]]s. The hydrogenation of polar substrates such as ketones and aldehydes typically requires transfer hydrogenation, at least reactions that use [[homogeneous catalyst]]s.  These catalysts are readily generated in chiral forms, which is the basis of asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones.

===Electrolytic hydrogenation===
[[Chemical polarity|Polar]] substrates such as [[nitriles]] can be hydrogenated [[electrosynthesis#Cathodic reductions|electrochemically]], using [[protic solvent]]s and reducing equivalents as the source of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ed081p1350 | title = Catalytic Hydrogenation of Organic Compounds without H2 Supply: An Electrochemical System | year = 2004 | last1 = Navarro | first1 = Daniela Maria do Amaral Ferraz | last2 = Navarro | first2 = Marcelo | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 81 | issue = 9 | pages = 1350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermodynamics and mechanism==
The addition of hydrogen to double or triple bonds in [[hydrocarbons]] is a type of [[redox]] reaction that can be thermodynamically favorable. For example, the addition of hydrogen to an alkene has a [[Gibbs free energy]] change of -101 kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Textbook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|title=Shriver &amp; Atkins' inorganic chemistry.|date=2010|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co.|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4292-1820-7|page=696|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the reaction rate for most hydrogenation reactions is negligible in the absence of catalysts.
Hydrogenation is a strongly [[exothermic]] reaction. In the hydrogenation of vegetable oils and fatty acids, for example, the heat released is about 25 kcal per mole (105 kJ/mol), sufficient to raise the temperature of the oil by 1.6–1.7&amp;nbsp;°C per [[iodine number]] drop. The [[reaction mechanism|mechanism]] of metal-catalyzed hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes has been extensively studied.&lt;ref&gt;Kubas, G. J., "Metal Dihydrogen and σ-Bond Complexes", Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers: New York, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; First of all [[isotope labeling]] using [[deuterium]] confirms the [[regiochemistry]] of the addition:
:RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → RCHDCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;D

===Heterogeneous catalysis===
On solids, the accepted mechanism is the Horiuti-[[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]] mechanism:&lt;ref&gt;Gallezot, Pierre. "Hydrogenation - Heterogeneous" in Encyclopedia of Catalysis, Volume 4, ed. Horvath, I.T., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1039/TF9343001164 | title = Exchange reactions of hydrogen on metallic catalysts | year = 1934 | last1 = Horiuti | first1 = Iurô | last2 = Polanyi | first2 = M. | journal = Transactions of the Faraday Society | volume = 30 | pages = 1164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Binding of the unsaturated bond, and hydrogen dissociation into atomic hydrogen onto the catalyst
# Addition of one atom of hydrogen; this step is reversible
# Addition of the second atom; effectively irreversible under hydrogenating conditions.

In the second step, the metallointermediate formed is a saturated compound that can rotate and then break down, again detaching the alkene from the catalyst. Consequently, contact with a hydrogenation catalyst necessarily causes ''cis-trans''-isomerization, because the isomerization is thermodynamically favorable. This is a problem in partial hydrogenation, while in complete hydrogenation the produced ''trans''-alkene is eventually hydrogenated.

For aromatic substrates, the first bond is hardest to hydrogenate because of the free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system. The product of this is a cyclohexadiene, which is extremely active and cannot be isolated; in conditions reducing enough to break the aromatization, it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene. The [[cyclohexene]] is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane, but special modifications to the catalysts (such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium) can preserve some of the cyclohexene, if that is a desired product.

===Homogeneous catalysis===
In many homogeneous hydrogenation processes,&lt;ref&gt;Johannes G. de Vries, Cornelis J. Elsevier, eds. The Handbook of Homogeneous Hydrogenation Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2007. {{ISBN|978-3-527-31161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the metal binds to both components to give an intermediate alkene-metal(H)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex. The general sequence of reactions is assumed to be as follows or a related sequence of steps:
* binding of the hydrogen to give a dihydride complex via [[oxidative addition]] (preceding the oxidative addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the formation of a [[dihydrogen complex]]):
:L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;M + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;MH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* binding of alkene:
:L&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;M(η&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHR → L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;MH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHR) + L
* transfer of one hydrogen atom from the metal to carbon (migratory insertion)
:L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;MH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHR) → L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;M(H)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R)
* transfer of the second hydrogen atom from the metal to the alkyl group with simultaneous dissociation of the alkane ("reductive elimination")
:L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;M(H)(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) → L&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;M + CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R

==Inorganic substrates==
The hydrogenation of nitrogen to give ammonia is conducted on a vast scale by the [[Haber-Bosch]] process, consuming an estimated 1% of the [[World energy consumption|world's energy supply]].
:&lt;chem title="Hydrogenation of nitrogen"&gt;
\underset{nitrogen}{N{\equiv}N} + \underset{hydrogen\atop (200 atm)}{3H2} -&gt;[\ce{Fe\ catalyst}][350-550^\circ\ce C] \underset{ammonia}{2NH3}
&lt;/chem&gt;
Oxygen can be partially hydrogenated to give [[hydrogen peroxide]], although this process has not been commercialized

==Industrial applications==
Catalytic hydrogenation has diverse industrial uses. Most frequently, industrial hydrogenation relies on heterogeneous catalysts.&lt;ref name=Rylander/&gt;

===Food industry{{anchor|In_the_food_industry}}===
{{fats}}
The largest scale application of hydrogenation is for the processing of [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name=Rylander/&gt; Typical vegetable oils are derived from [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s (containing more than one carbon-carbon [[double bond]]). Their partial hydrogenation reduces most, but not all, of these carbon-carbon double bonds. The degree of hydrogenation is controlled by restricting the amount of hydrogen, reaction temperature and time, and the catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;Ian P. Freeman "Margarines and Shortenings" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:H2forMargerin.png|thumb|320px|Partial hydrogenation of a typical plant oil to a typical component of margarine. Most of the C=C double bonds are removed in this process, which elevates the melting point of the product.]]

Hydrogenation converts liquid [[vegetable oil]]s into solid or semi-solid fats, such as those present in [[margarine]]. Changing the degree of saturation of the fat changes some important physical properties, such as the melting range, which is why liquid oils become semi-solid. Solid or semi-solid fats are preferred for baking because the way the fat mixes with flour produces a more desirable texture in the baked product. Because partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are cheaper than animal fats, are available in a wide range of consistencies, and have other desirable characteristics (such as increased oxidative [[chemical stability|stability]] and longer [[shelf life]]), they are the predominant fats used as [[shortening]] in most commercial baked goods.

A side effect of incomplete hydrogenation having implications for human health is the [[isomerization]] of some of the remaining unsaturated carbon bonds to their [[trans isomer]]s. [[Trans fat]]s (resulting from partial hydrogenation) have been implicated in circulatory diseases including [[heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Teresa Tarrago-Trani | first1 = Maria | last2 = Phillips | first2 = Katherine M. | last3 = Lemar | first3 = Linda E. | last4 = Holden | first4 = Joanne M. | year = 2006 | title = New and Existing Oils and Fats Used in Products with Reduced Trans-Fatty Acid Content | url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/JADA106_867-880.pdf| journal = Journal of the American Dietetic Association | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 867–880 | doi = 10.1016/j.jada.2006.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversion from cis to trans bonds is favored because the trans configuration has lower energy than the natural cis one. At equilibrium, the trans/cis isomer ratio is about 2:1. Many countries and regions have introduced mandatory labeling of trans fats on food products and appealed to the industry for voluntary reductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/healthy-living/deadly-fats-why-are-we-still-eating-them-843400.html|title=Deadly fats: why are we still eating them?|date=2008-06-10|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-06-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614071803/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/healthy-living/deadly-fats-why-are-we-still-eating-them-843400.html|archivedate=2008-06-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16051436/|title=New York City passes trans fat ban|date=2006-12-05|publisher=[[msnbc]]|accessdate=2010-01-09|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106041324/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16051436/|archivedate=2010-01-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/health/fda-gives-food-industry-three-years-eliminate-trans-fats.html|title=F.D.A.

===Petrochemical industry===
In petrochemical processes, hydrogenation is used to convert alkenes and aromatics into saturated alkanes (paraffins) and cycloalkanes (naphthenes), which are less toxic and less reactive. Relevant to liquid fuels that are stored sometimes for long periods in air, saturated hydrocarbons exhibit superior storage properties.  On the other hand, alkene tend to form [[hydroperoxide]]s, which can form gums that interfere with fuel handing equipment.  For example, [[mineral turpentine]] is usually hydrogenated. [[Hydrocracking]] of heavy residues into diesel is another application. In [[isomerization]] and [[catalytic reforming]] processes, some hydrogen pressure is maintained to [[Hydrogenolysis|hydrogenolyze]] [[Petroleum coke|coke]] formed on the catalyst and prevent its accumulation.

===Organic chemistry===
Hydrogenation is a useful means for converting unsaturated compounds into saturated derivatives.  Substrates include not only alkenes and alkynes, but also aldehydes, imines, and nitriles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werkmeister|first1=Svenja|last2=Junge|first2=Kathrin|last3=Beller|first3=Matthias|title=Catalytic Hydrogenation of Carboxylic Acid Esters, Amides, and Nitriles with Homogeneous Catalysts|journal=Organic Process Research &amp; Development|date=2 February 2014|volume=18|issue=2|pages=289–302|doi=10.1021/op4003278}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are converted into the corresponding saturated compounds, i.e. alcohols and amines.  Thus, alkyl aldehydes, which can be synthesized with the [[oxo process]] from [[carbon monoxide]] and an alkene, can be converted to alcohols. E.g. [[1-propanol]] is produced from propionaldehyde, produced from ethene and carbon monoxide. [[Xylitol]], a [[polyol]], is produced by hydrogenation of the sugar [[xylose]], an aldehyde. Primary amines can be synthesized by [[Nitrile reduction|hydrogenation of nitriles]], while nitriles are readily synthesized from cyanide and a suitable electrophile. For example, isophorone diamine, a precursor to the [[polyurethane]] monomer [[isophorone diisocyanate]], is produced from isophorone nitrile by a tandem nitrile hydrogenation/reductive amination by ammonia, wherein hydrogenation converts both the nitrile into an amine and the imine formed from the aldehyde and ammonia into another amine.

==History==

===Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation===
The earliest hydrogenation is that of [[platinum]] [[catalysis|catalyzed]] addition of hydrogen to oxygen in the [[Döbereiner's lamp]], a device commercialized as early as 1823. The French chemist [[Paul Sabatier (chemist)|Paul Sabatier]] is considered the father of the hydrogenation process. In 1897, building on the earlier work of [[James F. Boyce, Sr.|James Boyce]], an American chemist working in the manufacture of soap products, he discovered that traces of nickel catalyzed the addition of hydrogen to molecules of gaseous hydrocarbons in what is now known as the [[Sabatier process]]. For this work, Sabatier shared the 1912 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. [[Wilhelm Normann]] was awarded a patent in Germany in 1902 and in Britain in 1903 for the hydrogenation of liquid oils, which was the beginning of what is now a worldwide industry. The commercially important [[Haber–Bosch process]], first described in 1905, involves hydrogenation of nitrogen. In the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]], reported in 1922 carbon monoxide, which is easily derived from coal, is hydrogenated to liquid fuels.

In 1922, Voorhees and Adams described an apparatus for performing hydrogenation under pressures above one atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1922/44/i06/f-pdf/f_ja01427a021.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910124034/http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1922/44/i06/f-pdf/f_ja01427a021.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Parr shaker, the first product to allow hydrogenation using elevated pressures and temperatures, was commercialized in 1926 based on Voorhees and Adams' research and remains in widespread use. In 1924 [[Murray Raney]] developed a finely powdered form of nickel, which is widely used to catalyze hydrogenation reactions such as conversion of nitriles to amines or the production of margarine.

===Homogeneous catalytic hydrogenation===
In the 1930s, Calvin discovered that copper(II) complexes oxidized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The 1960s witnessed the development of well defined [[homogeneous catalyst]]s using transition metal complexes, e.g., [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] (RhCl(PPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Soon thereafter cationic Rh and Ir were found catalyze the hydrogenation of alkenes and carbonyls.&lt;ref name=ACS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schrock|first1=Richard R.|last2=Osborn|first2=John A.|title=Catalytic hydrogenation using cationic rhodium complexes.

Pettinari, F. Marchetti, D. Martini "Metal Complexes as Hydrogenation Catalysts" Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II, 2004, volume 9. pp. 75–139. {{DOI|10.1016/B0-08-043748-6/09125-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of homogeneous hydrogenation was influenced by work started in the 1930s and 1940s on the [[oxo process]] and [[Ziegler–Natta polymerization]].

==Metal-free hydrogenation==
For most practical purposes, hydrogenation requires a metal catalyst. Hydrogenation can, however, proceed from some hydrogen donors without catalysts, illustrative hydrogen donors being [[diimide]] and [[aluminium isopropoxide]], the latter illustrated by the [[Meerwein–Ponndorf–Verley reduction]].  Some metal-free catalytic systems have been investigated in academic research. One such system for reduction of [[ketone]]s consists of [[Tert-Butanol|''tert''-butanol]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide]] and very high temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01072a028 | title = Homogeneous Hydrogenation in the Absence of Transition-Metal Catalysts | year = 1964 | last1 = Walling | first1 = Cheves. | last2 = Bollyky | first2 = Laszlo. | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 86 | issue = 18 | pages = 3750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction depicted below describes the hydrogenation of [[benzophenone]]:

Another system for metal-free hydrogenation is based on the [[phosphine]]-[[borane]], compound '''1''', which has been called a ''[[frustrated Lewis pair]]''. It reversibly accepts dihydrogen at relatively low temperatures to form the [[phosphonium]] [[borate]] '''2''' which can reduce simple hindered [[imine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/anie.200702908 | title = Metal-Free Catalytic Hydrogenation | year = 2007 | last1 = Chase | first1 = Preston A. | last2 = Welch | first2 = Gregory C. | last3 = Jurca | first3 = Titel | last4 = Stephan | first4 = Douglas W. | journal = Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume = 46 | issue = 42 | pages = 8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[File:MetalfreehydrogenationPhosphineBorane.svg|400px|Metal free hydrogenation Phosphine Borane]]

The reduction of [[nitrobenzene]] to [[aniline]] has been reported to be catalysed by [[fullerene]], its mono-anion, atmospheric hydrogen and UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja9061097 | title = A Nonmetal Catalyst for Molecular Hydrogen Activation with Comparable Catalytic Hydrogenation Capability to Noble Metal Catalyst | year = 2009 | last1 = Li | first1 = Baojun | last2 = Xu | first2 = Zheng | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 131 | issue = 45 | pages = 16380–2 | pmid = 19845383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment used for hydrogenation==
Today's bench chemist has three main choices of hydrogenation equipment:
* Batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions
* Batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and/or pressure&lt;ref name=Apparatus&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=Roger|last2=Voorhees|first2=V.|title=Apparatus for catalytic reduction|journal=Organic Syntheses|date=1928|volume=8|page=10|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.008.0010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flow hydrogenation

===Batch hydrogenation under atmospheric conditions===
The original and still a commonly practised form of hydrogenation in teaching laboratories, this process is usually effected by adding solid catalyst to a [[round bottom flask]] of dissolved reactant which has been evacuated using [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]] gas and sealing the mixture with a penetrable rubber seal. Hydrogen gas is then supplied from a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-filled [[balloon]]. The resulting three phase mixture is agitated to promote mixing. Hydrogen uptake can be monitored, which can be useful for monitoring progress of a hydrogenation. This is achieved by either using a graduated tube containing a coloured liquid, usually aqueous [[copper sulfate]] or with [[Sight glass|gauges]] for each reaction vessel.

===Batch hydrogenation at elevated temperature and/or pressure===
Since many hydrogenation reactions such as [[hydrogenolysis]] of [[protecting groups]] and the reduction of [[aromatic]] systems proceed extremely sluggishly at atmospheric temperature and pressure, pressurised systems are popular. In these cases, catalyst is added to a solution of reactant under an inert atmosphere in a [[pressure vessel]]. Hydrogen is added directly from a cylinder or built in laboratory hydrogen source, and the pressurized slurry is mechanically rocked to provide agitation, or a spinning basket is used.&lt;ref name=Apparatus /&gt; Heat may also be used, as the pressure compensates for the associated reduction in gas solubility.

===Flow hydrogenation===
Flow hydrogenation has become a popular technique at the bench and increasingly the process scale. This technique involves continuously flowing a dilute stream of dissolved reactant over a fixed bed catalyst in the presence of hydrogen. Using established [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] technology, this technique allows the application of pressures from atmospheric to {{convert|1450|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. Elevated temperatures may also be used. At the bench scale, systems use a range of pre-packed catalysts which eliminates the need for weighing and filtering [[pyrophoric]] catalysts.

===Industrial reactors===
Catalytic hydrogenation is done in a [[Plug flow reactor model|tubular plug-flow reactor]] (PFR) packed with a supported catalyst. The pressures and temperatures are typically high, although this depends on the catalyst. Catalyst loading is typically much lower than in laboratory batch hydrogenation, and various promoters are added to the metal, or mixed metals are used, to improve activity, selectivity and catalyst stability. The use of nickel is common despite its low activity, due to its low cost compared to precious metals.

Gas Liquid Induction Reactors (Hydrogenator) are also used for carrying out catalytic hydrogenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0009-2509(82)80171-1 | title = Mechanically agitated gas–liquid reactors | year = 1982 | last1 = Joshi | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Pandit | first2 = A.B. | last3 = Sharma | first3 = M.M. | journal = Chemical Engineering Science | volume = 37 | issue = 6 | pages = 813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15503">[[File:Deep injection well.jpg|thumb|right|Deep injection well for disposal of hazardous, industrial and municipal wastewater; a "Class I" well under USEPA regulations.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt;]]
An '''injection well''' is a device that places fluid deep underground into [[porous rock]] formations, such as sandstone or limestone, or into or below the shallow [[soil]] layer. The fluid may be [[water]], [[wastewater]], [[brine]] (salt water), or water mixed with chemicals.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC| url=http://www.epa.gov/uic/general-information-about-injection-wells |title=General Information About Injection Wells |date=2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition ==
The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) defines an injection well as "a bored, drilled, or driven shaft, or a dug hole that is deeper than it is wide, or an improved sinkhole, or a subsurface fluid distribution system".&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Well construction depends on the injection fluid injected and depth of the injection zone. Deep wells that are designed to inject [[hazardous wastes]] or carbon dioxide deep below the Earth's surface have multiple layers of protective casing and cement, whereas shallow wells injecting non-hazardous fluids into or above drinking water sources are more simply constructed.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt;

==Applications==
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
Injection wells are used for many purposes.

=== Waste disposal ===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
{{Expert-subject|Engineering|section|date=July 2010}} 
In [[waste water]] disposal, treated waste water is injected into the ground between [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impermeable]] layers of rocks to avoid polluting [[fresh water]] supplies or adversely affecting quality of receiving waters. Injection wells are usually constructed of solid walled pipe to a deep elevation in order to prevent injectate from mixing with the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Unlike outfalls or other direct disposal techniques, injection wells utilize the earth as a filter to further clean the treated wastewater before it reaches the receiving water.  This method of waste water disposal also serves to spread the injectate over a wide area, further decreasing environmental impacts.

Critics of waste water injection wells cite concerns relating to the injectate polluting receiving waters.&lt;ref name="ProPublica-Poison-Beneath"&gt;ProPublica non-profit news agency. New York, NY. [https://www.propublica.org/article/injection-wells-the-poison-beneath-us "Injection Wells: The Poison Beneath Us"] Updated 2014-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most [[environmental engineering]] professionals,{{who|date=September 2013}} however, consider waste water treatment followed by disposal through injection wells to be the most cost effective and environmentally responsible method of waste water treatment.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The only known alternatives to injection wells are direct discharge of treated waste water to receiving waters or utilization of the treated water for irrigation. Direct discharge does not disperse the water over a wide area; the environmental impact is focused on a particular segment of a river and its downstream reaches or on a coastal waterbody. Extensive irrigation is often prohibitively expensive and requires ongoing maintenance and large electricity usage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Since the early 1990s, [[Maui County]], Hawaii has been engaged in a struggle over the 3-5 million gallons per day of wastewater that it injects below the [[Lahaina]] sewage treatment plant, over the claim that the water was emerging in seeps that were causing [[algae bloom]]s and other environmental damage. After some twenty years, it was sued by environmental groups after multiple studies showed that more than half the injectate was appearing in nearby coastal waters. The judge in the suit rejected the County's arguments, potentially subjecting it to millions of dollars in federal fines. A 2001 consent decree required the county to obtain a water quality certification from the Hawaii Department Of Health, which it failed to do until 2010, after the suit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilbeat.com/2014/07/federal-judge-rejects-maui-county-arguments-on-lahaina-plant-violations/#comments |title=Federal Judge Rejects Maui County Arguments on Lahaina Plant Violations |publisher=Civil Beat |date= |accessdate=2014-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil and gas production===
{{see|Enhanced oil recovery|Hydraulic fracturing}}
Another use of injection wells is in [[natural gas]] and [[petroleum]] [[Extraction of petroleum|production]]. Steam, [[carbon dioxide]], water, and other substances can be [[water injection (oil production)|injected into an oil-producing unit]] in order to maintain [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] pressure, heat the oil or lower its viscosity, allowing it to flow to a producing well nearby.&lt;ref name="EPA Class II"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/uic/class-ii-oil-and-gas-related-injection-wells "Class II Oil and Gas Related Injection Wells."] Updated 2015-10-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waste site remediation===
Yet another use for injection wells is in [[environmental remediation]], for cleanup of either [[soil contamination|soil]] or [[groundwater contamination]].  Injection wells can insert clean water into an [[aquifer]], thereby changing the direction and speed of groundwater flow, perhaps towards [[extraction well]]s downgradient, which could then more speedily and efficiently remove the contaminated groundwater.  Injection wells can also be used in cleanup of soil contamination, for example by use of an ozonation system. Complex [[hydrocarbons]] and other contaminants trapped in soil and otherwise inaccessible can be broken down by [[ozone]], a highly reactive gas, often with greater cost-effectiveness than could be had by digging out the affected area. Such systems are particularly useful in built-up urban environments where digging may be impractical due to overlying buildings.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. New York, NY (2003-04-17). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/6427a6b7538955c585257359003f0230/7bfcdcd6fef70da285257163005c159c!OpenDocument "EPA Announces Cleanup Plan for Contaminated Soil and Ground Water at Central Islip Superfund Site."] Example of use of ozonation wells for remediation ''in situ.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquifer recharge===
Recently the option of [[Groundwater recharge|refilling natural aquifers]] with injection or percolation has become more important, particularly in the driest region of the world, the [[MENA]] region (Middle East and North Africa).&lt;ref&gt;H2O magazine (2010-10-16). [http://www.h2ome.net/en/2010/10/strategic-reserve/ "Strategic reserve"] by Anoop K Menon''&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface runoff can also be recharged into [[dry well]]s, or simply barren wells that have been modified to functions as cisterns.&lt;ref&gt;H2O magazine (2011-05-03). [http://www.h2ome.net/en/2011/05/recharging-dry-wells/ "Recharging dry wells."] by Nicol-André Berdellé''&lt;/ref&gt; These hybrid [[stormwater]] management systems, called [[recharge well]]s, have the advantage of aquifer recharge and instantaneous supply of potable water at the same time. They can utilize existing infrastructure and require very little effort for the modification and operation. The activation can be as simple as inserting a polymer cover (foil) into the well shaft. Vertical pipes for conduction of the overflow to the bottom can enhance performance. The area around the well acts as funnel. If this area is maintained well the water will require little purification before it enters the cistern.&lt;ref&gt;Prototype-Creation (2011-04-20). [http://www.prototype-creation.de/recharge_wells.pdf "Recharge wells and ASR."] by Nicol-André Berdellé''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal energy===
Injection wells are used to tap [[geothermal energy]] in hot, porous rock formations below the surface by injecting fluids into the ground, which is heated in the ground, then extracted from adjacent wells as fluid, steam, or a combination of both. The heated steam and fluid can then be utilized [[geothermal power|to generate electricity]] or directly for [[geothermal heating]].&lt;ref name="EERE pamphlet"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geothermal Technologies Program: Tapping the Earth’s energy to meet our heat and power needs |url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy04osti/36025.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy |accessdate=2 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fitch and Matlick 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fitch |first1=David |last2=Matlick |first2=Skip |title=Gold, silver and Other Metals in scale—  Puna Geothermal Venture, Hawaii |journal=GRC  Transactions |date=2008 |volume=32 |pages=385-388 |url=http://pubs.geothermal-library.org/lib/grc/1028353.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Direct uses"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gill |first1=Andrea T. |title=Prospective Direct Use Enterprises in Kapoho, Hawaii |url=https://energy.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Prospective-Direct-Use-Enterprises-in-Kapoho-Hawaii.pdf |publisher=Hawaii Dept. of Business, Economic Development and Tourism, Strategic Industries Division |accessdate=2 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory requirements==
In the United States, injection well activity is regulated by EPA and state governments under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]] (SDWA).&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; EPA has issued Underground Injection Control (UIC) regulations in order to protect drinking water sources.&lt;ref name="EPA Regs"&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/uic/underground-injection-control-regulations "Underground Injection Control Regulations."] Updated 2015-10-05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EPA. (July 2001). [http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=2000E99H.PDF "Technical Program Overview: Underground Injection Control Regulations."] Document no. EPA 816-R-02-025.&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA regulations define six classes of injection wells. Class I wells are used for the injection of municipal and industrial wastes beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class II wells are used for the injection of fluids associated with oil and gas production, including waste from hydraulic fracturing. Class III wells are used for the injection of fluids used in mineral [[solution mining]] beneath underground sources of drinking water. Class IV wells, like Class I wells, were used for the injection of hazardous wastes but inject waste into or above underground sources of drinking water instead of below. EPA banned the use of Class IV wells in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/uic/class-iv-shallow-hazardous-and-radioactive-injection-wells |title=Class IV Shallow Hazardous and Radioactive Injection Wells |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-09-06 |website=Underground Injection Control |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Class V wells are those used for all non-hazardous injections that are not covered by Classes I through IV. Examples of Class V wells include stormwater drainage wells and [[Septic drain field|septic system leach fields]]. Finally, Class VI wells are used for the injection of carbon dioxide for [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]], or long term storage.&lt;ref name="EPA Basicinfo"/&gt; Currently, there are no Class VI wells in operation, but 6 to 10 wells are expected to be in use by 2016.

==Injection-induced earthquakes==
[[File:Cumulative induced seismicity.png|thumbnail|Cumulative number of earthquakes in the central U.S. The red cluster at the center of the map shows an area near Oklahoma which experienced the largest increase in activity since 2009.]]
{{see also|Induced seismicity#Waste_disposal_wells|label 1=Induced seismicity § Waste disposal wells}}
A July 2013 study by US Geological Survey scientist William Ellsworth links earthquakes to wastewater injection sites. In the four years from 2010-2013 the number of earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater in the central and eastern United States increased dramatically. After decades of a steady earthquake rate (average of 21 events/year), activity increased starting in 2001 and peaked at 188 earthquakes in 2011, including [[2011 Oklahoma earthquake|a record-breaking 5.7-magnitude earthquake]] near [[Prague, Oklahoma]] which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma. USGS scientists have found that at some locations the increase in seismicity coincides with the injection of wastewater in deep disposal wells. Injection-induced earthquakes are thought to be caused by pressure changes due to excess fluid injected deep below the surface and are being dubbed “man-made” earthquakes.&lt;ref name="Man-Made Earthquakes Update"&gt;USGS. [http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/man-made-earthquakes/ "Man-Made Earthquakes Update"] Updated January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On September&amp;nbsp;3, 2016, [[2016 Oklahoma earthquake|a 5.8-magnitude earthquake]] occurred near [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]], followed by nine aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within three and one-half hours. The earthquake broke the previous record set five years earlier. Tremors were felt as far away as [[Memphis, Tennessee]], and [[Gilbert, Arizona]]. [[Mary Fallin]], the Oklahoma governor, declared a local emergency and shutdown orders for local disposal wells were ordered by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_MIDWEST_EARTHQUAKE Record tying Oklahoma earthquake felt as far away as Arizona], ''[[Associated Press]], Ken Miller, September 3, 2016.

Retrieved 4 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Results of ongoing multi-year research on induced earthquakes by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) published in 2015 suggested that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma, such as the 1952 magnitude 5.5 El Reno earthquake may have been induced by deep injection of waste water by the oil industry.&lt;ref name="usgs_2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=4362#.Vj-sOpTIxku |title=A Century of Induced Earthquakes in Oklahoma? |last1=Hough |first1=Susan E. |last2=Page |first2=Morgan |date=October 20, 2015 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=November 8, 2015 |quote=Several lines of evidence further suggest that most of the significant earthquakes in Oklahoma during the 20th century may also have been induced by oil production activities. Deep injection of waste water, now recognized to potentially induce earthquakes, in fact began in the state in the 1930s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Tramiel''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|ə|'|m|ɛ|l|}} {{Respell|trə|MEL}}; born '''Idek Trzmiel'''; December 13, 1928&amp;nbsp;– April 8, 2012) was a [[Polish American]] [[businessman]], best known for founding [[Commodore International]].&lt;ref name="Terdiman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9832092-52.html|title=Woz, meet Jack Tramiel|last=Terdiman|first=Daniel |publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commodore PET]], [[Commodore VIC-20]] and [[Commodore 64]] are some [[home computer]]s produced while he was running the company. Tramiel later formed [[Atari Corporation]] after he purchased the remnants of the original [[Atari, Inc.]] from its parent company.

==Early years==
Tramiel was born as Idek Trzmiel&lt;ref name="BirthDetails"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jackandthemachine.com/jack-tramiel/#jack-tramiel-birth | title = Jack Tramiel: Birth Details | last = Schmüdde | first = D. | date = 26 April 2016 | website = Jack and the Machine: An Interactive Documentary | access-date = 13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tramiel"&gt;http://tramiel.org/poland/poland6.html&lt;/ref&gt; (some sources also list Juda Trzmiel, Jacek Trzmiel, or Idek Tramielski) into a Jewish family, the son of Abram Josef Trzmiel and Rifka Bentkowska.&lt;ref name="BirthDetails" /&gt;

After the [[Nazi Germany|German]] invasion of Poland in 1939 his family was transported by German occupiers to [[Łódź Ghetto|the Jewish ghetto in Łódź]], where he worked in a garment factory. When the ghettos were liquidated, his family was sent to the [[Auschwitz]] [[concentration camp]]. He was examined by [[Josef Mengele]] and selected for a work party, after which he and his father were sent to the labor camp Ahlem near [[Hanover]],&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/finance-obituaries/9205839/Jack-Tramiel.html&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother remained at Auschwitz. Like many other inmates, his father was reported to have died of [[typhus]] in the work camp; however, Tramiel believed he was killed by an injection of [[gasoline]]. Tramiel was rescued from the labor camp in April 1945 by the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Infantry Division]] of the US army.

On 10 November 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jackandthemachine.com/jack-tramiel/#jack-tramiel-immigration | title = Jack Tramiel: American Immigration | last = Schmüdde | first = D. | date = 13 June 2016 | website = Jack and the Machine: An Interactive Documentary | access-date = 13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tramiel immigrated to the [[United States]]. He soon joined the U.S. Army, where he learned how to repair office equipment, including [[typewriter]]s.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/&gt;

==Commodore==
{{Main|Commodore International}}

===Typewriters and calculators===
In 1953, while working as a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver, Tramiel bought a shop in the [[Bronx]] to repair office machinery,&lt;ref name="Up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commodore.ca/history/company/chronology_portcommodore.htm|title=Chronological History of Commodore Computer|publisher=Up &amp; Running Technologies Incorporated|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; securing a $25,000 loan for the business from a U.S. Army entitlement.&lt;ref name="Up &amp; Running Technologies Incorporated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commodore.ca/history/people/1989_you_dont_know_jack.htm|title=You Don't Know Jack!|publisher=Running|accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named it '''Commodore Portable Typewriter'''. Tramiel wanted a military-style name for his company, but names such as Admiral and General were already taken, so he settled on the Commodore name.&lt;ref name="pcmag"&gt;{{cite news

In 1955, Tramiel signed a deal with a Czechoslovak typewriter manufacturer [[Zbrojovka Brno|Zbrojovka Brno NP]] to assemble and sell their typewriters in North America. However, as Czechoslovakia was part of the [[Warsaw Pact]], they could not be imported directly into the U.S., so Tramiel used parts from Zbrojovka's Consul typewriters and set up '''Commodore Business Machines''' in [[Toronto, Ontario]], Canada.&lt;ref name="Up"/&gt; After Zbrojovka began developing their own hardware Commodore signed an agreement in 1962 with Rheinmetall-Borsig AG and began to sell Commodore portable typewriters made from the parts of older Rheinmetall-Borsig typewriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oztypewriter.blogspot.com/2013/05/rheinmetall-portable-typewriters.html|title=oz.Typewriter: Rheinmetall Portable Typewriters|last=Messenger|first=Robert|date=2013-05-03|website=oz.Typewriter|access-date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962, Commodore went public, but the arrival of Japanese typewriters in the U.S. market made the selling of Czechoslovakian typewriters unprofitable. Struggling for cash, the company sold 17% of its stock to Canadian businessman [[Irving Gould]], taking in $400,000&lt;ref name="Up"/&gt; and using the money to re-launch the company in the [[adding machine]] business,&lt;ref&gt;In 1962, he bought Feiler, a German company producing adding machines (see  [http://www.commodore.ca/commodore-history/early-history-of-jack-tramiels-commodore/ Early  history of Jack Tramiels-Commodore])&lt;/ref&gt; which was profitable for a time before the Japanese entered that field as well. Stung twice by the same source, Gould suggested that Tramiel travel to Japan to learn why they were able to outcompete North Americans in their own local markets. It was during this trip that Tramiel saw the first digital calculators, and decided that the mechanical adding machine was a dead end.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commodore.ca/history/company/early_commodore_history.htm|title=Early Commodore History!|publisher=Running|accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Commodore released its first calculators, combining an LED display from [[Calculator#Pocket calculators|Bowmar]] and an [[integrated circuit]] from [[Texas Instruments]] (TI), it found a ready market. However, after slowly realizing the size of the market, TI decided to cut Commodore out of the middle, and released their own calculators at a price point below Commodore's cost of just the chips. Gould once again rescued the company, injecting another $3 million, which allowed Commodore to purchase [[MOS Technology|MOS Technology, Inc.]] an [[Integrated circuit|IC]] design and [[semiconductor fabrication plant|semiconductor manufacturer]], a company which had also supplied Commodore with calculator ICs.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; When their lead designer, [[Chuck Peddle]], told Tramiel that calculators were a dead end and computers were the future, Tramiel told him to build one to prove the point.

===Home computers===
Peddle responded with the [[Commodore PET]], based on his company's [[MOS Technology 6502]] processor. It was first shown, privately, at the Chicago Consumer Electronics Show in 1977, and soon the company was receiving 50 calls a day from dealers wanting to sell the computer.&lt;ref name=early/&gt; The PET became a success—especially in the education field, where its all-in-one design was a major advantage. Much of their success with the PET came from the business decision to sell directly to large customers, instead of selling to them through a dealer network. The first PET computers were sold primarily in Europe, where Commodore had also introduced the first wave of digital handheld calculators.&lt;ref name=early/&gt;

As prices dropped and the market matured, the monochrome (green text on black screen) PET was at a disadvantage in the market when compared to machines like the [[Apple II]] and [[Atari 800]], which offered color graphics and could be hooked to a [[television]] as an inexpensive display. Commodore responded with the [[VIC-20]], and then the [[Commodore 64]], which became the best-selling home computer of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9449764/Commodore-64-at-30-computing-for-the-masses.html "Commodore 64 at 30: computing for the masses"], The Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt; The Commodore VIC-20 was the first computer to sell one million units. The Commodore 64 sold several million units. It was during this time that Tramiel coined the phrase, "We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://retro.ign.com/articles/105/1057252p2.html "Gamer Decades: The 1980s"], IGN&lt;/ref&gt; An industry executive attributed to Tramiel the discontinuation of the [[TI-99/4A]] home computer in 1983, after the company had lost hundreds of millions of dollars, stating that "TI got suckered by Jack".&lt;ref name="ahl198403"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1984-03/Creative_Computing_v10_n03_1984_Mar#page/n31/mode/2up | title=Texas Instruments | work=Creative Computing | date=March 1984 | accessdate=6 February 2015 | author=Ahl, David H. | pages=30–32 | authorlink=David H.

===Departure===
Gould had controlled the company since 1966. He and Tramiel often argued, but Gould usually let Tramiel run Commodore by himself. Tramiel was a micromanager who did not believe in budgets; he wanted to approve every expense greater than $1,000, which meant that operations stopped when Tramiel went on vacation.&lt;ref name="maher20130728"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.filfre.net/2013/07/a-computer-for-every-home/ | title=A Computer for Every Home? | work=The Digital Antiquarian | date=2013-07-28 | accessdate=10 July 2014 | author=Maher, Jimmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Osborne]] wrote in 1981:&lt;ref name="osborne19810413"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dj4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP42&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Portable Osborne | work=InfoWorld | date=1981-04-13 | accessdate=1 January 2015 | author=Osborne, Adam | pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Jack Tramiel has built a large and profitable organization by offering a capable product. Tramiel definitely plays hardball, but he deserves credit for what he has been able to accomplish.}}

Tramiel angrily left a 13 January 1984 meeting of Commodore's board of directors led by chairman Gould, and never returned to the company. What happened at the meeting remains unclear.{{r|maher20130728}} Neil Harris, editor of ''[[Commodore Magazine]]'' at the time, recalled:

{{quote|Well, came that fateful [[Consumer Electronics Show|C.E.S. show]] in January of '84 — a very strange press conference. Jack Tramiel got on stage in front of a whole ballroom full of press people to make the announcement that in the calendar year of 1983, Commodore had sold more than a billion dollars worth of products. Just phenomenal. In three years the company had grown from under $100 million to over a billion dollar corporation. Just unbelievable growth. A success story. But Jack was on stage and he didn't look like a happy man, and Jack was not someone to hide his emotions generally — it just seemed strange for some of us in the back of the room. Three days after the show, Jack announced that he was resigning from the company. Apparently there had been some falling out between him and the chairman of the board, Irving Gould, and from that day on the company was not the same place.&lt;ref name="DAK54"&gt;{{cite news | first = Marty | last = Herzog | date = January 1988 | title = Neil Harris | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 41–51 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tramiel later said that he had resigned from Commodore because he disagreed with Gould "on the basic principles — how to run the company".&lt;ref&gt;(1985). {{YouTube|id=NImJFV3wH88#t=9m25s|title=Jack Tramiel Interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their disagreement was so bitter that, after Tramiel's departure, ''Commodore Magazine'' was forbidden to quote Tramiel or mention his name.&lt;ref name="DAK54"/&gt; ''[[Ahoy!]]'' wrote after his departure that although Tramiel's "obsession with controlling the cost of every phase of the manufacturing process" had led to record profits during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|home computer price war]], his "inflexible one-man rule" had resulted in poor dealer relations and "a steady turnover of top executives at Commodore". The magazine concluded "it has become increasingly clear that the company is just too big for one man, however talented, to run".&lt;ref name="leemon198405"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_05_1984-05_Ion_International_US#page/n43/mode/2up | title=The Future of Commodore? | work=Ahoy! | date=May 1984 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | author=Leeman, Sheldon | pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a question and answer session at CommVEx v11 (July 18, 2015), Leonard Tramiel finally revealed to the crowd, what really transpired between Jack and Irving Gould during the 1984 [[Consumer Electronics Show|C.E.S. show]] resulting in Tramiel leaving Commodore:&lt;ref name="commvex"&gt;{{Citation|last=BIOSJERBIL|title=Bil Herd and Leonard Tramiel at CommVEx v11 2015|date=2015-09-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfJzMAyDh_I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4080|accessdate=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 13th January 1984 during a meeting with Irving, Jack told Irving that treating the assets of the company as his own and using them for personal use was wrong. He said to Irving, "you can't do that while I'm still president" to which Irving responded by saying "Goodbye". Three days after the show, Jack announced to the public that he was resigning from the company.&lt;ref name="commvex"/&gt;

In an interview with [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]] on 1998-04-13 Tramiel said "Business is war, I don't believe in compromising, I believe in winning." &lt;ref name=mvpr&gt;{{Citation |author= |accessdate=2016-03-23 |date=1998-04-13 |publication-date=2009-04-29 |title=movieprop.com's atari video game pages |url=https://www.movieprop.com/videogames/atari/people.htm |quote="Business is war, I don't believe in compromising I believe in winning." |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319033900/http://movieprop.com/videogames/atari/people.htm |archivedate=2016-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Atari==
{{Main|Atari Corporation}}

After a short break from the computer industry, he formed a new company named Tramel Technology, Ltd., in order to design and sell a next-generation home computer.&lt;ref name="purchase info"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was named "Tramel" to help ensure that it would be pronounced correctly (i.e., "tra - mel" instead of "tra - meal").&lt;ref name="Takahashi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2007/12/20/a_few_words_with_jack_tramiel_and_the_commodore_64_gang/|title=A few words with Jack Tramiel and the Commodore 64 gang|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|publisher=Media News Group|accessdate=2008-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612061146/http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2007/12/20/a_few_words_with_jack_tramiel_and_the_commodore_64_gang/|archivedate=2009-06-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1984, Tramel Technology bought the Consumer Division of [[Atari| Atari Inc.]] from [[Time Warner|Warner Communications]].&lt;ref name="purchase info" /&gt; The division had fallen on hard times due to the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game crash of 1983]].&lt;ref name="NGen11"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=75 Power Players: The Family|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=11|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=November 1995|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TTL was then renamed Atari Corporation, and went on to produce the 16/32-bit [[Atari ST]] computer line based on [[Motorola]]'s [[Motorola 68000 family|MC68000]] [[CPU]], directly competing with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], which also used it. Under Tramiel's direction, the Atari ST was a considerable success in Europe, and globally in the professional music market.&lt;ref name="NGen11"/&gt;

Despite successfully shipping the ST, Tramiel's poor personal reputation hurt Atari. One retailer said in 1985 about the ST that because of its prior experience with Tramiel "Our interest in Atari is zero, zilch".&lt;ref name="maremaa19850603"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8C4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Atari Ships New 520 ST | work=InfoWorld | date=1985-06-03 | accessdate=19 July 2014 | author=Maremaa, Tom | pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A software company executive said "Dealing with Commodore was like dealing with Attila the Hun.

Letter |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Tramiel decided to step away from day-to-day operations at Atari, naming his son, Sam, President and CEO. In 1995, Sam suffered a heart attack, and his father returned to oversee operations. In 1996, Tramiel sold Atari to disk-drive manufacturer [[JT Storage|Jugi Tandon Storage]] in a [[reverse merger]] deal. The newly merged company was named JTS Corporation, and Tramiel joined the JTS board.

==Later years==
Tramiel was a co-founder of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], which was opened in 1993. He was among many other survivors of the Ahlem labor camp who tracked down U.S. Army veteran [[Vernon Tott]], who was among the [[84th Division (United States)|84th Division]] which rescued survivors from the camp and had taken and stored photographs of at least 16 of the survivors. Tott, who died of cancer in 2003, was personally commemorated by Tramiel with an inscription on one of the Holocaust Museum's walls saying "To Vernon W. Tott, My Liberator and Hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14661020|title = Holocaust Survivors Honor Camp Liberator|date = September 25, 2007|author = Susan Stamberg|publisher = NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tramiel retired in 1996 and moved to [[Monte Sereno, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/11/jack-tramiel Jack Tramiel obituary | Technology | The Guardian] Retrieved 2016-12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

LESKER COMPANY Company Profile |publisher=Bioportfolio.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The John Morris Group principally serves the [[life sciences]], [[vacuum]] research, [[Environmental Science and Research|environmental]], [[Petroleum industry|petroleum]], [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Pharmaceutical sciences|pharmaceutical]] industries.

==History==
With original roots in Holland for 2 generations - John Morris Scientific was founded in April 1956 by John Leon Wyzenbeek and Morris Garlick to supply Australian research laboratories with quality products not available in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coleparmer.johnmorris.com.au/t/history |title=From Humble Beginnings... &amp;#124; Cole Parmer Lab Supplier John Morris |publisher=Coleparmer.johnmorris.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323052504/http://coleparmer.johnmorris.com.au/t/history|archivedate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original roots stem back to John's wife Hetty. Her father owned and ran a second generation, chemical and glassware distributor in Holland which was forced into closure during the second world war. The shell of this company was sold after the war and the proceeds were used to establish new roots in Australia.

After working for a range of established Australian Scientific Instrument distributors including Townsend Mercer John Leon Wyzenbeek began a partnership with Morris Garlic leveraging the relationships from Hetty's childhood.

Since inception, three generations of the Wyzenbeek family have worked in John Morris Scientific. At present, John's son Norbert is Chairman of the Board and Norbert's eldest son Andre is the Managing Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoshowsky |first=Robert |url=http://www.businessinfocus.com.au/index.php/2013/08/john-morris-scientific-pty-ltd/ |title=John Morris Scientific Pty Ltd &amp;#124; Business In Focus Magazine |publisher=Businessinfocus.com.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the early days, John would ride a bicycle to customers selling glassware until he had enough orders to place a shipment with his European suppliers. In 1987 John Morris transitioned from ''Glassware and Chemicals'' into instrumentation – investing in product specialist staff and service infrastructure. John Morris Scientific maintains knowledge of the latest technologies by providing personnel with regular factory training, attending vendors’ facilities regularly and through involvement in key industry events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studentadmin.mq.edu.au/docs/SciPrizes.pdf|title=Faculty of Science |accessdate=November 13, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301024327/https://studentadmin.mq.edu.au/docs/SciPrizes.pdf |archivedate=March 1, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This company is the only third generation, privately owned, scientific instrument supplier in the South West Pacific region. John Morris Scientific has remained under the same family ownership for over 60 years.

In 2016 John Morris Scientific changed its name to the John Morris Group to better reflect their growth and diversification into technical industries outside of the Laboratory.

==Service and training==
Their technical services team is composed of 5 graduate application engineers, 15 product specialists and 15 technical engineers. These staff are regularly factory trained on specific instrumentation ensuring that their knowledge remains current. The John Morris Group team share expertise through user training (with installation) and ongoing support specific to application requirements.

[[File:Splitting logs with a gas powered log splitter.JPG|thumb|upright|A woman using a gas powered log splitter to split [[firewood]].]]
A '''log splitter''' is a piece of machinery or equipment used for splitting [[firewood]] from [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]] logs that have been pre-cut into sections (rounds), usually by chainsaw or on a saw bench. Many log splitters consist of a [[hydraulic]] or electrical [[piston rod|rod and piston]] assembly and these are often rated by the tons of [[force]] they can generate. The higher the force rating, the greater the thickness or length of the rounds that can be split. The log splitter consists of all four major hydraulic components.

Most log splitter models for home use have a rating around 10 tons, but professional hydraulic models may exert 30 tons of force or more. There are also manual log splitters, which use mechanical [[lever]]age to force logs through a sharpened blade assembly; and screw or 'corkscrew' types that are driven directly from an agricultural tractor's [[power take-off]] shaft where the splitter is mounted on the three point linkage.

==Power source==
[[File:Croco log splitter.jpg|thumb|A Croco log splitter attached to a Kobelco excavator in [[Jyväskylä]], Finland.]]
A simple log splitter may be powered by an electric motor driving a hydraulic pump or by [[gasoline engine|gasoline]] or [[diesel engine]] with or without a tractor. The non-electric versions can be used remotely where the splitter can be moved to the location of the cut wood source. [[Wood splitting|Split logs]] can then be loaded into trucks, trailers or [[Flexible intermediate bulk container|bulk bags]].

No matter what the power source, a log splitter either uses a hydraulic piston to drive the log through a stationary blade or a rotating cone shaped screw mandrel that pulls the log up over a wedge. Some models have attachments that prevent the split logs from falling to the ground allowing the operator to reposition the logs quickly for a second pass on the log splitter. Some cone or screw splitters are mounted on steel platforms mounted on a 3-point linkage that allow the log to be repeatedly split into smaller pieces without putting the wood down and up again.

==Uses==
Although smaller firewood splitters are intended for home, there are now many commercial units available. Some commercial splitters are part of a 'firewood processor' that saw logs of timber into lengths, split them, and then carry the wood up an inclined conveyor onto a pile or into a bag, truck or trailer. Specialty producers such as those producing [[maple syrup]] use units that split 4 foot lengths. Machines that split and point wood for fence post also exist though they are few in number as it is generally safer and more convenient to saw the posts.

The rising cost of domestic heating gas oil has reawakened a desire for alternative fuel sources and burning wood is carbon neutral. Modern wood burning stoves are efficient and safe. Many consumers that would not have considered splitting their own logs a few years ago are now burning wood fuel for both ecological and economical reasons.

==Safety==
[[File:Dampffest Bochum 01.ogg|thumb|right|Video of a vintage steam-powered log splitter in Germany]] 
Although a good log splitter can save the operator hours of labor, it is not possible to make it completely safe. Only trained adults should operate a log splitter, since anything caught between the log and the splitting blade will be subjected to a force of at least 10 tons. Most hydraulic machines now have 'two handed operation' for safety which means that both of the operator's hands are needed to actuate the splitter thus keeping them out of the way of the moving blade.

The behavior of each log cannot be predicted, so a [[safety]] zone should be established around the splitter to prevent injury from flying splinters of wood. Helpers can pick up the individual pieces of firewood, but should not stand near the log splitter while it is in operation.

===Integration===
The integrating activities have two levels:&lt;ref name=med/&gt; 
#The [[project management]] is a task for the steering committee composed with the project leader, a manager by sub-project, and a manager by Mediterranean country. This steering committee will meet in a regular way to plan the actions, to solve the difficulties and evaluate the results. This steering committee will be assisted by a technical committee in charge with the implementation of the actions in each sub-project and by a technical advisor in charge with the evaluation of the deliverables.
#Transversal activities of the sub-projects are constituted by the training of the trainers, the realisation of the technological platform, the realisation of the study on competencies, the animation of the network development and the actions of dissemination and timelessness of the project activities.

The '''Medici Oriental Press''' (also '''Typographia Medicea''') was a press established by [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand de Medici]] in the 16th century. This press produced some of the earliest books printed in [[Arabic]]. The press was active from 1584 to 1614.&lt;ref name="Saliba"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gd7pl1x387cC&amp;pg=PA202 ''A shared legacy: Islamic science East and West'' by G. Saliba p.202]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The press initially benefited from the oriental manuscripts contributed by [[Ignatius Nemet Allah I]], Patriarch of the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], then in exile in [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="Saliba"/&gt; 

The Medici Oriental Press published Christian religious works in oriental languages, such as the [[Gospels]] which were printed in Arabic in 1591,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk5TA0sfERIC&amp;pg=PA27 ''Modern Arabic literature'' by Muḥammad Muṣṭafá Badawī,M. M. Badawi p.27]&lt;/ref&gt; with the objective of converting [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2YcouJuKiC0C&amp;pg=PA143 ''Islam in Britain, 1558-1685'' by Nabil I. Matar p.143 Note 89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Press also produced scientific books in the original Arabic language, possibly for European scientist to gain direct access to Arabic works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Boc0JjGRPF0C&amp;pg=PA229 ''Islamic science and the making of the European Renaissance'' by George Saliba p.229]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4gQV2V01Y6UC&amp;pg=PA30 ''First globalization: the Eurasian exchange, 1500 to 1800'' by Geoffrey C. Gunn]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Press received from the Pope a [[monopoly]] to print books in "foreign languages".&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OFX9wInwnR4C&amp;pg=PA528 ''Asia in the making of Europe: Volume II, A century of wonder'' p.528]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Granjon]] of Paris (who also worked for the ''Typographia Vaticana'') was employed to cut Oriental typefaces, and [[Giovan Battista Raimondi]] from [[Cremona]] was designated as the manager of the Press.&lt;ref name="Asia"/&gt;

__NOTOC__
The '''modifiable areal unit problem''' ('''MAUP''') is a source of [[statistical bias]] that can significantly impact the results of [[statistical hypothesis test]]s. MAUP affects results when point-based measures of spatial phenomena are [[Aggregate data|aggregated]] into districts, for example, [[population density]] or [[illness rate]]s. The resulting summary values (e.g., totals, rates, proportions, densities) are influenced by both the shape and scale of the aggregation unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://support.esri.com/other-resources/gis-dictionary/term/MAUP|title=MAUP {{!}} Definition - Esri Support GIS Dictionary|website=support.esri.com|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, census data may be aggregated into county districts, census tracts, postcode areas, police precincts, or any other arbitrary spatial partition. Thus the results of data aggregation are dependent on the mapmaker's choice of which "modifiable areal unit" to use in their analysis. A census [[choropleth map]] calculating population density using state boundaries will yield radically different results than a map that calculates density based on county boundaries. Furthermore, census district boundaries are also subject to change over time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/boundary-changes.html|title=Geographic Boundary Change Notes|last=Geography|first=US Census Bureau|website=www.census.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning the MAUP must be considered when comparing past data to current data.

== Background ==
The issue was first recognized by Gehlke and Biehl in 1934&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gehlke|Biehl|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later described in detail in a famous article by [[Stan Openshaw|Openshaw]] (1984) and in the book by Arbia (1988). In particular, Openshaw (1984) observed that "the areal units (zonal objects) used in many geographical studies are arbitrary, modifiable, and subject to the whims and fancies of whoever is doing, or did, the aggregating".&lt;ref name = openshaw3&gt;{{Harvnb|Openshaw|1983|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is especially apparent when the aggregate data are used for cluster analysis for [[spatial epidemiology]], [[spatial statistics]] or [[choropleth map]]ping, in which misinterpretations can easily be made without realizing it. Many fields of science, especially [[human geography]] are prone to disregard the MAUP when drawing inferences from statistics based on aggregated data.{{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed for science in general, and specifically for human geography|date=January 2018}}  MAUP is closely related to the topic of [[ecological fallacy]] and ecological bias (Arbia, 1988).

Ecological bias caused by MAUP has been documented as two separate effects that usually occur simultaneously during the analysis of aggregated data. The scale effect causes variation in statistical results between different levels of aggregation. Therefore, the association between variables depends on the size of areal units for which data are reported. Generally, correlation increases as areal unit size increases. The zone effect describes variation in correlation statistics caused by the regrouping of data into different configurations at the same scale.

Since the 1930s, research has found extra variation in statistical results because of the MAUP. The standard methods of calculating within-group and between-group variance do not account for the extra variance seen in MAUP studies as the groupings change. MAUP can be used as a methodology to calculate upper and lower limits as well as average regression parameters for multiple sets of spatial groupings.

== Suggested solutions ==

Several suggestions have been made in literature to reduce aggregation bias during [[regression analysis]].  A researcher might correct the variance-covariance matrix using samples from individual-level data.&lt;ref&gt;Holt D, Steel D, Tranmer M, Wrigley N. (1996). “Aggregation and ecological effects in geographically based data.” “Geographical Analysis” 28:244{261&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, one might focus on local spatial regression rather than global regression. A researcher might also attempt to design areal units to maximize a particular statistical result.&lt;ref name = openshaw3/&gt; Others have argued that it may be difficult to construct a single set of optimal aggregation units for multiple variables, each of which may exhibit non-stationarity and spatial autocorrelation across space in different ways. Others have suggested developing statistics that change across scales in a predictable way, perhaps using fractal dimension as a scale-independent measure of spatial relationships. Others have suggested Bayesian hierarchical models as a general methodology for combining aggregated and individual-level data for ecological inference.

Studies of the MAUP based on empirical data can only provide limited insight due to an inability to control relationships between multiple spatial variables. Data simulation is necessary to have control over various properties of individual-level data.  Simulation studies have demonstrated that the spatial support of variables can affect the magnitude of ecological bias caused by spatial data aggregation.&lt;ref name=swift2008 /&gt;

== MAUP sensitivity analysis ==
{{Primary sources|section|date=August 2018}}
Using simulations for univariate data, Larsen advocated the use of a Variance Ratio to investigate the effect of spatial configuration, spatial association, and data aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, J. (2000). "The Modifiable Areal Unit Problem: A problem or a source of spatial information?" PhD thesis, Ohio State University.&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed description of the variation of statistics due to MAUP is presented by Reynolds, who demonstrates the importance of the spatial arrangement and spatial autocorrelation of data values.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, H. (1998). "The Modifiable Area Unit Problem: Empirical Analysis By Statistical Simulation." PhD thesis, Department of Geography University of Toronto, http://www.badpets.net/Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; Reynold’s simulation experiments were expanded by Swift, who in which a series of nine exercises began with simulated regression analysis and spatial trend, then focused on the topic of MAUP in the context of spatial epidemiology. A method of MAUP sensitivity analysis is presented that demonstrates that the MAUP is not entirely a problem.&lt;ref name=swift2008&gt;Swift, A., Liu, L., and Uber, J. (2008) "Reducing MAUP bias of correlation statistics between water quality and GI illness." Computers, Environment and Urban Systems 32, 134–148&lt;/ref&gt; MAUP can be used as an analytical tool to help understand spatial heterogeneity and [[spatial autocorrelation]].

This topic is of particular importance because in some cases data aggregation can obscure a strong [[correlation]] between variables, making the relationship appear weak or even negative. Conversely, MAUP can cause random variables to appear as if there is a significant association where there is not. Multivariate regression parameters are more sensitive to MAUP than correlation coefficients. Until a more analytical solution to MAUP is discovered, spatial sensitivity analysis using a variety of areal units is recommended as a methodology to estimate the uncertainty of correlation and regression coefficients due to ecological bias. An example of data simulation and re-aggregation using the ArcPy library is available.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, A. (2017).

In transport planning, MAUP is associated to Traffic Anaisis Zoning (TAZ). A major point of  departure in understanding problems in transportation analysis is the recognition that spatial  analysis has some limitations associated with the discretization of space. Among them,  modifiable areal units and boundary problems are directly or indirectly related to  transportation planning and analysis through the design of traffic analysis zones (TAZs) - most of transport studies require directly or indirectly the definition of TAZs. The modifiable boundary and the scale issues should all be given specific attention during the  specification of a TAZ because of the effects these factors exert on statistical and  mathematical properties of spatial patterns (ie the modifiable areal unit problem—MAUP).  In the studies of Viegas, Martinez and Silva (2009, 2009b)&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; the authors propose a method where the results obtained from the study of spatial data are not independent of the scale, and the aggregation effects are implicit in the choice of zonal boundaries. The delineation of zonal boundaries of TAZs has a direct impact on the reality and accuracy of the results obtained from transportation forecasting models. In this paper the MAUP effects on the TAZ definition and the transportation demand models are measured and analyzed using different grids (in size and in origin location). This analysis was developed by building an application integrated in commercial GIS software and by using a case study (Lisbon Metropolitan Area) to test its implementabiity and performance. The results reveal the conflict between statistical and geographic precision, and their relationship with the loss of information in the traffic assignment step of the transportation planning models.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4133">A '''nanoelectromechanical systems mass spectrometer''' ('''NEMS-MS''') is an instrument measuring the mass of analyte particles by detecting the frequency shift caused by the adsorption of the particles on a [[Nanoelectromechanical systems|NEMS]] resonator.

NEMS-MS was invented by Prof. [[Michael Roukes]] and Dr. Kamil Ekinci at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1999.

First attainment of attogram-scale mass sensitivity was documented in their 2001 patent disclosure. Successive NEMS-MS sensitivity milestones were reported by the Caltech researchers in publications appearing in 2004 (attogram-scale sensitivity)

'''Pickling''' is the process of [[food preservation|preserving]] or extending the lifespan of [[food]] by either [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]] in [[brine]] or immersion in [[vinegar]]. The resulting food is called a ''pickle'', or, to prevent ambiguity, prefaced with ''pickled''. The pickling procedure will typically affect the food's texture and flavor. In [[East Asia]], [[vinaigrette]] ([[vegetable oil]] and vinegar) is also used as a pickling medium. Foods that are pickled include meats, fruits, eggs, and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chou|first=Lillian|title=Chinese and Other Asian Pickles|url=http://www.flavorandfortune.com/dataaccess/article.php?ID=426|work=Flavor and Fortune (Fall 2003 Volume)|publisher=Institute for the Advancement of the Science And Art Of Chinese Cuisine|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinguishing characteristic is a [[pH]] of 4.6 or lower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mda.state.mn.us/food/business/factsheets/picklebill.htm|title=Pickle Bill Fact Sheet|date=13 March 2008|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313102803/http://www.mda.state.mn.us/food/business/factsheets/picklebill.htm|archivedate=13 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is sufficient to kill most bacteria. Pickling can preserve [[Decomposition|perishable]] foods for months. [[Antimicrobial]] herbs and spices, such as [[mustard seed]], [[garlic]], [[cinnamon]] or [[clove]]s, are often added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 154497 | pmid=12732572 | volume=69 | issue=5 | title=Antimicrobial effects of mustard flour and acetic acid against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium | journal=Appl Environ Microbiol | pages=2959–63 | last1 = Rhee | first1 = MS | last2 = Lee | first2 = SY | last3 = Dougherty | first3 = RH | last4 = Kang | first4 = DH | doi=10.1128/aem.69.5.2959-2963.2003| year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the food contains sufficient moisture, a pickling brine may be produced simply by adding dry salt. For example, [[Germany|German]] [[sauerkraut]] and [[Korea]]n [[kimchi]] are produced by salting the [[vegetable]]s to draw out excess water. Natural fermentation at room temperature, by [[lactic acid bacteria]], produces the required acidity. Other pickles are made by placing vegetables in vinegar. Like the [[canning]] process, pickling (which includes fermentation) does not require that the food be completely [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]] before it is sealed.  The acidity or salinity of the solution, the temperature of fermentation, and the exclusion of oxygen determine which microorganisms dominate, and determine the flavor of the end product.&lt;ref name=McGee1&gt;McGee, Harold (2004). ''[[On Food and Cooking|On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen]]''. New York: Scribner, pp. 291–296. {{ISBN|0-684-80001-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When both salt concentration and temperature are low, ''[[Leuconostoc mesenteroides]]'' dominates, producing a mix of acids, alcohol, and aroma compounds.  At higher temperatures ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' dominates, which produces primarily [[lactic acid]]. Many pickles start with ''Leuconostoc'', and change to ''Lactobacillus'' with higher acidity.&lt;ref name=McGee1/&gt;

==History==
The exact origins of pickling are unknown, but the [[Mesopotamia|ancient Mesopotamians]] may have used the process around 2400 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/hungry-history/pickles-throughout-history-2|title=Pickles Throughout History|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pickling was used as a way to preserve food for out-of-season use and for long journeys, especially by sea. [[Salt pork]] and [[salt beef]] were common [[staple food|staples]] for sailors before the days of steam engines. Although the process was invented to preserve foods, pickles are also made and eaten because people enjoy the resulting flavors. Pickling may also improve the nutritional value of food by introducing [[B vitamins]] produced by bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploratorium.edu/cooking/pickles/history.html|title=Science of Pickles: Fascinating Pickle Facts - Exploratorium|website=Exploratorium: the museum of science, art and human perception|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The term ''pickle'' is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word ''pekel'', meaning ''brine''. In the U.S. and Canada, and sometimes Australia and New Zealand, the word ''pickle'' alone almost always refers to a pickled cucumber, except when it is used figuratively. It may also refer to other types of pickles such as "pickled onion", "pickled cauliflower", etc. In the UK, pickle, as in a "[[cheese and pickle sandwich]]", may also refer to [[Ploughman's pickle]], a kind of [[chutney]].

==Popularity of pickles around the world==

===Asia===
{{Main|Chinese pickles|Mixed pickle|South Asian pickles|Tursu}}

====South Asia====
{{main|South Asian pickles}}
South Asia has a large variety of pickles (known as ''achar'' (आचार) in Assamese, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, ''uppinakaayi'' in Kannada, ''lonacha'' (लोणचं) in Marathi, ''uppilittathu'' or ''achar'' in [[Malayalam]],   ''oorukai'' in Tamil, ''ooragaya'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]), which are mainly made from varieties of mango, [[Preserved lemon|lemon]], [[Pickled lime|lime]], goongura(a sour leafy shrub), tamarind and Indian gooseberry (amla), chilli. Vegetables such as eggplant, carrots, cauliflower, tomato, bitter gourd, green tamarind, ginger, garlic, onion, and citron are also occasionally used. These fruits and vegetables are generally mixed with ingredients like salt, spices, and vegetable oils and are set to mature in a moistureless medium.

In [[Pakistan]], pickles are known locally as ''achaar'' (in [[Urdu]]) and come in a variety of flavors. A popular item is the traditional mixed [[Hyderabadi pickle]], a common delicacy prepared from an assortment of fruits (most notably mangoes) and vegetables blended with selected spices.

In [[Sri Lanka]], ''achcharu'' is traditionally prepared from carrots, onions, and ground dates that are mixed with mustard powder, ground pepper, crushed ginger, garlic, and vinegar, and left to sit in a clay pot.

====Southeast Asia====
{{see | acar}}
[[Singapore]], [[Indonesia]]n and [[Malaysia]]n pickles, called ''acar'', are typically made out of cucumber, carrot, bird's eye chilies, and shallots, these items being seasoned with vinegar, sugar and salt. Fruits, such as papaya and pineapple, are also sometimes pickled.

In the [[Philippines]], ''achara'' is primarily made out of green papaya, carrots, and shallots, with cloves of garlic and vinegar. Other versions could include ginger, bell peppers, [[Daikon|white radishes]], cucumbers or bamboo shoots. Separately, in some provinces, unripe mangoes or ''burong mangga'', unripe tomatoes, [[Psidium guajava|guavas]], [[jicama]], bitter gourd and other fruit and vegetables are also pickled. [[Siling labuyo]], sometimes with garlic and red onions, are also pickled in bottled vinegar. The spiced vinegar itself is a staple [[Philippine condiments|condiment]] in [[Philippines|Filipino]] cuisine.

[[File:Dưa cải muối.JPG|thumb|left|{{lang|vi|Dưa cải muối}} made from {{lang|vi|[[Brassica juncea|cải bẹ xanh]]}}]]

In [[Vietnamese cuisine]], vegetable pickles are called {{lang|vi|dưa muối}} ("salted vegetables") or {{lang|vi|dưa chua}} ("sour vegetables"). {{lang|vi|Dưa chua}} or {{lang|vi|dưa góp}} is made from a variety of fruits and vegetables, including {{lang|vi|[[Solanum macrocarpon|cà pháo]]}}, [[eggplant]], [[Napa cabbage]], [[kohlrabi]], [[carrot]]s, radishes, [[papaya]], [[cauliflower]], and {{lang|vi|[[Ficus racemosa|sung]]}}. {{lang|vi|Dưa chua}} made from carrots and radishes are commonly added to {{lang|vi|[[bánh mì]]}} sandwiches. {{lang|vi|Dưa cải muối}} is made by pressing and sun-drying vegetables such as {{lang|vi|[[Brassica juncea|cải bẹ xanh]]}} and [[bok choy]]. {{lang|vi|Nhút mít}} is a specialty of [[Nghệ An Province|Nghệ An]] and [[Hà Tĩnh Province|Hã Tĩnh]] provinces made from [[jackfruit]].

In [[Burma]], tea leaves are pickled to produce [[lahpet]], which has strong social and cultural importance.

[[File:Gimchi.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Kimchi]] is a very common side dish in Korea.]]

====East Asia====
[[China]] is home to a huge variety of pickled vegetables, including [[radish]], ''[[Chinese cabbage|baicai]]'' (Chinese cabbage, notably ''[[suan cai]]'', ''[[kimchi|la bai cai]]'', ''[[pao cai]]'', and [[Tianjin preserved vegetable]]), ''[[zha cai]]'', [[chili pepper]], and [[Pickled cucumber|cucumber]]s, among many others.

[[Japan]]ese ''[[tsukemono]]'' (pickled foods) include ''[[takuan]]'' ([[daikon]]), ''[[umeboshi]]'' ([[ume]] plum), ''[[Gari (ginger)|gari]]'' &amp; ''[[beni shōga]]'' (ginger), [[Turnip (brassica rapa)|turnip]], [[cucumber]], and [[Chinese cabbage]].

The [[Korea]]n staple [[kimchi]] is usually made from pickled [[napa cabbage]] and [[radish]], but is also made from green onions, garlic stems, chives and a host of other vegetables.  Kimchi is popular throughout East Asia. [[Jangajji]] is another example of pickled vegetables.

==== Western Asia ====
[[File:Tursucu Sahne sokak beyoglu Istanbul_0644.jpg|thumb|[[Torshi]], traditional pickles in [[Balkan cuisine|Southeast Europe]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Western Asia]] and the [[Caucasian cuisine|Caucasus]]]]
In [[Iranian cuisine|Iran]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkey]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab countries]], the [[Balkan cuisine|Balkans]], and the [[Caucasian cuisine|Caucasus]], pickles (called [[torshi]] in [[Persian language|Persian]], ''turşu'' in [[Turkish language]] and ''mekhallel'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) are commonly made from [[turnips]], peppers, carrots, green [[olive]]s, cucumbers, cabbage, green tomatoes, [[Preserved lemon|lemon]]s, and [[cauliflower]].

===Europe===

====Central and Eastern Europe====
[[File:Coriander Seed.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coriander]] seeds are one of the spices popularly added to pickled vegetables in Europe.]]
In [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungary]] the main meal ''(lunch)'' usually goes with some kind of pickles ''(savanyúság)'' but they are commonly consumed at other times of the day too. The most commonly consumed pickles are [[sauerkraut]] ''(savanyú káposzta)'', the different kinds of [[Pickled cucumber#Hungarian|pickled cucumbers]] and [[Pickled pepper|peppers]] and ''csalamádé'' but tomatoes, carrots, beetroot, baby corn, onions, garlic, certain squashes and melons and a few fruits like plums and apples are used to make pickles too. Stuffed pickles are specialties usually made of peppers or melons pickled after being stuffed with a cabbage filling. Pickled plum stuffed with garlic is a unique Hungarian type of pickle just like ''csalamádé'' and leavened cucumber ''(kovászos uborka)''. ''Csalamádé'' a type of [[mixed pickle]] made of cabbage, cucumber, paprika, onion, carrot, tomatoes and bay leaf mixed up with vinegar as the fermenting agent. Leavened cucumber, unlike other types of pickled cucumbers that are around all year long, is rather a [[Silly season|seasonal]] pickle produced in the summer. Cucumbers, spices, herbs and slices of bread are put in a glass jar with salt water and kept in direct sunlight for a few days. The yeast from the bread, along with other pickling agents and spices fermented under the hot sun, give the cucumbers a unique flavor, texture and slight carbonation. Its juice can be used to make a special type of [[spritzer]] ''('Újházy fröccs')'' instead of carbonated water.
It is common for Hungarian households to produce their own pickles. Different regions or towns have their special recipes unique to them. Among them all the Vecsési Sauerkraut ''(Vecsési savanyú káposzta)'' is the most famous.

[[File:Pomidor turshusu e-citizen.jpg|thumb|upright|Pickled tomatoes are common in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]]]
[[Romanian cuisine|Romanian]] pickles ([[murături]]) are made out of [[beetroot]], [[pickled cucumber|cucumbers]], green tomatoes (''gogonele''), [[carrot]]s, [[cabbage]], [[garlic]], [[sauerkraut]] (bell peppers stuffed with cabbage),  [[pickled pepper|bell peppers]], [[melon]]s, [[mushroom]]s, [[turnip]]s, [[celery]] and [[cauliflower]]. Meat, like [[pork]], can also be preserved in salt and [[lard]].

[[Polish cuisine|Polish]], [[Czech cuisine|Czech]] and [[Slovak cuisine|Slovak]] traditional pickles are cucumbers and sauerkraut, but other [[pickled fruit]]s and vegetables, including plums, [[pumpkin]]s and mushrooms are also common.

[[Russian cuisine|Russian]], [[Ukrainian cuisine|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian cuisine|Belarusian]] pickled items include beets, mushrooms, tomatoes, sauerkraut, cucumbers, [[ramsons]], [[garlic]], eggplant (which is typically stuffed with julienned carrots), custard [[Squash (fruit)|squash]], and [[watermelon]]. Garden produce is commonly pickled using salt, [[dill]], [[Blackcurrant|blackcurrant leaves]], [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]] and garlic and is stored in a cool, dark place. The leftover brine (called ''rassol'' (рассол) in [[Russian language|Russian]]) has a number of culinary uses in these countries, especially for cooking traditional soups, such as [[shchi]], [[rassolnik]], and [[solyanka]]. ''Rassol'', especially cucumber or [[sauerkraut]] rassol, is also a favorite traditional remedy against morning [[hangover]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Russian Culture'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf6tJnMjbi4C&amp;pg=PA514, pp.514-515]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern Europe====
An [[Italy|Italian]] pickled vegetable dish is [[giardiniera]], which includes onions, carrots, celery and cauliflower. Many places in southern Italy, particularly in Sicily, pickle eggplants and hot peppers.

In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]] and [[Turkey]], mixed pickles, known as ''turshi'', ''tursija'' or ''turshu'' form popular appetizers, which are typically eaten with ''[[rakia]]''. Pickled green tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, bell peppers, peppers, eggplants, and [[sauerkraut]] are also popular.

[[Turkey|Turkish]] pickles, called ''turşu'', are made out of vegetables, roots, and fruits such as peppers, cucumber, [[Armenian cucumber]], cabbage, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), carrot, [[turnip]], beetroot, green [[almond]], baby watermelon, baby cantaloupe, [[garlic]], [[cauliflower]], [[bean]] and green [[plum]]. A mixture of spices flavor the pickles.

In [[Greece]], pickles, called ''τουρσί(α)'', are made out of carrots, celery, [[eggplant]]s stuffed with diced carrots, cauliflower, [[tomato]]es, and [[Capsicum|peppers]].

====Northern Europe====
In [[British cuisine|Britain]], [[pickled onion]]s and [[pickled egg]]s are often sold in [[public house|pubs]] and [[Fish and chips|fish and chip shops]]. Pickled [[beetroot]], [[Pickled Walnuts|walnuts]], and [[gherkin]]s, and condiments such as [[Branston (brand)|Branston Pickle]] and [[piccalilli]] are typically eaten as an accompaniment to [[pork pie]]s and cold meats, sandwiches or a [[ploughman's lunch]]. Other popular pickles in the UK are pickled [[mussels]], [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s, [[red cabbage]], mango [[chutney]], [[sauerkraut]], and [[olives]]. [[Rollmops]] are also quite widely available under a range of names from various producers both within and out of the UK.

[[Pickled herring]], [[rollmops]], and [[salmon]] are popular in [[Scandinavia]]. Pickled cucumbers and red garden beets are important as [[condiment]]s for several traditional dishes. Pickled capers are also common in Scandinavian cuisine.

===United States and Canada===
[[File:GiardinieraSpicy.JPG|thumb|right|A dish of [[giardiniera]]]]

In the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[pickled cucumber]]s (most often referred to simply as "pickles" in Canada and the United States), olives, and [[sauerkraut]] are most commonly seen, although pickles common in other nations are also available.

Canadian pickling is similar to that of Britain. Through the winter, pickling is an important method of food preservation. Pickled cucumbers, onions, and eggs are common individual pickled foods seen in Canada. [[Chow-chow (food)|Chow-chow]] is a tart vegetable mix popular in the Maritime Provinces and the [[Southern United States]], similar to [[piccalilli]]. Pickled fish is commonly seen, as in Scotland. Meat is often also pickled or preserved in different brines throughout the winter, most prominently in the harsh climate of Newfoundland.

[[Giardiniera]], a mixture of pickled peppers, celery and olives, is a popular condiment in [[Chicago]] and other cities with large Italian-American populations, and is often consumed with [[Italian beef]] sandwiches. [[Pickled egg]]s are common in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]. [[Pickled herring]] is available in the [[Upper Midwest]]. [[Pennsylvania Dutch Country]] has a strong tradition of pickled foods, including chow-chow and [[Pickled beet egg|red beet eggs]]. In the Southern United States, pickled [[okra]] and [[watermelon|watermelon rind]] are popular, as are deep-fried pickles and pickled pig's feet, pickled chicken eggs, pickled quail eggs, pickled garden vegetables and pickled sausage.&lt;ref name="fried"&gt;{{cite web | last = Zeldes | first = Leah A. | title = Eat this!

Various pickled vegetables, fish, or eggs may make a side dish to a Canadian lunch or dinner. Popular pickles  in the Pacific Northwest include pickled asparagus and green beans. Pickled fruits like blueberries and early green strawberries are paired with meat dishes in restaurants. 

In the United States, National Pickle Day is recognized as a food "holiday" every year on November 14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.food.com/food-holidays/pickle-day-1114 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507180257/http://www.food.com/food-holidays/pickle-day-1114 |archivedate=2015-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico, Central America, and South America===

In the [[Mesoamerican region]] pickling is known as "encurtido" or "curtido" for short. The pickles or "curtidos" as known in Latin America are served cold, as an appetizer, as a side dish or as a tapas dish in Spain. In several Central American countries it is prepared with cabbage, onions, carrots, lemon, vinegar, oregano, and salt. In Mexico, "curtido" consists of carrots, onions, and jalapeño peppers and used to accompany meals still common in taquerias and restaurants. In order to prepare a carrot "curtido" simply add carrots to vinegar and other ingredients that are common to the region such as chilli, tomato, and onions. Varies depending on the food, in the case of sour. Another example of a type of pickling which involves the pickling of meats or seafood is the "escabeche" or "ceviches" popular in Peru, Ecuador, and throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. These dishes include the pickling of pig's feet, pig's ears, and gizzards prepared as an "escabeche" with spices and seasonings to flavor it. The ceviches consists of shrimp, octopus, and various fishes seasoned and served cold.

==Process==
[[File:Vase by Bat Trang ceramic for pickling 2.JPG|thumb|[[Bát Tràng porcelain]] vessel for pickling]]
In traditional pickling, fruit or vegetables are submerged in brine (20-40 grams/L of salt (3.2–6.4 oz/imp gal or 2.7–5.3 oz/US gal)), or shredded and salted as in [[sauerkraut]] preparation, and held underwater by flat stones layered on top.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makesauerkraut.com/fermentation-weights/ Fermentations weights] on MakeSauerkraut.com&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a lid with an airtrap or a tight lid may be used if the lid is able to release pressure which may result from [[carbon dioxide]] buildup. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildfermentation.com/aerobic-vs-anaerobic-fermentation-controversy/ Discussion] of aerobic versus anaerobic fermentation on WildFermentation.com&lt;/ref&gt; Mold or (white) kahm [[yeast#Nutrition and growth|yeast]] may form on the surface; kahm yeast is mostly harmless but can impart an off taste and may be removed without affecting the pickling process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culturesforhealth.com/learn/natural-fermentation/fermentation-equipment-choosing-the-right-supplies/ Pickling recipes], Cultures for Health, culturesforhealth.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemical pickling, the fruits or vegetables to be pickled are placed in a sterilized jar along with brine, vinegar, or both, as well as spices, and are then allowed to mature until the desired taste is obtained.

The food can be pre-soaked in brine before transferring to vinegar. This reduces the water content of the food, which would otherwise dilute the vinegar. This method is particularly useful for fruit and vegetables with a high natural water content.

In commercial pickling, a preservative such as [[sodium benzoate]] or [[EDTA]] may also be added to enhance shelf life.  In fermentation pickling, the food itself produces the preservation agent, typically by a process involving ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' bacteria that produce lactic acid as the preservative agent.

[[Alum]] is used in pickling to promote crisp texture and is approved as a food additive by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]].

"Refrigerator pickles" are unfermented pickles made by [[Marination|marinating]] fruit or vegetables in a seasoned vinegar solution. They must be stored under [[refrigeration]] or undergo canning to achieve long-term storage.&lt;ref name="then_AllP"&gt;{{Cite web| title = All Pickle Types| author = | work = thenibble.com| date = | accessdate = 2015-01-22| url = http://www.thenibble.com/reviews/main/condiments/pickles/pickle-glossary5.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese [[Tsukemono#Making_tsukemono|Tsukemono]] use a variety of pickling ingredients depending on their [[Tsukemono#Making_tsukemono|type]] , and are produced by combining these ingredients with the vegetables to be preserved and putting the mixture under pressure.

==Possible health hazards of pickled vegetables==
The [[World Health Organization]] has listed pickled vegetables as a possible [[carcinogen]], and the ''[[British Journal of Cancer]]'' released an online 2009 [[meta-analysis]] of research on pickles as increasing the risks of [[esophageal cancer]]. The report, citing limited data in a statistical meta analysis, indicates a potential two-fold increased risk of oesophageal cancer associated with Asian pickled vegetable consumption. Results from the research are described as having "high heterogeneity" and the study said that further well-designed prospective studies were warranted.&lt;ref name=metaanalysis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Islami |first=F |year=2009|title=Pickled vegetables and the risk of oesophageal cancer: a meta-analysis |url=http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/v101/n9/full/6605372a.html |journal=British Journal of Cancer |volume=101|issue=9 |pages=1641–1647|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6605372|pmid=19862003 |pmc=2778505 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their results stated "The majority of subgroup analyses showed a statistically significant association between consuming pickled vegetables and Oesophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma".&lt;ref name=metaanalysis/&gt;

The 2009 meta-analysis reported heavy infestation of pickled vegetables with [[fungi]]. Some common fungi can facilitate the formation of [[Nitroso|N-nitroso compounds]], which are strong oesophageal carcinogens in several animal models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=MH|last2=Ji|first2=C|last3=Cheng|first3=SJ|title=Occurrence of nitroso compounds in fungi‐contaminated foods: A review|journal=Nutrition and Cancer|date=1986|volume=8|issue=1|pages=63–69|doi=10.1080/01635588609513877}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roussin red methyl ester,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = J.

[[File:Preselector, Wiring diagram of a simple radio circuit.png|thumb|right|Circuit of a very simple preselector]]

A '''preselector''' is a name for an [[Electronics|electronic device]] that connects between a [[Antenna (radio)|radio antenna]] and a [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]]. The '''preselector''' is a [[band-pass filter]] that blocks troublesome out-of-tune [[Radio frequency|frequencies]] from passing through from the [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] into the [[radio receiver]] (or [[preamplifier]]) that otherwise would be directly connected to the antenna.

==Purpose==
A preselector improves the performance of nearly any receiver, but is especially helpful to receivers with broadband front-ends that are prone to overload, such as [[Scanner (radio)|scanners]] and ordinary consumer-market [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]] and [[AM expanded band|AM broadcast]] receivers. However, receivers and [[preamplifier|preamps]] get no benefit from preselection if they are fed from a narrow-band source, such as a [[Loop antenna#small_loop_ants|small loop antenna]].

[[File:Response curves for a radio receiver preselector.png|thumb|right|Frequency response curves for a simple preselector with tuning capacitor setting of 10, 30, 100, or 300&amp;nbsp;''p''F]]
A preselector typically is tuned to have a narrow [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], centered on the receiver’s operating frequency. The preselector passes through the signal on the frequency it is tuned to unchanged, or only slightly diminished, but it reduces or removes off-frequency signals, cutting down or eliminating unwanted [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. However, a preselector does ''not'' remove interference on the ''same'' frequency that it and the receiver are both tuned to.

Extra filtering can be useful because the first input stage (“front end”) of receivers contains at least one [[RF power amplifier|RF amplifier]], which has a limited capacity ([[dynamic range]]). Most radios’ front ends amplify ''all'' radio frequencies delivered to the antenna connection. So off-frequency signals constitute a load on the RF amplifier, using part of its dynamic range for unused signals. “Limited [[dynamic range]]” means that the amplifier circuits have a limit to the total amount of incoming RF energy they can handle without overloading, symptoms of which are [[Amplifier figures of merit#linearity|nonlinearity]] and ultimately [[Clipping (signal processing)|clipping]].

When the front-end overloads, the performance of the receiver is severely reduced, and in extreme cases can damage the receiver.&lt;ref name=Cutsogeorge_2014&gt;{{cite book |first=George |last=Cutsogeorge |year=2014 |title=Managing Interstation Interference with Coaxial Stubs and Filters |edition=2nd |orig-year=2009 |location=Aptos, CA |publisher=International Radio Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In situations with noisy and crowded bands, or where there are strong local stations, the dynamic range of the receiver can quickly be exceeded. Extra filtering by the preselector limits frequency range and power demands that are applied to all later stages of the receiver, only loading it with signals within the preselected band.

===Multifunction preselectors===
A preselector can be engineered so that in addition to attenuating interference from unwanted frequencies, it will perform other services which may be helpful for a receiver: It can limit input signal voltage to protect a sensitive receiver from damage caused by static discharge, nearby voltage spikes, and overload from nearby transmitters’ signals. It can also incorporate a [[preamplifier|small radio frequency amplifier]] stage to boost the filtered signal, although for typical use, amplification at the preselector is unnecessary. None of these extra conveniences is an essential part of preselection.

Antenna [[preamplifier]]s (preamps) can be made “tunable” by incorporating a front-end preselector circuit to improve their performance. The integrated device is ''both'' a preamplifier and a preselector, and either name is correct. This ambiguity sometimes leads to confusion. A ''passive preselector'' has no power and no internal amplifier, and typically works quite well with modern receivers, with negligible signal-loss.

==Bandwidth vs. signal strength trade-off==
With all preselectors there is some loss at the tuned frequency; usually, most of the loss is in the [[inductor]] (the tuning coil). Tuning the preselector for narrower [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (or [[Q factor|higher ''{{math|Q}}'']], or greater selectivity) increases this loss.

Most preselectors have separate settings for an inductor and (at least) one [[capacitor]]. So with at least two adjustments available to tune to just one frequency, there are often a variety of settings that will tune the preselector to a frequency in its middle-range.

For the narrowest bandwidth (highest ''{{math|Q}}''), the preselector is tuned using the highest inductance and lowest capacitance for the desired frequency, but this produces the greatest loss. It also requires retuning the preselector more often while searching for faint signals, to keep the preselector’s pass-through frequency closely aligned with the receiver’s working frequency.

For lowest loss (and widest bandwidth), the preselector is tuned using the lowest inductance and highest capacitance (and the lowest ''{{math|Q}}'', or least selectivity) for the desired frequency. The wider bandwidth allows interference through from more nearby frequencies, but reduces the need to retune the preselector while tuning the receiver, since any one low-inductance setting for the preselector will pass many nearby frequencies.

==Different from an antenna tuner==
Although a preselector is placed in the same location as an [[antenna tuner]], it serves a different purpose: An antenna tuner or “[[antenna tuner|transmatch]]” connects two signal lines with different [[Characteristic impedance|signal impedances]] and only blocks out-of-tune frequencies incidentally (if it blocks any at all).

A [[antenna tuner|transmatch]] matches transmitter [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]] to feedline impedance, so that signal power from the [[radio transmission|radio transmitter]] smoothly transfers into the antenna’s feed cable; a properly adjusted transmatch prevents transmitted power from being reflected back into the transmitter (called ''‘backlash current’''). Some antenna tuner circuits can both impedance match and preselect&lt;ref name=K4ERO_1999&gt;{{cite book |last=Stanley |first=John, K4ERO |year=1999 |article=The Filtuner |title=ARRL Antenna Compendium |volume=6 |location=Newington, CT |publisher=American Radio Relay League}}&lt;/ref&gt;, for example the [[Antenna tuner#SPC_tuner|''Series Parallel Capacitor'' (SPC) tuner]], and most circuits for [[Antenna tuner#Balanced line tuners|''balanced line'' (BLT) tuners]] can be adjusted to also function as [[band-pass filter]]s.

Some simpler types of [[antenna tuner]]s that are not [[band-pass filter|band-pass circuits]] can also provide limited preselection. The now-common [[Antenna tuner#High Pass T network|‘T’-network]] is a [[High-pass filter|high-pass]] circuit which always essentially eliminates frequencies ''below'' the operating frequency, and can be adjusted for high [[Q factor|operating ''{{math|Q}}'']] that might attenuate noise by as much as 20&amp;nbsp;dB ''above'' the operating frequency.&lt;ref name=K4ERO_2015&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Stanley |first=John, K4ERO |department=Technical Correspondence |title=Antenna tuners as preselectors |magazine=QST Magazine |page=61 |date=September 2015 |location=Newington, CT |publisher=American Radio Relay League}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complementary [[Pi (letter)|&lt;big&gt;‘π’&lt;/big&gt;]]-[[Antenna tuner#Pi network|network]], customarily incorporated in the final stage of ‘vintage’ [[Vacuum tube|tube]] transmitters and amplifiers, is [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]] and always essentially eliminates frequencies ''above'' the tuned frequency; it can be similarly adjusted to provide as much as 20&amp;nbsp;dB attenuation below the tuned frequency.

In [[nuclear engineering]], '''prompt criticality''' is said to be reached during a [[nuclear fission]] event if one or more of the immediate or [[prompt neutron]]s released by an atom in the event causes an additional fission event resulting in a rapid, [[exponential growth|exponential increase]] in the number of fission events. Prompt criticality is a special case of [[Critical mass|supercriticality]].

== Criticality ==
An assembly is critical if each fission event causes, on average, exactly one additional such event in a continual chain.  Such a chain is a self-sustaining fission [[nuclear chain reaction|chain reaction]]. When a [[uranium]]-235 (U-235) atom undergoes [[nuclear fission]], it typically releases between one and seven [[neutrons]] (with an average of 2.4). In this situation, an assembly is critical if every released neutron has a 1/2.4 = 0.42 = 42% probability of causing another fission event as opposed to either being absorbed by a non-fission [[Neutron capture|capture event]] or escaping from the fissile core.

The average number of neutrons that cause new fission events is called the [[nuclear chain reaction|effective neutron multiplication factor]], usually denoted by the symbols ''k-effective'', ''k-eff'' or ''k''. When ''k-effective'' is equal to 1, the assembly is called critical, if ''k-effective'' is less than 1 the assembly is said to be subcritical, and if ''k-effective'' is greater than 1 the assembly is called supercritical.

== Critical versus prompt-critical ==
In a supercritical assembly the number of fissions per unit time, ''N'', along with the power production, increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with time.  How fast it grows depends on the average time it takes, ''T'', for the neutrons released in a fission event to cause another fission.  The growth rate of the reaction is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;N(t) = N_0 k^{t/T} \,&lt;/math&gt;

Most of the neutrons released by a fission event are the ones released in the fission itself.  These are called prompt neutrons, and strike other nuclei and cause additional fissions within [[nanosecond]]s (an average time interval used by scientists in the [[Manhattan Project]] was one [[shake (unit)|shake]], or 10 nanoseconds).  A small additional source of neutrons is the [[fission product]]s.  Some of the nuclei resulting from the fission are [[radioactive isotope]]s with short [[Half-life|half-lives]], and [[nuclear reaction]]s among them release additional neutrons after a long delay of up to several minutes after the initial fission event.  These neutrons, which on average account for less than one percent of the total neutrons released by fission, are called delayed neutrons. The relatively slow timescale on which delayed neutrons appear is an important aspect for the design of nuclear reactors, as it allows the reactor power level to be controlled via the gradual, mechanical movement of control rods. Typically, control rods contain neutron poisons (substances, for example boron or hafnium, that easily capture neutrons without producing any additional ones) as a means of altering ''k-effective''. With the exception of experimental pulsed reactors, nuclear reactors are designed to operate in a delayed-critical mode and are provided with safety systems to prevent them from ever achieving prompt criticality.

In a [[delayed criticality|delayed-critical]] assembly, the delayed neutrons are needed to make ''k-effective'' greater than one.  Thus the time between successive generations of the reaction, ''T'', is dominated by the time it takes for the delayed neutrons to be released, on the order of seconds or minutes.  Therefore, the reaction will increase slowly, with a long time constant.  This is slow enough to allow the reaction to be controlled with [[electromechanical]] [[control system]]s such as [[control rod]]s, and as such all [[nuclear reactor]]s are designed to operate in the delayed-criticality regime.

In contrast, a critical assembly is said to be prompt-critical if it is critical (''k=1'') without any contribution from [[delayed neutron]]s and prompt-supercritical if it is supercritical (the fission rate growing exponentially, ''k&gt;1'') without any contribution from delayed neutrons.  In this case the time between successive generations of the reaction, ''T'', is only limited by the fission rate from the prompt neutrons, and the increase in the reaction will be extremely rapid, causing a rapid release of energy within a few milliseconds.  Prompt-critical assemblies are created by design in [[nuclear weapon]]s and some specially designed research experiments.

When differentiating between a prompt neutron versus a delayed neutron, the difference between the two has to do with the source from which the neutron has been released into the reactor. The neutrons, once released, have no difference except the energy or speed which have been imparted to them. A nuclear weapon relies heavily on prompt-supercriticality (to produce a high peak power in a fraction of a second), whereas nuclear power reactors use delayed-criticality to produce controllable power levels for months or years.

== Nuclear reactors ==
In order to start up a controllable fission reaction, the assembly must be delayed-critical. In other words, ''k'' must be greater than 1 (supercritical) without crossing the prompt-critical threshold. In nuclear reactors this is possible due to delayed neutrons. Because it takes some time before these neutrons are emitted following a fission event, it is possible to control the nuclear reaction using control rods.

A steady-state (constant power) reactor is operated so that it is critical due to the delayed neutrons, but would not be so without their contribution. During a gradual and deliberate increase in reactor power level, the reactor is delayed-supercritical. The exponential increase of reactor activity is slow enough to make it possible to control the criticality factor, ''k'', by inserting or withdrawing rods of neutron absorbing material. Using careful control rod movements, it is thus possible to achieve a supercritical reactor core without reaching an unsafe prompt-critical state.

Once a reactor plant is operating at its target or design power level, it can be operated to maintain its critical condition for long periods of time.

=== Prompt critical accidents ===
{{main article|Criticality accident}}
Nuclear reactors can be susceptible to prompt-criticality accidents if a large increase in reactivity (or ''k-effective'') occurs, e.g., following failure of their control and safety systems. The rapid uncontrollable increase in reactor power in prompt-critical conditions is likely to irreparably damage the reactor and in extreme cases, may breach the containment of the reactor. Nuclear reactors' safety systems are designed to prevent prompt criticality and, for [[Defense in depth (nuclear engineering)|defense in depth]], reactor structures also provide multiple layers of containment as a precaution against any accidental releases of [[radioactive]] [[fission products]].

With the exception of research and experimental reactors, only a small number of reactor accidents are thought to have achieved prompt criticality, for example [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl #4]], the U.S. Army's [[SL-1]], and [[Soviet Navy|Soviet]] [[Nuclear submarine|submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-431|''K-431'']]. In all these examples the uncontrolled surge in power was sufficient to cause an explosion that destroyed each reactor and released [[radioactive]] fission products into the atmosphere.

At Chernobyl in 1986, an unusual and unsafe test was performed that resulted in an overheated reactor core. This led to the rupturing of the fuel elements and water pipes, vaporization of water, a [[steam explosion]], and a [[graphite]] fire. Estimated power levels prior to the incident suggest that it operated in excess of 30 GW, ten times its 3 GW maximum thermal output. The reactor chamber's 2000-ton lid was lifted by the steam explosion. Since the reactor was not designed with a [[containment building]] capable of containing this catastrophic explosion, the accident released large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. The catastrophic fire in the graphite [[neutron moderator]] compounded the problem, sending massive amounts of radioactive debris into the atmosphere.

In the other two incidents, the reactor plants failed due to errors during a maintenance shutdown that was caused by the rapid and uncontrolled removal of at least one control rod. The [[SL-1]] was a prototype reactor intended for use by the US Army in remote polar locations. At the SL-1 plant in 1961, the reactor was brought from shutdown to prompt critical state by manually extracting the central control rod too far. As the water in the core quickly converted to steam and expanded (in just a few milliseconds), the {{convert|26000|lb|kg|adj=on}} reactor vessel jumped {{convert|9|ft|1|in|m}}, leaving impressions in the ceiling above.&lt;ref name="Tucker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Todd |title=Atomic America: How a Deadly Explosion and a Feared Admiral Changed the Course of Nuclear History|isbn=978-1-4165-4433-3 |year=2009 |publisher=Free Press |location=New York}} See summary: [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/enhancements/fy0904/2008013842-s.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ProvePrinciple15&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three men performing the maintenance procedure died from injuries. 1,100 curies of fission products were released as parts of the core were expelled. It took 2 years to investigate the accident and clean up the site. The excess prompt reactivity of the SL-1 core was calculated in a 1962 report:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf IDO-19313] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065809/http://www.id.doe.gov/foia/PDF/IDO-19313.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }} ''Additional Analysis of the SL-1 Excursion, Final Report of Progress July through October 1962'', November 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The delayed neutron fraction of the SL-1 is 0.70%… Conclusive evidence revealed that the SL-1 excursion was caused by the partial withdrawal of the central control rod. The reactivity associated with the 20-inch withdrawal of this one rod has been estimated to be 2.4% δk/k which was sufficient to induce prompt criticality and place the reactor on a 4 millisecond period.}}

In the ''K-431'' reactor accident, 10 were killed during a refueling operation. The ''K-431'' explosion destroyed the adjacent machinery rooms and ruptured the submarine's hull. In these two catastrophes, the reactor plants went from complete shutdown to extremely high power levels in a fraction of a second, damaging the reactor plants beyond repair.

==List of accidental prompt critical excursions==
A number of research reactors and tests have purposely examined the operation of a prompt critical reactor plant. [[CRAC-II|CRAC]], [[Kinetics Experiment Water Boiler reactor|KEWB]], [[SPERT-I]], [[Godiva device]], and [[BORAX experiments]] contributed to this research. However, many accidents have also occurred, primarily during research and processing of nuclear fuel. SL-1 is the notable exception.

The following list of prompt critical power excursions is adapted from a report submitted in 2000 by a team of American and Russian nuclear scientists who studied [[criticality accident]]s, published by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, the location of many of the excursions.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.csirc.net/docs/reports/la-13638.pdf A Review of Criticality Accidents]'', Los Alamos National Laboratory, LA-13638, May 2000.

== Nuclear weapons ==
{{main article|Nuclear weapon design}}
In the design of [[nuclear weapon]]s, on the other hand, achieving prompt criticality is essential. Indeed, one of the design problems to overcome in constructing a bomb is to compress the fissile materials enough to achieve prompt criticality before the chain reaction has a chance to produce enough energy to cause the core to expand.  A good bomb design must therefore win the race to a dense, prompt critical core before a less-powerful chain reaction disassembles the core without allowing a significant amount of fuel to fission (known as a [[Fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]). This generally means that nuclear bombs need special attention paid to the way the core is assembled, such as the [[Implosion-type nuclear weapon|implosion]] method invented by [[Richard C. Tolman]], [[Robert Serber]], and other scientists at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1942.

A '''rotary cutter''' is a tool generally used by [[quilter]]s to cut [[fabric]]. It consists of a handle with a circular blade that rotates, thus the tool's name. Rotary cutter blades are very sharp, can be resharpened, and are available in different sizes: usually smaller blades are used to cut small curves, while larger blades are used to cut to straight lines and broad curves. Several layers of fabric can be cut simultaneously with a sharp (fresh) blade, making it easier to cut out patchwork pieces of the same shape and size than with [[scissors]]. Quilters use rotary cutters with specially designed templates and rulers made of approximately 1/8-inch thick clear or color-tinted plastic. 

==History==
The first rotary cutter was introduced by the [[Olfa]] company in 1979 for garment making, however, it was quickly adopted by quilters. Prior to the invention of the rotary cutter, quilters traced handmade templates of the necessary shapes onto the wrong side of the fabric and added 1/4-inch seam allowances all around. Templates were often handmade of (cereal box type) cardboard and the pencil wore down the edges with repeated tracings, rendering them inaccurate; new templates would be made several times until all the patchwork pieces were cut. Pieces were usually cut one at a time with dressmaking scissors, which were often heavy and had long blades that were designed for cutting large pieces for garments but were cumbersome to use for cutting small pieces for patchwork. The rotary cutter gained almost immediate widespread use among quilters after its introduction and, along with the accompanying development of strip techniques, revolutionized quilting. 

Today there are many companies making rotary cutters. Cutters come in a variety of handle types and some include specialty blades to cut curved or zigzagged lines. Most have retractable blades that can be locked to prevent injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://quilting.about.com/od/rotarycuttingskills/bb/rotary_cutter.htm|title=Choose the Best Rotary Cutter for Your Needs|work=The Spruce Crafts|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://driffy.com/pages/quilt-and-sew-with-rotary-cutters|title=Quilting Supplies and Sewing With Rotary Cutters|website=Driffy|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal National College for the Blind''' ('''RNC''') is a [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] specialist residential college of [[further education]] based in the English city of [[Hereford]]. Students who attend the college are aged over 16 and [[blindness|blind]] or partially sighted. They can study a wide range of qualifications at RNC, from academic subjects such as English and mathematics to more vocational topics such as performing arts. Alongside regular further education subjects and vocational training, the College offers training in mobility, independent living and personal development.

Founded in 1872&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/royalnormalcolle01drfj|title=Royal Normal College for the Blind Program Pamphlets and Papers|last=Dr. F. J. Campbell|date=1870-1930|others=Perkins School for the Blind Samuel P. Hayes Research Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; in London as the Royal Normal College and Academy for the Blind, the college had a number of homes before moving to its campus in Hereford; it was renamed the Royal National College for the Blind in the late 1970s. It has been a pioneer in the education of visually impaired people in Britain since the Victorian era, and, as of 2010, is the only college for visually impaired students in the United Kingdom to have been awarded [[Beacon Status]] in recognition of its outstanding teaching and learning.

RNC hosts the UK's first VI Sports Academy, having begun as the home of the first football academy for visually impaired players and the England [[Paralympic association football|blind football]] team. It hosted the [[2010 IBSA World Blind Football Championship|2010 World Blind Football Championship]] and also served as a training facility for participants in the [[2012 Paralympic Games]]. The college is actively involved in the development of [[assistive technology]], including student participation in the Tech Novice Cafe, run for members of the public who are not confident in computer use. Two notable devices were developed at RNC; the [[Mountbatten Brailler]], an electronic braille writer, and the [[Talking Tactile Tablet|T3]], a talking tactile device that helped with the reading of maps and diagrams.

Early in the 21st century, there was dramatic departmental restructuring at the college, and a significant redevelopment and modernisation of the Hereford campus. The campus, located on Venns Lane, Hereford, is home to RNC's teaching, residential and leisure facilities. Students live in halls of residence, which enable them to gain a level of independence within the college environment. RNC operates a leisure facility, thePoint4, which is open to the public, and conferencing and hotel accommodation under the name Gardner Hall.

The college is a registered charity (number 1000388), and its [[Patron (charity)|Patron]] is [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. There are several high-profile supporters, including Dave Clarke, former captain of the England and Great Britain blind football teams. RNC has a number of notable people among its alumni, including former Home Secretary [[David Blunkett]]. The college was the subject of a 2007 film for the [[Channel 4]] ''[[Cutting Edge (Channel 4 TV series)|Cutting Edge]]'' documentary strand, which followed three students through their first term of study. The film won a 2008 [[Royal Television Society]] Award.

Originally located in two small buildings on Anerley Hill near London's [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], the college later moved to larger accommodation at Westow Street, [[Upper Norwood]] after rapidly outgrowing its original premises.&lt;ref name="RNC"/&gt; In its early days, the college was considered very progressive and experimental in its approach to education.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rncb.ac.uk/,About-28/History_of_The_Royal_National_College_for_the_Blind|title= 140 years of leading the way in specialist education for people who are blind or partially sighted|publisher= Royal National College for the Blind|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsquest"/&gt; A history of the college on its website describes the curriculum as "liberal and advanced for its day",&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; and emphasis was placed on physical activities such as swimming, cycling and roller-skating.&lt;ref name=Newsquest/&gt; Students even took part in a morning of tobogganing following a heavy fall of snow.&lt;ref name=Newsquest/&gt; By the end of the 19th century, the college had over 200 students.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; Until the [[Second World War]] the college admitted 11- to 15-year-olds, but in 1945 the principal of RNC and headmaster of [[New College Worcester|Worcester College for the Blind]] came to an agreement that Worcester would provide secondary education and RNC would take students over the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= An experiment in education: the history of Worcester College for the Blind, 1866–1966|first= Donald|last= Bell|year= 1967|publisher= Hutchinson Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being one of its founders, Francis Joseph Campbell served as RNC's first principal, from 1871 until his retirement in 1912.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; He was knighted as a [[Knight Bachelor]] by [[King Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1909,&lt;ref name="Tennessee"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28275|date=30 July 1909|page=5805}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his services to blind people.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt; He was succeeded by his son, Guy Marshall Campbell, and following his death in 1929 Guy's widow, Louie Bealby Campbell took over the position.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The role of principal passed outside the Campbell family for the first time upon Louie Bealby Campbell's retirement in 1934.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

===Relocation===
[[File:Rowton Castle - geograph.org.uk - 51756.jpg|thumb|right|Rowton Castle, near Shrewsbury, Shropshire, seen in 2005. RNC moved to Rowton during the Second World War and was based there until the late 1970s.|alt=A large brick building built in the style of a medieval castle; grass, bushes and some trees in the foreground.]]

In the 20th century, the college moved location several times before establishing itself at its present campus in Hereford. The first of these moves occurred at the beginning of the [[Second World War]], when the college was evacuated from its London site and moved to a mansion named [[Great Maytham Hall|Great Maytham]] in [[Rolvenden]] in west Kent.&lt;ref name="Newsquest"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://archive.thisisherefordshire.co.uk/2003/9/18/29476.html|title= Assisting the blind to reach their full potential|work= Hereford Times|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|date= 18 September 2003|accessdate= 26 November 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the threat of a German invasion, the authorities soon advised another move, and this time, with 24 hours notice and the help of the [[Royal London Society for the Blind|London Society for the Blind]], a temporary home was found for RNC in [[Dorton]], near [[Aylesbury]], [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsquest"/&gt; At the time of the move most of the students were on holiday, although some thirty had remained at the college along with several staff members.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

The college did not return to London because the Upper Norwood site&amp;nbsp;– which was being used as a hospital following RNC's move to Kent&amp;nbsp;– was bombed in 1940 during [[the Blitz]],&lt;ref name="RNC"/&gt; then acquired by the authorities.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The college had to close temporarily, until a permanent new home could be found, but in 1941 it purchased new premises at [[Rowton Castle]] near [[Shrewsbury]] and relocated there.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rowton"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/features/schooled-for-scandal-and-blind-ambition.shtml?|title= Schooled for scandal and blind ambition|first= Ian|last= Macrae|work= BBC News|publisher= BBC|date= 4 December 2004|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowtoncastle.com/history/full/index.aspx|title= Rowton Castle history|publisher= Rowton Castle|accessdate=27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castle was built in the 17th Century and is situated in {{convert|17|acre|m2}} of grounds six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) west of Shrewsbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowtoncastle.com/|title= Welcome to Rowton Castle Hotel &amp; Restaurant|publisher= Rowton Castle|accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This accommodation had limited space, and throughout its time in Shrewsbury RNC acquired other premises in and around the town. Albrighton Hall, about three miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from Shrewsbury, was acquired in 1955 and adapted for residential and training purposes for male students, and Hardy House was obtained as a new residential area for female students in 1958.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Plans to enlarge the Rowton site were seriously affected when, in 1953, fire destroyed much of the buildings and 38 pianos and organs.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; The alarm was raised by one of the students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.expressandstar.com/millennium/1900/1950-1975/1953.html|title= Our Century|work= Express &amp; Star|publisher= Midland News Association|date= 2 June 1953|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and everybody present was evacuated to safety.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Training was able to continue after Henshaw's Institution for the Blind took students and staff as a temporary measure.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

RNC remained in [[Shropshire]] for many years until, in 1978, more suitable accommodation was found that would enable RNC to consolidate its teaching and residential accommodation into one campus, and the college moved to its current home in Hereford.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newsquest"/&gt; The site had previously been the campus of [[Hereford College of Education]], a former teacher training college.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt; In 1978 the college adopted its present name, the Royal National College for the Blind.&lt;ref name="Visugate"&gt;{{cite book|title= New Beacon, January 1996|first= Ann|last= Lee|publisher= RNIB publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNC was opened at its new campus by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], who arrived in Hereford by helicopter to perform the ceremony in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/features/thislife/3847419.Many_happy_returns__Charles___remember_when_you_visited_us_/|title= Many happy returns, Charles&amp;nbsp;– remember when you visited us?|work= Worcester News|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|date= 14 November 2008|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNC was the subject of a 2007 documentary for the [[Channel Four]] series ''[[Cutting Edge (Channel 4 TV series)|Cutting Edge]]'', which followed three young students (Steve Markham, Daniel Angus and Selina Litt)&lt;ref name=LSC&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.lscnews.com/issue5/article8|title= Yorkshire teenagers star in Channel 4 documentary|publisher= LSC News|date= July 2005|accessdate= 28 November 2009|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110713235105/http://www.lscnews.com/issue5/article8|archivedate= 13 July 2011|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; during their first term at the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1049474|Blind Young Things}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2007/04/blind_young_things.html|title= Blind Young Things|work= BBC Online|publisher= BBC|date= 27 April 2007|accessdate=23 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film examines their individual journeys towards greater independence as they encounter the unique challenges that being visually impaired presents,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; as well as how they deal with the everyday issues that affect all teenagers, such as sex, relationships, partying and their future plans after graduation.&lt;ref name=LSC/&gt; The documentary, ''[[Blind Young Things]]'', was first aired on 30 April 2007,&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1717684.ece|title= Tonight's TV|work= Times Online|publisher= News International|format= subscription required|date= 30 April 2007|accessdate=13 January 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Chater}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won a [[Royal Television Society]] award for Channel Four and the Cutting Edge team in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/3221775.Hereford_students__key_role_for_Blind_Young_Things/|title= Hereford students' key role for Blind Young Things|work= Hereford Times|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|date= 21 July 2008|accessdate=27 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 the college became the permanent home of the National [[BlindArt]] Collection, a collection of paintings, sculptures, installations and other works of art designed to engage all the senses and to provide people who are visually impaired with greater accessibility to art.&lt;ref name=BlindArt&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art71711|title= National BlindArt Collection moves into Royal National College for the Blind|publisher= Culture24|date= 15 September 2009|accessdate=24 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 RNC announced that it had been forced to send a third of its students home following an outbreak of [[2009 flu pandemic in the United Kingdom|swine flu]] on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.herefordtimes.com/news/4747736.Students_with_swine_flu_at_Hereford_College_sent_home/|title= Students with swine flu at Hereford's Royal National College for the Blind sent home|work= Hereford Times|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|first= Jess|last= Childs|date= 19 November 2009|accessdate=24 November 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Winter of 2009–2010 in Europe|heavy winter snowfall of 2009–2010]] the college's sports facilities were utilised by the [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] team for training after the bad weather conditions made using their own grounds at [[Edgar Street]] difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/sport/4841864.Car_park_rescues_training/|title= Car park rescues training|work= Worcester News|publisher= Newsquest Media Ltd|date= 9 January 2010|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restructuring===
In the late 2000s RNC underwent significant restructuring as it responded to changes in the world of employment and therefore the courses that it offered its students.&lt;ref name="Changes"/&gt; However, some of the college's changes provoked criticism from staff and students who argued these were not in RNC's best interest.&lt;ref name="In Touch"/&gt; There was some controversy over the college's decision to reduce the availability of courses in piano tuning, traditionally regarded as a secure profession for visually impaired people, while fears were expressed that the decrease in A Level subjects would lead to RNC becoming a sport rather than an academic orientated college.&lt;ref name="UCU1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Changes"/&gt; Responding to these concerns in July 2008, the then principal Christine Steadman told ''In Touch'', the [[BBC Radio 4]] news programme for visually impaired listeners; "It's about what the local authorities, what the learning and skills council, what the Welsh Assembly for government will purchase from us. And at the moment we are reducing a small number of A Level courses but at the same time we're extending other courses, for example we've got level 3 Braille being taught for the first time at the college, we're not cutting A Levels, we're just responding to the needs of the learners that are coming through our doors."&lt;ref name=Changes/&gt; In an interview in January 2010, the then principal Geoff Draper said that piano tuning would be taught at the college if there was a demand for it, and suggested RNC could look to bringing in international students to fill places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/20100112-it.rtf|title= BBC Radio 4 In Touch|work= BBC Online|publisher= BBC|first= Peter|last= White|date= 12 January 2010|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The changes led to significant department reorganisations within RNC, with several dozen staff members being summarily dismissed without explanation; some were replaced by volunteers. A number of former college employees made complaints regarding the manner in which their employment was ended.&lt;ref name="Changes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Insulted"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ucu.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=3403|title= Royal National College for the Blind 'insulted and degraded' staff|publisher= University and College Union|date= 11 July 2008|accessdate=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008 the college lecturers union, the [[University and College Union]], called for greater consultation between management and staff at the college.&lt;ref name=TES1&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2644205|title= College for blind snubs union|publisher= Times Educational Supplement|date= 4 July 2008|accessdate= 22 January 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051910/http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2644205|archive-date= 10 June 2011|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in a 2009 interview with ''In Touch'' Ian Pickford, who was brought in as interim principal following Christine Steadman's departure, claimed that the atmosphere of the college had changed and issued a challenge to any student or member of staff who was still unhappy to meet with him to discuss their concerns.&lt;ref name=WhiteVisit/&gt;

Financial concerns were raised in 2009 over the cost of the new leisure complex, and because of a change in the source of student funding from the [[Learning and Skills Council]] to [[Local Education Authority|Local Education Authorities]]. The college was facing a shortfall of at least £500,000 in 2009 and its auditors expressed doubt about RNC's ability to continue as a going concern.&lt;ref name=WhiteVisit&gt;{{cite web|url= http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/20090519_it_royalcollegeforblind.rtf|title= BBC Radio 4 In Touch|work= BBC Online|publisher= BBC|first= Peter|last= White|date= 19 May 2009|accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Ian Pickford said that much of thePoint4's costs had been paid for through donations and that the shortfall issue was being addressed through cutbacks, including some redundancies.&lt;ref name=WhiteVisit/&gt; Of the auditors' concerns he said; "I think post the banking crisis a lot of auditors are incredibly nervous about making bland statements in terms of the future of organisations and therefore they frequently now put those sort of caveats in to protect their position going forward."&lt;ref name=WhiteVisit/&gt;

==Assistive technology==
The college is actively involved in the development and use of [[assistive technology]] to aid [[visual impairment|visually impaired]] people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the [[Talking Tactile Tablet|T3]] (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps.&lt;ref name="T3"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.worcesternews.co.uk/archive/2007/04/19/Health+%28hereford_news_health%29/1337514.College_breaks_new_ground/|title= College breaks new ground|publisher= Worcester News|date= 18 April 2007|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed.&lt;ref name=T3b&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/4782052.stm|title= College creates new touch device|work= BBC News|publisher= BBC|date= 7 March 2006|accessdate=8 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses.

The assessment typically includes an evaluation of a person's level of vision, their mobility and independence skills, any residential support they may require, basic literacy and numeracy skills tests, and an interview with the leader of the course they wish to take.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rncb.ac.uk/,Study,Younger_Students-5/Assessment_Process_at_The_Royal_National_College_for_the_Blind_RNC|title= The Assessment Process (Pre-entry Assessment)|publisher= Royal National College for the Blind|accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally courses in Piano Tuning and Piano Technology were also available at the college. However, these were significantly reduced in the late 2000s because of a decline in the number of students studying the subjects. There has also been a reduction in the number of A-levels available for study owing to changes in the types of courses that education funding bodies supporting students at RNC are willing to pay for.&lt;ref name="Changes"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch_20080708.shtml|title= BBC Radio 4 In Touch|author= White, Peter|publisher= [[BBC Online]]|date= 8 July 2008|accessdate=20 November 2008|authorlink= Peter White (broadcaster)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In Touch"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/intouch_20081104.shtml|title= BBC Radio 4 In Touch

[[Image:Sansewer.jpg|thumb|PVC sanitary sewer installation. Sanitary sewers are sized to carry the amount of sewage generated by the collection area. Sanitary sewers are much smaller than combined sewers designed to also carry [[surface runoff]].]]

A '''sanitary sewer''' or '''foul sewer''' is an underground pipe or tunnel system for transporting [[sewage]] from houses and [[Commercial building|commercial buildings]] (but not [[stormwater]]) to [[sewage treatment|treatment]] facilities or disposal. Sanitary sewers are part of an overall system called a sewage system or [[sewerage]].

Sewage may be treated to control [[water pollution]] before discharge to [[surface water]]s.&lt;ref name="Metcalf1922"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E4ybw1sOIk8C|title=Sewerage and Sewage Disposal: A Textbook|last2=Eddy|first2=Harrison P.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1922|isbn=|location=New York|page=|pages=|last1=Metcalf|first1=Leonard|authorlink=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staley1899"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jT81AAAAMAAJ|title=The Separate System of Sewerage, Its Theory and Construction|last2=Pierson|first2=George S.|publisher=Van Nostrand|year=1899|isbn=|location=New York|page=|pages=|last1=Staley|first1=Cady|authorlink=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanitary sewers serving industrial areas also carry [[industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]].

Separate sanitary sewer systems are designed to transport sewage alone. In municipalities served by sanitary sewers, separate [[storm drain]]s may convey [[surface runoff]] directly to surface waters. Sanitary sewers are distinguished from [[combined sewer]]s, which combine sewage with [[stormwater]] runoff in one pipe. Sanitary sewer systems are beneficial because they avoid [[Combined sewer#Combined sewer overflows (CSOs)|combined sewer overflows]].

== Background ==
[[Sewage treatment]] is less effective when sanitary waste is diluted with stormwater, and combined sewer overflows occur when runoff from heavy rainfall or [[snowmelt]] exceeds the hydraulic capacity of [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plants]].&lt;ref name="EPARTC"&gt;
{{cite report |date=August 2004 |title=Report to Congress: Impacts and Control of CSOs and SSOs |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2004-npdes-cso-report-congress |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-833-R-04-001 |page=ES-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome these disadvantages, some cities built separate sanitary sewers to collect only municipal wastewater and exclude stormwater runoff collected in separate storm drains. The decision between a combined sewer system or two separate systems is mainly based on need for sewage treatment and cost of providing treatment during heavy rain events. Many cities with combined sewer systems built prior to installing sewage treatment have not replaced those sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |date=1972 |title=Wastewater Engineering: collection, treatment, disposal |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Wastewater_engineering_collection_treatm.html?id=fhpSAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher=McGraw–Hill |page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Orfice.jpg|thumb|Interior of a large sanitary sewer viewed from an access manhole.]]

In the developed world, sewers are [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]] from buildings to one or more levels of larger underground trunk mains, which transport the sewage to [[sewage treatment]] facilities. Vertical pipes, usually made of [[precast concrete]], called [[manhole]]s, connect the mains to the surface. Depending upon site application and use, these vertical pipes can be [[Cylinder|cylindrical]], [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentric]], or [[Concentric objects|concentric]]. The manholes are used for access to the sewer pipes for inspection and maintenance, and as a means to vent sewer gases. They also facilitate vertical and horizontal angles in otherwise straight pipelines. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.acu-tech.com.au/systems/acu-sewer/|title=Acu-Sewer Pressure Pipe for Sewer Mains {{!}} Acu-Tech Piping Systems|work=Acu-Tech Piping Systems|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pipes conveying sewage from an individual building to a common gravity sewer line are called laterals. Branch sewers typically run under streets receiving laterals from buildings along that street and discharge by gravity into trunk sewers at manholes. Larger cities may have sewers called '''interceptors''', receiving flow from multiple trunk sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |editor1-last=Lee |editor1-first=C.C. |title=Environmental Engineering Dictionary |edition=4th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f1lnQwrvOSEC&amp;lpg=PA707&amp;dq=%22interceptor%20sewer%22%20glossary&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q=interceptor%20sewer&amp;f=false |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Government Institutes |page=423 |date=2005 |isbn=9780865878488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asce"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Design and Construction of Sanitary and Storm Sewers |url= |publisher=American Society of Civil Engineers and Water Pollution Control Federation |location=New York |pages=2, 288 |date=1969 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design and sizing of sanitary sewers considers the population to be served over the anticipated life of the sewer, per capita wastewater production, and flow peaking from timing of daily routines. Minimum sewer diameters are often specified to prevent blockage by solid materials flushed down toilets; and gradients may be selected to maintain flow velocities generating sufficient turbulence to minimize solids deposition within the sewer. Commercial and industrial wastewater flows are also considered, but diversion of surface runoff to storm drains eliminates wet weather flow peaks of inefficient combined sewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tyler |first=Richard G. |authorlink = |title =Civil Engineering Handbook |publisher =McGraw-Hill |volume =Section 9 |edition =Fourth |date =1959 |location =New York |pages =1–24 |isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Force mains === 
Pumps may be necessary where gravity sewers serve areas at lower elevations than the sewage treatment plant, or distant areas at similar elevations. A lift station is a sewer sump that lifts accumulated sewage to a higher elevation. The pump may discharge to another gravity sewer at that location or may discharge through a pressurized force main to some distant location.&lt;ref name="asce" /&gt;

=== Effluent sewer ===
{{see also|Effluent sewer}}
Effluent sewer systems, also called septic tank effluent drainage (STED) or solids-free sewer (SFS) systems, have [[septic tank]]s that collect [[sewage]] from residences and businesses, and the effluent that comes out of the tank is sent to either a centralized [[sewage treatment]] plant or a distributed treatment system for further treatment. Most of the solids are removed by the septic tanks, so the treatment plant can be much smaller than a typical plant. In addition, because of the vast reduction in solid waste, a pumping system can be used to move the wastewater rather than a gravity system. The pipes have small diameters, typically {{convert|1.5|to|4|in|cm|0}}. Because the waste stream is pressurized, they can be laid just below the ground surface along the land's contour.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Simplified sewer ===
{{see also|Simplified sewerage}}
Simplified sanitary sewers consist of small-diameter pipes, typically around {{convert|100|mm|in|0}}, often laid at fairly flat gradients (1 in 200). Although the investment cost for simplified sanitary sewers can be about half the cost of conventional sewers, the requirements for operation and maintenance are usually higher. Simplified sewers are most common in [[Brazil]] and are also used in a number of other{{which|date=May 2018}} developing countries.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=== Vacuum sewer ===
{{Main|Vacuum sewer}}
In low-lying communities, wastewater is often conveyed by [[vacuum sewer]]. Pipelines range in size from pipes of {{convert|6|in|mm}} in diameter to concrete-lined tunnels of up to {{convert|30|ft|m|0}} in diameter. A low pressure system uses a small [[grinder pump]] located at each point of connection, typically a house or business. Vacuum sewer systems use differential [[atmospheric pressure]] to move the liquid to a central vacuum station.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

==Maintenance==
[[Sanitary sewer overflow]] can occur due to blocked or broken sewer lines, infiltration of excessive [[stormwater]] or malfunction of pumps. In these cases untreated [[sewage]] is discharged from a sanitary sewer into the environment prior to reaching [[sewage treatment]] facilities. To avoid this, maintenance is required.

The maintenance requirements vary with the type of sanitary sewer. In general, all sewers deteriorate with age, but [[Infiltration/Inflow|infiltration and inflow]] are problems unique to sanitary sewers, since both combined sewers and storm drains are sized to carry these contributions. Holding infiltration to acceptable levels requires a higher standard of maintenance than necessary for structural integrity considerations of combined sewers.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;Hammer, Mark J. ''Water and Waste-Water Technology'' (1975) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-34726-4}} p.442&lt;/ref&gt;  A comprehensive construction inspection program is required to prevent inappropriate connection of cellar, yard, and roof drains to sanitary sewers.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;Steel, E.W. and McGhee, Terence J. ''Water Supply and Sewerage'' (1979) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-060929-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt;  The probability of inappropriate connections is higher where combined sewers and sanitary sewers are found in close proximity, because construction personnel may not recognize the difference.  Many older cities still use combined sewers while adjacent suburbs were built with separate sanitary sewers.

For decades, when sanitary sewer pipes cracked or experienced other damage, the only option was an expensive excavation, removal and replacement of the damaged pipe, typically requiring street repavement afterwards.  In the mid-1950s a unit was invented where two units at each end with a special [[cement]] mixture in between was pulled from one manhole cover to the next, coating the pipe with the cement under high pressure, which then [[Accelerated curing|cured rapidly]], sealing all cracks and breaks in the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qsgcX3mC0k&amp;sig=5uzq7dFzwBL4NlAn6jl810wzujk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DPAdUMLcFabRyAGC94D4CQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&amp;f=true "Sewer Sealing Machine Patches Cracks Underground."] ''Popular Mechanics'', April 1956, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a similar method using epoxy resin is used by some municipalities to re-line aging or damaged pipes, effectively creating a "pipe in a pipe". These methods may be unsuitable for locations where the full diameter of the original pipe is required to carry expected flows, and may be an unwise investment if greater wastewater flows may be anticipated from population growth, increased water use, or new service connections within the expected service life of the repair.

Another popular method for replacing aged or damaged lines is called [[pipe bursting]], where a new pipe, typically PVC or ABS plastic, is drawn through the old pipe behind an "expander head" that breaks apart the old pipe as the new one is drawn through behind it.

These methods are most suitable for trunk sewers, since repair of lines with lateral connections is complicated by making provisions to receive lateral flows without accepting undesirable infiltration from inadequately sealed junctions.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Sanitary sewers evolved from combined sewers built where water was plentiful. Animal [[feces]] accumulated on city streets while [[Outline of animal-powered transport|animal-powered transport]] moved people and goods. Accumulations of animal feces encouraged dumping [[chamber pot]]s into streets where [[night soil]] collection was impractical.&lt;ref name="bellis2018"&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://inventors.about.com/od/pstartinventions/a/Plumbing_3.htm|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-plumbing-1992310|title=The History of Plumbing|author=Bellis, Mary|archivedate=2013-12-16|date=2018-03-31|accessdate=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined sewers were built to use surface runoff to flush waste off streets and move it underground to places distant from populated areas. Sewage treatment became necessary as population expanded, but increased volumes and pumping capacity required for treatment of diluted waste from combined sewers is more expensive than treating undiluted sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steel |first1=E.W. |last2=McGhee |first2=Terence J. |authorlink = |title =Water Supply and Sewerage |publisher =McGraw-Hill |volume = |edition =5th |date =1979 |location =New York |page =318 |isbn =0-07-060929-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19559">The '''sexual division of labour''' ('''SDL''') is the [[delegation]] of different tasks between males and females. Among human foragers, males and females target different types of foods and share them with each other for a mutual or familial benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Frank. "Hunting and Gathering: The Human Sexual Division of Foraging Labor." Cross-Cultural Research.  41.2 (2007): 170-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In some species, males and females eat slightly different foods, while in other species, males and females will routinely share food; but only in humans are these two attributes combined.&lt;ref&gt;Zihlman, A., and NM Tanner. "Gathering and the hominid adaptation." Anthropology Origins. 10.99 (2001): 163-194. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The few remaining [[hunter-gatherer]] populations in the world serve as [[Evolution|evolutionary]] models that can help explain the origin of the sexual division of labor. Many studies on the sexual division of labor have been conducted on hunter-gatherer populations, such as the [[Hadza people|Hadza]], a [[hunter-gatherer]] population of [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, Frank. (2010). The Hadza: the Hunter-Gatherers of Tanzania. University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral ecological perspective ==

===Man the hunter vs. woman the gatherer ===
{{See also|Women's work}}
Both men and women have the option of investing resources either to provision children or to have additional offspring based on life history theory. Males and females monitor costs and benefits of each alternative to maximize reproductive [[fitness (biology)|fitness]];&lt;ref name="Bird 65-75"&gt;Bird, R. "Cooperation and conflict: the behavioral ecology of the sexual division of labor." Evolutionary Anthropology. 8.2 (1999): 65-75.&lt;/ref&gt; however, trade-off differences do exist between sexes. Females are likely to benefit most from [[parental]] effort because they are certain which offspring are theirs and have relatively few reproductive opportunities, each of which is relatively costly and risky. In contrast, males do not have an absolute certainty of paternity, but may have many more mating opportunities bearing relatively low costs and risks. Though not every hunter-gatherer population pinpoints females to gathering and males to hunting (most notably the [[Aeta]]&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Woman the Gatherer|author=Dahlberg, F.|date=1983|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300029895|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTPULzP1MZAC&amp;pg=PA120|page=120|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ju'/hoansi]]&lt;ref&gt;Biesele, Megan; Barclay, Steve (March 2001). "Ju/'Hoan Women's Tracking Knowledge And Its Contribution To Their Husbands' Hunting Success". African Study Monographs Suppl.26: 67–84&lt;/ref&gt;), the norm of most current populations divide the roles of labor in this manner. [[Natural selection]] is more likely to favor male reproductive strategies that stress mating effort and female strategies that emphasize [[parental investment]].&lt;ref name="Bird 65-75"/&gt; As a result, women do the low-risk task of gathering [[vegetation]] and underground storage organs that are rich in energy to provide for themselves and offspring.&lt;ref name="Bird 65-75"/&gt; Since women provide a reliable source of caloric intake, men are able to afford a higher risk of failure by hunting animals.

This classic theory of natural selection positing a difference in male and female reproductive strategies has recently been reexamined, with an alternate theory being proposed that [[promiscuity]] was encouraged [[Female promiscuity|among women]] and men alike, causing uncertainty among males of the paternity of their offspring, allowing for group cooperation in raising all offspring due to the possibility that any child could be the descendant of a male, similar to observations of the closest relative of humans, the [[bonobo]].&lt;ref name="psychologytoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-dawn/201108/ill-fated-interview-part-i|title=Ill-Fated Interview Part I &amp;#124; Psychology Today|publisher=psychologytoday.com|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, recent archaeological research done by the anthropologist and archaeologist Steven Kuhn from the University of Arizona suggests that the sexual division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic (50,000 and 10,000 years ago) and developed relatively recently in human history. The sexual division of labor may have arisen to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Lovgren. "Sex-Based Roles Gave Modern Humans an Edge, Study Says". National Geographic News. Retrieved 2008-02-03. http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061207-sex-humans.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604071800/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061207-sex-humans.html |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypotheses for the evolutionary origins of SDL ==

=== Traditional hypothesis ===

====''Provisioning household''====

The traditional explanation of the sexual division of labor finds that males and females cooperate within [[pair bond]]s by targeting different foods so that everyone in the household benefits.&lt;ref name="Lee-Devore 30-48"&gt;Lee and I. Devore, "What hunters do for a living, or How to make out on scare resources," in Man the Hunter. pp. 30-48. Chicago:Aldine&lt;/ref&gt; Females may target foods that do not conflict with [[reproduction]] and child care, while males will target foods that females do not gather, which will reduce variance in daily consumption and provide a broader diet for the family.&lt;ref name="Lee-Devore 30-48"/&gt; [[Foraging]] specialization in particular food groups should increase skill level and thus foraging success rates for targeted foods.

=== Alternative hypotheses ===

====''"Show-Off" / Signaling hypothesis''====
The "show‐off" hypothesis proposes that men hunt to gain social attention and mating benefits by widely sharing game. This model proposes that [[hunting]] functions mainly to provide an honest signal of the underlying genetic quality of hunters, which later yields a mating advantage or social deference.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, K, and Bird Bliege. "Showing off, handicap signaling, and the evolution of men's work." Evolutionary Anthropology. 11. (2002): 58-67. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Females tend to target the foods that are most reliable, while men tend to target difficult-to-acquire foods to "signal" their abilities and genetic quality. Hunting is thus viewed as a form of mating or male-male status competition, not familial [[wikt:provisioning|provisioning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes, K. "Why do men hunt? Some benefits for risky strategies.." E. Cashdan. (1990): 145-166. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies on the Hadza have revealed that men hunt mainly to distribute food to their own families rather than sharing with other members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, B., and K Hill. "A Test of the "Showing-Off" Hypothesis with Ache Hunters." Current Anthropology. 10.99 (2000): 124-25. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion suggests evidence against hunting for signaling purposes.

==="The Victorian Period"===
The Victorian era that has been so closely examined by Sally Shuttleworth and company shed light on women during the Victorian era. They played dual roles and were expected to deliver with conviction in the aspects in which they were required to perform duties in and outside of the household. She states, "Two traditional tropes are here combined: Victorian medical textbooks demonstrated not only woman's biological fitness and adaptation to the sacred role of homemaker, but also her terrifying subjection to the forces of the body. At once angel and demon, woman came to represent both the civilizing power that would cleanse the male from contamination in the brutal world of the economic market and also the rampant, uncontrolled excesses of the material economy."&lt;ref name="Sexual Division of Labor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuttleworth|first=Sally|title=Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." *Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|pages=47–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SDL and optimal foraging theory ==

Optimal foraging theory (OFT) states that organisms forage in such a way as to maximize their energy intake per unit time.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, F. "Hunting and Gathering: The Human Sexual Division of Foraging Labor." Cross-Cultural Research.  41.2 (2007): 170-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, animals behave in such a way as to find, capture, and consume food containing the most calories while expending the least amount of time possible in doing so. The sexual division of labor provides an appropriate explanation as to why males forgo the opportunity to gather any items with caloric value- a strategy that would seem suboptimal from an energetic standpoint. The OFT suggests that the sexual division of labor is an [[adaptation]] that benefits the household; thus, foraging behavior of males will appear optimal at the level of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Marlowe, F. "A critical period for provisioning by Hadza men: Implications for pair bonding." Evolution and Human Behavior. 24. (2003): 217-29. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; If a hunter-gatherer man does not rely on resources from others and passes up a food item with caloric value, it can be assumed that he is foraging at an optimal level. But, if he passes up the opportunity because it is a food that women routinely gather, then as long as men and women share their spoils, it will be optimal for men to forgo the collection and continue searching for different resources to complement the resources gathered by women.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, C. (2007). "How Marginal are forager habitats?." Journal of Archeological. 34. (2007): 59-68. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cooking and the sexual division of labor ==

The emergence of [[cooking]] in early Homo may have created problems of food theft from women while food was being cooked.&lt;ref name=Wrangham&gt;Wrangham, R, J.D. Jones, G Laden, and D Pilbeam. "The Raw and the Stolen." Current Anthropology 40.5 (1999): 567-94.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, females would recruit male partners to protect them and their resources from others. This concept, known as the theft hypothesis, accommodates an explanation as to why the [[Manual labour|labor]] of cooking is strongly associated with the status of women.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt; Women are forced to gather and cook foods because they will not acquire food otherwise and access to resources is critical for their [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt; On the contrary, men do not gather because their physical dominance allows them to scrounge cooked foods from women. Thus, women's foraging and food preparation efforts allow men to participate in the high-risk, high-reward activities of hunting. Females, in turn, become increasingly sexually attractive as a means to exploit male interest in investing in her protection.&lt;ref name=Wrangham/&gt;

== Sexual division of labor and the evolution of sex differences ==

Many studies investigating the spatial abilities of men and women have found no significant differences,&lt;ref&gt;Corley, DeFries, Kuse, Vandenberg. 1980. ''Familial Resemblance for the Identical Blocks Test of Spatial Ability: No Evidence of X Linkage''. Behavior Genetics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julia A. Sherman. 1978.

Those differences disappear with a short training &lt;ref name=Petra&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ788119 |title=ERIC - Manual Training of Mental Rotation in Children, Learning and Instruction, 2008-Feb – Experiment of Wiedenbauer, Gunnar; Jansen-Osmann, Petra (2008) |publisher=eric.ed.gov|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when given a favorable image of woman ability.&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.nber.org/~sewp/events/2005.01.14/Bios+Links/Krieger-rec5-Steele_Threat-in-the-Air.pdf |title=Article by Claude Steele, "A Threat in the Air - How Stereotypes Shape Intellectual Identity and Performance" in 1997, "American Psychologist" |publisher=users.nber.org|accessdate=2015-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the individual differences are greater than the average differences, which isn't therefore a valid prediction of a man or woman cognitive ability.&lt;ref name="Vidal"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12152-011-9121-9 |title=The Sexed Brain: Between Science and Ideology |author= Catherine Vidal|accessdate=2015-07-12|doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9121-9|volume=5|journal=Neuroethics|pages=295–303}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis argues that males needed the ability to follow prey over long distances and to accurately target their game with projectile technology, and, as a result, male specialization in hunting prowess would have spurred the selection for increased spatial and navigational ability. Similarly, the ability to remember the locations of underground storage organs and other vegetation would have led to an increase in overall efficiency and decrease in total energy expenditure since the time spent searching for food would decrease.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Geary. Sexual selection, the division of labor, and the evolution of sex differences. Behavioral and Brain Sciences. 21. (1998): 444-447. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection based on behaviors that increase hunting success and energetic efficiency would bear a positive influence on [[reproductive success]]. However, recent research suggests that the sexual division of labor developed relatively recently and that gender roles were not always the same in early-human cultures, contradicting the theory that each sex is naturally predisposed to different types of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061207-sex-humans.html |title=Sex-Based Roles Gave Modern Humans an Edge, Study Says |work=National Geographic News |author=Stefan Lovgren |accessdate=2008-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of the division of gender roles have been an ongoing debate and Gerda Lerner quotes the philosopher Socrates to demonstrate that the idea of defined gender roles is patriarchal. It also identifies how men and women are capable of performing the same job descriptions with the exception of when it calls for anatomical differences, such as giving birth. "In Book V of the Republic, Plato—in the voice of Socrates—sets down the conditions for the training of the guardians, his elite leadership group. Socrates proposes that women should have the same opportunity as men to be trained as guardians. In support of this he offers a strong statement against making sex differences the basis for discrimination: if the difference [between men and women] consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not amount to proof that a woman differs from a man in respect to the sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits.&lt;ref name="Sexual Division of Labor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Creation opf Patriarchy|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He continues to add that with the same set of established resources such as education, training and teaching, it creates an atmosphere of equity which helps to further the cause of gender equality. "Socrates proposes the same education for boys and girls, freeing guardian women from housework and child-care. But this female equality of opportunity will serve a larger purpose: the destruction of the family. Plato's aim is to abolish private property, the private family, and with it self-interest in his leadership group, for he sees clearly that private property engenders class antagonism and disharmony. Therefore "men and women are to have a common way of life. . . —common education, common children; and they are to watch over the citizens in common. "&lt;ref name="Sexual Division of Labor"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lerner|first=Gerda|title=The Creation of Patriarchy|year=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=Chapter 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers, such as [[Cordelia Fine]], argue that available evidence does not support a biological basis for gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Significance: Why the sexual division of labor? ==

===''Evolutionary perspective''===

Based on the current theories and research on the sexual division of labor, four critical aspects of hunter‐gatherer socioecology led to the evolutionary origin of the SDL in humans: (1) long‐term dependency on high‐cost offspring,&lt;ref&gt;Halperin, R. "Ecology and Mode of Production: Seasonal Variation and the Division of Labor by Sex Among Hunter-Gatherers." Journal of Anthropological Research. 36 (1980): 379-399. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; (2) optimal dietary mix of mutually exclusive foods,&lt;ref&gt;Wrangham, R, J.D. Jones, G Laden, and D Pilbeam. "The Raw and the Stolen." Current Anthropology 40.5 (1999): 567-94. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; (3) efficient foraging based on specialized skill, and (4) sex‐differentiated comparative advantage in tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Hurtado, A. M., Hill, K., Kaplan, H., &amp; Hurtado, I. (1992). Trade-offs between female food acquisition and child care among Hiwi and Ache foragers. Human Nature. 3.3. (1992): 185 – 216.&lt;/ref&gt; These combined conditions are rare in nonhuman vertebrates but common to currently-existing populations of human foragers, which, thus, gives rise to a potential factor for the evolutionary divergence of social behaviors in ''Homo''.

[[Image:Stanford torus external view by Don Davis AC76-0525.jpg|thumb|right|Exterior view of a Stanford torus. Bottom center is the non-rotating primary solar mirror, which reflects sunlight onto the angled ring of secondary mirrors around the hub. Painting by Donald E. Davis]]
[[Image:Stanford Torus interior.jpg|thumb|right|Interior of a Stanford torus, painted by Donald E. Davis]]

The '''Stanford torus''' is a proposed [[NASA]] design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/75SummerStudy/Table_of_Contents1.html| title=Space Settlements: A Design Study|year=1977| author=Johnson, Holbrow|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[space habitat]] capable of housing 10,000 to 140,000 permanent residents.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, pg 1, "The Overall System", pg 60, Summary&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stanford torus was proposed during the 1975 NASA Summer Study, conducted at [[Stanford University]], with the purpose of exploring and speculating on designs for future [[space colonization|space colonies]]&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, pg VII, "Preface"&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Gerard O'Neill]] later proposed his [[Bernal sphere#Island One|Island One]] or [[Bernal sphere]] as an alternative to the torus&lt;ref&gt;Gerard K. O'Neil, "The High Frontier", William Morrow &amp; Co., 1977, p149&lt;/ref&gt;). "Stanford torus" refers only to this particular version of the design, as the concept of a [[Rotating wheel space station|ring-shaped rotating space station]] was previously proposed by [[Wernher von Braun]]&lt;ref&gt;Von Braun, W.:Crossing the Final Frontier, Colliers, March 22, 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herman Potočnik]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Potočnik: The Problem of Space Travel (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;

It consists of a [[torus]], or [[doughnut]]-shaped ring, that is 1.8&amp;nbsp;km in diameter (for the proposed 10,000 person habitat described in the 1975 Summer Study) and rotates once per minute to provide between 0.9g and 1.0g of [[artificial gravity]] on the inside of the outer ring via [[centrifugal force]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, NASA study, p46&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunlight is provided to the interior of the torus by a system of [[mirror]]s, including a large non-rotating primary solar mirror.

The ring is connected to a hub via a number of "spokes", which serve as conduits for people and materials travelling to and from the hub. Since the hub is at the rotational axis of the station, it experiences the least artificial gravity and is the easiest location for [[spacecraft]] to dock. [[Space manufacturing|Zero-gravity industry]] is performed in a non-rotating module attached to the hub's axis.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, Chap. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior space of the torus itself is used as living space, and is large enough that a "natural" environment can be simulated; the torus appears similar to a long, narrow, straight [[U-shaped valley|glacial valley]] whose ends curve upward and eventually meet overhead to form a complete circle. The population density is similar to a dense suburb, with part of the ring dedicated to agriculture and part to housing.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson. NASA Study, Chap. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
The torus would require nearly 10 million tons of mass. Construction would use materials extracted from the [[Moon]] and sent to space using a [[mass driver]]. A mass catcher at [[Lagrangian point#L2|L2]] would collect the materials, transporting them to [[Lagrangian point#L4 and L5|L5]] where they could be processed in an industrial facility to construct the torus. Only materials that could not be obtained from the Moon would have to be imported from Earth. [[Asteroid mining]] was an alternative source of materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19770014162_1977014162.pdf | title=Space Settlements: A Design Study | publisher=NASA Technical Reports Server | year=1977 | accessdate=October 20, 2012 |author1=Johnson, Richard D. |author2=Holbrow, Charles | pages=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steadicam''' is a brand of [[camera stabilizer]] mounts for [[Movie camera|motion picture cameras]] invented by [[Garrett Brown]] and introduced in 1975 by [[Cinema Products Corporation]]. It mechanically isolates the operator's movement, allowing for a smooth shot, even when the camera moves over an irregular surface.

== History ==
Before the camera stabilizing system, a director had two choices for moving (or "[[Tracking shot|tracking]]") shots:
# The camera could be mounted on a [[camera dolly|dolly]], a wheeled mount that rolls on tracks or leveled boards. This procedure is time consuming to set up, and it is impractical in many situations.
# The [[camera operator]] could simply hold the camera. This manual grip allows speed and flexibility, but even the most skilled operator cannot entirely prevent shaking.  [[Hand-held camera]] footage has traditionally been considered suitable mostly for [[documentaries]], [[news]], reportage, live action, unrehearsable footage, or the evocation of authentic immediacy or ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' during dramatic sequences.

While these [[cinematic techniques]] are still common, the Steadicam has added another dimension to motion picture [[cinematography]] and [[videography]].

A Steadicam combines the stabilized steady footage of a conventional tripod mount with the fluid motion of a dolly shot and the flexibility of hand-held camera work. While smoothly following the operator's broad movements, the Steadicam's arm absorbs jerks, bumps, and shakes, while its almost frictionless gimbal gives precise control of the camera and framing.

The Steadicam was introduced to the industry in 1975 by inventor and cameraman Garrett Brown, who originally named the invention the "Brown Stabilizer".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stabilizer-news.com/garrett-brown-father-of-the-steadicam/ Stabilizer News]&lt;/ref&gt; After completing the first working prototype, Brown shot a ten-minute demo reel of the revolutionary moves this new device could produce. This reel was seen by numerous directors, including [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[John G. Avildsen]]. The Steadicam was subsequently licensed to and manufactured by Cinema Products Corporation, which later diversified the brand into a consumer line for [[DV]] cameras.

The Steadicam was first used in the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]–nominated [[Woody Guthrie]] biopic ''[[Bound for Glory (film)|Bound for Glory]]'' (1976),&lt;ref name="steadicam30anniv"&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051225070154/http://lserv2.dtopinc.com/tiffen/staging_html/tiffen_news_Steadicam30th_Anniv.html |dead-url = yes |archive-date = December 25, 2005 |title = Steadicam Celebrates its 30th Anniversary at NAB 2005 |publisher = Tiffen |accessdate = March 3, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; debuting with a shot that compounded the Steadicam's innovation: [[cinematographer]] [[Haskell Wexler]] had Brown start the shot on a fully elevated platform crane which [[Jib (camera)|jibbed]] down, and when it reached the ground, Brown stepped off and walked the camera through the set. This technically audacious and previously impossible shot created considerable interest in how it had been accomplished, and impressed the Academy enough for Wexler to win the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] that year.

It was then used in extensive running and chase scenes on the streets of New York City in ''[[Marathon Man (film)|Marathon Man]]'' (1976), which was released two months before ''Bound for Glory''. It landed a notable third credit in Avildsen's Best Picture–winning ''[[Rocky]]'' in 1976, where it was an integral part of the film's Philadelphia street jogging/training sequences and the run up the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Art Museum]]'s [[Rocky Steps|flight of stairs]], as well as the fight scenes where it can even be plainly seen in operation at the ringside during some wide shots of the final fight. ''Rocky'' was also released before ''Bound for Glory''. Garrett Brown was the Steadicam operator on all of these.&lt;ref name="steadicam30anniv" /&gt;

''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) pushed Brown's innovations even further, when director Stanley Kubrick requested that the camera shoot from barely above the floor. This prompted the innovation of "low mode" to mount the top of the camera to the bottom of an inverted post, which substantially increased the creative angles of the system which previously could not go much lower than the operator's waist height.&lt;ref name="Ferrara2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Ferrara |first1 = Serena |title = Steadicam: techniques and aesthetics |date = 2001 |publisher = Focal |location = Oxford [u.a.] |isbn = 978-0-240-51607-3 |pages = 26–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This low-mode concept remains the most important extension to the system since its inception.

A Steadicam rig was also employed during the filming of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), in conjunction with two gyroscopes for extra stabilization, to film the background plates for the [[speeder bike]] chase. Brown, who personally operated the shot, walked through a redwood forest, with the camera running at a speed of less than one frame per second. The end result, when projected at 24 frames per second, gave the impression of flying through the air at perilous speeds.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Garrett. "Return of the Jedi", ''[[American Cinematographer]]'', June 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EmpireOfDreams"&gt;''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2004]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Michael Crichton]] film ''[[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]]'' (1984), a Steadicam rig was used to simulate the point of view of a futuristic smart bullet in flight while targeting specific individuals by their heat signature.

== Description ==
[[File:Steadicam Operator John Fry with Master Steadicam &amp; Arri Alexa camera.jpg|thumb|upright|The larger Steadicams are designed to support [[35 mm film]] cameras, [[digital cinema camera]]s, and [[IMAX]] cameras.]]
[[File:LondonSmog.jpg|thumb|upright|To film this recreated Victorian London street scene, the Steadicam operator is next to the lamp post, wearing a leather Steadicam vest.]]

The operator wears a harness, the Steadicam ''vest'', which is attached to an [[iso-elastic]] arm. This is connected by a multiaxis and ultra-low friction [[gimbal]] to the Steadicam "sled" which has the camera mounted at one end and counterbalancing weight (the monitor and batteries) at the other. The monitor substitutes for the camera's viewfinder, since the range of motion of the camera relative to the operator makes the camera's own viewfinder unusable.  In the film industry the armature and weight are traditionally called the ''sled'', as the two units combined resembled a [[sled]] in an early model of the Steadicam.  The sled includes the top ''stage'' where the camera is attached, the ''post'' which in most models can be extended, with the monitor and batteries at the bottom to counterbalance the camera weight. This is how the Steadicam stays upright, by simply making the bottom slightly heavier than the top, pivoting at the gimbal. This leaves the [[center of gravity]] of the whole rig, however heavy it may be, exactly at the operator's fingertip, allowing deft and finite control of the whole system with the lightest of touches on the gimbal. The skill of the operator is to keep the desired framing and composition by feathering his touch on the gimbal, while the rig and operator is in motion, and, indeed, when still.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jerryholway.com/manuals/|title=Manuals|website=Jerry Holway|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined weight of the counterbalance and camera means that the armature bears a relatively high [[inertia]]l mass which is not easily moved by small body movements from the operator (much as it is difficult to quickly shake a [[bowling ball]]). The freely pivoting armature adds additional stabilization to the photographed image, and makes the weight of the camera-sled assembly acceptable by allowing the body harness to support it.

When the armature is correctly adjusted, operators can remove their hands from the Steadicam entirely and the camera stays in place. During operation, the operator usually rests a hand on the camera gimbal and applies force at that point to move the camera. To avoid shaking the camera when lens adjustments are made, a wireless remote operated by the camera assistant is used to control focus and iris.

For low-angle shots, the Steadicam sled can be inverted vertically, putting the camera on the bottom, and the monitor and batteries on the top. This is referred to as ''low mode'' operation.

The newest generation is the Tango. A body-supported camera-stabilization-system, its horizontal mechanism makes it possible to move the camera freely while staying horizontal. A Steadicam operator can change from low mode to high mode without any alteration. Dimensions are not limited to ups and downs, but also in depth and over or through obstacles.

The smallest, lightest Steadicam that can be used with a support arm and vest is the Merlin. It is light enough to be hand held with cameras weighing up to about 5.5 pounds (2.5&amp;nbsp;kg), and may carry cameras up to about 7 pounds (3.2&amp;nbsp;kg) when used with the arm. The Merlin may be folded and carried in comparatively small spaces such as medium-size camera bags. In its lightest configuration, the Merlin weighs just 12.5 ounces (0.35&amp;nbsp;kg). Photographers who shoot with [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|HDSLR cameras]] that combine still and motion photography most often work with the Merlin. Since the Merlin has no facility to carry a separate monitor, cameras suitable for it must have built-in monitors.

Steadicam introduced a camera mount for smartphones, called the Smoothee, in 2012. Marketed to consumers instead of video professionals, its tubular frame supports iPhone and Android phones that are 4.53" to 6.26" long by 2.32" to 3.27" wide (115 to 159&amp;nbsp;mm long by 59 to 83&amp;nbsp;mm wide).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://tiffen.com/steadicamsmoothee/ |title=Steadicam Smoothee Universal Camera Mount |website=Tiffen |access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adapter can be used to fit a GoPro camera to it. An even smaller, camera-specific Steadicam Curve (a single, curved aluminum slash) is available for GoPro cameras. It is also marketed to consumers.

A '''surtout de table''' is an ornamental [[centrepiece]] displayed on a formal dining table. Evolving from a simple plate or bowl on which to stand candlesticks and condiments, a surtout de table often took the form of a long galleried tray made of precious or gilded metals, on which a series of other objects were placed for display.  It was often made in sections allowing its length to be determined by the leaves added to the table. During the later half of the 18th century and throughout the 19th century, no formal table was considered compete without one. Today, they are still seen and used in the most formal dining rooms.

The term can refer either to a large centrepiece object, or the tray type on which objects are placed, or the two in combination.

==History==
[[File:Drawing, Design for a Surtout de Table (Centerpiece), 1780–90 (CH 18542829-2).jpg|thumb|Drawing, Design for a Surtout de Table based on [[Pompeii]], 1780–90]] 
The surtout de table first appeared in the 17th century and was a utilitarian object designed to hold candles, and protect a polished wooden table from the staining caused by spillage from the salt and vinegars in the condiments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/oeuvre-notices/surtout-de-table The Louvre] Retrieved 27 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As the great central and ceremonial salt cellars fell from favour, to be replaced by smaller individual salt cellars, during the first half of the 18th century, the surtout de table evolved to fill the role of ornamental table centrepiece. It often took the form of a raised galleried tray which would be filled with matching candelabra, figurines, vases and [[epergne]]s, the gallery itself sometimes containing candle sconces. They were not always constructed from precious metals; porcelain and glass were often used,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/IMG/pdf/a_De_bronze_et_de_pierre_dure-_Un_cadeau_espagnol_a_Napoleon.pdf Musee Chateau de Fontainebleau] retrieved 21 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as might be [[sugar sculpture|sculptures made from sugar]]. The top of the tray was often a mirror, to show the underside of the objects on it, and increase reflected light.

It was not uncommon, if a surtout de table were commissioned for a specific house, for an indigenous theme to be used in the style. Hence, a hunting lodge may have a surtout de table with figurines of dogs and their quarry while a grander town palace would feature the most fashionable Rococo or Baroque styles of the day.

During the 1850s, the fashion for themed dining table decoration reached its apogee and the surtout de table reflected this. Porcelain factories such as [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] produced elaborate models and figurines which replaced the classical statuary of the [[Empire style]] with coloured porcelain mountains, rustic scenes with cattle and goats and, occasionally, even a jungle theme complete with lifelike porcelain snakes.&lt;ref&gt;See the Surtout de table by  Charles-Jean Avisseau (1795-1861). Exhibited at the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Exposition Universelle]]. 1903 Infantry: 10573 [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable examples==
[[File:Giuseppe Valadier surtout de table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Design for a classical architectural surtout de table by Giuseppe Valadier]]

Notable examples of surtouts de table include those made the Italian goldsmith Luigi Valadier, often designed by his son, the architect [[Giuseppe Valadier]]. These monumental surtouts de table often represent Roman cities in miniature, complete with temples, colonnades and triumphal arches of coloured marbles and alabaster mounted on gold and mosaic pediments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-chateau-fontainebleau.fr/IMG/pdf/a_De_bronze_et_de_pierre_dure-_Un_cadeau_espagnol_a_Napoleon.pdf Musee Chateau de Fontainebleau] retrieved 21 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Waddesdon Manor]] in England is now home to a vast 6.7 metre long gilt tray surtout de table made by [[Pierre-Philippe Thomire]] (1751-1843). Made circa 1818, it was given to Prince Ruffo della Scaletta by [[Louis XVIII]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yannickchastang.com/conservation/portfolio/bronze/21/ Yannick Chastang Conservation] retrieved 27 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

France distributing wreaths of glory is the name and theme of a large silver plate on bronze surtout de table commissioned from the Parisian jeweller [[Charles Christofle]] by [[Napoleon III]] in 1852. Intended for use at state banquets at the [[Tuileries Palace]], the gilded tray contains a [[garniture]] of fifteen sculptures. The central figure is a winged [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] bearing laurel leaves which she awards to two horse-drawn chariots representing war and peace. At Victory's feet sit figurines representing Justice, Concord, Force and Religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en/collectors_corner/object/files/surtout_christofle.asp Napoleon.org] retrieved 28 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The surtout de table was still in situ when the palace caught fire in 1871. It was pulled from the smoking debris damaged but intact. It has never been restored and is today displayed with its smoke-blackened gilt and dents at the [[Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris|Musée des Arts Décoratifs]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en/collectors_corner/object/files/surtout_christofle.asp Napoleon.org] retrieved 28 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Television interference''' ('''TVI''') is a particular case of [[electromagnetic interference]] which affects [[television]] [[Television antenna|reception]].  Many natural and man-made phenomena can disrupt the reception of television signals.  These include naturally occurring and artificial spark discharges, and effects due to the operation of radio transmitters.

Analog television broadcasts display different effects due to different kinds of interference. Digital television reception generally gives a good quality picture until the interference is so large that it can no longer be eliminated by the error checking systems in the receiver, at which point the video display becomes pixelated, distorts, or goes blank.

==Co-channel and multipath (ghost)==
During unusual atmospheric conditions, a distant station normally undectable at a particular location may provide a much stronger signal than usual. The analog television picture may display the sum of the two signals, producing an image from the strong local signal with traces or "ghosts" from the distant, weaker signal. Television broadcast stations are located and assigned to channels so that such events are rare.  Readjustment of the receiving antenna may allow more of the distant signal to be rejected, improving image quality.

A local signal may travel by more than one path from the transmitter to receiving antenna. "Multipath" reception is visible as multiple impressions of the same image, slightly shifted along the width of the screen due to the varying transmission path.  Some multipath reception is momentary due to road vehicles or aircraft passing; other multipath problems may persist due to reflection off tall buildings or other landscape features. Strong multipath can cause the analog picture to "tear" or momentarily lose synchronization, causing it to roll or flip.&lt;ref name=PMJN80&gt;Joma Hyppia, ''8 Ways to Beat TV Interference'',  ''Popular Mechanics'', June 1980 pages 88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Static electricity and sparks==
The sparks generated by static electricity can generate interference.

Many systems where radio frequency interface is caused by sparking can be modeled as the following circuit. The source of energy charges C1 via a resistance, and when the spark gap breaks down, the electricity passes through L and excites the resonant LC circuit. The energy in the LC circuit is then radiated through the aerial.

[[Image:Sparktrans2 vers UK vectorised.svg|centre]]
As an example, when a person walks over a [[nylon]] carpet, the rubbing of shoes on carpet performs the role of a battery and resistor, while the person acts as a [[capacitor]] (C1 and C2), and the air between a hand and a [[door knob]] is a [[spark gap]]. Stray inductance acts as L.

==Sparks and allied phenomena==
Horizontal lines randomly arranged on a television screen may be caused by sparking in a malfunctioning electrical device. Electric railways can also be a strong source of this type of interference.

Other possible sources of such interference include:
* Thermostats, fridges, freezers, fish tank heaters, central heating systems
**These can create sparks as they turn on or off; as they age they can become worse. In some rare cases they can create non-stop interference through sparking. 
* Electric motors
**Motors which have a commutator can suffer from sparking at the [[Brush (electric)|brushes]].
* Ignition systems on cars and motorbikes.

==Devices which switch at powerline frequency ==
* Power line hardware, this can generate sparks at either a 100 or 120&amp;nbsp;Hz rate
* Light dimmers and other solid state power control devices.

[[Thyristor]] and [[TRIAC|Triac]] regulators without proper [[choke (electronics)|chokes]] are a common source of [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]] as well. It is likely that a [[thyristor]] (SCR) power controller using the variable phase angle method will generate harmonics of the mains supply, while the spark at a contact will be a very wide band source whose frequency is not related to the power supply frequency. In [[Thyristor]] control systems the potential for [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]] problems can be minimised by using [[zero crossing]] switching where the [[thyristor]] is switched on at the moment of time when the [[Alternating current|AC]] voltage changes from one direction to the other.

[[Image:Lightdimmer.svg|frame|centre|A typical SCR based light dimmer which dims the light through phase angle control. This unit is wired in series with the load. Diodes (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) for a bridge which generates DC with lots of ripple. R and C form a circuit with a time constant, as the voltage increases from zero (at the start of every halfwave) C will charge up, when C is able to make ZD conduct and inject current into the SCR the SCR will fire. When the SCR conducts then D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; will discharge C via the SCR. The SCR will shut off when the current falls to zero when the supply voltage drops at the end of the half cycle, ready for the circuit to start work on the next half cycle.]]

==Devices which switch faster than 200 Hz ==
* Computers and other digital electronic equipment. These devices create and use signals which are switched on/off at great speed. It is the case that any repetitive signal can be reduced down to a [[Fourier series]] of sine waves. It so happens that a perfect square wave is

E = E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; sin (ωt) - {E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; sin (2ωt)}/2 + {E&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; sin (3ωt)}/3 ......

As the term goes on for ever to higher and higher frequencies the square wave contains harmonics of the fundamental which go on upwards in frequency for ever, these harmonics are responsible for much of the interference created by [[computer]]s. A modern PC is a device which is operating in the [[VHF]]/[[UHF]] frequency range using [[square wave]]s. As the cases on many computers are not perfect shields, some of this radio frequency energy can leak out and cause interference to radio (and sometimes TV) reception.

* [[Switched-mode power supply|Switched-mode power supplies]] or packs can be a source of interference. These are used in consumer electronic/electrical products and in some lighting systems.

==Strong TV signals==
It is possible to also get a bad picture if the signal strength of the TV transmitter is too high. An [[attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] inserted in the antenna lead-in wire may be used if the television receiver displays signs of overload in the [[RF front end]]. Strong out-of-band signals may also affect television reception and may require band-pass filters to reduce the level of the undesired signal at the receiver.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3020">[[Image:Toilet paper orientation over.jpg|thumb|A classic horizontal-axle, wall-mounted toilet roll holder]]
A '''toilet-roll holder''', also known as a '''toilet paper dispenser''', is an item that holds a roll of [[toilet paper]].  Common models include a hinged length of wire mounted horizontally on a wall, a thicker axle either recessed into a wall or mounted on a frame, or a freestanding vertical pole on a base. In recent years, [[automatic toilet paper dispenser]]s which automatically fold and cut the toilet paper are being installed in [[public toilet]]s.

== Wire on hinge ==
In the first case, the idea is that the toilet roll maintains contact with the [[door]] or wall as the roll's radius decreases.  This provides enough [[friction]] to allow the user to tear off a piece of tissue.  More sophisticated designs include a curved horizontal plate that covers the roll, thus removing the necessity of touching the roll. These roll holders can be used in both [[Toilet paper orientation|orientations]], but may be difficult to use in the "under" orientation.

== Horizontal axle in wall ==
The horizontal axle design is found in most homes, and also in many schools. It is easy to use due to its low friction and ease of refilling. This is the type of holder most commonly assumed about when [[toilet paper orientation]] is mentioned.

==Horizontal freestanding axle==
[[File:Vertical Toilet Roll Holder.jpg|thumb|100px|Vertical pole toilet roll holder]]
This type of holder is not common, probably because it can get in the way of traffic getting on and off the toilet more than the horizontal axle in the wall.{{huh?|date=September 2012}}

== Vertical pole ==
Originally intended to hold a stock of replacement rolls, the vertical pole has become the only paper holder in some households.  It is particularly useful in homes where the family has mixed handedness. Its drawbacks include that there is a lot more friction than in other types of toilet roll holders, and thus not as easy to use.

== Public toilets ==
The holders in many public toilets are designed to make it difficult for patrons to steal the toilet rolls. Various contraptions have been devised to lock the spare rolls away, and release them only when the active roll is used up.

An increasing number of public toilets are furnished with holders that hold very large rolls of toilet paper.  These are designed to save money by reducing the frequency of janitorial services to restock the paper.

In many toilets, especially in elementary schools, a dispenser releases only a small square of toilet paper to prevent a user from intentionally clogging the toilet with large amounts of paper.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19825">'''Usability testing''' is a technique used in [[user-centered design|user-centered]] [[interaction design]] to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable [[usability]] practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, J. (1994). Usability Engineering, Academic Press Inc, p 165&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast with [[usability inspection]] methods where experts use different methods to evaluate a user interface without involving users.

Usability testing focuses on measuring a human-made product's capacity to meet its intended purpose. Examples of products that commonly benefit from usability testing are [[food]], consumer products, [[web design|web sites]] or web applications, [[user interface|computer interfaces]], documents, and devices. Usability testing measures the usability, or ease of use, of a specific object or set of objects, whereas general [[human–computer interaction]] studies attempt to formulate universal principles.

==What it is not==
Simply gathering opinions on an object or document is [[market research]] or [[qualitative research]] rather than usability testing. Usability testing usually involves systematic observation under controlled conditions to determine how well people can use the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://jerz.setonhill.edu/writing/technical-writing/usability-testing/ | title=Usability Testing: What Is It? | work=Jerz's Literacy Weblog | date=July 19, 2000 | accessdate=June 29, 2016 | author=Dennis G. Jerz}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, often both qualitative and usability testing are used in combination, to better understand users' motivations/perceptions, in addition to their actions.

Rather than showing users a rough draft and asking, "Do you understand this?", usability testing involves watching people trying to ''use'' something for its intended purpose. For example, when testing instructions for assembling a toy, the test subjects should be given the instructions and a box of parts and, rather than being asked to comment on the parts and materials, they are asked to put the toy together. Instruction phrasing, illustration quality, and the toy's design all affect the assembly process.

==Methods==
Setting up a usability test involves carefully creating a [[scenario]], or realistic situation, wherein the person performs a list of tasks using the product being [[Dynamic testing|tested]] while observers watch and take notes ([[Software verification#Dynamic verification .28Test.2C experimentation.29|dynamic verification]]). Several other [[Static testing|test]] instruments such as scripted instructions, [[paper prototypes]], and pre- and post-test questionnaires are also used to gather feedback on the product being tested ([[Software verification#Static verification .28Analysis.29|static verification]]). For example, to test the attachment function of an [[e-mail]] program, a scenario would describe a situation where a person needs to send an e-mail attachment, and ask him or her to undertake this task. The aim is to observe how people function in a realistic manner, so that developers can see problem areas, and what people like. Techniques popularly used to gather data during a usability test include [[think aloud protocol]], co-discovery learning and [[eye tracking]].

===Hallway testing===

'''Hallway testing''' is a quick and cheap method of usability testing in which [[random]]ly-selected people—e.g., those passing by in the hallway—are asked to try using the product or service.  This can help designers identify "brick walls", problems so serious that users simply cannot advance, in the early stages of a new design. Anyone but project designers and engineers can be used (they tend to act as "expert reviewers" because they are too close to the project).

===Remote usability testing===

In a scenario where usability evaluators, developers and prospective users are located in different countries and time zones, conducting a traditional lab usability evaluation creates challenges both from the cost and logistical perspectives. These concerns led to research on remote usability evaluation, with the user and the evaluators separated over space and time. Remote testing, which facilitates evaluations being done in the context of the user's other tasks and technology, can be either synchronous or asynchronous. The former involves real time one-on-one communication between the evaluator and the user, while the latter involves the evaluator and user working separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/1240624.1240838 |title=What happened to remote usability testing? |journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems  - CHI '07 |year=2007 |last1=Andreasen |first1=Morten Sieker |last2=Nielsen |first2=Henrik Villemann |last3=Schrøder |first3=Simon Ormholt |last4=Stage |first4=Jan |isbn=9781595935939 |page=1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous tools are available to address the needs of both these approaches.

Synchronous usability testing methodologies involve video conferencing or employ remote application sharing tools such as WebEx. WebEx and GoToMeeting are the most commonly used technologies to conduct a synchronous remote usability test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/remote_online_usability_testing_why_how_and_when_to_use_it|title=Remote Online Usability Testing: Why, How, and When to Use It|author=Dabney Gough|author2=Holly Phillips|date=2003-06-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215231619/http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/remote_online_usability_testing_why_how_and_when_to_use_it|archivedate=December 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, synchronous remote testing may lack the immediacy and sense of "presence" desired to support a collaborative  testing process. Moreover, managing inter-personal dynamics across cultural and linguistic barriers may require approaches sensitive to the cultures involved. Other disadvantages include having reduced control over the testing environment and the distractions and interruptions experienced by the participants' in their native environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dray|first=Susan|author2=Siegel, David |title=Remote possibilities?: international usability testing at a distance|journal=Interactions|date=March 2004|volume=11|pages=10–17|doi=10.1145/971258.971264|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the newer methods developed for conducting a synchronous remote usability test is by using virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chalil Madathil|first=Kapil|author2=Joel S. Greenstein |title=Synchronous remote usability testing: a new approach facilitated by virtual worlds|journal=Proceedings of the 2011 annual conference on Human factors in computing systems|date=May 2011|series=CHI '11|pages=2225–2234|doi=10.1145/1978942.1979267|isbn=9781450302289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asynchronous methodologies include automatic collection of user's click streams, user logs of critical incidents that occur while interacting with the application and subjective feedback on the interface by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/971258.971264|title=Remote possibilities?|year=2004|last1=Dray|first1=Susan|last2=Siegel|first2=David|journal=Interactions|volume=11|issue=2|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to an in-lab study, an asynchronous remote usability test is task-based and the platform allows researchers to capture clicks and task times. Hence, for many large companies, this allows researchers to better understand visitors' intents when visiting a website or mobile site. Additionally, this style of user testing also provides an opportunity to segment feedback by demographic, attitudinal and behavioral type. The tests are carried out in the user's own environment (rather than labs) helping further simulate real-life scenario testing. This approach also provides a vehicle to easily solicit feedback from users in remote areas quickly and with lower organizational overheads. In recent years, conducting usability testing asynchronously has also become prevalent and allows testers to provide feedback in their free time and from the comfort of their own home.

===Expert review===

Expert review is another general method of usability testing. As the name suggests, this method relies on bringing in experts with experience in the field (possibly from companies that specialize in usability testing) to evaluate the usability of a product.

A [[heuristic evaluation]] or '''usability audit''' is an evaluation of an interface by one or more human factors experts. Evaluators measure the usability, efficiency, and effectiveness of the interface based on usability principles, such as the 10 usability heuristics originally defined by Jakob Nielsen in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heuristic Evaluation|url=http://www.usabilityfirst.com/usability-methods/heuristic-evaluation/|publisher=Usability First|accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen's usability heuristics, which have continued to evolve in response to user research and new devices, include:
* Visibility of system status
* Match between system and the real world
* User control and freedom
* Consistency and standards
* Error prevention
* Recognition rather than recall
* Flexibility and efficiency of use
* Aesthetic and minimalist design
* Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
* Help and documentation

===Automated expert review===

Similar to expert reviews, '''automated expert reviews''' provide usability testing but through the use of programs given rules for good design and heuristics. Though an automated review might not provide as much detail and insight as reviews from people, they can be finished more quickly and consistently. The idea of creating surrogate users for usability testing is an ambitious direction for the artificial intelligence community.

===A/B testing===
{{Main|A/B testing}}

In web development and marketing, A/B testing or split testing is an experimental approach to web design (especially user experience design), which aims to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest (e.g., click-through rate for a banner advertisement). As the name implies, two versions (A and B) are compared, which are identical except for one variation that might impact a user's behavior. Version A might be the one currently used, while version B is modified in some respect. For instance, on an e-commerce website the purchase funnel is typically a good candidate for A/B testing, as even marginal improvements in drop-off rates can represent a significant gain in sales. Significant improvements can be seen through testing elements like copy text, layouts, images and colors.

Multivariate testing or bucket testing is similar to A/B testing but tests more than two versions at the same time.

==Number of test subjects==

In the early 1990s, [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]], at that time a researcher at [[Sun Microsystems]], popularized the concept of using numerous small usability tests—typically with only five test subjects each—at various stages of the development process. His argument is that, once it is found that two or three people are totally confused by the home page, little is gained by watching more people suffer through the same flawed design. "Elaborate usability tests are a waste of resources. The best results come from testing no more than five users and running as many small tests as you can afford."&lt;ref name="useit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html|title=Usability Testing with 5 Users (Jakob Nielsen's Alertbox)|publisher=useit.com|date=2000-03-13}}; references {{cite conference |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=169166&amp;CFID=159890676&amp;CFTOKEN=16006386 |title=A mathematical model of the finding of usability problems |author1=Jakob Nielsen |author2=Thomas K. Landauer |date=April 1993 |booktitle=Proceedings of ACM INTERCHI'93 Conference (Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 24–29 April 1993)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim of "Five users is enough" was later described by a mathematical model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Virzi |first=R. A. |title=Refining the Test Phase of Usability Evaluation: How Many Subjects is Enough? |journal=Human Factors |year=1992 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=457–468 |doi=10.1177/001872089203400407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which states for the proportion of uncovered problems U

&lt;math&gt;U = 1-(1-p)^n&lt;/math&gt;

where p is the probability of one subject identifying a specific problem and n the number of subjects (or test sessions). This model shows up as an asymptotic graph towards the number of real existing problems (see figure below).

[[Image:Virzis Formula.PNG]]

In later research Nielsen's claim has eagerly been questioned with both [[empirical]] evidence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Testing-web-sites%3A-five-users-is-nowhere-near-Spool-Schroeder/392202ea356a588893319babfe258fc415207352|title=Testing web sites: five users is nowhere near enough - Semantic Scholar|author=|date=|website=semanticscholar.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more advanced [[mathematical model]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Caulton |first=D. A. |title=Relaxing the homogeneity assumption in usability testing |journal=Behaviour &amp; Information Technology |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |doi=10.1080/01449290010020648 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two key challenges to this assertion are:
# Since usability is related to the specific set of users, such a small sample size is unlikely to be representative of the total population so the data from such a small sample is more likely to reflect the sample group than the population they may represent
#Not every usability problem is equally easy-to-detect. Intractable problems happen to decelerate the overall process. Under these circumstances the progress of the process is much shallower than predicted by the Nielsen/Landauer formula.&lt;ref&gt;Schmettow, Heterogeneity in the Usability Evaluation Process. In: M. England, D. &amp; Beale, R. (ed.),  Proceedings of the HCI 2008, British Computing Society, 2008, 1, 89-98&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth noting that Nielsen does not advocate stopping after a single  test with five users; his point is that testing with five users, fixing the problems they uncover, and then testing the revised site with five different users is a better use of limited resources than running a single usability test with 10 users. In practice, the tests are run once or twice per week during the entire development cycle, using three to five test subjects per round, and with the results delivered within 24 hours to the designers.  The number of users actually tested over the course of the project can thus easily reach 50 to 100 people.

In the early stage, when users are most likely to immediately encounter problems that stop them in their tracks, almost anyone of normal intelligence can be used as a test subject. In stage two, testers will recruit test subjects across a broad spectrum of abilities.  For example, in one study, experienced users showed no problem using any design, from the first to the last, while naive user and self-identified power users both failed repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asktog.com/columns/000maxscrns.html|author=Bruce Tognazzini|title=Maximizing Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later on, as the design smooths out, users should be recruited from the target population.

When the method is applied to a sufficient number of people over the course of a project, the objections raised above become addressed:  The sample size ceases to be small and usability problems that arise with only occasional users are found.  The value of the method lies in the fact that specific design problems, once encountered, are never seen again because they are immediately eliminated, while the parts that appear successful are tested over and over.  While it's true that the initial problems in the design may be tested by only five users, when the method is properly applied, the parts of the design that worked in that initial test will go on to be tested by 50 to 100 people.

==Example==
A 1982 [[Apple Computer]] manual for developers advised on usability testing:&lt;ref name="apple1982"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.apple2scans.net/files/1982-A2F2116-m-a2e-aiiedg.pdf | title=Apple IIe Design Guidelines | publisher=Apple Computer |author1=Meyers, Joe |author2=Tognazzini, Bruce | year=1982 | pages=11–13, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "Select the target audience. Begin your human interface design by identifying your target audience. Are you writing for businesspeople or children?"
# Determine how much target users know about Apple computers, and the subject matter of the software.
# Steps 1 and 2 permit designing the user interface to suit the target audience's needs. Tax-preparation software written for accountants might assume that its users know nothing about computers but are expert on the tax code, while such software written for consumers might assume that its users know nothing about taxes but are familiar with the basics of Apple computers.

Apple advised developers, "You should begin testing as soon as possible, using drafted friends, relatives, and new employees":{{r|apple1982}}

{{quote|Our testing method is as follows. We set up a room with five to six computer systems. We schedule two to three groups of five to six users at a time to try out the systems (often without their knowing that it is the software rather than the system that we are testing). We have two of the designers in the room. Any fewer, and they miss a lot of what is going on. Any more and the users feel as though there is always someone breathing down their necks.}}

Designers must watch people use the program in person, because{{r|apple1982}}

{{quote|Ninety-five percent of the stumbling blocks are found by watching the body language of the users. Watch for squinting eyes, hunched shoulders, shaking heads, and deep, heart-felt sighs. When a user hits a snag, he will assume it is "on account of he is not too bright": he will not report it; he will hide it ... Do not make assumptions about why a user became confused. Ask him. You will often be surprised to learn what the user thought the program was doing at the time he got lost.}}

==Education==
Usability testing has been a formal subject of academic instruction in different disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breuch|first=Lee-Ann|author2=Mark Zachry |author3=Clay Spinuzzi |title=Usability Instruction in Technical Communication Programs|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|date=April 2001|volume=15|issue=2|pages=223–240|doi=10.1177/105065190101500204 |url=http://jbt.sagepub.com/content/15/2/223.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Versatile Laboratory Aid''' ('''VELA''') is a 4-channel [[Data logger|data logging tool]] that was created as part of a joint venture by Ashley Clarke and David Binney of [[Leeds University]] and Educational Electronics. The VELA was designed to be used as a stand-alone data logger that could be used out in the field and it could then be taken back to the laboratory where it could be connected to a chart printer, oscilloscope or microcomputer for data analysis purposes.

The VELA was designed and built with the intention that it would be used in schools and Universities to monitor Physics&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Andrew (1990), ''InnoVativE LeArning in the school physics laboratory'', pp.119-121 Physics Education, Volume 25, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, R. (1987), ''Using VELA to teach AC Theory'', p.37 Electronics Systems News Spring 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and Chemistry experiments as it could be attached to all manner or analogue probes and sensors such as [[pH meter]]s, [[Thermometer|temperature sensors]], [[light gates]], [[Signal generator]] and [[microphone]]s. Each of the VELA's four channels can be independently set to record voltages in the ranges of +/-250mV, +/-2.5V and +/-25V&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Ashley R. (circa 1982). ''VELA User and Technical Manual'', p. 5. Educational Electronics, Leeds.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a range of different input devices to be connected simultaneously.

The basic VELA carries a single 4KB EPROM (ISL1 or ISL1*) which contains the basic input and output routines that handle the keyboard input and 8-digit [[LED display]] output together with seventeen user selectable programs which range from a 4-channel digital volt meter to a random event monitor which could be used with a [[Geiger Counter]] Probe to measure and log radiation levels from a source material.

In total, the VELA could record a maximum of 4096 data points either from one channel or split equally between the four channels depending on the selected monitoring program. In later versions of the VELA [[firmware]] (ISL1*), the number of data points was reduced by 7 bytes per data channel as these bytes were reserved for storing channel and program configuration data when transferring data to a microcomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Ashley R. (circa 1982). ''VELA User and Technical Manual'', p. 18. Educational Electronics, Leeds.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware specifications ==
The VELA went through at least two hardware revisions going from the Mark I to Mark II and subsequently the VELA PLUS but the ISL ROMs remained compatible between all three devices although the Mark I VELA required a daughter board to carry the extra ROMs that were developed after the VELA's initial release.

=== Mark I Specifications ===
The VELA Mark I was based around the Motorola MC6802 central processor and carried 4KB of RAM. It shipped with the original ISL1 ROM fitted and has space for a further 2 ROMs to be fitted on board. The PCB of the Mark I was split into two parts which connected to each other through a ribbon cable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retro-kit.co.uk/page.cfm/content/VELA-Versions-of-VELA/ Versions of VELA]&lt;/ref&gt; The ROMs were generally shipped on 2732 EPROM chips and they could be sent back to Educational Electronics to be updated with enhanced firmware when it became available.&lt;ref&gt;Binney, D.A., Clarke, A.R. (1985), ''User Manual for Physics EPROM ISL4'', Instrumentation Software Ltd. Leeds.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mark II Specifications ===
The VELA Mark II was a refinement to the Mark I design and was based on the same processor and hardware. The Mark II PCB was condensed onto a single board and carried space for a further three EPROM's to be fitted in addition to the ISL1* EPROM that it shipped with. There were modifications to the connectors on the VELA Mark II with the addition of a 5V 70mA output and a revised power supply connector although early Mark II VELA's continued to use the original 3.5mm power supply plug socket as used on the VELA Mark I.

=== VELA PLUS Specifications ===
The VELA PLUS was again a refinement on the Mark II VELA and the PCB carried alterations to the op-amps and circuitry associated with the channel inputs. The VELA front panel was also revised to make it clearer to understand as the usability of the VELA had been a source of issues amongst the teaching community.

With the advent of the VELA PLUS, the name '''''Ve'''rsatile '''L'''aboratory '''A'''id'' which was displayed on the front panel was changed to '''''Ve'''rsatile '''La'''boratory Instrument'' whilst retaining the VELA contraction.

== Use in education ==
The VELA was 50/50 subsidised&lt;ref&gt;Birrell, Ian J. (1988). ''Getting to know your VELA&amp;nbsp;— for chemists'', p. 6. Instrumentation Software Ltd, Leeds. {{ISBN|0-947653-07-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Higginbotham, Barbara. [http://www.technology-in-education.co.uk/features/datalogging-a-history/ "Datalogging - a history"], ''Technology In Education'', Cheltenham, 17 March 2011. Retrieved 17 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|DTI]], an arm of the [[British Government]] to encourage take up within the education sector and many thousands of VELA units were sold to schools.

In 1986 an article in the Electronic Systems News Spring Journal&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, D. (1986), ''VELA&amp;nbsp;— help!'', p.34 Electronics Systems News Spring 1986&lt;/ref&gt; stated "4000 teachers now possess a VELA, but it is suspected that more than half of these have never been used."

== Connectivity ==
The VELA was designed to be connected to three different types of device, being a chart printer, an oscilloscope or a microcomputer. Connecting the VELA to a chart printer allowed the captured data to be printed directly from the VELA for analysis and making a permanent record of the data captured. Connecting the VELA to an oscilloscope allowed users to have a real-time view of the data the VELA was recording or a playback view of pre-existing captured data. When connected to a microcomputer, the data captured could be stored and manipulated using a variety of different software applications that were available for the VELA.

Using the Digital Out port, the VELA can also be used as a control device using 8 of the 16 data lines provided.&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, N.D.

'''Virtway''' is a [[serious game]] [[video game developer|developer]] located in [[Oviedo]], [[Spain]]. It was founded in 1999 as a general IT consulting firm, but in 2006 it spun off from its parent company to focus on 3D development and serious gaming as an independent branch of the [[Indigo Group]] holding.

== eLearning platform ==

The main focus of the company has been developing an advanced simulation system to empower learning through gaming, called VTS ([[Virtual Training System]]). The platform was presented at the 2008 [[Games, Learning &amp; Society Conference|Games+Learning+Society]] &lt;ref name=GLS08_ref&gt;[http://glsconference.org/2008/session.html?id=119 Perspective-Based Feedback in a Virtual World Training Simulation and the Effects on Learning] by [http://glsconference.org/2008/person.html?id=260 Robb Lindgren], [http://glsconference.org/2008/person.html?id=261 Emmanuel Fournier] and [http://glsconference.org/2008/person.html?id=262 José Carlos López]&lt;/ref&gt; conference in partnership with Robb Lindgren from [[Stanford University]].

VTS is built on top of the [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]]&lt;ref name=Gamebryo_ref&gt;[http://www.emergent.net/Global/Documents/Emergent/Visual%20Simulation%20hires.pdf Gamebryo Top Choice for Simulation &amp; Training Industries], by [[Emergent Game Technologies]] technologies (July, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gamebryo_ref2&gt;[http://www.emergent.net/en/Products/Clients--Titles/Visual-Simulation-and-Serious-Games/Firefighter-Simulation/ Emergent Game Engine Products: Firefighter Simulation]&lt;/ref&gt; and uses [[NVIDIA]] [[PhysX]] for the physics simulation (Formerly known as [[Ageia]]).

Apparently VTS is being applied to several areas of training, such as [[Firefighting]] (a teaser video depicting firefighters appeared on the company's YouTube channel) or [[Steel|Iron/Steel Industry]].

== 3D Simulation ==

Virtway has an extensive experience in developing 3D simulations/recreations of realistic scenarios distributed by several means (such as web pages).

''Molina Digital'' was the first large scale 3D project developed by Virtway. It was the recreation of a Spanish town ([[Molina de Segura]], [[Murcia]]) where users could chat, drive cars and play [[Pétanque]], all in 3D and through an [[Internet browser]], leveraging the [[Quest3D]] technology.

Part of the Molina Digital project was the development of an ''Interactive Theatre'', a pioneer application where users could take a role in a virtual play. Each user handles an avatar on stage, and controls its body language and facial expression while he talks with his mates. Everything is recorded by another user -the director- who edits the footage later, in a way similar to a [[machinima]] production.

Virtway has also been contracted by the regional government of [[Asturias]] to develop a 3D virtual visit of the city of [[Llanes]]. The result of this contract is a website where users can visit said town in 3D using [[x3d]] technology and a port of the landmarks to [[Google Earth]] [[KML]] models.

== Videogames ==

Virtway started the development of a project called ''Born To Run'' in 2004, and presented it in late 2006.&lt;ref name=Borntorun_ref&gt;[http://www.meristation.com/v3/des_noticia.php?id=cw4549f8e22195f&amp;pic=360&amp;idj=cw4549f4c23ee1d Born to Run, el primer videojuego internacional desde Asturias] (in Spanish, translates roughly as ''Born to Run, the first international videogame from Asturias'')&lt;/ref&gt; It was aimed to be one of the first First Person Shooters with photo-realistic levels of quality made in Spain, and slated to hit ''next-gen'' systems ([[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]). There has been no more information about the game since its announcement, so it is probably cancelled by now.

On 6 October 2008, Virtway entered into partnership with [[ICYou]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] company, to further develop their so-called Interactive City platform, a [[Massively multiplayer online|persistent virtual world]] with tie-ins to the real world of its players through a blend of virtual and real economy.&lt;ref name=icyou_ref&gt;[http://www.icyou.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=82&amp;Itemid=2 ICYou AB signs Agreement with Virtway]  Retrieved 14 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collaborations ==

=== Strategic Partnerships ===

As a member of the [[Indigo Group]] Holding, Virtway collaborates with some strategic partners which share their knowledge and allow them to offer better services.

As one of their partners [[Alletrust]]&lt;ref name=Alletrust_partnership_ref&gt;[http://www.alletrust.com/ Official Alletrust Website] in which ''links'' section Virtway is referenced&lt;/ref&gt; offers experience to Virtway improving their process and services.

[[ICYou AB]] (Publ) is a strategic partners that develops the Interactive City on the Virtway platform.

=== Research ===

Virtway has maintained collaborations through the Índigo Group with [[University of Oviedo]] and [[Stanford University]] in different research and development projects.&lt;ref name=GLS08_ref/&gt;

'''Water heating''' is a heat transfer process that uses an energy source to heat water above its initial temperature. Typical domestic uses of hot water include cooking, cleaning, bathing, and space heating. In industry, hot water and water heated to [[steam]] have many uses.

Domestically, water is traditionally heated in vessels known as ''water heaters'', ''kettles'', ''cauldrons'', ''pots'', or ''coppers''. These metal vessels that heat a batch of water do not produce a continual supply of heated water at a preset temperature. Rarely, hot water occurs naturally, usually from natural [[hot spring]]s. The temperature varies with the consumption rate, becoming cooler as flow increases.

Appliances that provide a continual supply of hot water are called ''water heaters'', ''hot water heaters'', ''[[hot water tank]]s'', ''[[boiler]]s'', ''[[heat exchanger]]s'', ''geysers'', or ''calorifiers''. These names depend on region, and whether they heat [[Drinking water|potable]] or non-potable water, are in domestic or industrial use, and their energy source. In [[Home|domestic]] installations, potable water heated for uses other than space heating is also called ''domestic hot water'' (''DHW'').

Fossil fuels ([[natural gas]], [[liquefied petroleum gas]], [[fuel oil|oil]]), or [[solid fuel]]s are commonly used for heating water. These may be consumed directly or may produce [[electricity]] that, in turn, heats water. Electricity to heat water may also come from any other electrical source, such as [[nuclear power]] or [[renewable energy]]. [[Alternative energy]] such as [[Solar power|solar energy]], [[heat pumps]], [[hot water heat recycling]], and [[geothermal heating]] can also heat water, often in combination with backup systems powered by fossil fuels or electricity.

Densely populated urban areas of some countries provide [[district heating]] of hot water. This is especially the case in [[Scandinavia]], [[Finland]] and [[Poland]]. District heating systems supply energy for water heating and [[space heating]] from [[cogeneration|combined heat and power (CHP) plants]], [[waste heat]] from industries, [[incinerator]]s, geothermal heating, and [[central solar heating]]. Actual heating of tap water is performed in heat exchangers at the consumers' premises. Generally the consumer has no in-building backup system, due to the expected high availability of district heating systems.

== Types of water heating appliances ==
[[File:FEMA - 63 - Photograph by Dave Saville taken on 10-04-1999 in North Carolina.jpg|thumb|Electric tank-type storage water heater (US)]]
Hot water used for space heating may be heated by fossil fuels in a boiler, while [[potable water]] may be heated in a separate appliance. This is common practice in the US, especially when warm-air space heating is usually employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-3085 |title=Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Search.eb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120909081633/http://www.search.eb.com/eb/article-3085 |archivedate=2012-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage water heaters (tank-type) ===
{{Main|Storage water heater}}
[[File:Boiler and Cylinder.jpg|thumb|upright|Gas furnace (top) and storage water heater (bottom) (Germany)]]

In household and commercial usage, most North American and Southern Asian water heaters are the tank type, also called ''storage water heaters'', these consist of a cylindrical vessel or container that keeps water continuously hot and ready to use. Typical sizes for household use range from 75 to 400 liters (20 to 100 US gallons). These may use [[electricity]], [[natural gas]], [[propane]], [[heating oil]], [[solar power|solar]], or other energy sources.  Natural gas heaters are most popular in the US and most European countries, since the gas is often conveniently piped throughout cities and towns and currently is the cheapest to use. In the United States, typical natural gas water heaters for households without unusual needs are 40 or 50 US gallons with a burner rated at 34,000 to 40,000 BTU/hour. Some models offer "High Efficiency and Ultra Low NOx" emissions.

This is a popular arrangement where higher flow rates are required for limited periods. Water is heated in a pressure vessel that can withstand a [[fluid pressure|hydrostatic pressure]] close to that of the incoming mains supply. A [[pressure reducing valve]] is sometimes employed to limit the pressure to a safe level for the vessel. In North America, these vessels are called ''hot water tanks'', and may incorporate an electrical resistance heater, a [[heat pump]], or a gas or oil burner that heats water directly.

Where hot-water space heating boilers are installed, [[Heat storage tank|domestic hot water cylinders]] are usually heated indirectly by primary water from the boiler, or by an electric [[immersion heater]] (often as backup to the boiler). In the UK these vessels are called ''indirect cylinders'', or ''direct cylinders'', respectively. Additionally, if these cylinders form part of a sealed system, providing mains-pressure hot water, they are known as unvented cylinders. In the US, when connected to a boiler they are called ''indirect-fired water heaters''.

Compared to tankless heaters, storage water heaters have the advantage of using energy (gas or electricity) at a relatively slow rate, storing the heat for later use. The disadvantage is that over time, heat escapes through the tank wall and the water cools down, activating the heating system to heat the water back up, so investing in a tank with better insulation improves this standby efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/oee.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pdf/equipment/WaterHeaterGuide_e.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215024903/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/oee.nrcan.gc.ca/files/files/pdf/equipment/WaterHeaterGuide_e.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-15 |df= }} pg28&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when heavy use exhausts the hot water, there is a significant delay before hot water is available again. Larger tanks tend to provide hot water with less temperature fluctuation at moderate flow rates.

[[Hot water thermal storage unit|Volume storage water]] heaters in the United States and New Zealand are typically vertical, cylindrical tanks, usually standing on the floor or on a platform raised a short distance above the floor. Volume storage water heaters in Spain are typically horizontal. In India, they are mainly vertical. In apartments they can be mounted in the ceiling space over laundry-utility rooms. In Australia, gas and electric outdoor tank heaters have mainly been used (with high temperatures to increase effective capacity), but solar roof tanks are becoming fashionable.

Tiny ''point-of-use'' (POU) electric storage water heaters with capacities ranging from 8 to 32 liters (2 to 6 gallons) are made for installation in kitchen and bath cabinets or on the wall above a sink. They typically use low power heating elements, about 1&amp;nbsp;kW to 1.5&amp;nbsp;kW, and can provide hot water long enough for hand washing, or, if plumbed into an existing hot water line, until hot water arrives from a remote high capacity water heater. They may be used when retrofitting a building with hot water plumbing is too costly or impractical. Since they maintain water temperature thermostatically, they can only supply a continuous flow of hot water at extremely low flow rates, unlike high-capacity tankless heaters.

In tropical countries, like Singapore and India,  a storage water heater may vary from 10&amp;nbsp;L to 35&amp;nbsp;L.  Smaller water heaters are sufficient, as ambient weather temperatures and incoming water temperature are moderate.

===Point-of-use (POU) vs centralized hot water===
A locational design decision may be made between point-of-use and centralized water heaters. Centralized water heaters are more traditional, and are still a good choice for small buildings. For larger buildings with intermittent or occasional hot water use, multiple POU water heaters may be a better choice, since they can reduce long waits for hot water to arrive from a remote heater. The decision where to locate the water heater(s) is only partially independent of the decision of a tanked vs. tankless water heater, or the choice of energy source for the heat.

=== Tankless heaters ===
{{Main|Tankless water heating}}
{{See also|Instant hot water dispenser|Electric water boiler}}
[[File:Water heater bathroom.JPG|thumb|upright|The inside of a [[hydraulic]]ally operated two-stage tankless heater, heated by 3-phase electric power. The copper tank contains heating elements with 18{{nbsp}}[[kW]] maximum power.]]

Tankless water heaters—also called ''instantaneous'', ''continuous flow'', ''inline'', ''flash'', ''on-demand'', or ''instant-on'' water heaters—are gaining in popularity.{{Citation needed|date = August 2013}} These high-power water heaters instantly heat water as it flows through the device, and do not retain any water internally except for what is in the heat exchanger coil. [[Copper in heat exchangers|Copper heat exchangers]] are preferred in these units because of their high thermal conductivity and ease of fabrication.

Tankless heaters may be installed throughout a household at more than one point-of-use (POU), far from a central water heater, or larger centralized models may still be used to provide all the hot water requirements for an entire house. The main advantages of tankless water heaters are a plentiful continuous flow of hot water (as compared to a limited flow of continuously heated hot water from conventional tank water heaters), and potential energy savings under some conditions. The main disadvantage is their much higher initial costs, a US study in Minnesota reported a 20- to 40-year payback for the tankless water heaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/difference-between-storage-and-tankless-water-heaters|title=The Difference Between Storage and Tankless Water Heaters|website=GreenBuildingAdvisor.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221115228/http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/difference-between-storage-and-tankless-water-heaters|archivedate=2017-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a comparison to a less efficient natural gas fired hot water tank, on-demand natural gas will cost 30% more over its useful life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atcoenergysense.com/For-Homeowners/Energy-Fact-Sheets/Water-Heater|title=Home Heating Energy-Saving Tips - Water Heaters|website=www.atcoenergysense.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221110335/http://www.atcoenergysense.com/For-Homeowners/Energy-Fact-Sheets/Water-Heater|archivedate=2017-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stand-alone appliances for quickly heating water for domestic usage are known in North America as ''tankless'' or ''on demand'' water heaters. In some places, they are called ''multipoint heaters'', ''geysers'' or ''ascots''. In Australia and New Zealand they are called ''instantaneous hot water units''. In Argentina they are called ''calefones''. In that country ''calefones'' use gas instead of electricity. A similar wood-fired appliance was known as the [[chip heater]].

A common arrangement where hot-water space heating is employed, is for a boiler to also heat [[Drinking water|potable water]], providing a continuous supply of hot water without extra equipment. Appliances that can supply both space-heating and domestic hot water are called ''combination'' (or ''combi'') boilers. Though on-demand heaters provide a continuous supply of domestic hot water, the rate at which they can produce it is limited by the thermodynamics of heating water from the available fuel supplies.

=== Electric shower heads ===
[[File:Showers in Guatemala.JPG|thumb|upright|An example of a [[electric shock|dangerously]] installed electric shower head in Guatemala.]]
An electric shower head has an [[electric heating]] element which heats water as it passes through. These self-heating shower heads are specialized point-of-use (POU) tankless water heaters, and are widely used in some countries.

Invented in Brazil in the 1930s and used frequently since the 1940s, the electric shower is a home appliance often seen in South American countries due to the higher costs of gas distribution. Earlier models were made of chromed copper or brass, which were expensive, but since 1970, units made of injected plastics are popular due to low prices similar to that of a hair dryer. Electric showers have a simple electric system, working like a coffee maker, but with a larger water flow. A flow switch turns on the device when water flows through it. Once the water is stopped, the device turns off automatically. An ordinary electric shower often has three heat settings: high (5.5&amp;nbsp;kW), low (2.5&amp;nbsp;kW), or cold (0&amp;nbsp;W) to use when a central heater system is available or in hot seasons.

====Energy usage====
The power consumption of electric showers in the maximum heating setting is about 5.5&amp;nbsp;kW for 120&amp;nbsp;V and 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW for 220&amp;nbsp;V. The lower costs with electric showers compared to the higher costs with boilers is due to the time of use: an electric shower uses energy only while the water flows, while a boiler works many times a day to keep a quantity of standing water hot for use throughout the day and night.  Moreover, the transfer of electric energy to the water in an electric shower head is very efficient, approaching 100%.  Electric showers may save energy compared to electric tank heaters, which lose some standby heat.
[[File:1500W Immersion Rod (15).jpg|thumb|1500W Immersion Rod]]

====Safety====
There is a wide range of electric showers, with various types of heating controls. The heating element of an electric shower is immersed in the water stream, using a [[nichrome]] resistance element which is sheathed and electrically isolated, like the ones used in oil heaters, radiators or clothes irons, providing safety. Due to electrical safety standards, modern electric showers are made of plastic instead of using metallic casings like in the past. As an electrical appliance that uses more electric current than a washer or a dryer, an electric shower installation requires careful planning, and generally is intended to be wired directly from the electrical distribution box with a dedicated [[circuit breaker]] and ground system. A poorly installed system with old aluminum wires or bad connections may be dangerous, as the wires can overheat or electric current may leak via the water stream through the body of the user to earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chai|first1=Hung Yin|title=18-year-old dies after getting electrocuted during shower at Hougang flat|url=http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/18-year-old-dies-during-shower-at-hougang-flat-after-freak-accident-with-water|accessdate=2 October 2014|agency=The New Paper|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141002132624/http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/singaporeseen/this-urban-jungle/18-year-old-dies-during-shower-at-hougang-flat-after-freak-accident-with-water|archivedate=2 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar water heaters ===
[[File:solar heater dsc00632.jpg|thumb|right| Direct-gain solar heater panels with integrated storage tank]]
[[File:Flatplate.png|thumb|Flat-plate solar thermal collector, viewed from roof-level]]
{{Main|Solar water heating}}
Increasingly, [[solar power#Solar heating systems|solar powered]] water heaters are being used. Their solar collectors are installed outside dwellings, typically on the roof or walls or nearby, and the potable [[hot water storage tank]] is typically a pre-existing or new conventional water heater, or a water heater specifically designed for solar thermal.

The most basic solar thermal models are the direct-gain type, in which the potable water is directly sent into the collector. Many such systems are said to use ''integrated collector storage'' (ICS), as direct-gain systems typically have storage integrated within the collector. Heating water directly is inherently more efficient than heating it indirectly via heat exchangers, but such systems offer very limited freeze protection (if any), can easily heat water to temperatures unsafe for domestic use, and ICS systems suffer from severe heat loss on cold nights and cold, cloudy days.

By contrast, ''indirect'' or ''closed-loop'' systems do not allow potable water through the panels, but rather pump a heat transfer fluid (either water or a water/antifreeze mix) through the panels. After collecting heat in the panels, the heat transfer fluid flows through a [[heat exchanger]], transferring its heat to the potable hot water. When the panels are cooler than the storage tank or when the storage tank has already reached its maximum temperature, the controller in closed-loop systems stops the circulation pumps. In a ''drainback'' system, the water drains into a storage tank contained in conditioned or semi-conditioned space, protected from freezing temperatures. With antifreeze systems, however, the pump ''must'' be run if the panel temperature gets too hot (to prevent degradation of the antifreeze) or too cold (to prevent the water/antifreeze mixture from freezing.)

''Flat panel collectors'' are typically used in closed-loop systems. Flat panels, which often resemble [[skylight (window)|skylights]], are the most durable type of collector, and they also have the best performance for systems designed for temperatures within {{convert|100|F-change|0|order=flip}} of [[ambient temperature]]. Flat panels are regularly used in both pure water and antifreeze systems.

Another type of solar collector is the ''evacuated tube collector'', which are intended for cold climates that do not experience severe hail and/or applications where high temperatures are needed (i.e., over {{convert|94|C|F|disp=sqbr}}). Placed in a rack, evacuated tube collectors form a row of glass tubes, each containing absorption fins attached to a central heat-conducting rod (copper or condensation-driven). The ''evacuated'' description refers to the vacuum created in the glass tubes during the manufacturing process, which results in very low heat loss and lets evacuated tube systems achieve extreme temperatures, far in excess of water's boiling point.

=== Geothermal heating ===
In countries like [[Iceland]] and [[New Zealand]], and other volcanic regions, water heating may be done using [[geothermal heating]], rather than combustion.

=== Gravity-fed system ===
Where a space-heating water boiler is employed, the traditional arrangement in the UK is to use boiler-heated (''primary'') water to heat potable (''secondary'') water contained in a cylindrical vessel (usually made of copper)—which is supplied from a cold water storage vessel or container, usually in the roof space of the building. This produces a fairly steady supply of DHW (Domestic Hot Water) at low [[pressure head|static pressure head]] but usually with a good [[Volumetric flow rate|flow]]. In most other parts of the world, water heating appliances do not use a cold water storage vessel or container, but heat water at pressures close to that of the incoming [[water main|mains water]] supply.

=== Other improvements ===
Other improvements to water heaters include check valve devices at their inlet and outlet, cycle timers, electronic [[ignition system|ignition]] in the case of fuel-using models, sealed air intake systems in the case of fuel-using models, and pipe insulation.  The sealed air-intake system types are sometimes called "band-[[joist]]" intake units. "High-efficiency" condensing units can convert up to 98% of the energy in the fuel to heating the water. The exhaust gases of combustion are cooled and are mechanically [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilated]] either through the roof or through an exterior wall.  At high [[combustion]] efficiencies a drain must be supplied to handle the water condensed out of the combustion products, which are primarily carbon dioxide and water vapor.

In traditional plumbing in the UK, the space-heating boiler is set up to heat a separate ''hot water cylinder'' or ''water heater'' for potable hot water. Such water heaters are often fitted with an auxiliary electrical ''immersion heater'' for use if the boiler is out of action for a time.  Heat from the space-heating boiler is transferred to the water heater vessel/container by means of a heat exchanger, and the boiler operates at a higher temperature than the potable hot water supply. Most potable water heaters in North America are completely separate from the space heating units, due to the popularity of [[HVAC]]/[[forced air]] systems in North America.

Residential combustion water heaters manufactured since 2003 in the United States have been redesigned to resist ignition of flammable vapors and incorporate a thermal cutoff switch, per [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] Z21.10.1. The first feature attempts to prevent vapors from flammable liquids and gases in the vicinity of the heater from being ignited and thus causing a house fire or explosion. The second feature prevents tank overheating due to unusual combustion conditions.  These safety requirements were made in response to homeowners storing, or spilling, [[gasoline]] or other flammable liquids near their water heaters and causing fires. Since most of the new designs incorporate some type of [[flame arrestor]] screen, they require monitoring to make sure they do not become clogged with lint or dust, reducing the availability of air for combustion. If the flame arrestor becomes clogged, the thermal cutoff may act to shut down the heater.

A ''wetback stove'' ([[New Zealand English|NZ]]), ''wetback heater'' (NZ), or ''back boiler'' (UK), is a simple household secondary water heater using incidental heat.  It typically consists of a hot water pipe running behind a [[fireplace]] or [[stove]] (rather than [[hot water storage]]), and has no facility to limit the heating.  Modern wetbacks may run the pipe in a more sophisticated design to assist [[heat-exchange]].  These designs are being forced out by government efficiency regulations that do not count the energy used to heat water as 'efficiently' used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/energy-efficiency-and-conservation-authority/news/article.cfm?o_id=285&amp;objectid=10342132|title=Clean-air rules could threaten wetback fires|date=24 August 2005 | work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Ancient Water Heater.jpg|thumb|Display of water heaters used in the past]]
[[File:Kerosene water heater, 1917.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Kerosene water heater, 1917]]
Though not very popular in North America, another type of water heater developed in Europe predated the storage model. In London, England, in 1868, a painter named Benjamin Waddy Maughan invented the first instantaneous domestic water heater that did not use [[solid fuel]]. Named the ''[[geyser]]'' after an Icelandic gushing hot spring, Maughan's invention made cold water at the top flow through pipes that were heated by hot gases from a burner at the bottom. Hot water then flowed into a sink or tub. The invention was somewhat dangerous because there was no flue to remove heated gases from the bathroom.  A water heater is still sometimes called a ''geyser'' in the UK.

Maughn's invention influenced the work of a Norwegian mechanical engineer named [[Edwin Ruud]]. The first automatic, storage tank-type gas water was invented around 1889 by Ruud after he immigrated to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] (US). The Ruud Manufacturing Company, still in existence today, made many advancements in tank-type and tankless water heater design and operation.

== Thermodynamics and economics ==
[[File:ModCon boiler system.jpg|thumb|Gas-fired tankless condensing boiler with hot water storage tank (US)]]
Water typically enters residences in the US at about {{convert|10|C|F}}, depending on latitude and season.  Hot water temperatures of {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} are usual for dish-washing, laundry and showering, which requires that the heater raise the water temperature about {{convert|40|C-change|F-change|abbr=on}} if the hot water is mixed with cold water at the point of use.  The [[Uniform Plumbing Code]] reference shower flow rate is {{convert|2.5|USgal|L}} per minute. Sink and dishwasher usages range from {{convert|1|-|3|USgal|L|0}} per minute.

Natural gas in the US is measured in [[therm|CCF]] (100 cubic feet), which is converted to a standardized energy unit called the [[therm]], which is equal to 100,000 [[British thermal unit]]s (BTU).  A BTU is the energy required to raise one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.  A US gallon of water weighs {{convert|8.3|lbs|kg}}.  To raise 60 gallons of water from {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|50|°C|°F|abbr=on}} requires {{math|60 × 8.3 × (122 − 50) {{=}} 35,856 BTU}}, or  approximately 0.359&amp;nbsp;CCF (35,856/100,000), at 88% efficiency.{{clarify|reason=doesn't the 88 percent efficient require factor of 1/.88?|date=August 2016}}  A 157,000&amp;nbsp;BTU/h heater (as might exist in a tankless heater) would take 15.6 minutes to do this, at 88% efficiency.  At $1 per [[therm]], the cost of the gas would be about 41 cents.

In comparison, a typical 60 gallon tank electric water heater has a 4500 watt (15,355{{nbsp}}BTU) heating element, which at 100% efficient results in a heating time of about 2.34 hours. At 16&amp;nbsp;cents/kWh the electricity would cost $1.68.

Energy efficiencies of water heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters tend to be slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas fired heaters have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 82–94% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall [[energy factor]]s can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane tank water heaters with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric tank water heaters with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units.  [[Energy Star]]-qualified natural gas and propane tank water heaters (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting. Direct electric resistance tank water heaters are not included in the Energy Star program, however, the Energy Star program does include electric [[heat pump]] units with energy factors of 200% or higher.  Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification.  Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% ([[combined cycle]] gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, direct resistance electric water heating may be the least energy efficient option. However, use of a heat pump can make electric water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a [[low carbon]] source of electricity is used.

Unfortunately, it takes a great deal of energy to heat water, as one may experience when waiting to boil a gallon of water on a stove.  For this reason, tankless on-demand water heaters require a powerful energy source.  A standard 120-V, 15-ampere rated wall electric outlet, by comparison, only sources enough power to warm a disappointingly small amount of water: about {{convert|0.17|USgal|L}} per minute at {{convert|40|C-change|F-change}} temperature elevation.

===US minimum requirements===
On April 16, 2015, as part of the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] (NAECA), new minimum standards for efficiency of residential water heaters set by the [[United States Department of Energy]] went into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/htgp_finalrule_fedreg.pdf |title=Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Residential Water Heaters, Direct Heating Equipment, and Pool Heaters; Final Rule |work=[[United States Department of Energy]] |date=April 16, 2010 |accessdate=September 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926111133/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/residential/pdfs/htgp_finalrule_fedreg.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  All new gas storage tank water heaters with capacities smaller than {{convert|55|USgal}} sold in the United States in 2015 or later shall have an energy factor of at least 60% (for 50-US-gallon units, higher for smaller units), increased from the pre-2015 minimum standard of 58% energy factor for 50-US-gallon gas units.  Electric storage tank water heaters with capacities less than 55 US gallons sold in the United States shall have an energy factor of at least 95%, increased from the pre-2015 minimum standard of 90% for 50-US-gallon electric units.

Under the 2015 standard, for the first time, storage water heaters with capacities of 55 US gallons or larger now face stricter efficiency requirements than those of 50 US gallons or less. Under the pre-2015 standard, a {{convert|75|USgal|adj=on}} gas storage water heater with a nominal input of {{convert|75,000|btu|kJ}} or less was able to have an energy factor as low as 53%, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for a 75-US-gallon gas storage tank water heater is now 74%, which can only be achieved by using condensing technology. Storage water heaters with a nominal input of 75,000 btu or greater are not currently affected by these requirements, since energy factor is not defined for such units. An {{convert|80|USgal|adj=on}} electric storage tank water heater was able to have a minimum energy factor of 86% under the pre-2015 standard, while under the 2015 standard, the minimum energy factor for an 80-gallon electric storage tank water heater is now 197%, which is only possible with [[heat pump]] technology. This rating measures efficiency at the point of use. Depending on how electricity is generated, overall efficiency may be much lower. For example, in a traditional coal plant, only about 30–35% of the energy in the coal ends up as electricity on the other end of the generator.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=ABB Inc|title=Energy Efficiency in the Power Grid|url=https://www.nema.org/Products/Documents/TDEnergyEff.pdf|website=nema.org|publisher=National Electrical Manufacturers Association|accessdate=1 October 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701034030/http://www.nema.org/Products/Documents/TDEnergyEff.pdf|archivedate=1 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Losses on the electrical grid (including line losses and voltage transformation losses) reduce electrical efficiency further. According to data from the Energy Information Administration, transmission and distribution losses in 2005 consumed 6.1% of net generation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In contrast, 90% of natural gas’ energy value is
delivered to the consumer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Gas 101 |url=http://naturalgasnb.com/CMS/site/media/naturalgasnb/2013%20Natural%20Gas%20101%20ENG_Web.pdf |website=Enbridge Gas New Brunswick (Canada) |accessdate=1 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002213100/http://naturalgasnb.com/CMS/site/media/naturalgasnb/2013%20Natural%20Gas%20101%20ENG_Web.pdf |archivedate=October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (In neither case is the energy expended exploring, developing and extracting coal or natural gas resources included in the quoted efficiency numbers.) Gas tankless water heaters shall have an energy factor of 82% or greater under the 2015 standards, which corresponds to the pre-2015 Energy Star standard.

== Water heater safety ==

=== Explosion hazard ===
[[File:WH safety valve.JPG|thumb|Temperature/pressure safety valve installed atop a tank-type water heater (US)]]

Water heaters potentially can explode and cause significant damage, injury, or death if certain safety devices are not installed. A safety device called a [[safety valve|temperature and pressure relief]] (T&amp;P or TPR) valve, is normally fitted on the top of the water heater to dump water if the temperature or pressure becomes too high.  Most plumbing codes require that a discharge pipe be connected to the valve to direct the flow of discharged hot water to a drain, typically a nearby [[floor drain]], or outside the living space.  Some building codes allow the discharge pipe to terminate in the garage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA57&amp;dq=popular+science+1951+car+lights+flash&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z7fCTPTtJsLYnAeTxryECg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Water Can Be Dynamite''] 1951 article with illustrations on basics of water heater safety pressure relief valve&lt;/ref&gt;

If a gas or propane fired water heater is installed in a [[garage (house)|garage]] or basement, many plumbing codes require that it be elevated at least {{convert|18|in|cm|abbr=on}} above the floor to reduce the potential for fire or explosion due to spillage or leakage of combustible liquids in the garage.  Furthermore, certain local codes mandate that tank-type heaters in new and retrofit installations must be secured to an adjacent wall by a strap or anchor to prevent tipping over and breaking the water and gas pipes in the event of an [[earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Plumbing Code |url=http://www.iapmo.org/California%20Plumbing%20Code/Chapter%2005.pdf |accessdate=23 Feb 2010 |publisher=International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials |pages=58–59 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720012518/http://www.iapmo.org/California%20Plumbing%20Code/Chapter%2005.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For older houses where the water heater is part of the space heating boiler, and plumbing codes allow, some plumbers install an automatic gas shutoff (such as the "Watts 210") in addition to a TPR valve. When the device senses that the temperature reaches {{convert|99|°C|°F}}, it shuts off the gas supply and prevents further heating.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In addition, an [[expansion tank]] or exterior pressure relief valve must be installed to prevent pressure buildup in the plumbing from rupturing pipes, valves, or the water heater.

=== Thermal burns (scalding) ===
[[File:Scaldburn.jpg|thumb|Scalding injury to right hand]]

[[Scalding]] is a serious concern with any water heater.  [[Human skin]] [[burn]]s quickly at high temperature, in less than 5 seconds at {{convert|60|°C|°F}}, but much slower at  {{convert|53|°C|°F}} — it takes a full minute for a [[second degree burn]].  Older people and children often receive serious scalds due to disabilities or slow [[reaction time]]s.&lt;ref name=ASPE03&gt;''Domestic Water Heating Design Manual (2nd Edition)'', American Society of Plumbing Engineers (ASPE), 2003,{{ISBN|978-1-891255-18-2}} pages 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and elsewhere it is common practice to put a [[tempering valve]] on the outlet of the water heater.  The result of mixing hot and cold water via a tempering valve is referred to as "tempered water".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Timothy A. [http://www.armstronginternational.com/files/products/lynnwood/EMC/articles/ASPE5-2003.pdf Tempered Water Systems.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224213048/http://www.armstronginternational.com/files/products/lynnwood/EMC/articles/ASPE5-2003.pdf |date=2009-02-24 }} Plumbing Systems &amp; Design, May/June 2003. pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

A tempering valve mixes enough cold water with the hot water from the heater to keep the outgoing water temperature fixed at a more moderate temperature, often set to {{convert|50|°C|°F}}.  Without a tempering valve, reduction of the water heater's setpoint temperature is the most direct way to reduce scalding.  However, for sanitation, hot water is needed at a temperature that can cause scalding.  This may be accomplished by using a supplemental heater in an appliance that requires hotter water.
Most residential [[dishwashing machine]]s, for example, include an internal electric heating element for increasing the water temperature above that provided by a domestic water heater.

=== Bacterial contamination ===
[[File:LegionellaPneumophila Kolonie.jpg|thumb|Bacterial colonies of ''Legionella pneumophila'' (indicated by arrows)]]
Two conflicting safety issues affect water heater temperature—the risk of scalding from excessively hot water greater than {{convert|55|°C|°F}}, and the risk of incubating bacteria colonies, particularly ''[[Legionella]]'', in water that is not hot enough to kill them.  Both risks are potentially life-threatening and are balanced by setting the water heater's thermostat to {{convert|55|°C|°F}}.  The European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease recommend that hot water should be stored at {{convert|60|°C|°F}} and distributed so that a temperature of at least {{convert|50|°C|°F}} and preferably {{convert|55|°C|°F}} is achieved within one minute at points of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewgli.org/data/european_guidelines/european_guidelines_jan05.pdf |title=European Guidelines for Control and Prevention of Travel Associated Legionnaires’ Disease |accessdate=2008-02-12 |date=2005-01-01 |publisher=European Working Group for Legionella Infections |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070922164043/http://www.ewgli.org/data/european_guidelines/european_guidelines_jan05.pdf |archivedate = 2007-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is a dishwasher without a booster heater, it may require a water temperature within a range of {{convert|57|-|60|°C|°F}} for optimum cleaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13090 |title=A Consumer's Guide to Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy: Lower Water Heating Temperature for Energy Savings |accessdate=2007-10-14 |date=2005-09-12 |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020616/http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13090 |archivedate=2007-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but tempering valves set to no more than {{convert|55|°C|°F}} can be applied to faucets to avoid scalding. Tank temperatures above {{convert|60|°C|°F}} may produce [[limescale]] deposits, which could later harbor bacteria, in the water tank. Higher temperatures may also increase [[Dishwasher#Silicate filming/etching/accelerated crack corrosion|etching of glassware]] in the dishwasher.

Tank thermostats are not a reliable guide to the internal temperature of the tank. Gas-fired water tanks may have no temperature calibration shown.  An electric thermostat shows the temperature at the elevation of the thermostat, but water lower in the tank can be considerably cooler. An outlet thermometer is a better indication of water temperature.&lt;ref name=DRW99&gt;Donald R. Wulfinghoff ''Energy Efficiency Manual''Energy Institute Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-9657926-7-6}} pages 458–460&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[renewable energy industry]] (solar and heat pumps, in particular) the conflict between daily thermal Legionella control and high temperatures, which may drop system performance, is subject to heated debate. In a paper seeking a green exemption from normal Legionellosis safety standards, Europe's top CEN solar thermal technical committee TC 312 asserts that a 50% fall in performance would occur if solar water heating systems were heated to the base daily. However some [[Solar Simulator|solar simulator]] analysis work using Polysun 5 suggests that an 11% energy penalty is a more likely figure. Whatever the context, both energy efficiency and scalding safety requirements push in the direction of considerably lower water temperatures than the legionella [[pasteurization]] temperature of around {{convert|60|°C|°F}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

However, legionella can be safely and easily controlled with good design and engineering protocols.  For instance raising the temperature of water heaters once a day or even once every few days to {{convert|55|°C|°F}} at the coldest part of the water heater for 30 minutes effectively controls legionella.  In all cases and in particular energy efficient applications, Legionnaires' disease is more often than not the result of engineering design issues that do not take into consideration the impact of stratification or low flow.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

It is also possible to control Legionella risks by chemical treatment of the water.  This technique allows lower water temperatures to be maintained in the pipework without the associated Legionella risk.  The benefit of lower pipe temperatures is that the heat loss rate is reduced and thus the energy consumption is reduced.

'''Well cementing''' is the process of introducing [[cement]] to the annular space between the well-bore and [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] or to the annular space between two successive [[casing string]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Economides, M. (1990). ''Well Cementing''. (E. B. Nelson, Ed.) Sugar Land, Texas: Schlumberger Educational Services.&lt;/ref&gt;. Personnel who conduct this job are called "Cementers".

==Cementing Principle==
# To support the vertical and radial loads applied to the casing
# Isolate [[porous]] formations from the producing zone formations
# Exclude unwanted sub-surface fluids from the producing interval
# Protect casing from [[corrosion]]
# Resist chemical deterioration of cement
# Confine abnormal [[pore pressure]]
# To increase the possibility to hit the target

Cement is introduced into the [[water well|well]] by means of a cementing [[hydraulic head|head]]. It helps in [[pump]]ing cement between the running of the top and bottom [[core plug|plugs]].

The most important function of cementing is to achieve zonal isolation. Another purpose of cementing is to achieve a good cement-to-pipe bond. Too low an effective [[confining pressure]] may cause the cement to become [[ductile]].

For cement, one thing to note is that there is no correlation between the [[shear strength|shear]] and [[compressive strength]]. Another fact to note is that cement strength ranges between 1000 and 1800 [[pounds per square inch|psi]], and for reservoir pressures &gt; 1000 psi; this means that the pipe cement bond will [[structural failure|fail]] first. This would lead to the development of micro-annuli along the pipe.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, W. C. (Ed.). (1993). ''Handbook for Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineers'' (Vol. 1). Houston: Gulf Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cement Classes==
{{unreliable sources|date=February 2015}}
A. 0–6000&amp;nbsp;ft used when special properties are not required.

B. 0–6000&amp;nbsp;ft used when conditions require moderate to high [[sulfate]] resistance

C. 0–6000&amp;nbsp;ft used when conditions require high early strength

D. 6000–10000&amp;nbsp;ft used under moderately high [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s

E. 10000–14000&amp;nbsp;ft used under conditions of high temperatures and pressures

F. 10000–16000&amp;nbsp;ft used under conditions of extremely high temperatures and pressures

G. 0–8000&amp;nbsp;ft can be used with [[Cement accelerator|accelerators]] and [[Retarder (chemistry)|retarders]] to cover a wide range of well depths and temperatures.
 
H. 0–8000&amp;nbsp;ft can be used with accelerators and retarders to cover a wide range of well depths and temperatures.
 
J. 12000–16000&amp;nbsp;ft can be used under conditions of extremely high temperatures and pressures or can be mixed with accelerators and retarders to cover a range of well depth and temperatures.

API cement grades A, B and C correspond to ASTM type I, II and III.

==Cement parameters==
*Particle size distribution.
*Distribution of [[silicate]] and [[aluminate]] [[Phase transition|phases]].
*Reactivity of [[hydrate|hydrating]] phases.
*[[Gypsum]]/[[hemihydrate]]s [[ratio]] and total sulphate content.
*Free [[alkali]] content.
*Chemical nature quantity and specific surface are of initial hydration products.

Given the multitude of cement [[parameter]]s the best and most thorough and practical method of designing a cement blend is through laboratory testing.

The tests should be conducted on a sample that represents the cement to be used on the [[job site]].

===Additives and mechanism of action===
There are 8 general categories of [[wikt:additive|additives]].

#'''Accelerators''' reduce setting time and increases the rate of compressive strength build up.
#'''Retarders''' extend the Setting time.
#'''Extenders''' lower the density&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherford.com/Products/EngineeredChemistry/CementingAdditives/CementExtenders/ |title=Login to access the Oil &amp;amp; Gas Journal Subscriber Premium features |author= |publisher=Weatherford |date= |accessdate=23 Nov 2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Weighting Agents''' increase density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lvlomas.com/english/pdf/Oilfield_Master_Product_List.pdf |title=Oilfield_Master_Product_List |author= |publisher=L.V. Lomas Ltd. |date=May 2012 |accessdate=23 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Dispersant]]s''' reduce viscosity.
#'''Fluid loss control agents'''.
#'''Lost circulation control agents'''.
#'''Specialty agents'''.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, E. B., Baret, J. F., &amp; Michaux, M. (1993). ''Additives and Mechanisms of Action''. Sugar Land, Texas: Schlumberger Educational Services.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accelerators==
Can be added to shorten the setting time or to accelerate the hardening process.

[[Calcium chloride]], under the right conditions, tends to improve the [[compressive strength]] and significantly reduces the thickening and setting time. Used in concentrations of up to 4.0%. The mechanism of this process is debated, but there are four major [[theory|theories]] put forward.

#It affects the hydration phase by one of the following theories:
##[[Chlorine]] (Cl-) [[ion]]s enhance the formation of [[ettingite]] ([[crystalline]]) Tenoutasse 1978.
##Increases the hydration of Aluminate phase/gypsum system. Traettenber &amp; Gratten Bellow 1975.
##Accelerates the hydration n of C3S. Stein 1961
#Changes the C-S-H structure.
##Controls the [[diffusion]] of [[water]] and ionic species.
##C-S-H gel has a higher area and will react faster.
#Diffusion of the chloride ions;
##Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions diffuse into the C-S-H [[gel]] faster, this process producing the precipitation of [[portlandite]] sooner.
##The smaller size of the Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions causes a greater tendency to diffuse into the C-S-H [[membrane]]. Eventually the C-S-H membrane bursts and the hydration process is accelerated.
##Changes the aqueous phase composition.

Calcium chloride also produces a high amount of [[heat]] during hydration. This heat could accelerate the hydration process.

This heat causes the casing to expand and contract as it [[dissipation|dissipates]]. The differing rates of expansion and contraction could result in the casing pulling away from the cement and lead to the formation of micro-annuli. It also has the ability to affect the cement [[rheology]], the compressive strength development, produce shrinkage by 10–15%, increases the [[Hydraulic conductivity|permeability]] with time, and lowers the sulphate resistance.

==Retarders==
They work by one of 4 main theories;

#[[Adsorption]] theory: the retarder is adsorbed &amp; inhibits water content.
#[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]] theory: reacts with aqueous phase to form an impermeable and insoluble layer around the cement grains.
#[[Nucleation]] theory: retarder poisons the hydration product and prevents future growth.
#[[Complexation]] theory: Ca+ ions are [[chelation|chelated]] by the retarder. A nucleus can’t be properly formed.

'''[[Lignosulphonate]]s''': Wood pulp derived [[polymer]]s. Effective in all [[Portland cement]]s and added in concentrations of 0.1% to 1.5% BWOC. It absorbs into the C-S-H [[gel]] and causes a change of [[Morphology (materials science)|morphology]] to a more impermeable structure.

[[Lactide|Hydroxycarboxylic Acid]]s – They have [[hydroxyl]] [[carboxyl]] [[Functional group|groups]] in their [[molecular structure]]. Below 93&amp;nbsp;°C they can cause over-retardation. They are efficient to a temperature of 150&amp;nbsp;°C. One [[acid]] used in [[citric acid]] with an effective concentration of 0.1% to 0.3% BWOC.

'''[[Saccharide]] [[Compound (chemistry)|Compounds]]''': [[Sugar (chemistry)|sugar]]s are excellent retarders of Portland cement. Such compounds are not commonly used due to the degree of retardation being very sensitive to variation of concentration. It also depends on the compound’s susceptibility to [[alkaline hydrolysis]].

'''[[Cellulose]] Derivatives''': [[Polysaccharide]]s derived from wood or vegetable matter, and are stable to the [[alkaline|alkali]] conditions of the cement [[slurry]].

'''[[Organophosphate]]s''': [[Alkylene]] [[phosphonic acid]]s.

'''[[Inorganic Compound]]s''': 
:Acids and accompanying [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s
:[[Sodium chloride]], used in concentrations of up to 5.0% and with bottom hole temperatures less than 160 deg F. It will improve compressive strength and reduce thickening and setting time.
:[[Oxide]]s of [[zinc]] and [[lead]].

==Extenders==
Reduce slurry density – reduces [[hydrostatic pressure]] during cementing. 
Increases slurry yield – reduces the amount of cement required to produce a given [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].

Water extenders – Allow/facilitate the addition of water to help extend the cement blend/slurry.

Low-density aggregates – Materials with densities less than Portland cement (3.15 g/cm3)

'''Gaseous extenders''' – [[Nitrogen]] or [[air]] can be used to prepare foam.

'''[[Clay]]s''' – Hydrous [[aluminum silicate]]s. Most common is [[bentonite]] (85% mineral clay [[smectite]]). Can be used to obtain a cement of density 11.5 to 15.0 [[parts per gallon|ppg]], with concentrations up to 20%. Used with an API ratio of 5.3% water to 1.0% bentonite.
   
Bentonite – this is added in conjunction with additional water, used for specific weight control but makes poor cement.

'''[[Pozzolan]]''' – finely ground [[pumice]] of [[fly ash]]. Pozzolan costs very little, but does not achieve much weight reduction of the slurry.

'''[[Diatomaceous earth|Diatomaceous]]''' earth – also requires additional water to be added. Properties are similar to those of bentonite.

'''[[Silica]]''' – α [[quartz]] and condensed [[silica fume]]. α quartz is used to prevent strength retrogression in [[thermal well]]s. Silica fume (micro fume) is highly reactive, and is regarded as the most effective pozzolanic material available. The high surface area increases the water demand to get pumpable slurry. Such a mixture can produce a cement slurry as low as 11.0&amp;nbsp;ppg.

Normal concentration = 15% BWOC but can be as high as 28% BWOC. Can sometimes be used to prevent annular fluid migration.

'''Expanded [[Pearlite]]'''—Used to reduce the weight as water is added with its addition. Without bentonite the pearlite separates and floats to the upper part of the slurry. Can be used to achieve a slurry weight as low as 12.0ppg. Bentonite in concentrations of 2–4% is also added to prevent segregation of particles and slurry.

'''[[Gilsonite]]''' – Used to obtain slurry weights as low as 12.0ppg. In high concentrations, mixing is a problem.

'''[[Powdered coal]]''' – Can be used to obtain a slurry with a density as low as 11.9ppg, 12.5–25&amp;nbsp;lbs per sack are usually added.

==Particulate materials==
Uses [[latex]] additives to achieve fluid loss. [[Emulsion polymerization|Emulsion polymers]] are supplied as [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of polymer particles. They contain about 50% solids. Such particles can physically plug the pores in the [[filter cake]].

==Water-soluble polymers==
They increase the [[viscosity]] of the aqueous phase and decrease the filter cake permeability.

==Cellulose derivatives==
'''Organic [[protein]]s''' ([[polypeptide]]s). Not used above temperatures of 93&amp;nbsp;°C.

'''[[Non-ionic]] [[synthetic polymer]]s''' Can lower fluid loss rates from 500&amp;nbsp;ml/30&amp;nbsp;min to 20&amp;nbsp;ml/30&amp;nbsp;min.

There are also [[anionic]] synthetic polymers and [[cationic polymerization|cationic polymers]].

==Non-ionic synthetic polymers==
Can lower fluid loss rates from 500ml/30min to 20ml/30min.

There are also anionic synthetic polymers and cationic polymers.

==Bridging agents==
The addition of materials that can physically bridge fractured or weak zones. E.g. gilsonite and [[cellophane]] flakes added in quantities of 0.125–0.500&amp;nbsp;lbs/sack.

==[[Thixotropy|Thixotropic]] Cement==
These are cement slurries that upon entering the formation they begin the gel and eventually become self-supporting.
