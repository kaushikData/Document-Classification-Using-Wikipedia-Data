'''Acid rain''' is a [[rain]] or any other form of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that is unusually [[acid]]ic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low [[pH]]). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of [[sulfur dioxide|sulphur dioxide]] and [[nitrogen oxide]], which react with the [[Properties of water|water molecules]] in the [[atmosphere]] to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by [[lightning]] strikes, and sulphur dioxide is produced by [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]]. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, [[corrosion]] of steel structures such as bridges, and [[weathering]] of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

==Definition==
"Acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog,  cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. [[Distilled water]], once [[carbon dioxide]] is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a [[pH]] greater than 7 are alkaline. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form [[carbonic acid]], a weak acid according to the following reaction:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula |C||O|2}} (g) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} ([[Aqueous solution|aq]])

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of [[carbonate]] and [[hydronium]] ions:

:{{Chemical formula|H|2|O}} (l) + {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{Chemical formula|H||C||O|3}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + {{Chemical formula|H|3|O}}&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq)

However, unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is [[nitric acid]] produced by [[electric discharge]] in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/JD092iD11p13299|author1=Likens, Gene E. |author2=Keene, William C. |author3=Miller, John M. |author4=Galloway, James N. |title=Chemistry of precipitation from a remote, terrestrial site in Australia|year=1987|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=92|issue=D11 |page=13299 |bibcode=1987JGR....9213299L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acid deposition as an [[environmental issue]] (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids other than {{Chemical formula|H|2|C||O|3}}.

==History==

The corrosive effect of polluted, acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by [[John Evelyn]], who remarked upon the poor condition of the [[Arundel marbles]].&lt;ref&gt;E. S. de Beer, ed. ''[[The Diary of John Evelyn]]'', III, 1955 (19 September 1667) p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased.&lt;ref name="NASA Glossary"&gt;{{Citation

The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local [[pollution]] has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation.&lt;ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"&gt;{{cite journal|author =Likens, G. E. |author2=Wright, R. F. |author3=Galloway, J. N. |author4=Butler, T.

E. |year=1984|title= Acid rain: the smokestack is the "smoking gun" |journal=Garden |volume=8|issue=4|pages=12–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (simply because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in [[Scandinavia]].

The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from [[Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest|Hubbard Brook]] Valley. In 1972, a group of scientists including [[Gene Likens]] discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Likens|first=Gene E.|last2=Bormann|first2=F.

Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noye M.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Charles T.|last3=Eaton|first3=John S.|last4=Likens|first4=Gene E.|last5=McDowell|first5=William H.|date=1981-09-01|title='Acid rain', dissolved aluminum and chemical weathering at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016703781902763|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=45|issue=9|pages=1421–1437|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(81)90276-3|bibcode=1981GeCoA..45.1421J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering. Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species’ behaviors. There was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the [[food web]] complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Ronald J.|last2=Likens|first2=Gene E.|last3=Fiance|first3=Sandy B.|last4=Hendrey|first4=George R.|date=1980-08-01|title=Experimental Acidification of a Stream in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=976–989|doi=10.2307/1936765|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1936765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed an [[Acid Deposition Act]].&lt;ref name="Lackey"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.epa.gov/wed/pages/staff/lackey/pubs/ACID-RAIN-SCIENCE-POLICY-LACKEY-BLAIR-JOURNAL-REPRINT-1997.pdf |author =Lackey, R.T. |year=1997|title= Science, policy, and acid rain: lessons learned|journal= Renewable Resources Journal|volume= 15|issue=1|pages= 9–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents.&lt;ref name="Lackey" /&gt;  For the U.S. Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1462-9011(98)00006-9|title=Acid rain: Science and policy making|year=1998|last1=Winstanley|first1=Derek|last2=Lackey|first2=Robert T.|last3=Warnick|first3=Walter L.|last4=Malanchuk|first4=John|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy|volume=1|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/08/science/acid-rain-issue-creates-stress-between-administration-and-science-academy.html|title=ACID RAIN ISSUE CREATES STRESS BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND SCIENCE ACADEMY|last=Times|first=Robert Reinhold, Special To The New York|date=1982-06-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Ronald_Reagan_Environment.htm|title=Ronald Reagan on Environment|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US.

In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyNET.exe/20013U0E.TXT?ZyActionD=ZyDocument&amp;Client=EPA&amp;Index=1981+Thru+1985&amp;Docs=&amp;Query=&amp;Time=&amp;EndTime=&amp;SearchMethod=1&amp;TocRestrict=n&amp;Toc=&amp;TocEntry=&amp;QField=&amp;QFieldYear=&amp;QFieldMonth=&amp;QFieldDay=&amp;IntQFieldOp=0&amp;ExtQFieldOp=0&amp;XmlQuery=&amp;File=D:%5Czyfiles%5CIndex%20Data%5C81thru85%5CTxt%5C00000012%5C20013U0E.txt&amp;User=ANONYMOUS&amp;Password=anonymous&amp;SortMethod=h%7C-&amp;MaximumDocuments=1&amp;FuzzyDegree=0&amp;ImageQuality=r75g8/r75g8/x150y150g16/i425&amp;Display=hpfr&amp;DefSeekPage=x&amp;SearchBack=ZyActionL&amp;Back=ZyActionS&amp;BackDesc=Results%20page&amp;MaximumPages=1&amp;ZyEntry=1&amp;SeekPage=x&amp;ZyPURL|title=Report of the Acid Rain Peer Review Panel|last=|first=|date=July 1984|website=Document Display {{!}} NEPIS {{!}} US EPA|publisher=|language=en|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; White House [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]] reviewed the draft report and sent [[Fred Singer]]’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/from-tobacco-to-climate-change-merchants-of-doubt-undermined-the-science/full/|title=From tobacco to climate change, ‘merchants of doubt’ undermined the science|date=2010-04-17|newspaper=Grist|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nierenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulphur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/18/us/legislators-sat-white-house-suppressed-acid-rain-report.html|title=LEGISLATORS SAT WHITE HOUSE SUPPRESSED ACID RAIN REPORT|last=Franklin|first=Ben A.|date=1984-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the US National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program : 1990 integrated assessment report. Washington, D.C. : National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program, Office of the Director, [1991]&lt;/ref&gt; It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1990, the U.S. Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/clean-air-act-title-iv-subchapter-acid-deposition-control |title=Clean Air Act Title IV - Subchapter A: Acid Deposition Control &amp;#124; Overview of the Clean Air Act and Air Pollution &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Title IV of these amendments established the a [[cap and trade]] system designed to control emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/air.pdf “Cleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. September 2017. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from power plants, close to a 50% reduction&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulphur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulphur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.&lt;ref name="US Environmental Protection Agency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |title=US EPA: A Brief History of Acid Rain |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214841/http://www.epa.gov/NE/eco/acidrain/history.html |archivedate=2010-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the [[Pacific Research Institute]], acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/03/MNMMTJUS1.DTL&amp;hw=Cap+trade+Acid+Rain&amp;sn=001&amp;sc=1000 'Cap-and-trade' model eyed for cutting greenhouse gases], [[San Francisco Chronicle]], December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2facts.com/RecordUrl.asp?article=/icof/search/i0702840.asp |title=Facts On File News Services Databases |publisher=2facts.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional regulation was used in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions during the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;Gilberston, T. and Reyes, O. 2009.

In 2007, total SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/airmarkt/progress/arp07.html Acid Rain Program 2007 Progress Report], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted.&lt;ref name="sfgate.com"/&gt; Forbes says: ''In 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W. Bush administration’s Clean Air Interstate Rule, SO2 emissions had fallen to 5.1 million tons.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerdes|first1=Justin|title=Cap and Trade Curbed Acid Rain: 7 Reasons Why It Can Do The Same For Climate Change|url=http://onforb.es/yfatTf|website=Forbes|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=27 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Citizen science]] can be traced back as far as January 1989 and a campaign by the [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]] to measure Acid rain. Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|Wilson Center]] entitled 'Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by R. Kerson in the magazine [[MIT Technology Review]] from January 1989.&lt;ref name=1stUse&gt;{{cite web|author=Muki Haklay|title=Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Citizen_Science_Policy_European_Perspective_Haklay.pdf|publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|page=11|date=2015|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson&gt;{{cite magazine|author=R. Kerson|title=Lab for the Environment|journal=MIT Technology Review|date=1989|volume=92|issue=1|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting from the Wilson Center report: "The new form of engagement in science received the name "citizen science". The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. The volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon."&lt;ref name=1stUse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kerson/&gt;

==Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification==
The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulphur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form [[nitric acid]] are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulphur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; comes from [[fossil fuel]] combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from [[wildfires]] and 7–8 Tg(S) per year from [[volcanoes]].&lt;ref name="Berresheim 1995"&gt;Berresheim, H.; Wine, P.H. and Davies D.D. (1995). "Sulfur in the Atmosphere". In ''Composition, Chemistry and Climate of the Atmosphere'', ed. H.B. Singh. Van Nostrand Rheingold {{ISBN|0-442-01264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural phenomena===
The principal natural [[phenomena]] that contribute acid-producing gases to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] are emissions from volcanoes. Thus, for example, [[fumarole]]s from the Laguna Caliente crater of [[Poás Volcano]] create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.
Acid-producing gasses are also created by [[biology|biological]] processes that occur on the land, in [[wetland]]s, and in the [[ocean]]s. The major biological source of sulphur containing compounds is [[dimethyl sulfide]].

Nitric acid in [[rainwater]] is an important source of fixed [[nitrogen]] for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as [[lightning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www6.dict.cc/wp_examples.php?lp_id=1&amp;lang=en&amp;s=nitric%20acid|title=|last=|first=|date=January 24, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acidic deposits have been detected in [[glacier|glacial ice]] thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.&lt;ref name="Likens, G. E. 1979"/&gt;

Soils of [[coniferous forests]] are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

===Human activity===
[[File:Gavin Power Plant.jpg|thumb|The coal-fired [[Gavin Power Plant]] in [[Cheshire, Ohio]]]]
The principal cause of acid rain is sulphur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as [[electricity generation]], factories, and [[motor vehicle]]s. Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.

==Chemical processes==
Combustion of fuels produces sulphur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulphuric acid and nitric acid.&lt;ref name="CAA01"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/09/980928072644.htm Clean Air Act Reduces Acid Rain In Eastern United States], ''ScienceDaily'', September 28, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas phase chemistry===
In the [[gas phase]] sulphur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the [[hydroxyl]] radical via an [[intermolecular]] reaction:&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/&gt;
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·
which is followed by:
:HOSO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;· + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
In the presence of water, [[sulfur trioxide|sulphur trioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is converted rapidly to [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]]:
:SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)

[[Nitrogen dioxide]] reacts with OH to form nitric acid:
[[File:Air Pollution-Causes&amp;Effects.svg|thumb|This shows the process of the air pollution being released into the atmosphere and the areas that will be affected.]]
:NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH· → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

===Chemistry in cloud droplets===
When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.

;Hydrolysis

sulphur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, [[hydrolysis|hydrolyses]] in a series of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] reactions:

:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
:SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
:HSO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}} H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

;Oxidation

There are a large number of aqueous reactions that [[redox|oxidize]] sulphur from S([[oxidation state|IV]]) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulphuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[oxygen]] (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by [[iron]] and [[manganese]] in the cloud droplets).&lt;ref name="Seinfeld 1998"/&gt;

==Acid deposition==

===Wet deposition===
Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

===Dry deposition===
Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition.&lt;ref name="archive glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |title=UK National Air Quality Archive: Air Pollution Glossary |publisher=Airquality.co.uk |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2010-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417054802/http://www.airquality.co.uk/archive/glossary.php |archivedate=2009-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

==Adverse effects==
Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

===Surface waters and aquatic animals===
[[File:Waterspecies.gif|thumb|This chart shows that not all fish, shellfish, or the insects that they eat can tolerate the same amount of acid; for example, frogs can tolerate water that is more acidic (i.e., has a lower pH) than trout.]]
Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the [[brook trout]] in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/surface_water.html Effects of Acid Rain – Surface Waters and Aquatic Animals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: "Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams".&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt; Lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition (i.e. marble) due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals, even with the same amount of acid rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mineral Resources, Economics and the Environment.|last=Kesler|first=Stephen|publisher=Cambridge University|year=2015|isbn=9781107074910|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Soils===
Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodhe, H., et al. The global distribution of acidifying wet deposition. Environmental Science and TEchnology. vlo. 36, no. 20 (October) p.&amp;nbsp;4382–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[enzyme]]s of these microbes are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]] (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize [[toxin]]s, such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name="EPA: Forests"&gt;US EPA: [http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html Effects of Acid Rain – Forests] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726034352/http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/forests.html |date=July 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as [[sugar maple]] ([[Acer saccharum]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The biogeochemistry of sulfur at Hubbard Brook|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/BioGeo60.235.316.pdf|doi=10.1023/A:1020972100496|year=2002|last1=Likens|first1=G.E.|last2=Driscoll|first2=C.T.|last3=Buso|first3=D.C.|last4=Mitchell|first4=M.J.|last5=Lovett|first5=G.M.|last6=Bailey|first6=S.W.|last7=Siccama|first7=T.G.|last8=Reiners|first8=W.A.|last9=Alewell|first9=C.|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=60|issue=3|page=235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.272.5259.244|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/mitchell/Class%20Readings/Sci.272.244.246.pdf|title=Long-Term Effects of Acid Rain: Response and Recovery of a Forest Ecosystem|year=1996|last1=Likens|first1=G.

===Forests and other vegetation===
[[File:Acid rain woods1.JPG|thumb|Acid rain can have severe effects on vegetation. A forest in the [[Black Triangle (region)|Black Triangle]] in Europe.]]
Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.&lt;ref&gt;DeHayes, D.H., Schaberg, P.G. and G.R. Strimbeck.

===Ocean acidification===
{{main|Ocean acidification}}
{{expand section|date=July 2013}}
Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans. However, acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their [[exoskeleton]]s that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/headline_universe/olpa/acid_coasts_7sept07.html|title=Acid Rain Has Disproportionate Impact on Near-Shore Ocean Waters - Windows to the Universe|website=www.windows2universe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the [[calcium carbonate]], core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.

===Human health effects===
Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including [[asthma]] and [[bronchitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/acidrain/effects/health.html Effects of Acid Rain – Human Health]. Epa.gov (2006-06-02). Retrieved on 2013-02-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse effects===
[[File:Pollution - Damaged by acid rain.jpg|Effect of acid rain on statues|thumb|right]]
[[File:Skulptur aus Sandstein, Dresden 2012-09-06-0555.jpg|Acid rain and weathering|thumb|right]]
Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as [[limestone]] and [[marble]], that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

:CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) {{eqm}} CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (s) + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the [[corrosion]] rate of metals, in particular [[iron]], [[steel]], [[copper]] and [[bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m0441x12l06k5n23/ |title=ICP on effects on materials |accessdate=2010-11-18 |doi=10.1007/BF01186242 |volume=85 |issue=4 |journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution |pages=2701–2706|bibcode=1995WASP...85.2701R |last1=Reisener |first1=A. |last2=Stäckle |first2=B. |last3=Snethlage |first3=R. |year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/PUB/Documents/WP-89-104.pdf |title=Approaches in modeling the impact of air pollution-induced material degradation |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected areas==
Places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/acid_rain_in_europe |title=Acid Rain in Europe |author=Ed.

==Prevention methods==

===Technical solutions===
Many coal-firing [[power station]]s use [[flue-gas desulfurization|flue-gas desulphurization]] (FGD) to remove sulphur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulphur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral [[calcium sulfate]] that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulphur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as [[gypsum]] when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in [[landfill]]. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to [[Restoration ecology|restore]] native life.

[[Fluidized bed combustion]] also reduces the amount of sulphur emitted by power production.

[[Vehicle emissions control]] reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

===International treaties===
A number of international treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]] under the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]]. Canada and the US signed the [[Air Quality Agreement]] in 1991.  Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

===Emissions trading===
{{main|Emissions trading}}
{{See also|Acid Rain Program}}
In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990]]&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=6 Transcript] (see p6). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 42 ''U.S. Code'' 7651&lt;/ref&gt; is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.

The ''' Baloch of Punjab'''  are [[Baloch people|Baloch]] people who have settled in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]]. A significant number of Baloch tribes have over time settled in the Punjab.

==History==
According to Dr. Akhtar Baloch, [[Professor]] at [[University of Karachi]], the Baloch migrated from [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]] during the [[Little Ice Age]] and settled in [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

Due to the extenstive residence in Punjab and the inter-marriage with the local [[Jat Muslim|Jat]] and [[Muslim Rajputs|Rajput]] Muslims has deprived them of many of their characteristics due to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and they have now forgotten the Baloch language and have abandoned the Baloch dress.

The [[Jatoi (tribe)|Jatoi]] are the children of Jatoi, Jalal Khan's daughter. These main sections are now divided into innumerable septs.  The [[Balochistan region]] is divided among [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].

[[Mangaka|Manga artists]] and [[anime director]]s have argued that it is dangerous to try to define child pornography when it comes to [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[drawing]]s, and [[Cartoon|animation]] when regarding [[hentai]] due to it being highly [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]], and have cited [[freedom of expression]] to prevent it from being abused. For example, they argued that even in the [[anime]] and [[manga]] series ''[[Doraemon]]'', the scene of the schoolgirl [[Shizuka Minamoto]] taking a bath might be mis-construed as "child pornography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kawamoto |first1=Hiroshi |title=Japan nears outlawing possession of child pornography |date=June 5, 2014 |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201406050010 |work=The [[Asahi Shimbun]] |accessdate=7 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224021/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201406050010 |archive-date=2014-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts depicting underage characters ([[lolicon]] and [[shotacon]]) and photography of underage models ([[junior idol]]) remain controversial in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ban on possession of child porn takes effect in Japan|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/07/15/national/crime-legal/hit-global-criticism-japan-bans-individual-possession-child-porn-images-manga-exempt/#.Vk7h0XLALFb|accessdate=20 November 2015|agency=[[Kyodo News]]|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/japan-to-enforce-ban-on-possession-of-child-pornography-a-year-after-passing-it-10392397.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal background==
===Domestic===
The ''Act on Punishment of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Protection of Children'' came into effect on May 26, 1999. Under Article 7, it outlawed the production, transport, import and export of child pornography, as well as possession of child pornography for the aforementioned purposes.&lt;ref name="1999act" /&gt;

Previously, obscenity was regulated by the 1907 [[Penal Code of Japan]]. Article 175 of the code has been applied to underage obscenity, notably in a 1993 case where a ''[[burusera]]'' shop owner was arrested on suspicion of possession for sale of obscene media, after he had invited a high school student to appear in a pornographic video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npa.go.jp/hakusyo/h06/h060500.html Police White Paper, 1994.] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

The penalty for possession with any intent of commercialization, sales, or distribution is a maximum imprisonment with labor for three years or a fine of three million yen (approximately $39,000). Production or distribution of child pornography is punishable by imprisonment with labor for up to five years and a fine of up to five million yen (approximately  $50,000). Article 34 of the Child Welfare Act, applicable since 1947, states that "''No person shall commit an act listed in any of the following items:''" with line six specifying "''Cause a child to commit an obscene act''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail_main?re=01&amp;vm=03&amp;id=11 |title=Child Welfare Act |publisher=Japaneselawtranslation.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there were no laws addressing the simple possession of [[Pornography|any kind of pornography]] in general (which included child pornography, with no intent to sale or distribute). On 4 June 2014, a bill was approved to be passed to ban the possession, closing this loophole in the nation's child pornography prohibition law, although it did not apply to [[hentai]] in [[anime]] and [[manga]] in order to prevent abuse of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Japan to finally outlaw possession of child porn, but manga gets free pass |url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/06/04/national/crime-legal/japan-finally-moving-to-ban-child-porn-possession/ |date=4 June 2014 |work=[[The Japan Times]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]], [[Jiji Press]] |accessdate=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kawamoto |first1=Hiroshi |title=Japan nears outlawing possession of child pornography |date=June 5, 2014 |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201406050010 |work=The [[Asahi Shimbun]] |accessdate=7 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606224021/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201406050010 |archive-date=2014-06-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Possession of child porn to be banned |url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001329875 |date=4 June 2014 |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |agency=[[Jiji Press]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606211528/http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0001329875 |archivedate=6 June 2014 |accessdate=28 January 2015 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/06/17/world/asia/japan-child-porn-law |title=Japan passes law banning possession of child pornography |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=18 June 2014 |accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political background==
In June 2008, a bill proposing a ban on child pornography possession was submitted to the [[House of Representatives of Japan]], where it was brought before the Diet in September, but failed to pass.&lt;ref name="reuters 2008"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUST35097220080808 Japan police crack down on 300 child porn cases] Kubota, Yuko. Reuters. Accessed August 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] and the [[New Komeito Party]] proposed to outlaw any possession of child pornography, but was countered by the [[Democratic Party of Japan]] with a different proposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_gian.nsf/html/gian/honbun/g16901032.htm Proposal by the ruling parties] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924101116/http://www.shugiin.go.jp/itdb_gian.nsf/html/gian/honbun/g16901032.htm |date=September 24, 2009 }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090320185503/http://www.dpj.or.jp/news/?num=15504 Democrat's counterproposal] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives dissolved on July 21, 2009, and both proposals to revise the law were withdrawn. During the [[general election]] of the House of Representatives in August 2009, open letters written by politicians to a civilian organization showed that the politicians were divided on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://miau.jp/20090817/tokyo_all.html The Movements for Internet Active Users (MIAU)] Answers to Question 8 (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Japanese branch of [[UNICEF]] called on the government to outlaw simple possession of child pornography, as well as [[manga]] and [[anime]] pornography depicting minors. It also called for tighter restrictions of [[Junior idol]] media under existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/03/11/oukin-uk-japan-pornography-idUKT20430220080311|author=Isabel Reynolds |title=UNICEF says Japan failing to control child porn|date=2008-03-11|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States ambassador to Japan has stated that Japan's lack of laws restricting possession of child pornography has impeded international investigations into child pornography.&lt;ref name="reuters 2008" /&gt;

On August 25, 2011, the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Japan|Liberal Democratic Party]] submitted a petition requesting stricter laws on child pornography, which included child pornography in anime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Artefact |url=http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2011/09/29/ldp-seeks-new-ban-manga-anime-virtual-child-abuse/ |title=LDP Seeks New Ban: "Manga &amp; Anime = Virtual Child Abuse" |publisher=Sankaku Complex |date=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangiin.go.jp/japanese/joho1/kousei/seigan/177/yousi/yo1771775.htm |title=請願：参議院ホームページ |publisher=Sangiin.go.jp |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2013, the Liberal Democratic Party moved forward with their proposal. A decision has not yet been reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Loli Ban Not Rejected | publisher=Sankaku Complex | url = http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2013/06/27/loli-ban-not-rejected/ |accessdate=2013-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 public opinion poll taken by the Japanese government showed that 86.5% of respondents believed that child pornography regulations should be applied to anime and manga, while 90.9% endorsed regulations of "harmful materials" on the Internet.&lt;ref name="Asiatimes"&gt;{{cite news|author=William Sparrow|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/JB23Aa02.html | title=Japan's Lolita merchants feel the heat|publisher=[[Asia Times]] |date=2007-02-23|accessdate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junior idols==
{{Main|Junior idol}}

While not considered explicitly pornographic, media portraying young idols is a large industry in Japan. Photobooks and videos of underage models in scant, tight fitting and revealing clothing are often taken to be provocative and pornographic in nature. The industry remains lucrative, with ''[[The Japan Times]]'' reporting an estimated 3 million idol photobooks sold between 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name=Asiatimes /&gt; However, child modeling in Japan is not seen in the same light as in the West, as many models are eventually offered acting, singing, or promotional careers.

Studios producing junior idol media are not exempt from current laws. After 2007, staff and heads of various video production firms were arrested on allegations that their productions overstepped legal boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3416297/ December3, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206003854/http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/3416297/ |date=February 6, 2009 }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/crime/090719/crm0907191744010-n1.htm July 19, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722073940/http://sankei.jp.msn.com/affairs/crime/090719/crm0907191744010-n1.htm |date=July 22, 2009 }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lolicon and shotacon==
{{Main|Lolicon|Shotacon}}

In Japan, ''[[lolicon]]'' is a broadly defined term that describes an "attraction to underage girls" by males and/or females, whether young or old. It can also apply to older characters with youthful [[neotenic]] features that make them appear to be younger than they really are, and refers to a [[hentai]] subgenre in [[dojinshi]], [[manga]], [[anime]], and [[video game]]s in which childlike characters are usually depicted in a [[ero kawaii]] (erotic cute) manner, which can range from [[pornography|explicitly pornographic]] to mildly suggestive, romantic and entirely non-sexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Jason|title=[[Manga: The Complete Guide]]|publisher=Del Rey|year=2007|page=501|isbn=0-345-48590-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young boys equivalent is called ''[[shotacon]]''. Outside Japan, the term has been narrowed to describe the hentai subgenre, usually involving [[simulated pornography]].

Figures regarding the prevalence of ''lolicon'' and ''shotacon'' are hard to come by, but it is estimated that 30-40% of manga contain sexual references involving underage characters.&lt;ref name=Asiatimes /&gt; The [[Ages of consent in Asia#Japan|age of consent]] in Japan is 13, but is generally higher under [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectural]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaJapan.asp Sexual Offenses Laws - Japan] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010925003412/http://www.interpol.int/public/children/sexualabuse/nationallaws/csajapan.asp |date=2001-09-25 }} by [[Interpol]], Aug 3, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; No regulations are in place to control images portraying sexual content of hentai in manga or anime.&lt;ref name="digital.asiaone.com"&gt;[http://digital.asiaone.com/Digital/News/Story/A1Story20081204-105512.html Japan main culprit in online child pornography] by Noriko Sakakibara of [[The Daily Yomiuri]], ANN, [[AsiaOne]]. December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of regulating simulated pornography claim to advocate [[human rights]] and children's rights such as the ''[[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]''. Opponents such as the {{nihongo|Japan Federation of Bar Associations|[[:ja:日本弁護士連合会]]}} also claim to advocate for the rights of children, pointing out the decreasing numbers in sexually motivated crimes are due to simulated materials providing an outlet to those who would otherwise seek material depicting actual children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/ja/opinion/report/2003_09.html Statement on February 21, 2003] (in Japanese) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618164226/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/ja/opinion/report/2003_09.html |date=18 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[constitutionality]] of proposed laws have been discussed, since Article 21 of the [[Constitution of Japan]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], [[Freedom of the press|press]] and all other forms of expression. The definitions of ''[[obscenity]]'', specifically written in law as "''arouses or stimulates the viewer's sexual desire''", have been argued as [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120402005026/http://www.japanpen.or.jp/statement/1998-1999/post_89.html The Japan PEN Club's statement on November 26, 1998] (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/japan-urged-to-ban-manga-child-abuse-images&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chitrali people}}
{{Pakistani cuisine}}
'''Chitrali cuisine''' ({{lang-ur|چترالی پکوان}}) refers to the food and cuisine of the [[Chitrali people]] from the North-Western region of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province of Pakistan and the bordering [[Nooristan]] province in Afghanistan. Chitrali food has a regional variance in contrast to many other [[Pakistani cuisine|cuisines]] of [[Pakistan]]. The food of Chitral is very similar to the cuisine in neighboring [[Gilgit-Baltistan]].
[[File:Mantuq Chitral.jpg|thumb|right|Mantus, locally pronounced mantuq, a Central Asian dish of steamed beef dumplings popular in Chitral due to influences from Badakhshan.]]
[[Pilaf]] usually of beef which is preboiled until it is extremely tender is an essential dish at large gatherings and the meat is served lying on top of the rice. Salty buttered tea is popular in Chitral as is [[green tea]] and very bitter black tea called [[Troq Chai]]. Honey, cheese and fresh fruits also make up a staple part of the Chitrali diet as these products are part of the local mountain agricultural tradition. The influence of [[Peshawar]] and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] is seen in the popularity of lamb and chicken [[karahi]]. [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] dumplings or [[manti (dumpling)|mantu]] are also very popular. Dried [[apricots]] ''chambor'' and [[mulberries]] ''kitori'' are both an important part of the local diet and are also exported to other parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan and [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]].

==Breads==
[[File:Tikki Bread.jpg|thumb|right|A loaf of tikki bread served with milk tea.]]
'''Tikki''' A thick leavened loaf baked over coals in a special mold. Because of its hard crust it can be stored for weeks. It is popularly eaten at breakfast or in the afternoon.

'''Khesta''' A bread made from a liquid batter which has been allowed to ferment and is cooked on a griddle. It has a slightly sour taste and a spongy texture.

'''Phulka''' The standard South Asian [[Chapatti]].

'''Rishiki''' Thin pancakes or [[crepes]] made of a batter consisting of whole wheat flour, water and eggs. They can be either savoury or sweet. Sweet rishiki is served with honey and cottage cheese.

==Dry Meat Dishes==

'''Rondijhzu''' Barbecued or spit roasted goat or lamb seasoned with only salt.

'''Taaw Kahak''' Chicken which is roasted on a griddle with additional pressure applied, usually by placing a rock or heavy pot over it. Very dry and crispy.

'''Taaw Machhi''' Fish cooked in the same pressure grilling method as taaw kahak, especially [[brown trout]], [[rainbow trout]] and [[schizothorax]].

==Soups==
[[File:Kallisoup.jpg|thumb|left|A Chitrali noodle soup.]]
One of the most important elements in Chitrali cuisine is the importance of soups, usually eaten as the main dish accompanied by bread and fruit. The cold climate of Chitral is one of the factors contributing to the popularity of soups in Chitrali cuisine.

'''Kalli''' A noodle soup made with minced beef and hand cut whole wheat noodles. It is very similar to the Central Asian [[Lamian|laghman]] and is probably of Chinese origin.

'''Leganu''' Made with tiny lentil-flour dumplings and unlike most Chitrali cuisine it is often quite spicy.

'''Lajhaik''' Similar to the Kashmiri [[hareesa]], it is a thick soup of whole wheat and barley grains slowly stewed together with lamb, beef or duck.

'''Khhamalogh''' A soup consisting of the skulls of sheep, goats or cattle crushed and slowly simmered for many hours.

'''Kawirogh''' A light soup made with dried wild [[caper]]s and meat. Very popular in the summer as it is supposed to have a cooling and blood thinning affect.

==Indigenous Dishes==
[[File:Ghalmandi herbs.jpg|thumb|left|Ghalmandi with cottage cheese and herbs]]
'''Ghalmandi''' A dish of layered flat breads with a filling of cottage cheese, coriander and chives and covered in melted butter and walnut oil.
'''Cheer Aa Shapik''' Similar to ghalmandi, but with a white sauce, similar to [[bechamel]] replacing the cottage cheese.

'''Qalaibat''' A dish made by cooking whole wheat flour with lamb fat.

'''Shroshrp''' A type of unsweetened [[halwa]] made from germinated wheat grain flour.

'''Pushur Tikki''' A loaf of tikki bread baked with a mince meat filling, a type of meat pie. 
Other variations include
'''Phhenak Tikki''' which is filled with cottage cheese and '''Pandir Tikki''' filled with matured cheese. 
A vegetarian version with a spinach filling is '''Shaakh Mujhzi'''.

In November 2015, the ''New York Times'' reported that in the fiscal year ending September 2015, the national police have seen a surge in thefts, burglaries, and robberies, more than 75,557 thefts and other property crimes in the fiscal year, 10.5 percent higher than the previous year. Violent crime was up 8.6 percent during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Thomas|title=Thai Economy and Spirits Are Sagging|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/world/asia/thailand-economy-tourism.html?_r=0|accessdate=30 November 2015|work=New York Times|date=2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures have been contested by the police and by Amorn Wanichwiwatana, a criminologist at [[Chulalongkorn University]], who said he was not aware of any significant uptick in crime since the military came to power. "I don’t think that’s the case. It's not possible," he said of the 60 percent increase reported by the ''Times''. Crime statistics from the Royal Thai Police (RTP) show a statistically negligible increase of 1.9 percent over the same period, with 920 additional crimes reported after an overall decline since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Charuvastra |first1=Teeranai |last2=Ruiz |first2=Todd |title=Data Contradicts New York Times on Crime Increase Under Junta |url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/detail.php?newsid=1449660405&amp;section=12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204025913/http://www.khaosodenglish.com/detail.php?%C3%A5newsid=1449660405&amp;section=12# |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-02-04 |accessdate=9 December 2015 |work=Khaosod English |date=2015-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augmenting the crime prevention efforts of the RTP, there are an estimated 3,000-4,000 security companies in Thailand, deploying between 400,000-500,000 security guards nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sukyingcharoenwong|first1=Mayuree|title=Security guards, firms fret over cost from new law|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30307966|accessdate=18 March 2017|work=Sunday Nation|date=5 March 2017|page=2|format=Print edition only}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By location==
Much of Thailand's crime is in urban areas where tourists congregate as they are easy targets, as well as where rampant [[Prostitution in Thailand|prostitution]] and human trafficking feeds their vices. The prime areas of drug abuse are [[Bangkok]], [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], and [[Pattaya]], but not limited to these areas.  The prime transit corridor for drugs entering northern Thailand is from the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], as well as from ethnically divided rebel-controlled areas within the fragmented state of [[Myanmar]], especially [[Shan State]]. Thailand's international ports, like [[Laem Chabang]] near Pattaya, and [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]], have seen a number of African&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ngamkham|first1=Wassayos|title=Love, marriage and drug mules: Thai women are being tricked into drug trafficking|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/learning-from-news/221542/african-drug-gangs-target-thai-women|accessdate=2015-01-24|work=Bangkok Post|date=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] gangs, as well as other transnational gangs and [[drug mules]] involved in the trade.

== Crime by type ==

===Drugs and druggings===
Thailand has a growing problem of drugs and the violence associated with it.&lt;ref name=globalpost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winn|first1=Patrick|title=Thailand: monks on meth|url=http://www.globalpost.com/globalpost-blogs/southeast-asia/monks-methamphetamine|accessdate=7 Mar 2015|work=globalpost|date=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drugs involved range from the traditional, [[kratom]],&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/23/world/asia/kratom-leaf-for-drug-cocktail-adds-to-thailands-woes.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; to [[ya ba]], opium from [[Myanmar]], and local herbal medicines.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

A previous attempt to control the drug trade by declaring the [[Human rights in Thailand#Deaths relating to the 2003 war on drugs|2003 War on Drugs]], was met with allegations of [[Thaksin Shinawatra|Thaksin]]-allied, politically-inspired targeted killings, quotas of dead drug traffickers, and the targeting of innocent victims.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Rape===
In 2013, some 87 women came forward daily to report sexual abuse or to seek counseling as a result of sexual abuse in Thailand, with most offenders known to the victim. Police refused to accept many complaints, giving excuses such as "political unrest".  The youngest victim was aged one year and nine months and eldest was 85. The youngest offender was a 10-year-old boy who took part in a gang-rape and the eldest was an 85-year-old man who molested a young girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About 80 sex-abuse cases reported daily in Thailand |url=http://www.asianewsnet.net/news-58300.html |accessdate=6 Mar 2015 |work=The Nation |publisher=Asia News Network |date=2014-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113044431/http://www.asianewsnet.net/news-58300.html |archivedate=November 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious passport and identification forgery caught the attention of US authorities after the disappearance of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 370]].

===Human trafficking and prostitution ===
{{main|Prostitution in Thailand|Human trafficking in Thailand}}

In 2013, the US State Department stated that Thailand faced the lowest rank (e.g. failing) in its Trafficking In Persons Report.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/05/us-thailand-rohingya-usa-idUSBRE9B401H20131205|title=Thailand's anti-trafficking effort loses steam|work=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 report stated that Thai police and immigration officials "extorted money or sex" from detainees or "sold Burmese migrants unable to pay labor brokers or sex traffickers,".&lt;ref name="reuters.com"/&gt; According to officials from the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), Thailand was the only government to vote against the [[United Nations]] [[Forced Labour Convention]] at the ILO's annual ministerial conference in June 2014.&lt;ref name="trustforced"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20140611164402-hj46x|title=Pact to halt forced labour snubbed by Thailand, Gulf - ILO|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|work=trust.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201406121748.html|title=Africa: UN Agency Adopts Treaty Advancing Global Efforts to Tackle Forced Labour|work=allAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, [[Walmart]] and [[Costco]] retail chains in USA have dumped [[Charoen Pokphand]] as a supplier of seafood products due to suppliers that "own, operate or buy from fishing boats manned with slaves." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/06/10/costco-walmart-slave-labor/10274641/|title=Shrimp slaves: Walmart, Costco act against forced labor|date=10 June 2014|work=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Thai government on 15 June 2014 caved to international pressure and explained its intention to rescind its previous ILO vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Thailand-reverses-earlier-decision-backs-ILO-proto-30236260.html|title=Thailand reverses earlier decision, backs ILO protocol on forced labour|date=15 June 2014|work=The Nation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic violence===
Violence against women and children has been rising in Thailand. In 2006, 13,550 cases of [[domestic violence]] against women and children were reported by Thailand's [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/80513/thailand-fighting-domestic-violence|title=Fighting domestic violence|work=IRIN|date=2008-09-22|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2007 and 2015 the total number of violence victims seeking assistance at the One-Stop Crisis Centre of the Public Health Ministry totalled 207,891. Of those, 105,622 involved children those involving women amounted to 102,269. In 2016, the number of distressed women and children seeking assistance from the centre was 20,018, according to the [[National Economic and Social Development Board]] (NESDB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spouses, boyfriends blamed for violence against women and children|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/breakingnews/30308099|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=The Nation|date=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign gangs and fugitives===
Thailand has been described as a "haven" for criminals on the run from the law in their homelands.&lt;ref name="ST-20160804"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why is Thailand the land of fugitives?: The Nation|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/why-is-thailand-the-land-of-fugitives-the-nation|access-date=8 August 2016|work=Straits Times|date=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, foreign criminal gangs have adopted Thailand as a base of operations. A 2014 study by the Thailand Institute of Justice identified 22 separate gangs of foreigners involved in identity fraud, petty theft, and burglary. Thailand's economic reliance on tourism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sriring|first1=Orathai|last2=Webb|first2=Simon|title=Tourism, infrastructure to support Thailand's economy this year: BOT Governor|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-economy-cenbank-idUSKCN10I11W?il=0|access-date=8 August 2016|agency=Reuters|date=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; means that it is all too easy{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2017}} for foreign criminals to enter the country. Bribery is frequently used to cement friendly relations with local officials, particularly the police. Their palms greased, police and immigration officials ignore wrongdoing.&lt;ref name="ST-20160804" /&gt; "Thailand has traditionally been one of the top source countries for extradition of criminals to the U.S.," said a March 2009 cable from the American Embassy in Bangkok obtained by WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="NYT-20110720"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Thomas|title=Fugitives, and Others, in Pursuit of Vice Find Thailand’s Liberties to Be a Virtue|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/21/world/asia/21iht-thailand21.html|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=New York Times|date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "There are a number of minor reasons and one very major one why the jet-setting underground would find Thailand irresistible," according to Thailand-based British author Mr. [[John Burdett]]. "The minor ones would include guns, girls, gambling, [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]] and gorgeous beaches, especially for those recently released from confinement." But, he said, what makes Thailand especially attractive, "is the ...compliant and bribable police force."&lt;ref name="NYT-20110720" /&gt;

== Crime dynamics ==
===Firearms===
About one in ten people in Thailand legally own a gun. There are more than six million registered guns in a country with a population of 66.7 million.&lt;ref name="DW-20160219"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Domínguez |first1=Gabriel |title=A look at Thailand's fervent gun culture |url=https://www.dw.com/en/a-look-at-thailands-fervent-gun-culture/a-19060721 |accessdate=31 October 2018 |work=Deutsche Welle |date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Small Arms Survey]] estimates that the total number of guns, both licit and illicit, held by Thai civilians in 2017 is 10,300,000,&lt;ref name="SAS-2018"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Karp |first1=Aaron |title=Briefing Paper; Estimating  Global Civilian-Held Firearms Numbers |publisher=Small Arms Survey; Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies |location=Geneva |page=4 |edition=June 2018 |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/T-Briefing-Papers/SAS-BP-Civilian-Firearms-Numbers.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; equating to 15.1 firearms per 100 inhabitants. Comparable figures for the other [[ASEAN]] nations are: Cambodia, 4.5 per 100 inhabitants; Philippines, 3.6; Laos, 3.0; Myanmar, 1.6; Vietnam, 1.6; Brunei, 1.4; Malaysia, 0.7; Singapore, 0.3; and Indonesia, zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Civilian Firearms Holdings 2017 |url=http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/Weapons_and_Markets/Tools/Firearms_holdings/SAS-BP-Civilian-held-firearms-annexe.pdf |website=Small Arms Survey (SAS) |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of firearms is particularly high in the south Thailand provinces of [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Narathiwat]] that have witnessed significant [[South Thailand Insurgency|insurgency and rebellion since 2004]].&lt;ref name="DW-20160219" /&gt;

In 2016 Thailand's rate of violent gun-related deaths stood at 4.45 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. In comparison, that of the Philippines was 7.42; the US, 3.85; Cambodia, 0.96; Myanmar, 0.56; Malaysia, 0.46; Indonesia, 0.10; and Singapore, 0.03.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Aizenman |first1=Nurith |title=Gun Violence: How The U.S. Compares With Other Countries |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/10/06/555861898/gun-violence-how-the-u-s-compares-to-other-countries |accessdate=1 November 2018 |work=National Public Radio (NPR) |date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical colleges for years have seen rival gang shootings at major intersections in Bangkok and elsewhere, and tends to be an urban phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/308354/2-students-held-in-fatal-bus-shooting 2 students held in fatal bus shooting]."

=== Prison infrastructure and corruption ===
Thailand has woefully inadequate prison infrastructure, as well as a lack of political will to deal with the exploding crime problem.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In [[Rayong Central Prison]], which was designed to house 3,000 inmates but holds 6,000, improvised rocket canisters were used to relay goods from the outside world over the top of walls into the prison.&lt;ref name=thaiprisonlife&gt;{{cite news|title=Overwhelming odds get better of efforts to stamp out prison drug trade|url=http://www.thaiprisonlife.com/news/overwhelming-odds-get-better-of-efforts-to-stamp-out-prison-drug-trade/|accessdate=6 Mar 2015|work=Bangkok Post|publisher=Thai Prison Life|date=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mail sent to prisoners contained items such as mobile phones used to coordinate and organize crime outside of the prison.&lt;ref name="pattayaone"&gt;{{cite news|title=Two suspected Pattaya drug dealers arrested and 2,000 Yabba Tablets seized|url=http://www.pattayaone.net/tag/rayong-central-prison/|work=Pattaya One|date=2012-11-03|accessdate=2018-10-31|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413131832/http://www.pattayaone.net/tag/rayong-central-prison/ |archivedate=April 13, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This situation is not unique to Rayong Prison, and is commonplace throughout Thailand.&lt;ref name="pdn"&gt;{{cite news|work=Pattaya Daily News|title=Inmates at Rayong Central Prison have Assistance with Smuggling Contraband and Drugs|date=2012-04-30|author= Nattaphummint|url=http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2012/04/30/inmates-at-rayong-central-prison-have-assistance-with-smuggling-contraband-and-drugs/ |accessdate=18 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108024936/http://www.pattayadailynews.com/en/2012/04/30/inmates-at-rayong-central-prison-have-assistance-with-smuggling-contraband-and-drugs/ |archivedate=November 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The case of Wendy Albano and foreigners on foreigners crime===
[[Wendy Albano]] was an American businesswoman murdered in 2012 in a hotel room in Thailand.&lt;ref name=thaiw&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/report-indian-police-make-arrest-in-2012-murder-of-south-tampa-designer/2200082 Police in India arrest suspect in 2012 murder of South Tampa designer]&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities in the U.S. got in touch with the U.S. State department eventually leading to the arrest of a suspect hiding in India years later.&lt;ref name=thaiw/&gt; The chief suspect was an Indian business associate who fled to India after her death.&lt;ref name=bk&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2102052/Wendy-Albano-dead-Florida-socialite-murdered-Bangkok-hotel-Indian-boyfriend.html Socialite murdered]{{unreliable source|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key pieces of evidence that made him a suspect was their known business relationship and video surveillance from the hotel.&lt;ref name=thaiw/&gt; U.S. Sen.

This is the case where foreigners commit crimes against other foreigners in Thailand, in Albano's case the chief suspect was an Indian man who fled Thailand but was eventually captured in India with the help of the Indian law enforcement.&lt;ref name="asiancorrespondentstaff"/&gt;

During the promotion he was only permitted a 5-minute break every two hours. It raised several thousand dollars for the worthy organization and made Hennessey a regular "honorary member" of the WPXC airstaff for several years to come.  He went on to serve in the first Persian Gulf War. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newzealandfighter.co.nz/home/would-somebody-somewhere-make-some-noise|title=Would somebody, Somewhere, Make some Noise|publisher=NZ Fighter |date= |accessdate=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the Marine Corp in 1993 and moved to [[New Zealand]] in 1998 to be a Club DJ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28247">The demographic features of [[Brunei]] include [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population. Like neighbouring countries, [[Brunei]] is a [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]]-dominated country.  Many cultural and linguistic differences make Brunei Malays distinct from the larger Malay populations in nearby [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], even though they are ethnically related and share the [[Islam|Muslim]] religion.

Brunei has a hereditary nobility with the title Pengiran these are, more often than not, related to the Sultan by blood. The Sultan can award to commoners the title [[Pehin]], the equivalent of a [[life peerage]] awarded in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Sultan also can award his subjects the [[Malay titles|Dato]], the equivalent of a [[knighthood]] in the United Kingdom, and Datin, the equivalent of a damehood.

Bruneians adhere to the practice of using complete full names with all titles, including the title [[Hajji|Haji]] (for men) or Hajjah (for women) for those who have made the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. Many Brunei Malay women wear the [[tudong]], a traditional head covering. Men wear the [[songkok]], a traditional Malay cap. Men who have completed the Haj wear a white songkok.

The requirements to attain Brunei citizenship include passing tests in Malay culture, customs and [[Malay language|language]]. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given International Certificates of Identity, which allow them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei's Chinese are permanent residents, and many are stateless.

[[Petroleum]] wealth allows the Brunei Government to provide the population with one of [[Asia]]'s finest [[health care]] systems. The [[Brunei Medical and Health Department]] introduced the region's first government "flying doctor service" in early 1965. [[Malaria]] has been eradicated, and [[cholera]] is virtually nonexistent. There are three general hospitals--in Bandar Seri Begawan, Tutong, and Kuala Belait--and there are numerous health clinics throughout the country.

[[Education]] starts with [[preschool]], followed by 6 years of [[primary education]] and up to 6 years of [[secondary education]]. Nine years of education are mandatory. Most of Brunei's [[college]] students attend [[university|universities]] and other institutions abroad, but approximately 2,542 study at the [[University of Brunei Darussalam]]. Opened in 1985, the university has a faculty of over 300 instructors and is located on a sprawling campus at [[Tungku]], overlooking the [[South China Sea]].

The official language is [[Malay language|Malay]], but [[English language|English]] is widely understood and used in business. Other languages spoken are several [[Chinese language|Chinese]] dialects, [[Iban language|Iban]], and a number of native dialects. [[Islam]] is the official religion, but religious freedom is guaranteed under the constitution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23612">'''Emigration from Mexico''' is a migratory phenomenon that has been taking place in [[Mexico]] since the early 20th century.

==Overview==
[[Emigration]] from Mexico began timidly about a century ago, but experienced a significant increase since the 1960s. The emigration phenomenon, in the case of Mexico is diverse and varied through the country. This is due to the economic situation that applies mainly to poorer people, who seek better job opportunities in other countries. More than 11% of Mexico’s native population lives abroad, making it the country with the most emigrants in the world. 98% of all Mexican emigrants reside in the United States, which are more than 12 million (documented and undocumented) migrants. Estimates on the amount of Mexican emigrants of indigenous origin in the U.S. range between 50% and 90% of the entire emigrant population. There are no official numbers on the amount of indigenous Mexican migrants, as U.S. censuses do not cover their specific ethnic origin. Recent reports by the [[Pew Research Center]] (February 2012) show that the current migratory influx from Mexico to the U.S. is just below a net zero, as more Mexicans leave the U.S. Economic problems are, overall, the little stability of [[Mexican peso]] exchange rate compared to the [[United States dollar]]. That is the reason for many Mexicans to leave their country and look for better salaries in the [[United States]], so they can send dollars to their families in Mexico. This case, however, is mainly temporary. Many others chose to permanently reside there with their families.

==Destinations==
Aside from the [[Mexican American|United States]], Mexican immigrants have settled in [[Mexican Canadian|Canada]], [[Mexican immigration to Spain|Spain]],  [[Mexicans in Germany|Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Mexicans in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Japan]] and other countries. A large Mexican immigrant population also exists in Central and South American countries as [[Mexicans in Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Mexicans in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[Mexicans in Cuba|Cuba]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]] and [[Chile]]. Mexican Mennonites settled in [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]] and [[Paraguay]]. There have been cases of Mexicans working and residing in [[Ukraine]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] where they are employed as construction and oil labor contractors. Under "Aliyah", or the immigration of Jews of the Diaspora to Israel, an unspecified number of Mexican Jews have immigrated to Israel. In recent years Mexican business and enigineering professionals have settled in African countries like [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[South Africa]]. 
 
Canada has a program that hires Mexican agricultural workers on a temporary basis. Many countries allow Mexicans opportunities in areas like science research, to study at colleges and universities, and through other cultural exchanges. The mass departure of artists, scientists, actors and more has led to a Mexican [[brain drain]]. However, recent years have shown an uptick in immigration to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/22/world/americas/for-migrants-new-land-of-opportunity-is-mexico.html|title=For Migrants, New Land of Opportunity Is Mexico|first=Damien|last=Cave|date=21 September 2013|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type of people and impact on Mexican society==
Generally, the people who tend to leave Mexico to the United States are from lower-class backgrounds and of [[Mestizos in Mexico|mestizo]]{{Dubious|date=October 2015}} or [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous]] ancestries. They primarily come from the following nine [[List of states of Mexico|states]]: [[Zacatecas]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoacán]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Guerrero]], [[San Luis Potosí]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Chiapas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2010/princi_result/cpv2010_principales_resultadosIV.pdf|title=Migración internacional en el quinquenio 2005-2010 (International Migration 2005-2010)|website=inegi.gob.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sinaloa]]. In these states it is not uncommon to see towns where men are absent, and are supposed to be working in the [[United States]]. While the women take care of their children, husbands [[Remittances from the United States|send money (dollars) to their families]] in Mexico. This money, sent by Mexican workers abroad to their country, is called ''[[Remittance|remesas]]'' in Spanish, and the amount of it have become the second income that Mexico receives from other countries. The first one is oil sales.

On the other hand, people from the educated middle-upper class, are usually [[Criollo people|criollo]]{{Dubious|date=October 2015}} or other [[Mexicans of European descent]] and some of [[castizo]]{{Dubious|date=October 2015}} descent, they emigrate to the [[United States]], but also many emigrate to Canada and European countries; they're usually employed by companies, universities, or many of them start their own businesses abroad.

Traditionally, richer people with overwhelming income used to live in Mexico, but recent economic opportunities and advantages with international treaties, harassing, and threatening insecurity have made them leave the country.

==Causes and origins==
Following the [[Mexican–American War]] which was concluded by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, and later, the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853, approximately 300,000 Mexican nationals found themselves living within the [[United States]].  Throughout the rest of the 19th century early 20th century, Mexican migration was not subject to any restrictions, and  Mexicans were free to move across the border, and often did so, typically in order for them to work in professions such as the construction of the railway system, or as seasonal [[agricultural]] laborers.  From 1910 to 1920, the political violence and societal chaos caused by the [[Mexican Revolution]] also played a role in increasing migration northwards.  Economic inequality, rural poverty, significantly lower wages, and better opportunities have also played a role throughout the 20th century as factors pulling Mexicans to migrate to the US.

The immigration laws of the United States such as [[Emergency Quota Act]] generally allowed exemptions for Mexico, while being more restrictive to citizens of the [[Eastern Hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=bean/&gt;  Mexicans received special allowances under United States immigration law due to the importance of Mexican labor in the United States [[economy]].  One example of these allowances is the [[Immigration Act of 1917]].  Under this act, all potential immigrants would have to pass a [[literacy test]] and pay a head tax.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  At the request of growers in the southwest who depended on farm labor from Mexico, the [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] waived those requirements for Mexican immigrants.&lt;ref name=bean/&gt; The groups interested in the availability of inexpensive labor ensured that the immigration laws in place throughout the early 20th century did not adversely affect the movement of Mexican migrants, in spite of calls on the part of some of the southern states’ [[congressmen]] to put an end to the open border policies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Wilmington, Scholarly Resources, Inc.: 1999 {{ISBN|0842027564}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the beginning of the Great Depression, the worldwide economic slowdown and the desperate search for jobs within the United States of America, [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigration sentiment]] rose. Thousands of Mexicans were forced back across the border and barriers to future immigrants were constructed.  From 1929 to 1931, legal Mexican immigration entries fell by 95%, and in the next ten years as many as 400,000 Mexican citizens were [[repatriated]].&lt;ref name=bean/&gt;

===More admissive regulations===
The limitations on Mexican immigration lasted until the beginning of [[World War II]], when the United States found itself short of labor.  In 1942 the United States and Mexico instituted the [[Bracero program]].  Under this arrangement, millions of Mexican laborers were contracted to complete agricultural work in the United States.  While under contract they were given housing and received a [[minimum wage]] of thirty cents an hour.  The program was intended to provide the United States with ''temporary'' workers while many working-aged men were away at war.  In order to ensure that braceros did not stay in the United States, their wives and families were not allowed to accompany them in the U.S. Additionally, 10% of each worker’s wage was withheld to be given back upon the worker’s return to Mexico but few U.S. employers complied.

The Bracero Program allowed [[agribusiness]] access to a large pool of labor that had virtually no civil rights, and no recourse to address growing injustices.  This inequity was seen in poor working conditions and the decrease in agricultural wages, which during the 1950s, actually dropped below the levels they were at during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  As the war ended, few returning soldiers returned to the jobs that the braceros were holding, and instead, they moved on to more industrial areas and reinforced the belief that immigrants take on the jobs that Americans would not be willing to do.

The [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican government's]] participation and oversight of the treatment of their workers in this program declined over the years, despite remittances from the program that made up a large part of its domestic economy.  The United States began encouraging braceros to cross into Mexico then return illegally to the United States. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Upon return they could become legal citizens, and this eliminated any program contracts as well as the ability of the [[Mexican government]] to intervene in any future labor relations.  In addition to this practice of creating legal citizens of former braceros, thousands of illegal immigrants were crossing the border in search of the opportunity promised by the idea of steady employment and eventual prosperity of the Bracero Program.

==A return to a more closed border==
In response to the growing number of Mexicans entering illegally, the United States government implemented [[Operation Wetback]] in 1954.  Under the direction of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), the [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] began deporting Mexicans who were in the United States illegally, and up to one million Mexicans were deported. Operation Wetback ended not long after its launch, due to the complaints regarding the violence involved in the deportations, and the fact that in many cases children of immigrants who were United States citizens were deported with their parents.&lt;ref&gt;Public Broadcasting Services [https://www.pbs.org/kpbs/theborder/history/index.html “The Border History”].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing migration===
Although the Bracero Program ended in 1964, the migration of Mexican workers did not.  The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] which had put limits on the total number of visas granted, was [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|amended in 1965]] following the termination of the Bracero Program.  These amendments put an end to the quota system, and instead, created a total number of visas allowed to the Western Hemisphere.  Exceptions to that total number were granted to spouses, minors and parents of United States citizens. However, the total allotment of 120,000 in 1965 still was not enough to address the demand for visas from Mexico.  By 1976, there was a two-year waiting period for any eligible applicant from the Western Hemisphere before they could receive a visa.&lt;ref name=bean&gt;Bean, Frank D. et al (eds). At the Crossroads: Mexico and U.S. Immigration Policy. Lanham, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.: 1997 {{ISBN|0847683923}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Displaced workers in northern Mexico===
A contributing factor to the persistently high numbers of migrants from Mexico was the creation of the [[Border Industrialization Program]] in 1965.  The termination of the Bracero Program in 1964 had led to both a shortage of workers willing to work for lower wages in the United States, and a high population of displaced workers at the northern Mexico border.  The result of this imbalance in the supply and demand of labor in the two countries in turn led the creation of this new agreement that allowed the construction of foreign-owned factories in northern Mexico.  These factories are referred to as [[maquiladoras]] or maquilas, and provided both Mexico and the United States with a number of benefits.  The factories provided Mexico with a way to increase its manufactured exports to the United States, and in return, the United States received tax benefits for placing its factories within Mexico. For example, the equipment imported into Mexico to be used in the factories was not subject to import taxes, and the final product was only taxed on the value that was added at the factory, rather than the entirety of the item.&lt;ref&gt;Morales, Gerard et al. [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/nao/maquilad.htm#viiits “An Overview of the Maquiladora Program”]. United States Department of Labor. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the maquilas program provided jobs to the displaced Bracero Program workers and allowed the United States to continue to use labor from Mexico, which was less expensive than labor in the United States.  The popularity of this program is evident in the incredible increase in the number of maquilas in operation: in 1967 there were 57 maquiladoras operating in Mexico; less than ten years later in 1976, that number had increased to 552. The rise in the number of available jobs in the region led to an extreme swell in the population of the border towns.  The maquiladora industry employed 4000 people in 1967, and by 1981 that amount grew to more than 130,000.&lt;ref&gt;Seligson, Mitchell A. &amp; Edward J. Williams. Maquiladoras and Migration: Workers in the Mexico – United States Border Industrialization Program. Austin, University of Texas Press: 1981, {{ISBN|0292750722}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The maquilas drew the population north to the border in search of employment opportunities, but in many cases the northward pull did not stop there.  The proximity of the United States with its markedly higher standard of living continued to pull the people who had migrated to border region even farther north, and led to higher numbers of migrants crossing the [[United States – Mexico border]].

Amendments to the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]] continued throughout the 1970s.  In 1976 the United State Congress imposed a limit of 20,000 visas per country per year in the Western Hemisphere.  At that time Mexico was exceeding that amount by approximately 40,000.  In 1978 a new amendment was put in place that enacted a worldwide immigration policy, allowing 290,000 visas per year total, with no limitations per country.

The end of the Bracero Program combined with restrictions put on the number of visas allowed by the United States greatly increased the levels of illegal migration from Mexico.&lt;ref name=bean/&gt; As a response, in 1986 the United States enacted the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act]] (IRCA).  Under this act, all undocumented migrants living in the United States as of January 1, 1982, as well as those who had labored in the seasonal agriculture work for at least ninety days during the previous years were granted legal residence.  IRCA also made it possible to impose civil and criminal penalties on any employer who knowingly hired undocumented workers.  Although a legalization of current undocumented workers, coupled with the increase in penalties suffered by employers who employed future undocumented workers was meant to decrease the total number of undocumented migrants in the United States, the actions did not produce the desired effect; as is evidenced by the number of apprehensions achieved through border patrolling.

==Recent trend reversal in migration Mexico-U.S.==
Still today, Mexico is the country with the most emigrants in the world, but during the last few years, migratory patterns from Mexico to the United States have changed. A report by the [[Pew Research Center]] (February 2012) has shown that for the first time in 60 years, migration trends have reversed, as more Mexicans leave the U.S. than enter it.

===Reasons for trend reversal===
Several major factors seem to contribute to a general sense among Mexican migrants that there is less profit and more danger to migrate to the U.S., leading many of them to decide that it is better to leave the U.S. or stay in Mexico:&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Nájar, A. (2012-03-09). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/03/120309_migracion_mexico_eeuu_reversa_an.shtml Migración mexicana en EE.UU.: el flujo ahora va en sentido contrario]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt;
*The decline of fertility in Mexico has resulted in proportionally fewer young people, and thus lower migration to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;What Mexican immigration problem? Richard Miles USA Today Jan 2015 https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/01/03/mexican-immigration-richard-miles/21056155/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2008–2012 [[global financial crisis|economic crisis of 2008]] has led to a decline of work opportunities in the U.S., meaning that many immigrants who came to the U.S. for work couldn't find any. Access to social security, healthcare and education has also become more difficult.
*The economic situation in Mexico has become better, ensuring better access to healthcare, education, and jobs. This reduces the incentive for Mexicans to leave the country.
*Since 2010, U.S. legislation on illegal immigration has been reinforced, as several American states criminalized illegal immigration. Deportations under the Obama administration have reached record numbers.
*During the last few years, violence associated with drug cartels and organized crime has been on the rise in Northern Mexico, making the routes for passing the border more dangerous.
*Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together (MATT) conducted 600 in-depth, in person interviews of migrants who returned to the Mexican state of Jalisco, that found family reasons and nostalgia are the primary cited reasons for return migration Mexico. The research also found that of the interviewed migrants who moved back to Mexico, only about 11% were forced to leave the United States due to being deported. 75% of the respondents cited that their reasons for return migration were self-motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Mexicans and Americans Thinking Together (MATT)Quantitative Research Study Preliminary Findings and Insights The US/Mexico Cycle End of an Era http://www.matt.org/uploads/2/4/9/3/24932918/returnmigration_top_line_www.pdf Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments in Mexico===
Mexican source communities, mostly indigenous villages, are most often poor and rely heavily on the emigration of a part of their members and the remittances they send back to survive economically. Emigration can function as an escape valve to alleviate economical pressure, as it is a source of income and opens up work opportunities in villages of origin.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; The return of many migrants now thus causes great stress on these communities, who are heading for economic crisis, as important sources of income fall away and more people become unemployed as there is less work available. The states most affected by this phenomenon try to take action to help those who come back, but the full economic impact of the return of migrants is still to come.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Since emigrants are coming back to their mostly poor home communities, sending them into economic crisis, another migration phenomenon is accelerating: internal migration. The lack of work opportunities in small villages drives people to migrate to large cities, rather than to the U.S.. With 78% of the Mexican population living in urban zones, slums are growing fast. Urban violence and crime, stunted growth, malnutrition, poor elementary education, poor hygiene and sanitation are just some of the implications of life in urban slums. According to [[UNICEF]], urban migration has badly worsened the reach of social schemes of health and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, 2012. The State of the World’s Children 2012, Executive Summary: Children in an Urban World. New York: United Nations Children’s Fund.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among communities of origin, there is a widespread ambivalence towards migrants, as the money they send back is welcome, but there is resentment against the cultural changes that they bring with them when they come back. Returning migrants are blamed for bringing with them drug use, sexually transmitted diseases, and antisocial behavior. They are held responsible for the abandonment of the traditional indigenous way of life as they bring back western cultural habits and material culture. The return of migrants to Mexico thus has important cultural repercussions and changes the face of their home communities forever.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Fitzgerald, D., 2009. A Nation of Emigrants: How Mexico manages its Migration. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press {{ISBN|0520257057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments in the U.S.===
In the U.S., Hispanics account for 54% of the day labor workforce{{dubious|date=November 2015}} and there is a large market for cheap day-laborers. This sector constitutes a non-negligible part of the U.S. economy. With the current migration trends, within a few years, Mexico will not be able to cover current demand for Mexican labor of its neighbor anymore. Migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras to the U.S. is rising, as their migrants begin to replace Mexican workers. It is however unclear whether other [[Hispanic America]]n countries follow these trends, and it is unsure whether the gap left by returning Mexican will be filled by such migrants. Experts say the consequences for the U.S. economy may be important.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Since 2010, deportations of illegal immigrants have increased, as deportation procedures became more systematic and border controls were reinforced with police and military patrols. Several states, such as Arizona and Alabama, have passed laws that criminalize illegal migration. Proposed acts that offer easier paths to U.S. citizenship for immigrants, such as the DREAM-act, have been rejected.

Together with Lauren Weiner, Zachary Jenson, and "Anna" (Zoe Elizabeth Voss, a paid FBI [[informant]])&lt;ref name=Aaronson/&gt; he planned acts of arson and sabotage to the [[Nimbus Dam]], [[United States Forest Service]], and nearby utilities.{{r|CBS Sac: freed}} During testimony, "Anna" claimed that the group considered the killing of bystanders to be [[collateral damage]],&lt;ref name="court report"&gt;[http://anarchistnews.org/?q=node/2041 Eric McDavid – Court Report from 9/11 | Anarchist news dot org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; although their plots were focused on property damage.

"Anna" had been working with the FBI to infiltrate the group since 2004. She encouraged their activities and provided them with bomb-making information, money to buy the raw materials, transportation and a cabin to work in, and produced consensual audio and video recordings of their activities.&lt;ref name=sacbee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to "Anna", McDavid threatened to kill her if she turned out to be working with law enforcement.&lt;ref name=sacbee/&gt;&lt;ref name="court report"/&gt;

Defense attorney Mark Reichel argued that "Anna" acted as an [[agent provocateur]]: encouraging the group to focus on a target, paying for meeting arrangements and supplies, and urging the group to act when they wavered. Reichel stated at the trial, "the crisp $100 bills and a Dutch Flat cabin where the group lived in the days leading up to the trio's arrest—all supplied by "Anna" thanks to her FBI sponsors...That's the creation of a case...Without 'Anna,' you have nothing."{{r|sacbee}}

== Arrest, conviction, and appeal ==
On January 13, 2006, the three were arrested outside a store where they had purchased household chemicals, presumably for bomb-making. None of the three had prior convictions. McDavid  spent 2 years pre-trial in solitary confinement. He also formally declared a [[hunger strike]] due to the jail's refusal to provide him with [[vegan]] food. He was given vegan food intermittently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supporteric.org/updates.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418042122/http://www.supporteric.org/updates.htm |archivedate=2009-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At their 2008 trials, Weiner and Jenson both pled guilty and testified against McDavid.&lt;ref name=hedlund/&gt; His defense contended that he was the victim of [[entrapment]].

==Release==
As noted above, on Jan. 8, 2015, McDavid was released from prison after the government admitted it had withheld approximately 2500 pages of documents potentially useful for his defense, which included love letters exchanged between "Anna" and McDavid and proof that she had been exempted from a requested FBI polygraph test by her handler, Special Agent Ricardo Torres.  The release was made in exchange for his guilty plea to a lesser charge of general conspiracy.&lt;ref name=Aaronson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

She had previously served as a [[United States Magistrate Judge]] of the same court since 2006.

Though she lost contact with her father when she moved from the West Coast, she would later reconnect with him during the course of the background check she underwent upon being appointed a federal judge. Growing up indigent, Salas recalls having to translate for her mother at the [[Welfare]] office, and later helping friends with various problems facing their lives, an activity that led to her pursuit of a career focusing on human services.

'''Fausto Isidro Meza Flores''' (born June 19, 1982), commonly referred to by his criminal alias '''El Chapo Isidro''' ("Shorty Isidro"), is a Mexican drug lord and high-ranking leader of the [[Beltrán Leyva Cartel]], a drug trafficking organization. He is also the alleged leader of [[Los Mazatlecos]] and was right-hand man of the now deceased drug lords [[Héctor Beltrán Leyva|Héctor]] and [[Alfredo Beltrán Leyva]]. The FBI is offering a USD$5 million bounty.

==Criminal career==

===Early life and ascension===
Meza Flores (known in the criminal world as ''El Chapo Isidro'') was born on June 19, 1982.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite web|title=MEZA FLORES: Drug Trafficking Organization |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/20130117_meza_flores.pdf |publisher=[[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] |accessdate=January 17, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DkDMVYxC?url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/20130117_meza_flores.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013 |date=January 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his criminal career in the 1990s, at first working for the [[Juárez Cartel]] under the tutelage of the then-leader [[Amado Carrillo Fuentes]]. After the drug lord died of plastic surgery complications in 1997, Meza Flores deserted the organization along with several other drug traffickers and decided to join the forces of the [[Beltrán Leyva Cartel]]. As a member of the Beltrán Leyva brothers, he proved to be a "skilled hitman, capable of daring, cunning and bravado."&lt;ref name=history1&gt;{{cite news|title=Chapo Isidro: A History |url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2012/07/chapo-isidro-history.html |accessdate=January 18, 2013 |newspaper=[[Borderland Beat]] |date=July 9, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dm1GetjV?url=http://www.borderlandbeat.com/2012/07/chapo-isidro-history.html |archivedate=January 18, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the leader [[Arturo Beltrán Leyva]] was gunned down and killed by the Mexican military in December 2009, many within the cartel deserted and left to form an independent criminal organization with [[Edgar Valdez Villarreal]], known as ''La Barbie''. Meza Flores, however, remained loyal to the Beltrán Leyva brothers and possibly forged an alliance with [[Vicente Carrillo Fuentes]].&lt;ref name=history1/&gt;

===Tubutama, Sonora shooting===
A fierce gunfight between members of the Sinaloa Cartel (with the backing of Gente Nueva) and the [[Beltrán Leyva Cartel]] (with the support of [[Los Zetas]] and Meza Flores' men) left about 30 dead in the town of [[Tubutama|Tubutama, Sonora]] in northern Mexico on July 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El juego final de "Poncho Arce |url=http://www.riodoce.mx/content/view/11492/42/ |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |newspaper=[[Ríodoce]] |date=November 7, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cu2CHznc?url=http://www.riodoce.mx/content/view/11492/42/ |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pedraza |first=Iván |title=Sicarios de los Beltrán Leyva y Zetas atacan a gente del Chapo en Sonora |url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/7c954b2a681dd8c89db2c26caf9ab0a9 |accessdate=December 14, 2012 |newspaper=[[Milenio]] |date=July 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cu2Hh4xF?url=http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/7c954b2a681dd8c89db2c26caf9ab0a9 |archivedate=December 14, 2012 |deadurl=yes |language=Spanish |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug gangs clashed just a few miles across the international border with the U.S. state of Arizona – an area notorious for being a smuggling route for narcotics and human trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=21 die in Mexican gang gunbattle near Arizona border |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38050468/ns/world_news-americas/t/die-mexican-gang-gunbattle-near-arizona-border/#.UM0i13PjnDF |accessdate=December 16, 2012 |newspaper=[[MSNBC]] |date=July 1, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CwURER6q?url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38050468/ns/world_news-americas/t/die-mexican-gang-gunbattle-near-arizona-border/ |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Meza Flores and a drug trafficker nicknamed ''El Gilo'' were the ones that carried out the surprise ambush attack on the gunmen of the Sinaloa Cartel.&lt;ref name=history1/&gt; Eleven late-model, bullet-ridden vehicles were found at the scene, along with dozens of assault rifles.

'''Frank Erickson''' (1896 – March 2, 1968) was born in [[New York City]] to parents of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. After the death of his father, he grew up in an orphanage.

Frank Erickson was [[Arnold Rothstein]]'s right-hand man and New York's largest bookmaker during the 1930s and 40's. Eventually, Erickson became very well known among bookmakers nationwide for handling "[[Lay off (bookmaking)|lay-off]]" bets. With Chicago's [[Moses Annenberg]], Erickson developed  a country wide wire service, making possible for the first time nationwide synchronized betting. Erickson never saw any of these profits because soon after, bookmaking became illegal and the government took over. In Robert Lacey's book on Meyer Lanksy, Erickson was named "the largest book maker on the East Coast, if not in all America." Additionally, it is a little-known fact that many of Erickson's profits went to charity. Along with many other ventures, he was a major contributor to the construction of a children's hospital in NYC. He allegedly had connections with the mob. 

He died on March 2, 1968, from cardiac arrest while undergoing surgery on a bleeding   ulcer.

== Brushes with the Law ==
Between the years of 1919 to 1926 Erickson was arrested five times for gambling only to have the charges dismissed each time. He was arrested again in 1939 for vagrancy and was so insulted by the charge, he arrived to court in an armoured car, escorted by Brink's guards. He showed the presiding body securities worth $125,000 to prove he wasn't a vagrant. That case, too, was dismissed. Erickson served 10 months on Riker's Island after eventually being convicted by District Attorney [[Frank Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;Katz, L. (1973). "Uncle Frank."

'''Games Done Quick''' is a semiannual [[video game]] [[speedrun]] charity marathon held in the [[United States]], originally organized by the [[Speed Demos Archive]] and Speedruns Live communities. Since 2015, it has been handled by Games Done Quick, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/privacy|publisher=Games Done Quick, LLC|title=Privacy Policy|date=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Held since 2010, the events have raised money for several charities; the most common two being the [[Prevent Cancer Foundation]] and [[Doctors Without Borders]]. 

The events are broadcast live on [[Twitch.tv|Twitch]]. Viewers are encouraged to donate for incentives during the stream such as naming characters in a run, having the runners attempt more difficult challenges, or winning prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://associationsnow.com/2015/01/gaming-gurus-reinvented-telethons-web/|publisher=''Association Now''|title=How Gaming Gurus Reinvented Telethons for the Web|last=Smith|first=Ernie|date=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over $16.7 million has been raised across 21 marathons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/|title=all events tracker|date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Speedrunners take turns demonstrating their prowess at beating various video games in the quickest possible time, done in front of an audience as well as a [[Live streaming|livestream]] through [[Twitch.tv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/watch-the-first-day-of-the-weeklong-awesome-games-done-1790948260|title=Watch The Final Days Of The Weeklong Awesome Games Done Quick Charity Marathon|last=Gach|first=Ethan|newspaper=Kotaku|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/prepare-your-switch-tab-shortcut-at-work-awesome-games-done-quick-is-back/|title=Awesome Games Done Quick is indeed awesome, will ruin productivity all week|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/01/09/awesome-games-done-quick-2017-started/|title=Awesome Games Done Quick speedruns another week|last=O'Connor|first=Alice|date=January 9, 2017|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes these runs may be executed in an unusual or specific way, such as fully completing every level, completing a game blindfolded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/5/12098530/speedrunner-castlevania-symphony-of-the-night-romscout-blindfolded-games-done-quick|title=Watch a speedrunner complete Castlevania: Symphony of the Night blindfolded|last=Biery|first=Thomas|date=July 5, 2016|website=Polygon|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or featuring multiple runners racing against one another to complete a game first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/13/11-amazing-speedruns-from-awesome-games-done-quick-2016|title=11 Amazing Speedruns from Awesome Games Done Quick 2016|last=Otero|first=Jose|date=January 12, 2016|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games run in Games Done Quick events include both [[retrogaming|retro]] and modern titles. The runs typically feature commentary from the runner(s) or experienced commentators, as well as donation messages read by an announcer.

Most of the popular runs feature video game glitches&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/9/12135296/summer-games-done-quick-2016-roundup-sgdq-2016|title=Summer Games Done Quick 2016 roundup: The biggest surprises of the week|last=Biery|first=Thomas|date=July 9, 2016|website=Polygon|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion between the runner and the commentators, most frequently describing techniques or using observational humor and banter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/what-to-watch-during-the-summer-games-done-quick-speedrun-marathon/|title=What to watch during the Summer Games Done Quick speedrun marathon|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humor and banter is especially used for non-interactive or repetitive sequences that don't require the runner to use much or any skill. Donations from viewers may feature humorous comments that contain inside jokes among the speedrunning community, as well as more personal acknowledgements concerning the charity donated to. Because of the live broadcast and wider audience, runners and commentators are encouraged to refrain from using strong profanity and offensive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/rules|title=Games Done Quick|website=gamesdonequick.com|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Games Done Quick logo.PNG|thumb|left|150px|Games Done Quick's former logo, used until 2018]]
Writer and speedrunner Eric Koziel identifies two important precursors to Games Done Quick: the "Desert Bus for Hope" donation drive held by LoadingReadyRun in November 2007, and a series of charity speedrun marathons held by The Speed Gamers starting in March 2008.&lt;ref name="Koziel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0014/1962/files/SpeedrunScience-010518_4e78a515-1852-4daf-ad5f-3f870cd569a8.pdf |date=January 5, 2018 |title=Speedrun Science: A Long Guide to Short Playthroughs |author=Koziel, Eric |publisher=Fangamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Users of the site Speed Demos Archive decided to hold a charity marathon in January 2010,&lt;ref name="MyUser_Wired.com_January_9_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/01/awesome-games-done-quick-2014/ |title=Speeding Through Classic Games to Beat Cancer |newspaper=Wired.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[MAGFest]] 8. It was themed around 8-bit and 16-bit video games and thus dubbed "Classic Games Done Quick" (after the 1990s speedrunning project Quake Done Quick). Internet connectivity problems at the MAGFest hotel forced SDA administrator Mike Uyama to relocate the event to his mother's basement, but it raised over $10,000 for [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]].&lt;ref name="MyUser_Vice.com_January_9_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/summer-games-done-quick-is-this-weekend-watch-and-be-wowed-333 |title=Summer Games Done Quick Starts This Weekend: Watch and Be Wowed |newspaper=Vice.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koziel"/&gt;

Following that initial success, the first Awesome Games Done Quick marathon was held in January 2011, expanding from two days to five days, incorporating newer games such as ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved|Halo]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and raising more than $50,000 for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Kevinbondelli.com_January_9_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kevinbondelli.com/2013/01/11/awesome-games-done-quick-has-already-raised-250k-for-prevent-cancer-foundation/#.VpFuvX2LTnA |title=Awesome Games Done Quick Has Already Raised $250K for Prevent Cancer Foundation |newspaper=Kevinbondelli.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Summer Games Done Quick was held in August 2011, raising $20,000 for the Organisation for Autism Research.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Researchautism.org_January_9_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.researchautism.org/resources/newsletters/2011/September_2011.asp |title=September_2011 |newspaper=Researchautism.org |date= |author= |accessdate=January 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304055828/http://www.researchautism.org/resources/newsletters/2011/September_2011.asp |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MyUser_Https:_January_9_2016c"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://netguide.co.nz/story/gamers-speed-run-for-charity/ |title=NetGuide NZ - Gamers speed-run for charity |newspaper=Https: |date=  |author= |accessdate= January 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, both Awesome Games Done Quick and Summer Games Done Quick have recurred annually, raising larger amounts each year.

A one-off additional marathon was held in March 2011 to support victims of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake and tsunami in Japan]]; Japan Relief Done Quick raised over $25,000. In addition, a one-off promotional event was held on March 20, 2015 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the [[God of War (franchise)|''God of War'' franchise]]. Over the course of five hours, God of War Done Quick ended up raising $3,500 for [[The AbleGamers Foundation]].

{{essay-like|date=June 2016}}
{{lead rewrite|date=June 2016}}
'''Honey trapping''' is an investigative practice that uses romantic and/or sexual relationships for an interpersonal, political or monetary purpose to the detriment of one party involved in this romantic or sexual affair. Investigators are also often employed by wives, husbands, and other partners usually when an illicit romantic affair is suspected of the "target," or subject of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Kelland, Kate. "Private Eye Defends Integrity of "Honey Trapping"" Reuters 13 Feb. 2008. 18 Feb. 2008 &lt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL132980220080213?sp=true https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL132980220080213?sp=true]&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, the term may be used for the practice of creating an [[affair]] for the purpose of taking incriminating photos for use in [[blackmail]]. A honey trap is used primarily to collect evidence on the subject of the honey trap.

== Private investigators ==

Each assignment varies depending on what the agent and client decided on during their prior consultant. A common assignment consists of the agent initiating contact with the subject through [[face-to-face interaction]]. The agent will attempt to take the communication further into other outlets including: e-mail, text messaging, phone calls, etc. The step after this can be considered the most crucial moment of the assignment. Whether or not the subject agrees to further communication will determine whether the assignment will go deeper or come to an end. The agent will propose a second meeting to the subject. [[Hotel]]s are often used as a meeting place, not for [[sexual intercourse]], but to determine whether the subject intends for the relationship to escalate. Once the investigation comes to an end, the agent will turn over any record of communication they had with the subject. Other documents that are recorded include: photographs, videos, venue appointments, etc.

==Spy craft== 
In 2009 the British [[MI5]] distributed  a 14-page document  to hundreds of British banks, businesses, and financial institutions, titled "The Threat from Chinese Espionage". It described a wide-ranging Chinese effort to blackmail Western business people over sexual relationships. The document explicitly warns that Chinese intelligence services are trying to cultivate "long-term relationships" and have been known to "exploit vulnerabilities such as sexual relationships … to pressurise individuals to co-operate with them."&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Knightley, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/03/12/the-history-of-the-honey-trap/ The History of the Honey Trap. Five lessons for would-be James Bonds and Bond girls -- and the men and women who would resist them], ''[[Foreign Policy]]'', (March 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jin Gyeong-suk''' (June 24, 1980{{spaced ndash}}2005), also known as '''Jin Kyung-sook''', was a [[North Korea]]n woman who, after successfully defecting to [[South Korea]] in 2002, was abducted in [[China]] two years later and forcefully deported back to [[North Korea]], where she was tortured and murdered.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;[//www.amnesty.org/en/stay-informed/enewsletters/wire/february-2010-march-2010-pdf-24-pages-167-mb Amnesty International: Newsletter ''THE WIRE''], Issue January/February 2010, Women Shaping Their Own Lives, P. 20. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kidnapping ==
In August 2004, Jin, who had acquired South Korean [[citizenship]] after her arrival there two years earlier, and her husband, Mun Jeong-hun, traveled on their honeymoon to the [[Jilin Province]] in northern China. Commissioned by a Japanese film production company, the couple had planned to make a video about the involvement of the North Korean regime in the [[Illegal drug trade|drug trade]]. In this context, they met a supposed middle-man on the Chinese side of the [[Tumen River]], which forms a border between China and North Korea. This middle-man was supposed to smuggle a video camera into North Korea, to facilitate gathering of evidence on film of the drug production taking place there. The meeting with the middle-man turned out to be a trap. Jin and her husband were abducted by four men disguised as road construction workers, but who, it is believed, were agents of the North Korean secret service. While her husband managed to escape, Jin Gyeong-suk was forced into a sack and transported across the Tumen River into North Korea. Later investigations showed that she was deported to the [[Chongjin concentration camp]] in the northern [[Hamgyong]] Province, where she was interrogated, tortured, and eventually murdered.

===Reactions===
The case proved to be politically highly charged, and indeed for two reasons:&lt;ref name="The Chosunilbo: Daily News From Korea"&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2004/09/08/2004090861020.html ''The Chosunilbo: Daily News From Korea''] Article from 08 September 2004: Was North Korean Defector kidnapped or arrestet? Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;    

#Since Jin held a South Korean passport, the case involved the kidnapping of a South Korean national on Chinese soil. Thus both South Korea and China were also involved. As a North Korean citizen, the legal situation of Jin would have been a different one, since China maintains a practice of turning over defectors from North Korea to the North Korean authorities. Chinese authorities asserted that, at the time of kidnapping, Jin was actually located on North Korean territory to help her sister escape from North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00300&amp;num=261 ''Daily NK''] Artikel vom 24. August 2005: Former General of People's Army Kidnapped by National Security Agency. Retrieved 15 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The question arose whether Jin had actually been kidnapped or only arrested in accordance with North Korean law. That law stipulates a punishment for foreign nationals suspected of espionage of up to seven years imprisonment in a Labor Camp. Since she held a South Korean passport, such law could have applied to Jin Gyeong-suk. A government official said: "We are always telling defectors that China is a dangerous place for them, but these incidents happen. We cannot comprehend how you could claim your right to free travel and then try to sell a North Korean video identified as a North Korean defector."&lt;ref name="The Chosunilbo: Daily News From Korea" /&gt;

===Petitions for release===
Jin's abduction to North Korea garnered a flurry of media attention. Various human rights organizations intervened, expending considerable energy and resources to seek Jin’s release; they attempted as well to determine whether Jin was still alive. The family petitioned to then South Korean president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] and pushed for her return to South Korea, without, however, receiving a response from the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk00100&amp;num=1080|work=Daily NK|date=September 9, 2006|title=Victims of Abduction: Jin Kyung Sook's Family Petition to the President|accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
Jin died around early January 2005, at the [[Chongjin concentration camp]]. The cause of death was determined to be the result of the residual effects of torture to which she had been subjected to.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International" /&gt;

The '''Lasowiacy''' or Lesioki, are a subethnic group of the [[Poles|Polish nation]], who reside in [[Lesser Poland]], at the confluence of the [[Vistula]] and the [[San (river)|San]] rivers, [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship]], southeastern Poland. They are descended from various ethnic groups, which settled in the dense [[Sandomierz Wilderness]] across centuries, with a dominant Polish element. The Lasowiacy were formed as a separate subethnic group in the late 19th and early 20th century. They use their own dialect, which belongs to [[Lesser Polish dialect]] of the [[Polish language]]. Like most Poles, the Lasowiacy are Roman Catholics.

== Area ==
The area inhabited by the Lasowiacy ranges from [[Sandomierz]] and [[Nisko]] in the north, to [[Głogów Małopolski]], [[Leżajsk]],  and [[Ropczyce]]. According to Polish ethographer Franciszek Kotula, their territory is much wider, reaching to [[Tarnogród]], [[Janów Lubelski]] and [[Biłgoraj]].

== Origins ==
The Lasowiacy were formed as a separate subethnic group in the 19th century. [[Sandomierz Wilderness]], one of the largest forests in southern Poland, was for centuries sparsely inhabited. In the mid-14th century, King [[Kazimierz Wielki]] established several towns located on the edge of the wilderness. In the 16th century, settlers from [[Mazovia]] began to arrive here, founding several villages (e.g. Mazury). Furthermore, in the 16th and 17th centuries, upon royal orders, the forest was settled by prisoners of war from several countries, such as [[Swedish Empire]], [[Crimean Khanate]], [[Turkish Empire]], [[Muscovy]], [[Tsardom of Russia|Rus']], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] [[Wallachia]], as well as German mercenaries, who served in different armies.

In the late 18th century, southern [[Lesser Poland]] and neighboring [[Red Ruthenia]] were annexed by the [[Habsburg Empire]], as the newly created province of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. Soon, first German-speaking settlers came to the Sandomierz Wilderness, during the action initiated by Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. Furthermore, after the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the border between Austria and [[Russian Empire]] was established along the [[Vistula]]. As a result, inhabitants of the wilderness were for 100 years separated from Sandomierzanie, another local subethnic group, named after the town of [[Sandomierz]], which deepened their isolation.

== Language ==
The Lasowiacy dialect (Polish gwara lasowiacka or gwara lasowska) belongs to the Lesser Poland dialect of the Polish language. Since the wilderness was settled by the Mazovians, the Lasowiacy dialect has several features of the [[Masovian dialect]], such as [[mazurzenie]]. [[Melchior Wańkowicz]] in his 1939 book [[Sztafeta]] gives an interesting example of the Lasowiacy dialect. In 1938, he went to the Lasowiacy village of Pławo, where a brand new industrial town of [[Stalowa Wola]] was being built. Wańkowicz talked to local residents, writing in the book: "The people in this village call themselves Lasowiacy, speaking a funny accent, which sounds like a mix of [[Podhale subdialect|goral dialect]], and the language of [[Kurpie]]".&lt;ref&gt;Melchior Wańkowicz, Sztafeta. Prószyński i Spółka, Warszawa 2012, pages 320–322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities of the Lasowiacy ==
Since bulk of the Lasowiacy inhabited the vast wilderness, they supported themselves by forestry, with such activities, as hunting, honey making, tar making and production of charcoal. There also were skilled artisans – carpenters, coopers, pot makers, wicker workers, and weavers. Since parts of the wilderness were cleared and turned into farmfields, several kinds of cereal and vegetables are cultivated here. Local soil, however, is not fertile, allowing for cultivation of potatoes, beetroots, rye and oat.

[[Image:Młyn wodny.JPG|thumb|Water mill from open-air museum in Kolbuszowa]]

== Houses and clothes ==
The Lasowiacy used to live in [[log cabin]]s, with a number of them making [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]], located in the woods. Their clothes were made of [[linen]], with most popular colors white, black and red. The [[open-air museum]] in [[Kolbuszowa]] (formerly known as Regional Museum of the Lasowiacy) features several original examples of the Lasowiacy culture. In 1956, Dancing Ensemble Lasowiacy was created in [[Stalowa Wola]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10425">[[File:MITSFS library 2.jpg|thumb|MITSFS library storage space is very scarce, requiring occasional use of "temporary shelves"]]
The '''MIT Science Fiction Society''' (or '''MITSFS''') of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] is a student organization which maintains and administers a large publicly-accessible library of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and [[science fantasy]] books and magazines.

==History==
In 1950, the club was instrumental in [[microfilm]]ing ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', leading to it becoming a recognized student organization in 1951. In 1961, Anthony R. Lewis became Librarian, and the library growth began in earnest. With the [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Stratton Student Center (1968)|Stratton Student Center]] opening in 1965, the Society moved out of the old [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Walker Memorial (1916)|Walker Memorial building]] to the new building. At about the same time, [[Erwin Strauss]] compiled a science fiction index for periodicals from 1951 to 1955, called ''The MIT Science Fiction Society's Index to the S-F Magazines 1951 - 1965''. MIT rules barred the Society from publishing the book because student organizations were prohibited from commercial activity, so Strauss published it himself under the same title.

In 1965, MITSFS joined with the UMass SFS&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ross|first1=A. Joseph|title=The early history of UMSFS|url=http://www.umass.edu/rso/scifi/history.shtml|website=UMass Science Fiction Society|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others, including [[Hal Clement]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=X6zthC39n1cC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=%22boston+science+fiction+society%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qkQ1F2CXbV&amp;sig=rJWJ2RbJBM8hfpu5RRV65GJde8s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCGoVChMIj8ris7TsxgIVBDeICh0Zygnp#v=onepage&amp;q=%22boston%20science%20fiction%20society%22&amp;f=false Hal's Worlds: Stories and Essays in Memory of Hal Clement] Shane Tourtellotte; 
Wildside Press LLC,  {{ISBN|0809550733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  in forming the "Boston Science Fiction Society", holding the first [[Boskone]] convention. In 1967, [[NESFA]] arose from the ashes of that group, and brought the [[WorldCon]] to Boston in 1971. In the mid-1970s, the [[MIT Libraries]] started partially funding acquisition of newly published books.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/article/531401/60000-books-and-a-few-toy-bananas/|title=60,000 Books and a Few Toy Bananas: The MIT Science Fiction Society has an admirable collection of quirks|first1=Jay|last1=London|journal=[[Technology Review]]|issn=0040-1692|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, the widow of respected [[Golden Age of Science Fiction|Golden Age]] editor [[John W. Campbell]] donated her husband's personal set of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdV_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=mitsfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bEHuVPGfBImeggTFhoO4BQ&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mitsfs&amp;f=false Science/Fiction Collections: Fantasy, Supernatural and Weird Tales] Lee Ash; Routledge, Aug 21, 2013; 181 pages; pp 69-77  {{ISBN|0917724496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell had almost finished an MIT physics degree, but transferred to [[Duke University]] to avoid a [[German language]] requirement, and then pursued a lifetime career in writing and editing science fiction.

==Society==
[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|''[[Spacewar!]]'' video game written at MIT in 1962, on an early [[PDP-1]] [[minicomputer]]]]
Guest speakers at meetings of the Society have included [[Hugo Gernsback]] (whose 1963 address to the Society has been published as "Prophets of Doom"), [[Frederik Pohl]], [[John W. Campbell]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Hal Clement]], and [[Larry Niven]], and more recently [[John Scalzi]] and [[Charles Stross]].  The Society was instrumental in the first [[Boskone]] science fiction convention, in [[NESFA]] founding, and in the [[29th World Science Fiction Convention|Noreascon]] in 1971, among others.  The [[World Science Fiction Society]], which sponsors the [[Hugo awards]], is still located in Cambridge.

Some past members include [[Durk Pearson]], [[Rick Norwood]], Al Kuhfeld, Bill Sarill, [[Whit Diffie]], [[Geoffrey A. Landis]], [[Erwin Strauss]], and [[Guy Consolmagno]]. The Society has been mentioned in [[Laurence M. Janifer]]'s ''The Counterfeit Heinlein: A Gerald Knave Science Fiction Adventure''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ukIfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=mitsfs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bEHuVPGfBImeggTFhoO4BQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=mitsfs&amp;f=false The Counterfeit Heinlein: A Gerald Knave Science Fiction Adventure] Laurence M.

The Society is informal in its operations, but has developed an elaborate pseudo-hierarchy with officer titles such as "Skinner", "Lord High Embezzler", and "Onseck".&lt;ref name=Eisen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eisen|first1=Janet M.|last2= Consolmagno|first2=Guy|last3=Hucklebery |first3=Tim|title=Lore of the MITSFS| url=http://ugcs.net/~rowlands/LoreOfTheMITSFS/LoreOfTheMITSFS.pdf| website=UGCS.net| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402110335/http://ugcs.net/~rowlands/LoreOfTheMITSFS/LoreOfTheMITSFS.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-02|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="London" /&gt; However, actual theft and vandalism are regarded as serious crimes, and strict security rules have developed to protect the collection, such as requiring that all [[backpack]]s, [[permanent marker]]s, and pens be left at the library entrance.&lt;ref name="MITSFS-Rules"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules-Fines|url=http://mitsfs.mit.edu/rules-fines/|website=MIT Science Fiction Society|publisher=MITSFS|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest ongoing challenge for MITSFS is finding sufficient physical space for its tightly-packed and ever-growing library collection.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MITSFS-Donate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Donations|url=http://mitsfs.mit.edu/donations/|website=MIT Science Fiction Society|publisher=MITSFS|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 45,000 books are crammed into less than {{convert|1700|sqft|m2}} of space, and some 16,000 volumes of its collection must be stored offsite in a warehouse.&lt;ref name="London" /&gt;

==Library==
The over 60,000&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="London" /&gt; volumes constitute the "world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction";&lt;ref name="MITSFS-Main"&gt;{{cite web|title=[Main page]|url=http://mitsfs.mit.edu|website=MIT Science Fiction Society|publisher=MITSFS|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[Eaton collection]] of the [[University of California, Riverside]] is larger,&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;{{cite web|title=Eaton Collection at UC Riverside|url=http://eaton.ucr.edu|website=UC Riverside|publisher=Regents of the University of California|accessdate=2017-06-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; that collection is not on open shelves. According to MITSFS, the library once included "over 90% of all science fiction ever published in English", although a profusion of [[self-publishing]] now may have outdistanced it.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;  The library is freely available for browsing by the public, as well as for borrowing by members.  Membership is open to anyone who pays the modest dues and agrees to abide by the rules.&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tatewilliams.org/2014/09/03/mad-scientist-club/ Mad Scientist Club] Tate Williams September 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MITSFS-Memb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Memberships|url=http://mitsfs.mit.edu/memberships/|website=MIT Science Fiction Society|publisher=MITSFS|accessdate=2017-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library is financially supported by membership dues, and by MIT's Association of Student Activities funding board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V133/N26/groups.html Fandom in student groups] Jessica J. Pourian; The Tech; May 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[library catalog|catalog]] of the library may be searched online through the PinkDex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitsfs.mit.edu/pinkdex/ |title=Pinkdex |website=MIT Science Fiction Society |publisher=MITSFS |date= |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the library's contents include full runs of [[Astounding Science Fiction]] and other American science fiction magazines, and full or nearly full runs of the major American fantasy magazines. It has first editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', editions in French and German of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', all of the paperback versions of the series, CDs of the series, copies of all of Tolkien's related works, and so on.  In fantasy, it has all of the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' books, with some also in German and Russian.

The collection is physically located in MIT's [[Julius Adams Stratton]] [[Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology#Stratton Student Center (1968)|Student Center]] at 84 [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. {{as of|2017}}, the library is usually open 7 days a week, though Monday hours may be curtailed or occasionally dropped, and summer hours may be reduced.&lt;ref name=Schedule&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mitsfs.mit.edu/www/schedule.txt |title=Schedule |website=MIT Science Fiction Society |publisher=MITSFS |date=March 22, 2015 |accessdate=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahl people''' refers to the ethnic [[Maldivians]] of [[India]] (i.e. People of [[Minicoy]] and migrant communities from Minicoy). They are one of the three subgroups of the [[Maldivians]] and speak the [[Mahl dialect]] of [[Maldivian language|Divehi]] which is a member of the southern group of [[Indo-Aryan languages]].&lt;ref name="Cain"&gt;{{cite book |last= Cain|first= B.D. |title= Dhivehi (Maldivian): A Synchronic and Diachronic Study (Ph.D. dissertation)|publisher= Cornell University |year= 2000 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090130072841/http://mathaaran.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; All Mahls are native to [[Minicoy|Minicoy Island]] in the [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India, which was formerly a part of the [[Maldive Islands]].

==History==
Local oral tradition has it that Kamborani and Kohoratukamana, two princesses from the [[Maldives]], came to Minicoy. When they arrived, the [[Tivaru]], who had been living there before, left the island for [[Sri Lanka]]. The Kamborani's descendants are the bodun (land- and shipowners) and the descendants of Kohoratukamana are the niamin (captains). The other status-groups are made up of the descendants of their crew.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Kattner, ''The Social Structure of Maliku (Minicoy)''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions like this and linguistic affinities with the [[Mahl dialect]] of [[Maldivian language|Divehi]] spoken in Minicoy and the standard Maldivian dialect, compared with the southern Maldivian dialects in which archaic features are more well-preserved suggest that Minicoy was principally settled by settlers from [[Malé]] or the northern [[Maldives]].

==Demographics and geographic distribution==
Most Mahls live in their native land of [[Minicoy|Maliku (Minicoy)]] in the union territory of [[Lakshadweep]], [[India]]. In Lakshadweep the Mahls emerged as a separate ethnic group and are 15.67% of the total population of Lakshadweep. 

There are migrant communities of Mahls in other parts of India too. The origin of all the Mahl communities in India and elsewhere lies in the island of [[Minicoy]]. A number of Mahls have settled in the districts of [[Kozhikode district|Kozhikode]], [[Malappuram]], [[Ernakulam]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram|Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum)]] in the southern state of [[Kerala]]. There is a community of Mahls in Kerala who came and settled there in the 17th century, when the islands of [[Lakshadweep]] came under the rule of [[Ali Raja]]hs/Arakkal Bheevi of [[Kannur]].

==Social groups==
===Thakru===
According to the ethno-history of the Thakru, a person named Thakru came to Minicoy from Atol Addu in Maldives and married thrice, and the present Thakru are his descendants.&lt;ref name="POI"&gt;{{cite book |last= Singh|first= K.S. |title= People of India: Lakshadweep|publisher= Anthropological Survey of India |year= 1993 |isbn= 81-85336-98-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Merina people are most commonly found in the center of the island (former [[Antananarivo Province]]). Beginning in the late 18th century, [[Kingdom of Madagascar|Merina sovereigns]] expanded the political region under their control from their interior capital, outwards into the island, with their king [[Radama I]] ultimately helping unite the island under their rule. The [[French colonial empire|French]] fought two wars with the Merina people in 1883-1885 and in 1895, [[French Madagascar|colonized Madagascar]] in 1895–96 and abolished the Merina monarchy in 1897.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p180"/&gt;

They built innovative and elaborate irrigation infrastructure and highly productive rice farms in high plateaus of Madagascar by the 18th century.&lt;ref name=britmerina/&gt; The Merina people were [[Social stratification|socially stratified]] with hierarchical [[caste]]s, inherited occupations and [[endogamy]],&lt;ref name="Campbell2005p120"/&gt; as well as one where two of the major and long serving monarchs of the Merina people were queens.&lt;ref name=green20/&gt;

==History==
{{further|Merina Kingdom|Malagasy Protectorate|History of Madagascar}}
[[Austronesian]] people started settling in Madagascar between 200 and 500 CE. They arrived by boats and were from various southeast Asian groups. Later [[Swahili-Arabs]] and [[India]]n traders came to the island's northern regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=An Economic History of Imperial Madagascar, 1750-1895: The Rise and Fall of an Island Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13Yt9jLuKzsC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-83935-8|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; African slaves were brought to the island's coasts between the 13th and the 18th centuries. The Portuguese traders were the first Europeans to arrive in the 15th century, followed by other European powers.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p180"/&gt;

[[File:Ethnic groups of Madagascar Map.png|thumb|200px|left|Traditional region of the Merina people (purple center), relative to other Malagasy ethnic groups.]]
This influx of diverse people led to various [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] sub-ethnicities in the mid-2nd millennium.

Oral history traces the emergence of a united kingdom in the central highlands of Madagascar – a region called Imerina – back to early 16th-century king [[Andriamanelo]]. By 1824, a succession of Merina kings had conquered nearly all of Madagascar, particularly through the military strategy, ambitious treaties and political policies of [[Andrianampoinimerina]] (circa 1785–1810) and his son [[Radama I]] (1792–1828). The colonial British empire recognized the sovereignty of the Merina kingdom and its control of the Madagascar island in 1817.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p180"/&gt; Radama I welcomed European traders and allowed Christian missionaries to establish missions on Madagascar.&lt;ref name=britmerina/&gt; After him, the Merina people were ruled by Queen Ranavolona I ruled from 1828 to 1861, Queen Rasoherina from 1863 to 1868, and Queen Ranavolona II ruled from 1868 to 1885.&lt;ref name=green20&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca L.

The Swahili Arab traders expanded their opportunities to trade and European colonial powers such as the French trader [[Joseph-François Lambert]] signed a disputed lease with King Radama II for plantation lands for sugarcane cultivation and industries along the Madagascar coastal plains.&lt;ref name="Gates167"/&gt; The Merina people called the Malagasy living along the coasts as ''Cotier''.&lt;ref name="Gates167"/&gt; These operations and plantations were worked by the forced labor of imported slaves. The largest influx of slaves was brought in by the 'Umani [[Arab]]s and the [[French colonial empire|French]].

The dominance of the Merina kingdom over all of Madagascar came to an end with the [[First Madagascar expedition|first Franco-Hova War]] of 1883 to 1885, triggered by the disputed lease signed by Radama II. At the war's end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Diégo Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-François Lambert, a Frenchman who had been promised lucrative trade privileges under King [[Radama II]] that had later been revoked. The French declared Madagascar as a protectorate in 1894, which the then Merina Queen refused to sign to.&lt;ref name="Pieter2013p247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Esterhuysen, Pieter|title=Africa A to Z: Continental and Country Profiles: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2R8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|year=2013|publisher=Africa Institute of South Africa|isbn=978-0-7983-0344-6|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Madagascar expedition|Second Franco-Hova War]] followed in 1895, when the French military landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city's defenders by surprise. In 1896, the French annexed [[Malagasy Protectorate|Madagascar]], and in 1897 the Merina people became the residents of the colony of [[French Madagascar]].

In early 20th century, the Merina people led an anti-French nationalist movement.  The group, based in Antananarivo, was led by a Malagasy Protestant clergyman, Pastor Ravelojoana. A secret society dedicated to affirming Malagasy cultural identity was formed in 1913, calling itself Iron and Stone Network (in local language, [[Vy Vato Sakelika]] – VVS). Repressed at first with numerous arrests over 1915 and 1916, the movement re-emerged in the 1920s through communists who gained concessions by partnering with the French Left in France.&lt;ref name="Clayton2014p81"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony Clayton|title=The Wars of French Decolonization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNcFBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81 |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-89486-5|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A famine in 1943-44 led to an open rebellion in Madagascar. The 1946 constitution of the French Fourth Republic made Madagascar a ''territoire d'outre-mer'' (overseas territory) within the French Union. Madagascar gained full independence in 1958 as the [[Malagasy Republic]]. The Merina people faced competition from other ethnic groups. The first president of the Republic, [[Philibert Tsiranana]], was a coastal Malagasy of [[Tsimihety people|Tsimihety]] ethnicity, and he was able to consolidate his power with a winner-takes-all system, while the Merina nationalists of the [[Congress Party for the Independence of Madagascar]] was weakened by rifts between leftist and ultranationalist factions. The Merina form much of the elite and educated middle-class of Madagascar. They are influential in the economy, universities and government organizations of Madagascar.&lt;ref name=britmerina/&gt;

==Religion==
King [[Radama I]] welcomed Christian missionaries to establish missions on Madagascar in the 1810s.&lt;ref name=britmerina/&gt; The Merina nobles were along the first to convert to Christianity. The [[London Missionary Society]] established numerous missions along the coast of Madagascar in the 1820s. Those who converted were offered scholarships in London and apprenticeship in Manchester.&lt;ref name="ShackSkinner1979p222"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William A. Shack|author2=Elliott P.

Due to the influence of British missionaries, the Merina upper classes converted to Protestantism entirely in the mid-19th century, following the example of their queen, [[Ranavalona II]]. The early spread of Protestantism among the Merina elite resulted in a degree of class and ethnic differentiation among practitioners of Christianity. The French preferred Catholic intrepreters and the former slaves of the Merina people converted to Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

The nobility attempted to intervene, by expelling certain Christian missions.

===Social stratification===
{{further|Andriana|Hova (Madagascar)|Andevo}}
Among all the Malagasy ethnicities, the Merina historically have had a highly stratified [[caste]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session24/Documents/A-HRC-24-43-Add2_en.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences], Gulnara Shahinian (December 2012), A/HRC/24/43/Add.2, United Nations General Assembly, Twenty-fourth session, page 4&lt;/ref&gt; The overall society, like many ethnic groups in Africa, had two category of people, the free locally called the ''fotsy'' who had ancestors with Asian Malagasy physiognomy, and the serfs or ''mainty'' who had ancestors with African physiognomy mostly captured in other parts of Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Shoup|title=Ethnic Groups of Africa and the Middle East: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SPBfnT_E1mgC&amp;pg=PA181|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-362-0|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Middleton1999p260"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen Middleton|title=Ancestors, Power, and History in Madagascar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=My4B9q9FTiYC|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-11289-8|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the fotsy-mainty dichotomy among Merina is not based on physiognomy, states Karen Middleton, but whether they have a family tomb: ''fotsy'' have family tomb, ''mainty'' are those without one or those who have established a recent tomb.&lt;ref name="Middleton1999p260"/&gt; The Merine people were divided into three strata: the ''[[Andriana]]'' (nobles), the ''[[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]]'' (freemen), and the lowest strata called ''[[Andevo]]'' (slaves).&lt;ref name="Danver2015p61"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven L.

Each strata had been then hierarchically subdivided.&lt;ref name="Campbell2005p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=An Economic History of Imperial Madagascar, 1750-1895: The Rise and Fall of an Island Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=13Yt9jLuKzsC&amp;pg=PA120|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83935-8|pages=120–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Andriana'' are divided into six sub-strata, each had an inherited occupation, and were endogamous.&lt;ref name="Danver2015p61"/&gt;

The nineteenth century records show that ''Andevo'' or slaves were imported blacks, and they constituted about a third of the Merina society. The Merina society sold highland slaves to both Muslim and European slave traders on Madagascar coast, as well as bought East African and southeast African slaves from them for their own plantations between 1795 and 1895. Marriage and any sexual relations between the ''fotsy'' and ''mainty'' were a taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=Abolition and Its Aftermath in the Indian Ocean Africa and Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmU2Dr_-WxsC&amp;pg=PT69|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-77078-5|pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2012 report by Gulnara Shahinian – the United Nation's Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the descendants of former slave castes continue to suffer in contemporary Madagascar Merina society, and inter-caste marriages socially ostracized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/RegularSessions/Session24/Documents/A-HRC-24-43-Add2_en.pdf Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences], Gulnara Shahinian (December 2012), A/HRC/24/43/Add.2, United Nations General Assembly, Twenty-fourth session, pages 3-4, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ritual and folklore===
The ''[[Vazimba]]'' feature prominently in Merina oral history and popular imagination.  It has been speculated that the Vazimba were the original population of Madagascar, descended from Southeast Asian seafarers who may have had [[pygmy]] physical characteristics. Among some Malagasy, the Vazimba are not believed to be human at all, but rather a form of supernatural creature possessing magical powers (''mahery'').&lt;ref name="man"/&gt;

In the first seven years of their lives, boys are typically [[circumcise]]d in a ritual wherein relatives request the blessings and protection of the ancestors. The Merina people also ritually kill their cattle with unusual violence, cook and consume beef prepared thereafter ceremoniously.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt;

The Merina believe their land to be ''tanin'drazana'' (the land of the ancestors) and show reverence to their ancestors by burying them in [[Architecture of Madagascar#Tomb construction|family tombs]] typically located in the ancestral village of origin.  Many believe that ancestors can intervene in events on Earth, for good or for ill, and this belief shapes the actions and thoughts of many Malagasy.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Kakapizon and chips food vendor in Antananarivo Madagascar.jpg|thumb|A Merina woman selling Kakapizon (left, a fried snack) and chips in [[Antananarivo]].]]
The [[cuisine of Madagascar|cuisine of the Merina]] is so heavily dominated by rice that the term for eating a meal is simply "to eat rice". This staple of the diet is so central to the Merina that it is considered to be ''masina'', or holy, and a common Merina belief holds that the eating of rice is the key to moral behaviour, and the French who occupied Merina lands were often looked down upon for eating bread over rice.&lt;ref name="man"&gt;Bloch, M. (1985). Almost Eating the Ancestors. ''Man, 20''(4), 631–646.&lt;/ref&gt; Beef also plays a large part in the Merina diet, and according to Merina oral history, it was a servant of King [[Ralambo]] who discovered that cows were edible and shared this knowledge with the king, who in turn informed the rest of his kingdom.&lt;ref name="man"/&gt;

===Livelihoods===
Rice, cassave and potatoes are staple crops of the Merina people. They also grow onions and other supplements, while cattle, pigs and animal husbandry is also a significant occupation. Many Merina people have moved into urban areas, where they operate factories and run businesses.&lt;ref name=britmerina/&gt;

The expression '''migrants' routes''' suggests the main geographical routes taken by migrants.

From Africa, the routes mainly head towards Europe, however they are slightly changing in the last years, moving towards South Africa and Asia.

[[Image:Carte des routes d'immigration africaine vers l'Europe.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of '''migrants' routes''' to North Africa and Europe from West Africa.]]

The majority of the African migrants haven't got European travel visas, therefore their only accessible ways northward is that of travelling through the trans-[[Sahara]]n routes. These routes are often shaped on the old ones used by caravans and during [[transumanza]] through the desert and on renewed and informal local networks, bent on the new survival needs and to pitiless rules of competition and exploitation.

About the 10% of the whole migratory stream uses sea routes.

The major part of African migrants usually doesn't go beyond the coastal regions of the North Africa, putting their journey to an end in one of the Mediterranean coastal countries (especially in [[Libya]] and in [[Maghreb]], where nowadays almost 2 millions of irregular migrants live).

Just a few migrants (between 10 and 15%) tries to head towards Europe facing control and repression policies adopted by any countries against irregular migration. The unexpected migrants' stream towards North African countries, together with the European effort and help to restrain this stream coming from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], prompted local governments to adopt repression and forced homecoming measures. According to the lack of repatriation agreements, migrants are mainly brought to the southern areas  bordering the neighbouring countries ([[Rosso]], near the [[Mauritania]]&amp;ndash;[[Senegal]] border; [[Oujda]], near the [[Morocco]]&amp;ndash;[[Algeria]] border; [[Tinzouatine]] and [[In Guezzam]], respectively near Algeria&amp;ndash;Mali and Algeria-[[Niger]] borders).

While the European policies,which have submitted the migration check to the coastal local authorities, seem to be effective in restraining the maritime migratory stream coming from Maghreb (though indirectly increasing human rights abuses), in 2007 trans-saharan and maritime routes from Africa have spread all over both modifying primal origins and increasing distances, human and material loss of the Great Migration. New routes have developed directly from Sub-Saharan countries (Senegal, [[Gambia]], [[Guinea]] coast) creating new entry paths and new migratory strategies (i.e. the increasing number of underages because less exposed to the risk of forced homecoming), which have partially varied the migrants' origins (fewer migrants from [[Sub-Sahara]] and more from [[Egypt]] and Morocco) but still not reducing the migratory pressure from Libya, which is still the major source of people migrating towards [[Italy]] and the main spot of departure for the European dream.

For many migrants, who try to cross the various African borders and their complex security, crime or corruption systems, this is a real human odyssey, about which in many cases we lack traces and witnesses. The journey is not only very expensive (people earning less than 1 Euro per day may spend thousands of Euros for this journey), but also very hazardous as far as life is concerned. The number of human losses during journeys across the desert, the sea or during other stops is really huge. United nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, announced since the beginning of 2018, at least 50 migrants have died trying to cross the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/migrants-deaths-in-mediterranean-reach-record-percentage-1.3652139 Migrants deaths in Mediterranean reach record percentage]&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons that prompt people to undertake the journey are mainly economic, for people in search of better life conditions, but also cultural and symbolic (e.g. in Sub-Saharan Africa the journey is mainly meant as a different way of undergoing the traditional rites of passage).

Through the modification of control and repression measures, the Sub-Saharan African migratory process is changing and therefore gradually tracing new maritime and overland routes, soon led by criminal organisations and networks of local go-betweens, which create new collusion between the police and the so-called ''passeurs'' within the exploitation of human beings.

== Agadez - Dirkou - Sabha ==

This is the first migratory route, which covers the old caravan trail passing by [[Agadez]] and [[Dirkou]] (in [[Niger]]) and the [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]] oasis (in [[Libya]]), and was gone through first in the 1990s from a huge migratory stream appealed in Libya by political measures aimed at opening the borders introduced by [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in 1992.

In the last years the Libyan migratory policy has been aiming at contrasting the Western embargo  and at supporting the use of Southern foreign workforce in order to overcome the productive lack especially in the field of agriculture and construction. These measures have been blocked after [[xenophobic]] reactions occurred in 2000 in [[Tripoli]] and [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawiya]].

From then onwards, Libya, being the country with the majority of immigrants among the local countries (about 1 million and a half immigrants among 5 millions and a half inhabitants, mainly distributed on the coastal area), aims at restraining and repressing irregular migrants. Libya and its policy have been supported (despite the continuous [[human rights]] violations) by the agreements on the control on irregular migrations signed together with the European countries (especially Italy).

Following the widely reported drowning of over 200 migrants traveling from Libya to Europe in March 2009, the Libyan Interior Minister [[Abdelfattah Yunis al-Obeidi]] announced an agreement with [[Nigerien Interior Minister]] [[Albadé Abouba]] to begin joint patrols to stem the flow of migrants through Niger into Libya.  The majority of Sub-Saharan migrants who travel through Libya come by this route.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggiM4Jlg7BRqj2r5oyNX6raTUvbA Libya says most illegals to Europe travel from Niger].

From 2000 onwards has been traced a new much more westward oriented route, which gathers the migratory stream moving from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], which is mostly exposed to conflicts and crisis (such as [[Nigeria]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Niger]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Cameroon]], etc.) as well as the smaller migratory stream coming from Central Asia.

So, nowadays migrants rediscover and go through the old routes of Sub-Saharan caravan networks covered for centuries by nomadic people ([[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]) from Mali, Niger and [[Algeria]].

The new joints passed through by caravans reshape the urban landscape and many cities, like [[Agadez]] and [[Arlit]] in Niger, [[Bamako]] and [[Gao]] in Mali and [[Tamanrasset]] in Algeria, are filled with migrants and other people involved in the handling and transporting illegal migrants.
[[File:CeutaBorderFence.jpg|thumb|right|The Ceuta-Morocco border fence, as seen from Ceuta.]]From these junts migrants head especially towards [[Maghnia]] on the Moroccan border and the Spanish enclave in [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] on the coast, where they continuously try to cross the  barriers in defence of the cities or to reach the nearest spots on the Algerian and Tunisian coasts. Between 2000 and 2005 the migratory pressure in Morocco has increased and reached its highest point in summer-autumn 2005, when hundreds of migrants assaulted the barriers of the two Spanish enclaves (Ceuta and Melilla), causing the death of dozens of people and the injure of hundreds of people.

The renewed policy of cooperation between [[Madrid]] and [[Rabat]], launched by Government Zapatero in 2004, prompts Moroccan authorities to adopt measures to dissuade and restrain irregular migration, causing a new southward movement of the migratory routes toward the [[Canary Islands]].

== Canary Islands ==

The third route toward the Spanish Canary Islands, located in the offing of [[Mauritania]], has a long history of irregular migrations, which has been increasing from 90s onwards because of the gradual closures of the way outs northwards.

The new restraining measures on the Mediterranean coasts, following up the agreements between Italy and Spain, are gradually moving the migratory pressure on the maritime route between [[El Aaiún]] in [[Western Sahara]] and the Canary Islands. This trail lasts almost a night. As time goes by, the fishermen' ships ([[dugout (boat)|dugout]] or [[pateras]]) of the Western Sahara, which have been strengthened with more powerful engines and therefore are more and more crowded with irregular migrants, are forced to start their journey from coastal spots more and more far-away from El Aaiún route. On the other hand, the restrictions adopted on the Mauritanian and Moroccan coasts deter fishermen from attempting this long journey and the starting points are no longer the Western- Saharan ones, but they become southward oriented, including the coasts of Senegal, Gambia and [[Gulf of Guinea]].

The economic costs and the losses of human lives during the passage to the West and the resulting exploitation processes are due to the increase in distance and to the risks of the transfer. Migrants, helped by a compass and little information on the driving of a boat, are in charge of leading it and this behaviour considerably increases the risks of the transfer. This also leads to an increasing number of castaways on the Atlantic coasts.

==Etymology==

Misandry is formed from the Greek ''misos'' (μῖσος, "hatred") and ''anēr'', ''andros'' (ἀνήρ, gen. ἀνδρός; "man").&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/misandry&lt;/ref&gt; Use of the word can be found as far back as the nineteenth century, including an 1871 use in ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Misandry" the Word – Its Origin |url=http://unknownmisandry.blogspot.com/2011/02/misandry-word-its-origin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Review of novel "Blanche Seymour", ''The Spectator'', London, 1 Apr. 1871, p. 389. ''“We cannot, indeed, term her an absolute misandrist, as she fully admits the possibility, in most cases at least, of the reclamation of men from their naturally vicious and selfish state, though at the cost of so much trouble and vexation of spirit to women, that it is not quite clear whether she does not regard their existence as at best a mitigated evil.”''&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in ''[[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary]]'' (11th ed.) in 1952. Translation of the French "''misandrie''" to the German "''Männerhass''" (Hatred of Men)&lt;ref name="german_english_Männerhaß"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/M%C3%A4nnerha%C3%9F |title=Translations for Männerhaß in the German » English dictionary |publisher=PONS GmbH, Stuttgart |work=Pons Dictionary German To English |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6OBt5zfJ5?url=http://en.pons.com/translate/german-english/M%C3%A4nnerha%C3%9F |archivedate=19 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is recorded in 1803.&lt;ref name="Krünitz1803"&gt;{{cite book |author=Johann Georg Krünitz |title=[[wikipedia:Oekonomische Encyklopädie |Oekonomische Encyklopädie]] oder allgemeines System der Staats-, Stadt-, Haus- u.

==Male disposability==
{{Main article|Male disposability}}

[[File:Misandry graffito.jpg|thumb|left|Anti-misandry graffito scratched into a public table.]]
Activist [[Warren Farrell]] has written of his views on how men are uniquely marginalized in what he calls their "disposability", the manner in which the most dangerous occupations, notably soldiering and mining, were historically performed exclusively by men and remain so today. In his book, ''[[The Myth of Male Power]]'', Farrell argues that patriarchal societies do not make rules to benefit men at the expense of women. Farrell contends that nothing is more telling about who has benefited from "men's rules" than [[Life expectancy#Gender differences|life expectancy]], which is lower in males, and [[Gender differences in suicide|suicide rates]], which are higher.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;Warren Farrell, ''The Myth of Male Power'', (N.Y.: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), Chp. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Within feminist movements==

Academic [[Alice Echols]], in her 1989 book ''Daring To Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'', argued that the radical feminist [[Valerie Solanas]], best known for her attempted murder of [[Andy Warhol]] in 1968, displayed an extreme level of misandry compared to other radical feminists of the time in her tract the ''[[SCUM Manifesto]]''. Echols stated:

{{quote|Solanas's unabashed misandry—especially her belief in men's biological inferiority—her endorsement of relationships between 'independent women,' and her dismissal of sex as 'the refuge of the mindless' contravened the sort of radical feminism which prevailed in most women's groups across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Echols, Nicole. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6zaVkAjBuPEC&amp;pg=PA104 ''Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975'']. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989, pp. 104-105, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-1786-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Andrea Dworkin]] criticized the [[biological determinist]] strand in [[radical feminism]] that, in 1977, she found "with increasing frequency in feminist circles" which echoed the views of Valerie Solanas that males are biologically inferior to women and violent by nature, requiring a [[gendercide]] to allow for the emergence of a "new ''Übermensch'' Womon".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/heresies6.pdf|title = Biological Superiority: The World's Most Dangerous and Deadly Idea|last = Dworkin|first = Andrea|date = Summer 1978|journal = HERESIES: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|access-date = 2015-05-12|publisher = Heresies Collective, Inc.|issue = #6|series = No. 2|location = New York City, NY, USA|volume =  2|page =46|issn = 0146-3411|author-link = Andrea Dworkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[bell hooks]] has discussed the issue of "man hating" during the early period of women's liberation as a reaction to patriarchal oppression and women who have had bad experiences with men in non-feminist social movements. She has also criticized separatist strands of feminism as "reactionary" for promoting the notion that men are inherently immoral, inferior, and unable to help end sexist oppression or benefit from feminism.&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (1984), ''Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center'', South End Press; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. (2005), ''The Will To Change: Men, Masculinity and Love'', New York; Washington Square Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Feminism is For Everybody'', hooks laments the fact that feminists who critiqued anti-male bias in the early women's movement never gained mainstream media attention and that "our theoretical work critiquing the demonization of men as the enemy did not change the perspective of women who were anti-male." hooks has theorized previously that this demonization led to an unnecessary rift between the [[men's movement]] and the [[women's movement]].&lt;ref&gt;hooks, bell. Feminist Theory from Margin to Center. Boston, MA: South End, 1984. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hooks doesn't name individual separatist theorists, [[Mary Daly]]'s utopian vision of a world in which men and heterosexual women have been eliminated is an extreme example of this tendency.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Mary. (1998), ''Quintessence...Realizing The Archaic Future'', Beacon Press; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; Daly argued that sexual equality between men and women was not possible and that women, due to their superior capacities, should rule men.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Mary. (1990),  ''Gyn/Ecology: The Metaethics of Radical Feminism'', Boston, Mass.: Beacon Press, pp. 384 &amp; 375–376&lt;/ref&gt; Yet later, in an interview, Daly argued "If life is to survive on this planet, there must be a decontamination of the Earth. I think this will be accompanied by an evolutionary process that will result in a drastic reduction of the population of males."&lt;ref&gt;Ridle, Susan (Fall/Winter 1999). "No Man's Land". ''EnlightenNext'' Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Nathanson]] and [[Katherine K. Young]] argued that "ideological feminism" as opposed to "egalitarian feminism" has imposed misandry on culture.&lt;ref name="NYspreading-xiv"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|p=xiv}} "[ideological feminism,] one form of feminism—one that has had a great deal of influence, whether directly or indirectly, on both popular culture and elite culture—is profoundly misandric".&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2001 book, ''Spreading Misandry'', analyzed "pop cultural artifacts and productions from the 1990s" from movies to greeting cards for what they considered to be pervasive messages of hatred toward men.&lt;ref name="NathansonYoung2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Nathanson|author2=Katherine K.

[[Wendy McElroy]], an [[individualist feminist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/aboutus/person_detail.asp?id=488 The Independent Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in 2001 that some feminists "have redefined the view of the movement of the opposite sex" as "a hot anger toward men [that] seems to have turned into a cold hatred."&lt;ref name="McElroy-05"&gt;{{Harv|McElroy|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued it was a misandrist position to consider men, as a class, to be irreformable or [[rape|rapists]].

In a 2016 article, author and journalist [[Cathy Young]] described a "current cycle of misandry" in feminism.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite news |last=Young |first=Cathy |date=2016-07-04 |title=Feminists treat men badly and it's bad for feminism |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/30/feminists-treat-men-badly-its-bad-for-feminism |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cycle, she explains, includes the use of the term "mansplaining" and other neologisms using "man" as a derogatory prefix.&lt;ref name="Young"/&gt; The term "mansplaining", according to feminist writer [[Rebecca Solnit]], was coined soon after the appearance in 2008 of her essay ''[[Men Explain Things to Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solnit|first1=Rebecca|title=Men Explain Things to Me|date=2014|publisher=Haymarket Books|location=Chicago IL|isbn=978-1-60846-457-9|chapter=1|quote=The term "mansplaining" was coined soon after the piece appeared, and I was sometimes credited with it. In fact, I had nothing to do with its actual creation, though my essay, along with all the men who embodied the idea, apparently inspired it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==
[[Men's rights movement|Men's rights]] activists and other [[masculinist]] groups have criticized modern laws concerning [[divorce]], [[domestic violence]], and [[Rape shield law|rape]] as examples of institutional misandry.{{refn|name=Ouellette}}&lt;ref name="AtlanticSexism"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Berlatsky |first1=Noah |title=When Men Experience Sexism |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/05/when-men-experience-sexism/276355/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly |accessdate=8 November 2018 |date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RavishlyMyth"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Thériault |first1=Anne |title=The Myth Of Misandry |url=https://ravishly.com/2015/01/07/myth-misandry-misogyny-oppression-marginalization |website=Ravishly Media Company |publisher=Ravishly.com |accessdate=8 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 488 college students regarding [[ambivalent sexism]] towards men, researchers found that women who did not identify as feminists were more likely to be hostile towards men than self-identified feminists, but also more likely to hold benevolent views towards men.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, K.J., Kanner, M. and Elsayegh, N. (2009), "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2009.01491.x/abstract Are Feminists Man Haters?

In a study of 503 self-identified heterosexual females, social psychologists found an association between [[Attachment theory#Attachment patterns|insecure attachment styles]] and women's hostile sexism towards men, while others dispute that feminism is build around misandry.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Hart, Peter Glick and Rachel E. Dinero, (2013), "She Loves Him, She Loves Him Not: Attachment Style as a Predictor of Women's Ambivalent Sexism Towards Men",  Psychology of Women Quarterly, Vol. 37: 507-517&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PsychologyPrejudiceDiscrimination"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kite |first1=Mary E. |last2=Whitley |first2=Bernard E. |title=Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |date=10 June 2016 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Chapter Four |isbn=9781317227236 |edition= First |url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781317227236 |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious studies professors [[Paul Nathanson]] and [[Katherine K. Young|Katherine Young]] examined the institutionalization of misandry in the public sphere in their 2001 three-book series ''Beyond the Fall of Man'',&lt;ref name="NYspreading-4_6"&gt;{{Harv|Nathanson|Young|2001|pp=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to misandry as a "form of prejudice and discrimination that has become institutionalized in North American society", writing, "The same problem that long prevented mutual respect between Jews and Christians, the teaching of contempt, now prevents mutual respect between men and women."&lt;ref name="NathansonSpreading"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nathanson |first1=Paul |last2=Young |first2=Katherine K. |title=Spreading misandry the teaching of contempt for men in popular culture |date=2001 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal, Que. |isbn=9780773569690 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIkNxlu8SOcC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6 |accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanford University]] Professor Philip Zimbardo writing for Psychology Today, argued that there was an empathy gap between young men and young women, with young women receiving more empathy and sympathy, and that young men were sometimes demonized and given conflicting messages about acceptable behavior and that this contributed to negative effects such as high young male suicide rates. The piece was part of a promotion for his book "Man, Interrupted: Why Young Men are Struggling &amp; What We Can Do About It".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Young Men and the Empathy Gap: Why we should be guiding, not demonizing our sons. |publisher=Psychology Today |author=Philip Zimbardo |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/hero/201708/young-men-and-the-empathy-gap |date=Aug 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government policy==
In November 2015, it was reported that the Canadian government was going to resettle thousands of Syrian refugees, but they would exclude single men. Only single women, families and unaccompanied minors would be taken in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''The Guardian''|author=Patrick Kingsley|date=Nov 25, 2015|title=Canada's exclusion of single male refugees may exacerbate Syrian conflict|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/canada-exclusion-refugees-single-syrian-men-assad-isis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada’s plan to accept refugees excludes single straight men|url=https://qz.com/558313/canadas-plan-to-accept-refugees-reportedly-excludes-single-men/|date=November 25, 2015|author=Hanna Kozlowska|website=www.qz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, an article on newsdeeply claimed that similar policies were still being carried out. The author went on the say that resettlement countries are acting on the bigoted stereotype of Arab men as dangerous potential terrorists, rather than as the vulnerable refugees and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsdeeply.com/refugees/community/2017/02/13/politics-of-fear-excludes-single-syrian-men-from-resettlement|title=Politics of Fear Excludes Single Syrian Men From Resettlement|author=Lewis Turner|website=www.newsdeeply.com|date=Feb 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymmetry with misogyny==
Sociologist Allan G. Johnson argues in ''[[The Gender Knot: Unraveling our Patriarchal Legacy]]''  that accusations of man-hating have been used to put down [[Feminism|feminists]] and to shift attention onto men, reinforcing a male-centered culture.&lt;ref name=Johnson107&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3nnxlqbN-IEC&amp;pg=PA107|page=107|title=The Gender Knot: Unraveling Our Patriarchal Legacy|edition= 2, revised|last=Johnson|first=Alan G.|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2005|isbn=1592133843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson asserts that culture offers no comparable anti-male ideology to [[misogyny]] and that "people often confuse men as individuals with men as a dominant and privileged category of people" and that "[given the] reality of women's oppression, male privilege, and men's enforcement of both, it's hardly surprising that ''every'' woman should have moments where she resents or even hates 'men'".

Marc A. Ouellette argues in ''International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities'' that "misandry lacks the systemic, transhistoric, institutionalized, and legislated antipathy of misogyny"; in his view, assuming a parallel between misogyny and misandry overly simplifies relations of gender and power.&lt;ref name="Ouellette"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ouellette |first=Marc |editor1=Flood, Michael |editor1-link=Michael Flood |display-editors=etal |title=International Encyclopedia of Men and Masculinities |chapter=Misandry |pages=442–3 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/International_Encyclopedia_of_Men_and_Ma.html?id=T54J3Q_VwnIC&amp;pg=PA442&amp;dq=misandry |date=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, UK; New York, N.Y. |isbn=978-0-415-33343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmore also argues that misogyny is a "near-universal phenomenon" and that there is no male equivalent to misogyny,&lt;ref name="gilmore"&gt;Gilmore, David G. ''Misogyny: The Male Malady''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2009, pp. 10–13, {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1770-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further defending manifestations of perceived misandry as not "hatred of men's traditional male role" and a "culture of machismo". He argues, misandry is "different from the intensely ''ad feminam'' aspect of misogyny that targets women no matter what they believe or do".&lt;ref name="gilmore"/&gt;

==In literature==
===Ancient Greek literature===

Classics professor [[Froma Zeitlin]] of [[Princeton University]] discussed misandry in her article titled "Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy".&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; She writes:
{{quote|The most significant point of contact, however, between Eteocles and the suppliant Danaids is, in fact, their extreme positions with regard to the opposite sex: the misogyny of Eteocles' outburst against all women of whatever variety (Se. 181-202) has its counterpart in the seeming misandry of the Danaids, who although opposed to their Egyptian cousins in particular (marriage with them is incestuous, they are violent men) often extend their objections to include the race of males as a whole and view their cause as a passionate contest between the sexes (cf. Su. 29, 393, 487, 818, 951).&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Froma I.|last=Zeitlin|title=Patterns of Gender in Aeschylean Drama: Seven against Thebes and the Danaid Trilogy|date=April 1, 1990|url=http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1008&amp;context=ucbclassics|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-21}} Princeton University, paper given at the Department of Classics, University of California, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Shakespeare ===

Literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] argued that even though the word misandry is relatively unheard of in literature it is not hard to find implicit, even explicit, misandry. In reference to the works of [[Shakespeare]] Bloom argued "I cannot think of one instance of misogyny whereas I would argue that misandry is a strong element. Shakespeare makes perfectly clear that women in general have to marry down and that men are narcissistic and not to be trusted and so forth. On the whole, he gives us a darker vision of human males than human females."&lt;ref&gt;Brockman, Elin Schoen. (25 July 1999) "In the Battle Of the Sexes, This Word Is a Weapon", New York Times,  https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/25/weekinreview/in-the-battle-of-the-sexes-this-word-is-a-weapon.html?module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern literature ===

[[Racialized]] misandry occurs in both "high" and "low" culture and literature. For instance, [[African-American]] men have often been disparagingly portrayed as either infantile or as eroticized and hyper-masculine, depending on prevailing cultural stereotypes.{{refn|name=Ouellette}}

Critic of mainstream feminism [[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has described [[Eve Ensler]]'s play ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'' as misandric in that "there are no admirable males&amp;nbsp;... the play presents a rogues’ gallery of male brutes, sadists, child-molesters, genital mutilators, gang rapists and hateful little boys" which she finds out of step with the reality that "most men are not brutes. They are not oppressors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/files/2008/11/19/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf What’s Wrong and What’s Right with Contemporary Feminism?, Hamilton College. Retrieved 2014-01-27.] Sommers, Christina Hoff. (2008), {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302081135/http://www.aei.org/files/2008/11/19/20090108_ContemporaryFeminism.pdf |date=2 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julie M. Thompson, a [[feminist]] author, connects misandry with envy of men, in particular "[[penis envy]]", a term coined by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1908, in his theory of female sexual development.&lt;ref&gt;
Emphasis added. Julie M. Thompson, ''Mommy Queerest: Contemporary Rhetorics of Lesbian Maternal Identity'', (Amherst: [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nancy Kang has discussed "the misandric impulse" in relation to the works of [[Toni Morrison]].&lt;ref&gt;Kang, N. (2003), [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/callaloo/v026/26.3kang.html "To Love and Be Loved: Considering Black Masculinity and the Misandric Impulse in Toni Morrison's "Beloved"], ''Callaloo'', Vol. 26, No. 3, pp. 836-854.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition'', [[Harry Brod]], a Professor of [[Philosophy]] and [[Humanities]] in the Department of Philosophy and [[Religion]] at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], writes:

{{quote|In the introduction to ''The Great Comic Book Heroes'', Jules Feiffer writes that this is Superman's joke on the rest of us. Clark is Superman's vision of what other men are really like. We are scared, incompetent, and powerless, particularly around women. Though Feiffer took the joke good-naturedly, a more cynical response would see here the Kryptonian's misanthropy, his misandry embodied in Clark and his misogyny in his wish that Lois be enamored of Clark (much like Oberon takes out hostility toward Titania by having her fall in love with an ass in Shakespeare's ''Midsummer-Night's Dream'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=SH8r3ntJG8AC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA279 ''Gender and Judaism: The Transformation of Tradition]'', Harry Brod&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Myopia Hunt Club''' is a [[foxhunting]] and private [[country club]] in the [[Northeastern United States|northeastern]] [[United States]], located in [[South Hamilton, Massachusetts]], northeast of [[Boston]]. In the early years of the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], the club hosted it four times: [[1898 U.S. Open (golf)|1898]], [[1901 U.S. Open (golf)|1901]], [[1905 U.S. Open (golf)|1905]], and [[1908 U.S. Open (golf)|1908]].

==History==
Myopia Hunt Club was founded {{Years or months ago|1882}} in 1882 by J. Murray Forbes. The golf course was designed and built by [[Herbert Leeds|Herbert C. Leeds]]&lt;ref name="Mass. Golf Association"&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Clubs: Myopia Hunt Club|url=http://members.mgalinks.org/clubs.asp?cmd=&amp;cid=777&amp;show=off|website=mgalinks.org|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1894 and he continued working at the Club for over 30 years.&lt;ref name="Myopia difficulty" /&gt; Leeds tied for seventh place in the [[1898 U.S. Open (golf)|1898 U.S. Open]] held at Myopia Hunt Club. His familiarity with the course was no doubt a factor in his ability to finish so high on the leaderboard in the tournament.&lt;ref name="Brenner"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Majors of Golf: Complete Results of the Open, the U.S. Open, the PGA Championship and the Masters, 1860-2008 |volume=1 |first=Morgan G. |last=Brenner |year=2009 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-3360-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Myopia" is due to some of its founding members having come from the [[Myopia Club]] in [[Winchester, Massachusetts]], which had been founded by four brothers with poor vision, or [[myopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Richard J. | last=Moss | title=Golf and the American country club | publisher=University of Illinois Press | year=2001 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Myopia Hunt Club is a [[drag hunt]], meaning that the [[Foxhounds|hounds]] follow a laid scent rather than live fox.

When completed, Myopia Hunt Club measured 6,539 yards and Leeds made certain that golfers would encounter a multitude of challenging features, including tall mounds, deep bunkers, lightning-fast greens, blind shots requiring substantial carry, deep swales, punishing rough, plateaued greens, as well as a pond and paddock to avoid.  So difficult was the course that in the [[1901 U.S. Open (golf)|1901 U.S. Open]] not a single professional was able to break 80 in any round.&lt;ref name="Myopia difficulty"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Labbance |first=Bob |title=Myopia Hunt Club |url=http://www.linksmagazine.com/golf_courses/myopia-hunt-club-south-hamilton-massachusetts |magazine=[[Links (magazine)|Links]] |accessdate=May 21, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521170533/http://www.linksmagazine.com/golf_courses/myopia-hunt-club-south-hamilton-massachusetts |archivedate=May 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polo==
Myopia also features one of the  oldest continually running polo fields in the nation. Gibney Field, formerly used  as a pasture, was mowed and used for practice in the summer of 1888. That fall, Myopia held its first official match against the Dedham Polo and Country Club.&lt;ref&gt;Sport in Norfolk County by Allan Forbes. Houghton Mifflin, Boston. 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Polo by Newell Bent. The MacMillan Company, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Myopia became one of seven charter members of the Polo Association, now the [[United States Polo Association]]. Of those seven original clubs, Myopia is one of two still in existence; Meadowbrook on [[Long Island, New York|Long Island]] is the other. It is the only one that still uses its original field.&lt;ref&gt;United States Polo Association Blue Book, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibney Field is not, however, the oldest continuously used polo field in the nation. That honor goes to [[Aiken Polo Club]]'s Whitney Field—in [[Aiken, South Carolina]]—which was first used for polo in a gala exhibition match in 1882. Aiken Polo Club joined the Polo Association in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;Life and Sport in Aiken, by Harry Worcester Smith. Derrydale Press, New York. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United States Polo Association Blue Book, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Polo is still played at Myopia throughout the summer season, from Memorial Day until Columbus Day. Sunday afternoon games at 3 p.m. are open to the public for a small fee. In 1902 a [[real tennis]] court was opened at the Myopia Hunt Club, but has since been converted to other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uscourttennis.com/Danzig.html| title=The Royal &amp; Ancient Game of Tennis| author=Allison Danzig| accessdate=April 24, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214224631/http://www.uscourttennis.com/Danzig.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Golf==
Myopia Hunt Club is the only course in the United States to have been listed by ''[[Golf Magazine]]'' as having two of the United States's top 100 signature holes, Myopia's fourth and ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.golfcourse.com/search/coursedtl_ga.cfm?clubid=1409&amp;courseid=1415&amp;source=GA&amp;start=1&amp;count=10&amp;sort=clubname&amp;usstate=MA| title=Myopia Hunt Club| author=Golf Online| accessdate=April 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] was held at the Club in 1898, 1901, 1905, and 1908. The 72-hole winning score in 1901 by [[Willie Anderson (golfer)|Willie Anderson]], one of only four four-time champions, was 331, a record high that still stands today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://golf.about.com/cs/historyofgolf/a/usopenrecords_3.htm| title=U.S. Open Records| accessdate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defeated [[Alex Smith (golfer)|Alex Smith]] in an 18-hole playoff, 85 to 86, his highest 18-hole score of the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://usga.usopen.com/2009/history/pastchamps/1901.html| title=The Official Site of the U.S. Open| accessdate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.golfclubatlas.com/myopiahunt1.html| title=Myopia Hunt Club, MA, USA| author=GolfClubAtlas.com| accessdate=April 24, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060310225950/http://www.golfclubatlas.com/myopiahunt1.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first nine was completed in 1896, but the second nine was not finished until 1901, so the 1898 U.S. Open was actually played over eight rounds of nine holes.&lt;br&gt;

===Myopia Hunt Club scorecard===
[[File:Myopia-Hunt-Club-Scorecard.JPG|none]]
From 1995–2005, the course underwent a series of major improvements under the leadership of Club president Michael Greene. Greene, along with Captain of Golf Steve Warhover (and with the consent of the voting members of the Club), lengthened the course with several new tees. These were installed on the 2nd, 4th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 15th, and 18th holes. In addition, many trees throughout the course were removed and replaced with traditional mounds, better fitting the historic design of Herbert Corey Leeds.

Myopia Hunt Club was the home course of the late novelist and golf writer [[John Updike]].&lt;ref&gt;John Updike, "The Yankee Golfer," ''Golf Dreams'' (N.Y., Knopf, 1996), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The holes on the course are all named on the scorecard, with most of the names pertaining to a geographic signifier on a particular hole:

{{orphan|date=June 2010}}

'''Nicholas Bain''' (1824{{spaced ndash}}December 15, 1854), also known as '''Beheehan''' or '''Behan''',&lt;ref name="wickham" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=True Crime On The North Fork: The Wickham Axe Murders|url=http://www.27east.com/news/article_print.cfm/news/article_print.cfm?id=388814|work=27east|date=Jun 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American farmworker who murdered three people on Long Island in 1854, a crime that gained much notoriety.&lt;ref name=brosky/&gt;  The author [[Charles Dickens]] commented on this crime in his ''Household Narrative of Current Events'' periodical.

In May 1854, Bain had been working for James and Francis Wickham on their farm near [[Cutchogue, New York]] for the past two years.&lt;ref name="wickham" /&gt; Bain asked Ellen Holland, a female servant at the farm, to marry him, but she rejected his proposal.  An enraged Bain then threatened her.  Holland later discovered that Bain had stolen $10 from her room and she complained to James Wickham.  He fired Bain on June 1, 1854.&lt;ref name="dickens"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Charles Dickens|title=The Household narrative of current events|year=1854|pages=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around midnight that same day, Bain murdered the Wickhams and Stephen Winston, a young servant boy, at the house with an axe.&lt;ref name="wickham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/06/07/97114360.pdf|title=The Wickham Murder - Confession of Nicholas Beheehan|date=June 7, 1854|work=New York Times|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bain first killed the boy downstairs while he slept, then murdered the couple in their bedroom after a violent struggle.  Bain later said that his intent was to rape Holland and then kill the two owners out of revenge.  However, Holland and another servant girl had fled the house to get help.  Authorities quickly identified Bain as the killer because he left his hat and distinctively large bloody footprints at the murder scene.&lt;ref name=brosky&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brosky|first1=Kerriann Flanagan|title=The Wickham Murders of 1854|url=http://patch.com/new-york/huntington/bp--the-wickham-murders-of-1854|website=Patch.com|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his confession, Bain's plan after the murders was to take the ferry that day from [[Long Island]] to [[New London, CT]] and then catch a train to New York City. However, a crowd near the dock made him fear capture.  His next plan was to take a train on Long Island to New York, but he was unable to hop onto a [[box car]].  Desperate at this point, Bain went into a swamp to hide. That evening he went to the house of a fellow Irishman in the area to get food, but the man attempted to detain Bain. However, Bain escaped and ran back into the woods.&lt;ref name="hunt" /&gt;

On June 6, after an extensive manhunt with 1,000 searchers from towns all around [[Suffolk County, New York]], Bain was found and arrested in the woods near Cutchogue. Sheriff's deputies had to draw their weapons to prevent an angry crowd from immediately [[lynching]] him.  While receiving medical treatment for a wound, Bain confessed to all three murders.&lt;ref name="hunt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1854/06/06/75433627.pdf|title=The Long-Island Murder - The Woods Searched by the Populace|date=June 6, 1854|work=New York Times|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later convicted and then hanged on December 15, 1854.

A '''novelty item''' is an object which is specifically designed to serve no practical purpose, and is sold for its uniqueness, humor, or simply as something new (hence "[[novelty]]", or newness). The term also applies to practical items with fanciful or nonfunctional additions, such as novelty [[slipper]]s. The term is normally applied to small objects, and is generally not used to describe larger items such as [[roadside attraction]]s. Items may have an [[advertising]] or promotional purpose, or be a [[souvenir]].

==Usage==
This term covers a range of small manufactured goods, such as  [[collectable]]s, [[gadget]]s and [[executive toy]]s. Novelty items are generally devices that do not primarily have a practical function. [[Toy]]s for adults are often classed as novelties. Some products have a brief period as a novelty item when they are actually new, only to become an established, commonly used product, such as the [[Hula Hoop]] or the [[Frisbee]].

Others may have an educational element, such as [[Crooke's radiometer]], [[Newton's cradle]] or the [[drinking bird]], often popular as an [[Office toy|executive toy]].  [[Sex toys]] are often described as novelty items (varying from this definition, as they do serve a practical purpose), and some products sold in [[sex shops]] may not have any practical sexual function, if operating primarily as a humorous gift, such as [[sex dice]]. Some food products may be considered novelty items, especially when first introduced, such as [[deep-fried Mars bar]]s.

== History ==
[[File:Pet rock.jpg|thumb|[[Pet rock]]s with [[googly eyes]], popular from c. 1970s]]
The [[France|French]] mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre Hérigone]] (1580–1643) describes a novelty item that was a [[camera obscura]] in the form of a [[goblet]].   Hérigone's device was constructed so that the user could spy on others while taking a drink.  Its 45-degree mirror had a stylized opening for the lens and the lid bore a magnifying lens at the top.

[[Lenticular printing]] was developed in the 1940s, and is used extensively in the production of novelty items. [[Paper clothing]], which has some practical purpose, was briefly novel in the United States in the 1960s.
One of the more popular novelty items in recent history was the singing [[Big Mouth Billy Bass]], manufactured by [[Gemmy Industries]]. It is estimated that over 20 million original pieces were sold in 12 months during 2000 and 2001.

[[File:Penrosetrianglemodel.jpg|thumb|A [[3D printing|3D printed]] [[Penrose triangle]]]]
Novelty items based on mathematical objects, such as [[Klein bottle]]s and [[Penrose triangle]]s, have been manufactured.  Models of [[Möbius strip]]s are sometimes made in place of regular bands, such as rings.

'''The Offences against the Person Act 1861''' (24 &amp; 25 Vict c 100) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. It consolidated provisions related to [[offences against the person]] (an expression, which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier [[statutes]] into a single Act. For the most part these provisions were, according to the draftsman of the Act,&lt;ref&gt;Greaves. The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts (1861) pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated with little or no variation in their phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the [[criminal law consolidation Acts 1861]]. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It is essentially a revised version of an earlier consolidation Act, the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] (and the equivalent Irish Act), incorporating subsequent statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, James Edward. The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 &amp; 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100. Butterworths. 1861. Pages vi and vii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HMw0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR6&amp;output=html Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it has been substantially amended, it continues to be the foundation for prosecuting personal injury, short of murder, in the courts of [[England and Wales]]. The Act was also adopted in British possessions. For example, New Zealand adopted the Act in 1866.

In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, the sexual offences under the Act have all been repealed. For legislation referring to sexual offences, see the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] and the [[Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008]]. In Northern Ireland, the 1861 Act continues to be the basis of a ban on abortion.

==Commentary==
The Act as originally drafted listed specific methods whereby harm might be caused. For example, section 18 originally included an offence of shooting which could be committed with any of the specified intents. Sections 11 to 15 specified various means by which a person might attempt to commit murder.

In some cases, these reflected political issues then of great significance. For example, the [[Fenian]]s were promoting their political case by leaving barrels of explosives in public places.{{Citation needed|reason=Who says that this is the historical cause of the enactment of these provisions|date=October 2013}} Hence, sections 28 to 30 and 64 specifically address the problem, whether injury results or not. Similarly, children were throwing stones at passing railway trains,{{Citation needed|reason=Again, who says this is the cause|date=October 2013}} and these provisions remain in force.

As originally enacted, the Act had 79 sections. In [[England and Wales]], 37 sections remain in force, namely sections 4, 5, 9, 10, 16 to 18, 20 to 38, 44, 45, 47, 57 to 60, 64, 65, 68 and 78. Of those, only sections 25, 34 to 36 and 78 have not been either partially repealed or otherwise amended. Different subsets of its provisions remain in force in [[Northern Ireland]] and in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==Dangerous offenders==

See the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003#Dangerous offenders|Criminal Justice Act 2003]] for further provisions about sentencing for manslaughter and for offences under sections 4 and 16 to 47 of this Act.

==Homicide==

===Sections 1 to 3 – Murder===

Sections 1 to 3 dealt with the death penalty for [[Murder in English law|murder]] and have been repealed.

In the Republic of Ireland, the references to murder in these sections were changed to references to [[capital murder]] by section 15 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1964/en/act/pub/0005/sec0005.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were repealed by section 9(1) of, and the second schedule to, the [[Criminal Justice Act 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/sec0009.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/gen_2.html] |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211085754/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/gen_2.html |archivedate=11 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; But the repeal of section 1 did not affect the operation of sections 64 to 68.(s.9(2))

====Section 1 – Penalty for murder====

This section replaced the corresponding provision in section 3 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]] (9 Geo 4 c 31) and section 4 of the corresponding Irish Act (10 Geo 4 c 34).

====Section 3 – Disposal of body====

This section provided that the body of every person executed for murder was to be buried within the precincts of the last prison in which he had been confined, and that his sentence was to direct that this should happen. It replaced the corresponding provision in section 16 of the [[Anatomy Act 1832]] (as amended by section 1 of the next mentioned Act) and replaced section 2 of the [[Hanging in Chains Act 1834]] (4 &amp; 5 Will 4 c 26).

===Section 4===

The penalty for offences under this section was increased by article 5(1) of the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977]],&lt;ref&gt;S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16)&lt;/ref&gt; but not in relation to offences "committed before the commencement" of that order (art.5(3)).

====Soliciting to murder====

This section creates the offence of [[soliciting to murder]].

====Conspiracy to murder====
This section creates the offence of [[conspiracy to murder]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].

The repeal of as much of this section as related to the offence of conspiracy to murder for [[England and Wales]] was consequential on the codification of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] by Part I of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]]. The effect of this section, in relation to conspiracy to commit murder abroad, was preserved by section 1(4) of that Act.

The repeal of as much of this section as related to the offence of conspiracy to murder for [[Northern Ireland]] was consequential on the codification of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] by Part IV of the [[Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983]] (S.I. 1983/1120 (N.I. 13)).

===Section 5 – Manslaughter===
This section now provides that a person convicted of [[manslaughter|manslaughter in English law]] is liable to [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|imprisonment for life]] or for any shorter term.

In [[England and Wales]] it now reads:

{{Blockquote|Whosoever shall be convicted of manslaughter shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be kept in [[penal servitude]] for life ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/5|title=Offences Against the Person Act 1861|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Repeals====

The words "or to pay" to the end were repealed by Part I of [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/11-12/58/schedule/TENTH/enacted Tenth Schedule] to the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]]. The other words were repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1892]].

===="Penal servitude for life"====

This means imprisonment for life: See section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1948]] and section 1(2) of the [[Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953]] and [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0014/sec0011.html#sec11 section 11(2)] of the [[Criminal Law Act, 1997]].

===Other matters===

Sections 6 to 8 have been repealed.  They respectively dealt with the form of the indictment for murder and manslaughter, with excusable homicide and with petty treason.

Section 6 replaced section 4 of the [[Criminal Procedure Act 1851]] (14 &amp; 15 Vict c 100). This section was repealed&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1924]], section 16(1) [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1924/en/act/pub/0044/sec0016.html] and the second schedule [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1924/en/act/pub/0044/gen_3.html#gen_3]&lt;/ref&gt; for the Republic of Ireland on 22 August 1924.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Justice Administration Order, 1924]], section (1) {{cite web |url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1924/en/si/v8pg1259.html] |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127035032/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1924/en/si/v8pg1259.html |archivedate=27 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 7 replaced section 10 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]].

Section 8 replaced section 2 of the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1828]].

===Sections 9 and 10: Jurisdiction===

Murder or manslaughter abroad. Section 9 gives the courts in England, Wales and Ireland [[extra-territorial jurisdiction]] over homicides committed by British subjects overseas. (Note however the restricted definition of "subject" under section 3 of the [[British Nationality Act 1948#The Act today|British Nationality Act 1948]].) Section 10 gives these courts jurisdiction over fatal acts committed by British subjects overseas where the death occurs in England, Wales or Ireland, and jurisdiction over fatal acts committed in England, Wales or Ireland by anyone, including aliens, where the death occurs abroad. (The word "criminally" in that section has been held to exclude fatal acts done by aliens overseas although the death occurs in England, Wales or Ireland, since such acts are not punishable under the criminal law.)

{{quote|9. Where any murder or manslaughter shall be committed on land out of the United Kingdom, whether within the Queen's dominions or without, and whether the person killed were a subject of Her Majesty or not, every offence committed by any subject of Her Majesty in respect of any such case, whether the same shall amount to the offence of murder or of manslaughter, ... may be dealt with, inquired of, tried, determined, and punished ... in England or Ireland; Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent any person from being tried in any place out of England or Ireland for any murder or manslaughter committed out of England or Ireland in the same manner as such person might have been tried before the passing of this Act.

10. Where any person being [criminally] stricken, poisoned, or otherwise hurt upon the sea, or at any place out of England or Ireland, shall die of such stroke, poisoning, or hurt in England or Ireland, or, being [criminally] stricken, poisoned, or otherwise hurt in any place in England or Ireland, shall die of such stroke, poisoning, or hurt upon the sea, or at any place out of England or Ireland, every offence committed in respect of any such case, whether the same shall amount to the offence of murder or of manslaughter, may be tried ... in England.}}

Sections 9 and 10 respectively replace sections 7 and 8 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1828]]. Section 10 was first enacted in 1728/29 by ''[[Murder Act 1728|2 Geo 2 c 21]]''.

==Attempts to murder==
Sections 11 to 15 dealt with attempts to murder and have been repealed.  See now the [[Criminal Attempts Act 1981]].

'''Section 11 – Administering poison or wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder'''

This section replaced section 2 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1837]] (7 Will 4 &amp; 1 Vict c 85).

'''Section 12 – Destroying or damaging a building with gunpowder with intent to murder'''

This section replaced section 2 of the [[Arson Act 1846]] (9 &amp; 10 Vict c 25) (Malicious injuries by fire)

'''Section 13 – Setting fire to or casting away a ship with intent to murder'''

'''Section 14 – Attempting to administer poison, or shooting or attempting to shoot, or attempting to drown, suffocate or strangle with intent to murder'''

This section replaced section 3 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1837]].

'''Section 15 – Attempting to commit murder by any other means'''

==Threats to kill==

'''Section 16'''

The making of a threat to kill is an offence wherein the defendant intends the victim to fear it will be carried out. It is immaterial whether it is premeditated or said in anger.

Although the normal maximum sentence is ten years, offenders deemed to present a "significant risk" of "serious harm" to the public can now receive a life sentence under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

Other threats of violence may be prosecuted summarily under section 4 of the [[Public Order Act 1986]].

This section, as originally enacted, replaced the offence of sending, delivering or uttering a letter or writing threatening to kill or murder under section 1 of the 10 &amp; 11 Vict c 66 (1847); the other offences under that section being consolidated elsewhere.

In Northern Ireland, this section was substituted by article 4 of the [[Criminal Law (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977]] (S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16)).

In the Republic of Ireland, this section has been repealed and replaced by section 5 of the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]].

==Bodily harm==
In the Republic of Ireland, sections 16 to 26 and 28 to 34 of this Act were repealed by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the [[Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997]]

'''Section 17 – Impeding a person endeavouring to save himself or another from shipwreck'''

Shipping was the lifeblood of the Empire, thus, specific offences to protect seamen were common.

'''Wounding and grievous bodily harm'''

The offences under sections 18 and 20 of this Act are discussed in detail in the article [[grievous bodily harm]].

===Section 18===

This section creates the offences of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, or to resist arrest. It is punishable with life imprisonment.

::"18. Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously by any means whatsoever wound or cause any grievous bodily harm to any person ... with intent ... to do some ... grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist or prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of any person, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable ... to be kept in penal servitude for life ..."

This section replaces section 4 of the [[Offences against the Person Act 1837]].

Charges under this section are, under CPS guidance, reserved for crimes with very high intent which cause serious (potentially life-threatening harm) or showed malicious intent and caused really serious life-threatening or life-altering harm. The former offences under this section of shooting and attempting to shoot with intent have been repealed.  It is also no longer possible to charge the remaining offences of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm as having been committed with intent to maim, disfigure or disable as the relevant words have been repealed.

'''Section 19'''

This section defined the expression "loaded arms". The repeal of this section was consequential on the repeal of the offences of shooting and attempting to shoot with intent under sections 14 and 18 above.

===Section 20===

This section creates the offences of wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The CPS guidance prefers this section to be used instead of section 18 when the harm done was more consequential rather than intentional, and/or the wounding was less serious. These are therefore less serious than the offences created by section 18 and carry a maximum prison sentence of 5 years.

:"Inflicting bodily injury, with or without weapon
:20. Whosoever shall unlawfully and maliciously wound or inflict any grievous bodily harm upon any other person, either with or without any weapon or instrument, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, being convicted thereof shall be liable ... to be kept in penal servitude ..."

This section replaces section 4 of the [[Prevention of Offences Act 1851]] (14 &amp; 15 Vict c 19). The offence of wounding either with or without a weapon or instrument under this section replaces the offence of stabbing, cutting or wounding under that section.

'''Garrotting, etc. – Administering chloroform, etc.'''

Sections 21 and 22: Attempting to choke, &amp;c., to commit or assist in the committing of any indictable offence. Certain forms of attack have always been viewed with particular horror and the use of strangulation or drugs to render someone unconscious with a view to committing a crime require special treatment. Contemporary crime including [[date rape]] following the use of hypnotic drugs such as [[Flunitrazepam]] show that little has changed save that where the intended offence is of a sexual nature, separate legislation applies (see [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]).

Section 22 replaces section 3 of the [[Prevention of Offences Act 1851]].

'''Poisoning'''

Sections 23 and 24 cover the insidious forms of attack based on administering poisons or other dangerous chemicals and substances intending to injure another. Although rarely used today, the offences remain available should the specific circumstances arise, e.g. sending a package containing a dangerous substance to an embassy.

Section 25 permits a jury to find a person charged with an offence under section 23 guilty of an offence under 24.

Sections 23 to 25 respectively replace sections 1 to 3 of the 23 &amp; 24 Vict c 8 (1860) (unlawful administering of poison).

'''Section 26 – Neglecting or causing bodily harm to servants'''

This section deals with the problem of neglect by an employer who failed to provide adequate food, clothing and accommodation for staff and servants. It is punishable on conviction on indictment with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

This section replaces section 1 of the [[Poor Law (Apprentices, &amp;c.) Act 1851]] (14 &amp; 15 Vict c 11).

The offence of assault under that section has been replaced by one of doing or causing bodily harm.

See also the summary offence under section 6 of the [[Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875]] which could be committed by neglecting to provide medical aid.

'''Section 27 – Abandoning or exposing a child under the age of two'''

The offence is in practice obsolete, as it has been superseded by the offence of ''cruelty to persons under sixteen'' under section 1 of the [[Children and Young Persons Act 1933]].  The exception to this is that it can be committed by a person who does not have responsibility for the child within the meaning of the 1933 Act (assuming that such a person can ''unlawfully'' abandon or expose a child), and also by a person who is under sixteen.

'''Explosives, etc.'''

Sections 28, 29, 30, and 64 created a range of criminal offences supplementing the [[Explosive Substances Act 1883]] and the [[Explosives Act 1875]]. These remain in force, although the [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]] covers all aspects of the resulting damage to property and the [[Terrorism Act 2000]] deals with possession for terrorist purposes.

Section 28 replaces section 3 of the [[Arson Act 1846]] (malicious injuries by fire).

Section 29 replaces section 4 of the [[Arson Act 1846]].

Section 30 replaces the corresponding offence under section 6 of that Act; the other offences under that section being consolidated elsewhere.

'''Section 31 – Setting spring guns with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm'''

This section addresses the problem of those who wish to protect their property with hidden traps.

This section replaces sections 1 to 4 of the 7 &amp; 8 Geo 4 c 18 (1827) (An Act to prohibit the setting of spring guns, mantraps and other engines calculated to destroy human life or inflict grievous bodily harm).

'''Causing danger on railways'''

Sections 32 to 34 protect the railways from those who place obstructions on the line, throw stones at the passing trains, and generally endanger the passengers.

Section 32 replaced the offence of attempting to endanger the safety of passengers under section 6 of the [[Prevention of Offences Act 1851]]; the other offence being consolidated elsewhere.

Section 33 replaced section 7 of that Act.

===Section 35 – Drivers of carriages injuring persons by furious driving===
In England and Wales and Northern Ireland this section creates the offence of [[causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving]]. It is repealed in the Republic of Ireland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">'''Open Water Wisdom''' is a community water activity safety program that was spearheaded by The [[Royal Life Saving Society of Canada]] and The [[Canadian Red Cross]]. It is dedicated to bringing awareness to recreational water safety issues nationally and in hundreds of remote communities across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.ca/article.asp?id=43714&amp;tid=025 "Keeping Communities Safe,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130115200801/http://www.redcross.ca/article.asp?id=43714&amp;tid=025 |date=January 15, 2013 }} as published in a press release by The Canadian Red Cross, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nunavutecho.ca/en/health-news/item/4992-open-water-wisdom "Take part in the Open Water Wisdom Campaign,"] as published in The Nunavut Echo, July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Children and youth are at higher risk for water injury and [[drowning]], most especially in Canada’s remote northern, rural, [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] and coastal communities. This is partly because many of Canada’s communities sit next to open water and at most times of the year the water is cold. There are also indications that several cultural issues can contribute to higher drowning rates in some parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Dangerous+waters/7142464/story.html "Dangerous Waters,"] by Michelle Zilio as published in the Ottawa Citizen, August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Lifesaving Canada and The Canadian Red Cross were given funding by The [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] in support of the Open Water Wisdom initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ottawacitizen.com/sports/Federal+government+announces+funding+prevent+sport/7646126/story.html "Federal government announces funding to prevent sport, recreation injuries,"] as published in the Ottawa Citizen, December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the campaign released several national radio Public Service Announcements about how to stay safe around open water during summer months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openwaterwisdom.ca/media/open-water-wisdom-campaign-releases-new-radio-public-service-announcement-on-respecting-the-power-of-nature "OPEN WATER WISDOM CAMPAIGN RELEASES NEW RADIO PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON RESPECTING THE POWER OF NATURE,"] by Open Water Wisdom, October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openwaterwisdom.ca/media/new-radio-public-service-announcement-on-importance-of-open-water-safety-in-sports-and-recreation "NEW RADIO PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON IMPORTANCE OF OPEN WATER SAFETY IN SPORTS AND RECREATION,"] by Open Water Wisdom, October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openwaterwisdom.ca/media/open-water-wisdom-campaign-releases-new-radio-public-service-announcement-on-lifejacket-use-this-fall "OPEN WATER WISDOM CAMPAIGN RELEASES NEW RADIO PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON LIFEJACKET USE THIS FALL,"] by Open Water Wisdom, October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openwaterwisdom.ca/media/open-water-wisdom-campaign-releases-new-radio-public-service-announcement-on-cold-water "OPEN WATER WISDOM CAMPAIGN RELEASES NEW RADIO PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT ON COLD WATER,"] by Open Water Wisdom, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

The campaign has targeted over 250 communities across the country, with a special focus on youth 19 years of age or younger. Open Water Wisdomʼs activities are rooted in providing local community champions with [[lifejacket]]s and resource training kits about cold water safety issues. Local champions provide water activity safety training to their communities based on the materials and resources supplied to participating communities. The official objectives of the campaign are to:

* Reduce water related incidents and drowning rates and increase lifejacket usage among children and youth;
* Increase public awareness of risks and actions needed to prevent injury and death through drowning;
* Influence children and youth, families and communities to adopt behavior and practices that increase their safety in, on and around the water while participating in [[recreation]], [[sport]] and play activities;
* Engage communities and build capacity to sustain and facilitate ongoing access to education materials and lifejackets;
* Provide resources for children and youth, families, communities and professionals to prevent injury and drowning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openwaterwisdom.ca/about-water-wisdom "About Open Water Wisdom,"] as posted by Open Water Wisdom&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ozone Park Boys''', also known as "Liberty Posse" and "The Young Guns" are a [[Gambino crime family]] [[American Mafia|Mafia]] crew based in [[Ozone Park, Queens]]. They are infamous for their massive number of crimes, including an illegal $30 million-a-year sports gambling enterprise.

==Members==
[[Ronnie Trucchio|Ronald Trucchio]], nicknamed "Ronnie One-Arm" due to a childhood accident that left him unable to use his right arm, is the ''[[Caporegime]]'' of the crew. He identified potential victims and helped plan crimes. He also acted as an intermediary with other organized crime interests. Barry Burke,also known as "The Mic" a Whitestone Queens native and a known captain of the crew, played a significant role in organizing and enforcing rackets in both Boston and South Boston and even as far north as Maine. Along with Burke, Kevin "Capone" Antinuche are currently the alleged crew leaders.

Other notable members include Robert "Bucks" Bucholz, Peter "Bud" Zuccaro, Joey Carr, Frank Roccaforte, Joseph Kondrotos, Valentino Nucci, Darrin Sirrota, James "Jimmy" Unknown, Dave Prevete,Todd Patrick Mitchell,Dave 'Three Fingers' Lortal, Seb 'Fringe' Latour and Edward "Eddie Wrecker" Callegari,  and Alexander "Youngblood" Colon

==Criminal history==
Since as early as 1986, this crew has been responsible for auto theft and "chop shop" operations, book making, racketeering, murder, robbery, arms trafficking, arson, assault, bank robbery, extortion, kidnapping, drug trafficking, tampering with witnesses, retaliating against witnesses, credit card fraud, identity theft, illegal gambling, interstate travel in aid of racketeering activities, interference with commerce by threats and violence, interstate transportation of stolen property, insurance fraud, mail fraud, tax evasion, wire fraud, and thefts from interstate shipments.

They organized theft of automobile and automobile parts throughout the New York metropolitan area. "The crew members stole specific cars and car parts on order and dismantled the stolen cars in several chop shops in the New York area", the government said, adding that the group also used the shops to facilitate credit card fraud, insurance fraud and robbery conspiracy.

Crew members stole credit cards and account information from the U.S. mail and thereafter purchased consumer goods from merchants in New York and Florida. "The crew participated in violent armed robberies of businesses and individuals during which victims were kidnapped and assaulted", the government alleged.

Members of the criminal crew traveled from New York to South Florida to commit robberies and traffic drugs, as well as perform credit card fraud and illegal weapons sales. In 1999 Damian Ely Bachovacchi was sentenced to five years for interstate drug trafficking, weapons possession and witness tampering. He was released on parole after serving only thirty-four months leading many to believe that Bachovacchi had an "inside man", but such rumors dissipated once it became apparent that the government was still attempting to find evidence on him. Although he was quickly released, the government has tried many attempts to indict him, none being successful. In 2004 the Federal government had a sealed indictment for Bachovacchi which was never handed down due to a "sudden" disappearance of suspects. To this day literally hundreds of files that are linked to The Ozone Park Boys / Young guns  remain unsolved. The government also said the crew transported stolen property from Florida to New York and also engaged in numerous armed bank robberies in the New York area.

In 1995, nightclub bouncer Vincent D'Angola and his massage-therapist girlfriend, Jamie Schneider, were found dead in D'Angola's Fort Lauderdale apartment. The next day, the bullet-riddled body of Little League coach Mark Rizzuto was found in Boca Raton. Federal and local authorities have linked the crew to these three unsolved South Florida murders.

''"The Trucchio organization"'' operated two separate wirerooms, first in the basement of an attached, one-family house at 149-29 122nd Street and thereafter in a third-floor apartment at 89-07 North Conduit Avenue, both in Ozone Park .

The crew has been in operation for over two decades.

==Conviction==
In December 2000, Trucchio and his son, Alphonse, were arrested along with most of the crew for operating a $30 million-a-year sports gambling enterprise in Ozone Park. Trucchio was also charged with failing to file New York State tax returns for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001.

Roccaforte allegedly was the clerk in the gambling operation who answered phones at the wirerooms, recorded wagers called in by bettors and recorded those wagers on tally sheets.

In July 2004, a new [[indictment]] was instated against the mobsters, claiming that while behind bars in prison, they made weapons and planned to attack people at a court hearing. They also claimed that the mobsters planned hits on several prosecutors and witnesses against them.

In 2006, Ronald Trucchio was sentenced to life in prison.

In 2017, former Ozone Park Boys leader Gennaro "Jerry" Bruno was sentenced to 21 years in prison for murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reputed Gambino mobster Gennaro (Jerry) Bruno gets 21 years in prison for hit on urinating drug dealer|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/reputed-gambino-mobster-21-years-prison-hit-dealer-article-1.2627829|website=The New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peasant economics''' is an area of economics in which a wide variety of economic approaches ranging from the neoclassical to the marxist are used to examine the [[political  economy]] of the [[peasantry]].  The defining feature of the peasants are that they are typically seen to be only partly integrated into the [[market economy]] - an economy which, in societies with a significant peasant population, is typically found to have many imperfect, incomplete or missing markets. Peasant economics treats peasants as something different from other farmers as they are not assumed to be simply  small profit maximizing farmers; by contrast, peasant economics covers a wide range of different theories  of peasant  household  behavior. These include various assumptions about the maximization of profits,  [[risk aversion]],  [[drudgery  aversion]], and [[sharecropping]]. The assumptions,  logic,  and  predictions of these theories are examined and the impact of  subsistence is typically found to have important implications in terms of producers  decisions about supply, consumption and price. [[Alexander Chayanov|Chayanov]] was an early proponent of the importance of understanding peasant behaviour arguing that peasants would work as hard as they needed in order to meet their subsistence needs, but had no incentive beyond those needs and therefore would slow and stop working once they were met. This principle, the consumption-labour-balance principle, implies that the peasant household will increase its work until it meets (balances) the needs (consumption) of the household. A possible implication of this view of peasant societies is that they will not develop without some external, added factor. Peasant economics has been seen as being an important area of study by some development economists, agricultural sociologists, and anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Frank (1988) ''Peasant Economics: Farm Households and Agrarian Development''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12172">Over the last few decades, '''pet ownership in Japan''' has gradually moved from a predominantly [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] function to a concept that more fully incorporates pets into the family system. In the minority of cases, pets are now considered to be family members. To many [[Japanese people|Japanese]], pets are as well loved as children, and may even serve as a substitute for those who choose to forgo [[Parenting|child-rearing]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/jun/08/why-japan-prefers-pets-to-parenthood Why Japan prefers pets to parenthood | Life and style]. theguardian.com.

==Spiritual hierarchy==

In the context of [[Ascended master|spiritual hierarchy]], pets occupy the space directly below humans, but above all other animals and forms of life.&lt;ref name="Ambros"&gt;Ambros, B. (2010). The Necrogeography of Pet Memorial Spaces: Pets as Liminal Family Members in Contemporary Japan. Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief, 6(3). 304-335. [DOI: 10.2752/175183410X12862096296801]&lt;/ref&gt; This position is not clearly defined, leaving many aspects of pet ownership open to interpretation, including the practice of keeping and caring for pets, as well as the correct means of caring for them after death. This position within the family is presented through various forms within the everyday flow of contemporary life, spiritual expression, [[memorialization]], and [[Funeral|burial rites]] of Japanese pets.

==Pet boom==

Pets have been increasing in numbers throughout Japan. Providing a convenient way for companionship without having the demands that a child would, pets are a popular alternative for people who do not have the time required to raise a baby. Although it is not by any means definitive, studies reflect a trend showing that [[Pet adoption|adopting pets]] into the family in lieu of children has become increasingly common.  Currently, “estimates place the number of pets above the number of children under the age of fifteen.”&lt;ref name="Ambros"/&gt; 

The Japanese “pet boom” can be traced back to 2003 where it was estimated that the combined number of [[Dog|dogs]] and [[Cat|cats]] in Japan have outnumbered the number of children.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael. (2011-07-17) [http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2011/07/17/national/it-seems-japan-has-literally-gone-to-the-dogs/#.UUhzHleyKF8 It seems Japan has literally gone to the dogs]. The Japan Times. Retrieved on 2014-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated number of pets and children under 16 in Japan was 19.2 and 17.9 million respectively in 2003, and 23.2 million to 17 million in 2009.

==Pets in everyday life==

Although Japan’s crowded environment makes for a not so pet-friendly country, Japanese have found ways to incorporate their pets into their everyday lives. One method is to choose small [[Dog breed|dog breeds]] as their companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/28/business/28dogs.html|title=Japan, Home of the Cute and Inbred Dog|first=Martin|last=Fackler|date=28 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common dog breeds for Japanese families are [[Chihuahua (dog)|chihuahuas]], [[Miniature Dachshund|miniature dachshunds]], and [[Poodle|toy poodles]]. The most common reason for choosing small breed dogs are the lack of space, and easier cleaning.

Although small dogs are preferred, one of the most popular dog breeds in Japan is the [[Shiba Inu]], which can grow to be two feet tall and weigh up to 25 pounds. Some Japanese prefer the Shiba Inu because they are family-friendly and have a lifespan of up to 15 years, making the Shiba Inu a long-lived companion. The Japanese also have an even larger breed unique to Japan, the [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], popularized by the story of [[Hachikō]].

Because of the declining birthrate and aging population in Japan, there are an increasing number of households in Japan with pets and no children.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; Since some families have no children, they instead pamper and lavish their pets like they would do their own children. Businesses in Japan such as [[Cat café|cat cafes]], dog spas, and restaurants that allow pets to sit down at a table and eat with the rest of the family have been booming since 2004. Some pets in Japan even have the luxury of their own pet closets filled with expensive [[Haute couture|couture clothing]] from [[Chanel]] to [[Gucci]] designed specifically [[Dog's fashion|for pets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/04/17/reference/pampered-pets/#.UUhw_VeyKF8 Pampered pets]. The Japan Times. Retrieved on 2014-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pets in Japan are not only for companionship. [[Therapy dog|Therapy dogs]] play a huge role in helping the disabled, comforting hospital patients, and as companions for the elderly. Some organizations in Japan, such as the Tokyo-based International Therapy Dog Association train dogs with no owners into therapy dogs and send them to various [[Nursing home care|nursing homes]] and [[Hospital|hospitals]] throughout Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/06/02/national/rescued-canines-trained-to-give-disaster-zone-therapy/#.UUhxQ1eyKF8 Rescued canines trained to give disaster-zone therapy]. The Japan Times (2012-06-02). Retrieved on 2014-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; One such dog was the basis for a 2004 film Walking With Dogs: Chirori and Tamaru, where the main character, Chirori, instead of being put to sleep, was discovered by a Japanese singer and was trained to help the elderly. The story of Chirori was so inspiring, there is now a statue in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan/cat21/sub145/item797.html|title=PETS IN JAPAN: NURSING CARE FOR PETS, CAT CAFES AND HIGH-PRICED KOI - Facts and Details|first=Jeffrey|last=Hays|website=factsanddetails.com|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shinto religion==

According to [[Japanese folklore]], there is a darker side of pet spirituality in [[Shinto]], known as the [[Inugami]], which literally translates to dog god. Inugami are dark dangerous [[Spirit|spirits]] which are conjured up through [[Ritual|dark rituals]] involving the sacrifice of a common pet dog. In a way similar to [[shikigami]], these rituals allow the dog’s tortured spirit to be under the control of whoever summoned it. The Inugami can then be used by its owner to do their bidding and curse other people or even possess them and bring misfortune. The idea of this type of spirit could be linked to the fact that pets in Japanese culture were traditionally kept for utilitarian purposes as opposed to companionship.

==Memorialization and posthumous care==

Japanese traditional folk religion and [[Buddhism]] have significantly influenced the death rites of pets, and their memorialization thereafter.  To some extent, [[Western culture]] and [[Christianity]] have also made an impact.  However, the aspects present in such procedures vary across Japan and rely heavily upon the beliefs, traditions, and circumstances of each individual family.
           
Traditionally, pets were not often considered to be members of the family.  Although there are some examples of pets being memorialized and given posthumous names during the mid-nineteenth century, there are few records of such efforts and those that exist have been attributed to the elite [[samurai]] class.&lt;ref name="veld" /&gt;  During this time, most dogs and cats were considered community residents and did not inhabit any one individual home.  Upon a community animal’s death, folk tradition required that special care be taken of the deceased animal’s remains, in order to protect the entire village from [[vengeful spirit]]s.&lt;ref name="veld"&gt;Veldkamp, E. (2009). The Emergence of Pets as Family and the Socio-Historical Development of Pet Funerals in Japan. Anthrozoos: A Multidisciplinary Journal of the Interactions of People &amp; Animals, 22(4). 333.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of vengeful spirits comes from the belief that “small animals such as cats and dogs were believed to be able to travel freely between the here-and-now and the afterworld, and to possess the power to wreak spiritual vengeance ([[tatari]]) on people”.&lt;ref name="veld" /&gt;  In order to ensure that the living would not be harmed, and in some instances to enlist good luck or protection from the animal spirit, special procedures were required, such as burial in a specific location of significance or inclusion of certain items within the animal’s grave.&lt;ref name="veld" /&gt;  If the correct process was followed, the village could rest assured that they would not be troubled by the deceased spirit.

Buddhist practices, specifically ancestral memorialization, have directly influenced the death rites and rituals performed for pets in Japan.  However, “there are no scriptures specifically for animals, let alone pets” in Buddhist doctrine.&lt;ref name="Ambros"/&gt;  Thus, memorialization of pets is left open to diverse interpretation.  One central disagreement among spiritualists revolves around the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|Buddhist cycle of rebirth]].&lt;ref name="Ambros" /&gt;  Some individuals claim that it is indeed possible, through proper care during life and correct memorialization after death, for a beloved pet to eventually be reborn as a fellow human, thus making enlightenment achievable.  Others feel that pets are only capable of being reborn as pets.&lt;ref name="Ambros" /&gt;  Often, Buddhist [[Clergy|clerics]] tend to allow families to decide for themselves what process they would like to follow.  As different temples interpret the rites in different ways, they often combine various elements or omit some entirely.&lt;ref name="Ambros" /&gt;

Over the last few decades, pet cemeteries have increased in popularity, particularly within crowded urban areas.  In rural areas, many pets are buried directly in the ground “in the hills outside the village, creating a harmony between the decay of the pet’s body and the fading away of memories and grief”.&lt;ref name="veld" /&gt;  In more urban, metropolitan areas, pet owners generally choose cremation for their lost companions.  They can then choose to inter them in individual or communal graves, or display the remains in columbariums &lt;ref name="Cont"&gt;Ambros, B. (2009). Vengeful Spirits or Loving Spiritual Companions? Changing Views of Animal Spirits in Contemporary Japan. Asian Ethnology, 69(1). 35-67.&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, pet owners request to be buried with their deceased pets, and some choose to conduct the rites just as they would be conducted for a human.  However, most “actual practices reinforce boundaries that place pets in a marginal position and delineate their liminal status within human society”.&lt;ref name="Cont" /&gt;  In contrast with the traditional folk beliefs, the majority of pet owners no longer believe that the spirits of their deceased pets will cause them harm as a result of their choice of memorialization.  Moreover, the rites and rituals serve as a means of easing the grief and loss of the living.   As a result, “the significance of animal funerals in Japan has shifted from prayer for the animal soul to a way of expressing grief by the pet owner".&lt;ref name="veld" /&gt;  Deceased pets are now more commonly remembered as members of the family, and are often memorialized at the family altar and become a part of the family’s ancestry.

In contemporary society, elements of Western thought and Christianity have also become interwoven into burial practices of deceased pets.  One example of this influence is found in the image of a “[[Rainbow Bridge (pets)|Rainbow Bridge]],” a concept very much like the Western ideal of heaven.&lt;ref name="Ambros" /&gt;  The Rainbow Bridge is described as a [[Utopia|utopian]] space where the deceased pet’s spirit remains until the death of their owner, at which time both spirits travel together into the realm of heaven.&lt;ref name="Ambros" /&gt;  This concept further emphasizes the growing familial connection between pets and their owners in contemporary Japan.

== Definition of size asymmetry ==

Resource competition can vary from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size, known also as [[scramble competition]]) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry can be described by the parameter θ in the following equation focusing on the partition of the resource r among n individuals of sizes Bj.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schwinning Fox 1995"&gt;Schwinning, S. &amp; Fox, G. A. Population-dynamic consequences of competitive symmetry in annual plants. Oikos 72, 422-432, [[doi:10.2307/3546128]] (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{#tag:math|r_i=r(B_i)^\theta}}
{{#tag:math|/\sum_{j=1}^{n}(B_j)^\theta}}

ri refers to the amount of resource consumed by individual i in the neighbourhood of j. When θ =1, competition is perfectly size symmetric, e.g. if a large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor, the large individual will acquire twice the amount of that resource (i.e. both individuals will exploit the same amount of resource per biomass unit). When θ &gt;1 competition is size-asymmetric, e.g.  if large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor and θ =2, the large individual will acquire four times the amount of that resource (i.e. the large individual will exploit twice the amount of resource per biomass unit). As θ increases, competition becomes more size-asymmetric and larger plants get larger amounts of resource per unit biomass compared with smaller plants.

== Differences in size-asymmetry among resources in plant communities ==

Competition among plants for [[light]] is size-asymmetric because of the directionality of its supply.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1990"/&gt; Higher [[leaves]] shade lower leaves but not vice versa.  Competition for [[nutrients]] appears to be relatively size-symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;Berntson, G. M. &amp; Wayne, P. M. Characterizing the size dependence of resource acquisition within crowded plant populations. Ecology 81, 1072-1085, [[doi:10.1890/0012-9658]](2000)081[1072:ctsdor]2.0.co;2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; although it has been hypothesized that a patchy distribution of nutrients in the soil may lead to size-asymmetry in competition among roots.&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rajaniemi, T. K. Evidence for size asymmetry of belowground competition. Basic and Applied Ecology 4, 239-247, doi:10.1078/1439-1791-00151 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Nothing is known about the size-asymmetry of competition for [[water]].&lt;ref name="Schwinning Weiner 1998"/&gt;

== Implication for plant communities ==
Various ecological processes and patterns have been shown to be affected by the degree of size-asymmetry e.g. [[Ecological succession|succession]],&lt;ref&gt;Rees, M. &amp; Bergelson, J. Asymmetric light competition and founder control in plant communities. Journal of Theoretical Biology 184, 353-358, [[doi:10.1006/jtbi.1996.0297]] (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; [[biomass]] distribution,&lt;ref name="Weiner 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrior, C. E., Bohlman, S.

Journal of Ecology 102, 167-175, [[doi:10.1111/1365-2745.12184]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[species richness]].&lt;ref name="Rajaniemi et al 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamb et al 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="May et al 2009"/&gt;  A large body of evidence shows  that species loss following  nutrient enrichment ([[eutrophication]]) is related to light competition (5, 15, 16).&lt;ref name="Lamb et al 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hautier, Y., Niklaus, P. A. &amp; Hector, A. Competition for Light Causes Plant Biodiversity Loss After Eutrophication. Science 324, 636-638, [[doi:10.1126/science.1169640]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borer, E. T. et al. Herbivores and nutrients control grassland plant diversity via light limitation. Nature 508, 517-520, [[doi:10.1038/nature13144]] (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is still a debate whether this phenomenon is related to the size-asymmetry of light competition&lt;ref name="Lamb et al 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016"/&gt; or to other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Harpole, W. S. &amp; Tilman, D. Grassland species loss resulting from reduced niche dimension. Nature 446, 791-793, [[doi:10.1038/nature05684]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting assumptions about size-asymmetry characterise the two leading and competing theories in plant ecology,&lt;ref name="DeMalach et al 2016" /&gt; the [[R* rule|R* theory]] and the [[Universal adaptive strategy theory|CSR theory]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size-symmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to withstand low level of resources (known as the [[R* rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tilman, D. Resource competition and community structure. Monographs in population biology 17, 1-296 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to grow fast and attain a large size.&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J. P. Evidence for existence of three primary strategies in plants and its relevance to ecological and evolutionary theory. American Naturalist 111, 1169-1194 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;

Size-asymmetric competition affects also several [[evolutionary]] processes in relation to trait selection. Evolution of plant height is highly affected by asymmetric light competition.&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"&gt;Tilman, D. Plant strategies and the dynamics and structure of plant communities. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 360. p. (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"&gt;Falster, D. S. &amp; Westoby, M. Plant height and evolutionary games. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 18, 337-343, [[doi:10.1016/s0169-5347(03)00061-2]] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Theory predicts that only under asymmetric light competition, plants will grow upward and invest in [[wood]] production at  the expense of investment in leaves, or in [[reproductive]] organs ([[flowers]] and [[fruits]]).&lt;ref name="Tilman 1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Falster Westoby 2003"/&gt;  Consistent with this, there is evidence that plant height increases as water availability increases,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, T., Randin, C. &amp; Korner, C. Water availability predicts forest canopy height at the global scale. Ecology Letters 18, 1311-1320, [[doi:10.1111/ele.12525]] (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; presumably due to increase in the relative importance of size-asymmetric competition for light. Similarly, investment in the size of seeds at the expense of their number may be more effective undersize-asymmetric resource competition, since larger seeds tend to produce larger seedlings that are better competitors.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"&gt;Falster, D. S., Moles, A. T. &amp; Westoby, M. A general model for the scaling of offspring size and adult size. American Naturalist 172, 299-317, [[doi:10.1086/589889]] (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
Size-asymmetric competition can be exploited in managing plant communities, such as the suppression of [[weed]] in [[crop]] fields.&lt;ref name="Falster et al 2008"/&gt;  Weeds are a greater problem for farmer in dry than in moist environments, in large part because crops can suppress weeds much more effectively undersize-asymmetric competition for light than under more size-symmetric competition below ground.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15058">'''Social cost''', in neoclassical{{what|date=July 2018}} [[economics]], is the sum of the private costs resulting from a transaction and the costs imposed on the consumers as a consequence of being exposed to the md's{{what|date=July 2018}} transaction for which they are not compensated or charged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2002/november/private-social-costs-pollution-production/, "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco"&lt;/ref&gt; Private costs are the direct costs of the producer to produce the good or service. Social cost includes these private costs, and in additional the costs (external costs) associated with the production of the good which are not dealt with by the free market. Mathematically, social [[marginal cost]] is the sum of private marginal cost and the [[external costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Gruber, Public Finance and Public Policy, Fourth Edition, 2012 Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when selling a glass of [[lemonade]] at a lemonade stand, the private costs involved in this transaction are the costs of the lemons and the sugar and the water that are ingredients to the lemonade, the opportunity cost of the labor to combine them into lemonade, as well as any transaction costs, such as walking to the stand. An example of marginal damages associated with social costs of driving includes wear and tear, congestion, and the decreased quality of life due to drunken driving or impatience.

"Social costs" in heterodox economics{{what|date=July 2018}} is the social part of the cost of production, the production's cost to society. According to this theory, producers shift as many costs as they can get away with to society, in order to increase profits. This means that capitalism is largely a system of unpaid costs and avoidance of responsibility on the part of producers. Because social costs are a systemic and not an accidental phenomenon, systemic planning is necessary to prevent. This means the adoption of the precautionary principle{{what|date=July 2018}} and a reversal of the burden of proof{{what|date=July 2018}}, such that producers have to prove the safety of their production methods and products beforehand. Social costs are also not merely a monetary phenomenon but involve substantive, complex,and often irreversible damages to the social and natural environment. These damages can accumulate and build on themselves, to undermine the entire economy of a community or region. This theory of social costs was developed by K. William Kapp (see reference list below) in the tradition of Institutional and Ecological Economics, which differ from neoclassical and neoliberal{{what|date=July 2018}} theories.

==Economic theory==
According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], "there are differences between private costs and the costs to the society as a whole". &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/basics/external.htm "Externalities: Prices Do Not Capture All Costs"], "International Monetary Fund", July 29, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; In a situation where there are positive social costs, it means that the first of the [[Fundamental theorems of welfare economics]] failed in that relying merely on private markets for price and quantity lead to an inefficient outcome. [[Market failures]] or situations in which consumption, investment, and production decisions made by individuals or firms result in indirect costs (they have an effect on parties external to the transaction) which are one of the most common reasons for [[government intervention]]. In economics, these [[indirect costs]] which lead to inefficiencies in the market and result in a difference between the private costs and the social costs are called [[externalities]]. Thus, social costs are the  [[transaction costs]] to society as a whole. Generally, social costs are easier to think about in marginal terms,{{what|date=July 2018}} i.e. marginal social cost. Marginal social cost refers to the total costs that the society pays for the production of an extra unit of the good or service in question. Mathematically, this can be represented by Marginal Social Cost (MSC) = Marginal Private Cost (MPC) + Marginal External Costs (MEC).

Social costs can be of two types -- Negative Production Externality and Positive Production Externality. Negative Production Externality refers to a situation in which marginal damages are social costs to society that result in Marginal Social Cost being greater than the Marginal Private Cost i.e. MSC &gt; MPC. Intuitively, this refers to a situation in which the production of the firm reduces the well-being of the people in the society who are not compensated for the same. For example, steel production results in a negative externality because of the marginal damages pertaining to pollution and negative environmental effects. [[Steelmaking]] results in indirect costs as a result of emission of pollutants, lower air quality, etc. For example, these indirect costs might include the health of a homeowner near the production unit and higher healthcare costs which have not been factored into the [[free market]] price and quantity. Given that the producer does not bear the burden of these costs, they are not passed down to the end user thus creating a situation where MSC &gt; MPC. 

[[File:Wikipedia illustration.jpg|thumb|An illustration in which the marginal social costs exceed marginal private costs by the marginal external costs (or marginal damages). This is known as a negative production externality.]] 

This example can be better elucidated with a diagram. Profit-maximizing organizations in a free market will set output at '''Q&lt;sup&gt;Market&lt;/sup&gt;''' where marginal private costs (MPC) is equal to marginal benefit (MB). Intuitively, this is the point on the diagram where the private supply curve (MPC) and consumer demand curve (MB) intersect i.e. where consumer demand meets firm supply. This results in a competitive market equilibrium price of p&lt;sup&gt;Market&lt;/sup&gt;. 

In the presence of a negative production externality, the private marginal cost increases i.e. shifted upwards to the left by marginal damages to yield the marginal social curve. The star in the diagram, or the point where the new supply curve (inclusive of marginal damages to society) and the consumer demand intersect, represents the socially optimum quantity Q&lt;sup&gt;optimum&lt;/sup&gt; and price. At this social optimum, the price paid by the consumer is p&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;consumer&lt;/sub&gt; and the price received by the producers is p&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;. 

High positive social costs, in the form of marginal damages, lead to an over-production. In the diagram, there is overproduction at Q&lt;sup&gt;Market&lt;/sup&gt; - Q&lt;sup&gt;optimum&lt;/sup&gt; with an associated deadweight loss of the shaded triangle. One of the public sector remedies for internalizing externalities is a corrective tax. According to [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] economist Arthur Pigou&lt;ref&gt;Pigou, Arthur C., 1920, The Economics of Welfare (London: Macmillan).&lt;/ref&gt;, in order to correct this market failure (or externality) the government should levy a tax which equals to marginal damages per unit. This would effectively increase the firm's private marginal so that SMC = PMC. &lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Gruber, Public Finance and Public Policy, Fourth Edition, 2012 Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospect of government intervention in regards to correcting an externality has been hotly debated. Economists like [[Ronald Coase]]&lt;ref&gt; Coase, Ronald, 1960, “The Problem of Social Cost,” Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 1–44&lt;/ref&gt; contend that in the absence of transaction costs and under the assumption of [[perfect information]] the market [[Coase_theorem|can internalize an externality]] and provide for an external outcome through [[bargaining]] among affected parties. For example, in the above-mentioned case, the homeowners could negotiate with the pollution firm and strike a deal in which they would pay the firm not to pollute or to charge the firm for pollution; the outcome pertaining to who pays is determined by [[bargaining power]]. According to Thomas Helbing at the International Monetary Fund, government intervention might be most optimal in situations where one party might have undue bargaining power compared to the other party.  

In an alternative scenario, positive production externality occurs when the social costs of production are lower than the marginal private costs of production. For example, the social benefit of research and development not only applies to the profits made by the firm but also helps improve the health of society through better quality of life, lower healthcare costs, etc. In this case, the marginal social cost curve would shift downwards and there would be underproduction. In this case, government intervention would result in a Pigouvian subsidy in order to decrease the firm's private marginal cost so that MPC = SMC.

The perspective of heterodox economics on social costs differs from the neoclassical perspective adopted by the IMF. In this, social costs are total costs of production minus private costs of production. This is an important difference as it highlights that producers "socialize" part of the costs, while they privatize profits. Heterodox economists think that this terminology is more adequate to the problem of social costs. In fact, the term "externality" - first developed by Alfred Marshall to cover economies of scale - itself is highly normative, suggesting that these costs are somewhat external. However, they are 100% internal when considered from a societal and ecological perspective. This heterodox definition of social costs is widely adopted within Social Economics, Institutional Economics, Ecological Economics, and Marxist Economics. These discourse communities reject neoclassical (Pigou) and neoliberal (Coase; Stigler; Hayek; Mises; Calabresi) definitions of social costs because they are laden with a free-market and conservative value bias that is couched in the mantle of objective "science". Alternatively, they propose a preventative approach through the precautionary principle and a reversal of the burden of proof, which essentially mean robust social controls of the economic system for the benefit of all citizens. This is clearly different from the ad hoc, non-systematic, inconsistent, piecemeal approaches taken by tax-based and bargaining solutions.

== Issues ==
One of the main problems with the problem of social costs is that their understanding depends on the chosen perspective and scientific paradigm. If one adopts a neoclassical Pigouvian lens the problem looks different from a Coasian, Kappian, or Misean lens. This also affects policy recommendations. In actual fact, we are faced with a plurality of views and prescriptions on this urgent problem. For an overview of approaches to the problem see below listed references, especially Berger 2017. 

Quantification of social costs, for damages or benefits in the future resulting from current production, is a critical problem for the presentation of social costs and when attempting to formulate policy to correct the externality. For example, damages to the environment, socioeconomic or political impacts, and costs or benefits that span long horizons are difficult to predict and quantify and thus, difficult to include in a cost-benefit analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Zerbe, R. O. and D.D. Dively. 1994. Benefit-Cost Analysis: In Theory and Practice. New York, NY: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example that speaks to the difficulty surrounding the estimation of social costs is the social cost of carbon. In trying to monetize the social costs arising from carbon, one needs to understand "the effect of a ton of a greenhouse gas on global temperatures, the effect of temperature change on agricultural yields, human health, flood risk, and myriad other harms to the [[ecosystem]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-social-costs-of-carbon/, "The social costs of carbon"], "Brookings Institution"&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts from Brookings Institution contend that one of the reasons the estimation of the social cost of carbon is incredibly complex is that the external costs imposed on society as a result of the transactions of one firm in China, for example, impact the quality of lives and health of consumers living in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraclitus' idea that "change is the only constant" can also be applied to the understanding of the issues surrounding the presentation and estimation of social costs. Given that social costs are estimates and will always be subject to uncertainty, the assumptions made about the responses to policy, baseline social welfare, and predictions about the nature and number of affected parties are consequently imbued with a degree of uncertainty. Thus, estimates of social costs as of the present can never be known with certainty.&lt;ref&gt;[https://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eerm.nsf/vwAN/EE-0228C-04.pdf/$file/EE-0228C-04.pdf, "Analyzing Social Costs"], Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chopin in the Luxembourg Gardens, Paris 28 June 2015.jpg|thumbnail|300px|A street piano in the [[Luxembourg Garden]], [[Paris]].]]
A '''street piano''' is a [[piano]] placed in the street which passersby are encouraged to play. The concept originated quite by accident in [[Sheffield]], [[England]].

==The Street Piano in Sheffield==
[[File:Street piano 25pc.jpeg|thumb|right|The Sheffield Street Piano]]
In [[Sheffield]], ''The Street Piano'' was a [[piano]] on the pavement on [[Sharrow]] Vale Road. It was originally left outside temporarily because the owner could not get it up the steps into his new house. As a social experiment the owner and a friend then attached a sign inviting passersby to play the piano for free. This offer was taken up by a great many people and the piano became a part of the local community. It survived for over a year, including being stolen and subsequently replaced by a newer model (with several volunteers willing to provide a new one). {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The original street piano in Sheffield belonged to a family from Middlesbrough for decades before moving, with the daughter of the family, ending up in Sheffield. The original piano stool and music book holder did not make it on to Sharrow Vale Rd, parting company after many happy years together. 

The piano became the centre of a local campaign once the council decided it constituted an abandoned item, and the campaign to save it spread quickly to local news outlets, with several articles on [[Indymedia]]. As of July 2006 a spokesman said in an interview for the National [[BBC Radio 4]] that the piano was no longer under threat of removal. However, it was eventually removed in 2008 because of weather damage.

==Play Me, I'm Yours==

[[File:Play Me, I'm Yours Millennium Bridge london.jpg|thumb|right|A ''Play Me, I'm Yours'' piano being played near London's Millennium Bridge]]
Artist [[Luke Jerram]] created the concept of installing multiple street pianos across a city as an art installation. Often decorated by local artist, the project is intended to challenge the prohibition of playing music in public places without special arrangement. It prompts members of the public to use the piano, regardless of skill and popularity. Typically, a musician would have been stopped from playing outside the [[City of London]] and Sing London festival.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. 

By 2018, his team had installed over 1900 streetpianos in 70 cities worldwide. Play Me I'm Yours created a global movement of pianos being installed in public places across the world by organisations and individuals, for people to play. The artwork is often presented in the same format, but under a different title. In this way, the concept, has now become part of culture.   

===Birmingham===
In 2007, Jerram installed 15 street pianos throughout [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]], for the public to play. In just three weeks, 140,000 people across the city played, listened and connected with one another.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Jerram said "Questioning the rules and ownership of public space 'Play Me I'm yours' is a provocation, inviting the public to engage with, activate and take ownership of their urban environment."

===São Paulo===

Thirteen pianos have been installed in [[São Paulo]].&lt;ref name=VCS /&gt; Luke Jerram reported that many of those who stopped at the pianos had never played a real piano or even seen one.&lt;ref name=VCS&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Nash |title=Keys to the cities: Artist's piano project widens worldwide |work=Ventura County Star |date=28 June 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |url=http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/jun/28/keys-to-the-cities-artists-piano-project-widens/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130205183648/http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/2009/jun/28/keys-to-the-cities-artists-piano-project-widens/ |archivedate=5 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto===
"Play Me, I'm Yours" started in Toronto in the summer of 2012. 41 pianos were placed around the downtown core of Toronto in celebration of the 2015 Pan American Games which were held in the city of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/1232541--play-me-i-m-yours-street-piano-art-moves-from-trinity-bellwoods-park-after-noise-complaints | location=Toronto | work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sydney===
Thirty street pianos were set up across [[Sydney]] for the [[Sydney Festival]] 2009. A [http://www.streetpianos.com website] was set up for the public to upload and share their films, photographs and stories of the pianos being played.

===London===
In June and July 2009, thirty ''Play Me, I'm Yours''-painted pianos were installed across [[London]] for members of the public to play. The painting on each piano was chosen to suit its location.&lt;ref name=bbc23 /&gt; The project was produced by [[Sing London]] and [[City of London Festival]]&lt;ref name=bbc23&gt;{{cite news |title=Art project puts pianos on street |work=BBC News  |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2009 |quote= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/8114859.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of £14,000.&lt;ref name=nyt13&gt;{{cite news |first=Sarah |last=Lyall |title=All Around London, an Invitation to Make Music  |work=New York Times |date=10 July 2009  |accessdate=13 July 2009 |quote= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/arts/design/11pianos.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; A music license had to be obtained for the location of each piano.&lt;ref name=nyt13/&gt;

===Bristol===
The artwork was presented again with Fifteen street pianos being located in and around [[Bristol]] in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetpianos.com/bristol2009/ |title=Play me I'm yours |publisher=Streetpianos.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona===
Play Me, I'm Yours arrived in [[Barcelona]] when twenty-three street pianos were located across the city in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetpianos.com/barcelona2010/ |title=Toca'm, sóc teu |publisher=Streetpianos.com |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warsaw ===
In several cities of Poland "pianina miejskie" are at the disposal of the population. 

===New York===

''Play Me, I'm Yours'', presented in [[New York City]], brought sixty pianos to the center of commercial [[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], [[The Bronx]], and [[Staten Island]].  The pianos were placed at strategic locations throughout the five boroughs.  For the two-week duration of 21 June through 5 July 2010, the pianos featured formal and impromptu concerts by students, tourists, children, nannies, lawyers, doctors, merchants, and artists in an open festival of music involving all elements of New York's culturally diverse population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetpianos.com/nyc2010/ |title=Play me I'm yours |publisher=Streetpianos.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Santa Barbara===

Beginning in 2009, a collaboration of arts organizations have been presenting "Pianos on State Street" as an annual community art project after being inspired by Luke Jerram and other cities.  The project happens in October to celebrate Arts and Humanities month, fostering the cultural vitality of the Santa Barbara arts community.  Several non-profit organizations solicit donated pianos from the community and give Santa Barbara-based artists an opportunity to paint and decorate the pianos.  The pianos are installed in the heart of downtown Santa Barbara where they are on display from one to three weeks.  Many youth and social service organizations participate as artists or as scheduled performers throughout the duration of the program.  The program has become a well-loved project by the community attracting local residents and tourists of all ages, artistic styles and socio-economic backgrounds.  A permanent display of a painted piano also sits at the Santa Barbara Airport.

===Cincinnati===

''Play Me, I'm Yours'' brought 35 pianos to [[Greater Cincinnati]] starting on 9 August 2010 with a kickoff event at Fountain Square, downtown. The pianos will be donated to arts centers and children in need after the project ends on 17 September. The project was brought to Cincinnati by [[Cincinnati Public Radio Inc.|Cincinnati Public Radio]] to celebrate the 50th anniversary of [[WGUC]], the 40th anniversary of [[WVXU]] and the 60th anniversary of [[WMUB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetpianos.com/cincinnati2010/ |title=Play me I'm yours |publisher=Streetpianos.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grand Rapids===
Mr. Jerram also entered ''Play Me I'm Yours'' in the 2010 [[Artprize]] competition in [[Grand Rapids]], Michigan. Despite the entry's popularity, it failed to make the final round, finishing in the Top 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artprize.org/artists/public-profile/49846 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204085141/http://www.artprize.org/artists/public-profile/49846 |archivedate=4 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tilburg===
The largest "Play Me, I'm Yours" project, with 101 pianos, took place 11 September through 18 September 2011, as part of the Incubate festival in [[Tilburg]], [[The Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==The Public Piano Project in Joshua Tree California==
The ''Public Piano Project '' in [[Joshua Tree]] California began as a public grand piano Valentine Gift to the community in 1995 as the ''Self Serve Serenade'' by artist Piano Bob (aka Bob Fenger).  In 2002 Piano Bob began a donated piano consolidation project building a weather proof outdoor piano from the parts of 3 pianos and installed  April 2004 in front of Joshua Tree Health Foods.  It was enjoyed by thousands of [[Joshua Tree National Park]] Visitors and locals for nearly 2 years and was reinstalled 20 April 2012 at the Coyote Corner Gift Shop in Joshua Tree as the  first ''Public Prepared Piano''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpreparedpiano.com/  |title=First Public Prepared Piano |publisher=Public Prepared Piano.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The piano is reminiscent of a [[Gamelan]] Orchestra prepared with everyday items such as coins, screws, paper mutes, wedged into the strings in a typical [[John Cage]] manner (inventor of the [[prepared piano]] in the 1940s also see Bob Fenger's ''Acoustisizer'' at ''Prepared piano'' 2.10).  The ''Public Prepared Piano'' is the third phase of the ''Public Piano Project'' dedication to unknown closet pianists, art in public places, and instant drum circle fun around a keyboard. Through regular tuning and maintenance of the ''public pianos'' another opportunity presented itself for the public to observe, learn and interact with the total ''Public Piano Project'' experience.  Questions like:how long does it stay in tune outside? The short answer: the colder the better the more in tune.  The fact that Joshua Tree is in the High Desert above Palm Springs with many 100 degree plus days in the summer gave numerous opportunities for tuning, sharing and exchanging ideas.  The artist's stated intention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pianobob.com/whyapublicpiano2.html |title=WHY A PUBLIC PIANO |publisher=Piano Bob.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'The ''Public Piano Project''  creates momentary beauty thoughts and ideas that resonate out across fields, parking lots and sidewalks.  It invites others to play along and gives way to song and laughter, accidental bonding and new friends; even possibly an ephemeral center of insight and change'. On 21 December 2012 Piano Bob launched his fourth phase of the ''Public Piano Project'' with the ''Prepared'' and ''Unprepared'' dueling pianos for peace at the Joshua Tree Hospice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hwy62art.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=446:dueling-pianos-for-peace-with-piano-bob-dec-21&amp;catid=1:news&amp;Itemid=8 |title=Morongo Basin Cultural Arts Council |publisher=hwy62art.com | date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Public Piano Locations''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpiano.com/pplocations.html |title=Public Piano Locations |publisher=Public Piano.com |date= |accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Public Piano Tour Pictures 2007''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playmeforward.com/tourpics.html  |title=Public Piano Tour Pictures |publisher=Play Me Forward.com |date= |accessdate=20 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HDS&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Wheeler |title= Piano Bob adorns Joshua Tree with public instruments|work= High Desert Star |date= 3 March 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2007 |url=http://www.hidesertstar.com/news/article_d8708eb4-3649-5616-9467-29671a882503.html/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biggerstaff, Jutta (17 November 2007) "Look out for that piano on the highway" ''[http://www.hidesertstar.com/news/article_bd618dd6-c577-5f77-b681-d1bb4dba194d.html]'' Joshua Tree CA, Retrieved 17 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unger|first= Rebecca |date=26 July 2010 |title=Pianos for peace persist |url=http://www.hidesertstar.com/news/community_news/article_af58ba62-4069-5a45-8882-624001c9b272.html|publisher=Joshua Tree |location=CA|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piano des villes, piano des champs in Montreal==

In 2012, the [[Le Plateau-Mont-Royal|Plateau-Mont-Royal]] borough in [[Montreal]] installed two public pianos; [[Patrick Watson (musician)|Patrick Watson]] inaugurated the season by being the first to play on one of them while artist and compositor Victor Simon played on the second.&lt;ref&gt;"Patrick Watson inaugure Piano des villes, piano des champs" ''[http://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/146774/patrick-watson-inaugure-piano-des-villes-piano-des-champs/]'', Montreal, Retrieved 28 June 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, following the success of the first season, the borough installed two more pianos and lent one to the [[Pointe-à-Callière Museum]] for a total of five public pianos, inaugurated by five different artists, [[Socalled]], [[Yann Perreau]], Louise-Andrée Baril, Alex Nevsky, Fanny Bloom and François Bourassa.&lt;ref&gt;"Piano des villes, piano des champs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1789">The '''Tallstick''' is a yardstick-like device for field measurement of childhood stunting based on age and sex norms. Its simplicity, portability, and low-cost have made it a popular tool for aide workers and community volunteers in remote areas.
[[File:Field of Validation for Tallstick in Nicaragua.jpg|thumb|right]]
==Application==
Shaped like a [[yardstick]], the Tallstick is marked in ages from birth to five years, with one side blue for boys and the other pink for girls. Markings on each side represent -2 standard deviations from height-for-age values (HAZ&lt;-2).  The Tallstick markings are expressed in years and months and each consecutive mark represents an increment of 1 month in age. Infants below 12 months are measured lying down (recumbent position) while children ages one to five are measured standing up. The child whose length is below the line corresponding to his or her age is recorded as stunted.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, M.F., Sokalingam, S. Seireg, M., Bonilla, J. ''The Tallstick: A tool for Community-based Assessment of Nutritional Stunting''. Food and Nutrition Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, the United Nations University, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The Tallstick was originally developed in 1989 by Marian Zeitlin, PhD, of [http://www.tufts.edu Tufts University] while the field validation was conducted by [[Mirette Seireg|Mirette Seireg Ohman]], MSc, lead investigator of the [http://www.positivedeviance.org Positive Deviance in Nutrition Project] in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;M Seireg et al.

'''''The Freewoman''''' was a feminist weekly published between 23 November 1911 and 10 October 1912 and edited by [[Dora Marsden]] and [[Mary Gawthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Freewoman: A Weekly Feminist Review|url=http://www.modjourn.org/render.php?view=mjp_object&amp;id=FreewomanCollection|work=The Modernist Journals Project|accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Freewoman'' published articles on women's waged work, housework, motherhood, the [[suffrage movement]], and literature, its notoriety and influence rested on its frank discussions of sexuality, morality, and marriage.  ''The Freewoman'' urged tolerance for male homosexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Cohler, Deborah. Citizen, Invert, Queer: Lesbianism and War in Early Twentieth Century Britain. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2010. p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; advocated for [[free love]], and encouraged women to remain unmarried.

''The Freewoman'''s editorial stance distinguished it sharply from the attitude of [[suffragists]] like [[Millicent Fawcett]], who was so disturbed at the journal's approach to sexuality that she tore the first issue into little pieces.

In March 1912 Gawthorpe resigned due to poor health and disagreements with Marsden. In September 1912, [[W H Smith]] refused to carry ''The Freewoman'' and in October 1912, the journal folded.

Although its circulation probably never exceeded 200, it had a significant influence in [[Modernist]] circles. Among its contributors were [[Rebecca West]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Edward Carpenter]], and [[Guy Aldred]].

In June 1913 Marsden started ''[[The New Freewoman]]'' which was more concerned with literary modernism than feminism and was funded by [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]]. In 1914, ''The New Freewoman'' became [[The Egoist (periodical)|''The Egoist'']].

==Creation of ''The Freewoman''==
''The Freewoman'' was a feminist journal/newspaper in publication during the early twentieth century in Britain. [[Dora Marsden]] founded ''The Freewoman'' in November 1911, but the paper was also co-edited by [[Mary Gawthorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism: Dora Marsden, Votes for Women and The Freewoman|journal=Women's History Review|year=2002|volume=11|issue=4|pages=632|doi=10.1080/09612020200200341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being edited by both women, Marsden initially used Gawthorpe for her name and influence in the feminist society to give the paper creditability and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism|pages=636}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was rooted in more radical feminist ideals that stretched beyond strictly suffrage. Marsden focused the paper around the discussion of sex and the idea of being sexual, causing many issues to arise amongst readers. After the first issue of ''The Freewoman'', the female readers, many of whom grew up during the Victorian era of feminism, thought the views presented did not reflect the ideals of the feminism they had grown to understand. One of their main objectives was the papers very obvious discussions and references to sex. 
In the paper’s first issue it stated that it sought to represent the feminist movement through intellectual thought by actual feminists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|journal=The Freewoman|date=November 1911|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It touched on the idea of marriage, motherhood, sexuality, women’s rights, and the domestic man. Its radical approach on these ideas seemed misplaced for the twentieth century, however its influence amongst the feminist and sexual radicals was greater than its small circulation implied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bland|first=Lucy|title=Heterosexuality, Feminism and The Freewoman Journal in Early Twentieth-century England|journal=Women's History Review|year=1995|volume=4|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.1080/09612029500200074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Freewoman'' ideals==
According to many of the female readers, ''The Freewoman'' expressed beliefs more radical than most feminists during the early twentieth century. In the paper’s first issue it discussed the definition of marriage. To ''The Freewoman'' marriage did not only mean men and women, nor did it mean that a couple had to have children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=November 1911|volume=1|issue=1|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the women who were raised during the Victorian era, this concept of marriage did not register with them. Marriage in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and even in the current day, meant a man and woman and usually resulted in children. However, with the job opportunities and improved possibility of economic and social independence from the years preceding and during the war, women were able to forge a new identity separate from the confines of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bland|first=Lucy|title=Heterosexuality, Feminism and The Freewoman|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As feminism began to grow throughout the twentieth century the paper began to put a new label on these radical and forward thinking feminists: The New Woman.

''The Freewoman'' began to redefine and transform feminism from being solely related to suffrage and the suffrage movement, but to show feminism in its purest form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=Philosophical vacuity and political ineptitude’: The Freewoman’s critique of the suffrage movement|journal=Women's History Review|year=2002|volume=11|issue=4|page=614|doi=10.1080/09612020200200340}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aimed to say that feminists needed to strive for more than just the right to vote. Marsden’s rather liberal and forward thinking opinion on the definition of feminism is what caused future debates amongst other prominent feminists of the time. The New Woman was to be a politically, socially and economically independent woman. ''The Freewoman'' did not reject the domestic life that most women during the twentieth century lived, but rather used the domestic life of a woman as a tool to show women that they could take an active role in protecting their interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=The Freewoman's critque of the suffrage movement|page=615}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the paper’s third publication it discussed the idea of the domestic man. It raised the idea that a man can do the work of a woman in the domestic sphere. The goal was to “work towards the evolution of the New Housekeeping.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=December 1911|volume=1|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rationale hinged on the argument that the house and its inner workings were no different from that of a restaurant or even a milliner’s shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marsden|first=Dora|author2=Mary Gawthorpe|title=The Freewoman|date=December 1911|volume=1|issue=3|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also suggested the idea of communal cooking and man and wife dividing up the household duties that would allow women to work outside of the domestic life. This idea of the domestic man also supported the idea of the homosexual family. With a man being able to do the domestic work, it presented the idea that man and man could live as a couple. To say that this openly happened is not likely, however ''The Freewoman'' implied and even supported this life style choice. The paper again showed its liberal and progressive beliefs with its idea of the domestic man.

The Freewoman stated that: "It is high time for a reversal of the servile notion of government from above. Free government proceeds from the individual outwards, not from the sum total inwards. It is for this reason that, considering the trend of Syndicalism, we are of the opinion that it is likely to make a far more intimate appeal to the nation than Socialism ever has. Its aims are the same: the means of production and exchange to be the property of the community as a whole, but under Syndicalism the control of conditions of work are to be in the hands of those who perform it."&lt;ref&gt;The Servile State, From the Freewoman, Reproduced in The Syndiacalist, London June 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Big Debate==
With the papers candid nature of expressing many of its beliefs, there were bound to be arguments. One of it biggest criticisms and continuous debates with some readers came from its stance on the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delap|first=Lucy|title=The Freewoman's critque of the suffrage movement|page=617}}&lt;/ref&gt; It openly challenged the ideals of the movement and its organization. Despite being co-edited, these views were mainly the opinions of Marsden and not Gawthorpe. With the paper’s belief that feminism was more than just the right to vote, its views on the suffrage movement were unlike most feminists in Britain during the twentieth century. During this era women were fighting for the right to vote and to be regarded as political equals amongst men. Not all feminists believed in complete female independence from the strongholds of the normative female life. ''The Freewoman'' wanted to stray away from this concept of feminism. It wanted women to not only be politically equal, but economically and socially self-sufficient as well. It rooted its beliefs in complete female independence from the norms of society.

==The Closing Years==
The publication of ''The Freewoman'' did not last long. Its final paper was published in 1912, but was later revived in May 1913 with the new title ''The New Freewoman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Cary|title=Marketing Edwardian Feminism|page=632}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the attempts to revive the paper and inspire more readers, the paper finally ended publication in 1914. Its publication did not reach a large market, mostly due to its views on feminism and the suffrage movement. The paper, but more specifically Dora Marsden’s beliefs and opinions were far too liberal and progressive for its early twentieth century audience. The audience was still rather conservative in their views. It would not be until the years of the Great War that women began to take small strides in some of the ideals that ''The Freewoman'' expressed. Despite having an extremely small circulation, the paper’s strong beliefs and opinions were widely known and debated against and provided the impetus for future feminist activists.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
The history of '''women in Morocco''' includes their lives from before, during, and after the arrival of [[Islam]] in the northwestern African country of [[Morocco]]. In 622 AC, as Islam arrived in Morocco, the women of Morocco received three basic rights under the Muslims' religion: the right to live, the right to be honored and to be respected as a mother, and the right to own business and be able to work. From the 1940s until the Moroccan declaration of independence from the tutelage of France in 1956, Moroccan women lived in family units that are "enclosed households" or ''[[harem]]'', wherein extended families live as one unit together and where women are secluded and require permission from the men before leaving a household that is protected by a gate keeper. In addition, during that time, married women were treated better than women who were divorced. The hierarchy and importance of women were further categorized according to age and status in the family and community. Among their activities during that period were performing household chores, embroidery, and crafts, attending Koranic schools, and going to a Moroccan bathhouse known as the ''[[Turkish bath|hammam]]''.  The tradition of the harem lifestyle for women gradually ended upon Morocco's independence from France in 1956.&lt;ref name=WIM&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Morocco|url=http://thirdeyemom.com/2011/04/25/1084/|publisher=THIRDEYEMOM|accessdate=9 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Morocco's independence from France, Moroccan women were able to start going to schools that don't focus only on teaching religion, but also sciences and other subjects. Upon the institution of the legal code known as [[Mudawana]] in 2004, Moroccan women obtained the rights to divorce their husbands, to child custody, to child support, and to own and inherit property.&lt;ref name=WIM/&gt;

While Morocco's current borders and entity as a nation state were not recognized until 1956 following independence from France, women there have played a significant role in its conception, which spans several centuries. From their roles of relaying oral traditions and stories, to forging the foundation of important institutions, to their involvement in resisting colonialism, and holding positions of power following the establishment of the Moroccan state, women were and continue play significant roles in Morocco.

==Amazigh Women in Morocco==
Prior to the spread of [[Islam]] into Morocco, which brought along with it the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Arab conquest]], Morocco was part of a region inhabited mostly by a non-Arab [[Amazigh]] population.&lt;ref&gt;Laroui, Abdallah. The History of the Maghrib: An Interpretive Essay. Princeton: Princeton Studies on the Near East, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;  Various Amazigh tribes during the 4th, 5th, and 6th century were noted to have been [[matrilineal]], such as the [[Tuareg]] tribes of North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Michael, and Elizabeth Fentress. The Berbers. Wiley: Blackwell, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, Amazigh women were noted to have taken on significant roles in local communities. This was especially evident through the figure of [[Kahina]], who was a noted Amazigh female military leader who fought against the Arab and Muslim expansion into North Africa.

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Berbervrouw in feestkledij uit Tafraoute Zuid-Marokko TMnr 60033850.jpg|thumbnail|left|Image of an Amazigh woman in Southern Morocco.]]
Amazigh women have had a lasting position in Moroccan folklore, a position that predates the Arab and Muslim conquest of the [[Maghreb]] region. It is believed that the tale of [[Aisha Qandisha]] has existed since at least the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Crapanzano, Vincent. The Hamadsha. A Study in Moroccan Ethnopsychiatry. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several variations of Aisha Qandisha's name, among which include Lalla Aicha and Aicha Hamdouchia. Stemming from the pre-Islamic era of Morocco, Aisha Qandisha is said to have been a female demon that takes the shape of multiple beings, including a half-goat.&lt;ref&gt;Westermarck, Edward. Ritual and Belief in Morocco. London: Macmillan and Co., 1926&lt;/ref&gt;   Aicha Qandisha, unlike other demons in Moroccan folklore, appears mostly in men's dreams and is said to make a man impotent.  Such folklore remains widely popular in Morocco today.

==Establishment of Islamic institutions (680-900)==
Following the Arab and Muslim expansion into the Maghreb region, women took on significant roles in the institutional foundation of landmarks that continue to function today. [[Fatima al-Fihri]], for example, is credited for founding the [[University of al-Karaouine]] in 859, the “world's first academic degree-granting institution of higher education” in [[Fes]], Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;"Kairaouine Mosque, Fes.” Sacred Destinations. Retrieved 2014-03-02 http://www.sacred-destinations.com/morocco/fes-kairaouine-mosque&lt;/ref&gt;  Fatima's sister, Mariam al-Fihri, also founded the al-Andalus Mosque in Fes.&lt;ref&gt;“Fatima Al-Fihri – Founder of the Oldest University in the World.” The Urban Muslim Woman. Retrieved 2014-03-02 http://theurbanmuslimwomen.wordpress.com/2008/08/04/fatima-al-fihri-founder-of-the-oldest-university-in-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imperial expansion into North Africa, and Colonialism (1600-1956)==
As part of a broader French imperialist project that justified the colonization of Morocco and the Maghreb region in general, European narratives on Moroccan women were fixated on Orientalist images. Dominant narratives described Moroccan women as docile, oppressed, and in need of being saved. Consequently, Moroccan women's experience of life under colonialism was a result of multiple intersections of power and patriarchy. For example, following a growing trend of French land expropriation, which drove rural Moroccan families out of their homes and land, many Moroccan women migrated to the urban areas in search of economic opportunity, especially in [[Casablanca]].&lt;ref&gt;Maghraoui, Driss. “Gendering Urban Colonial Casablanca” in Martina Rieker and Kamran Asdar Ali, eds. Gendering Urban Space in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa (New York &amp; Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon migrating to Casablanca, many Moroccan women were forced into prostitution, namely due to their lack of formal identification documents—a policy that the French instituted.

===Women in anti-colonial resistance===
Just as Moroccan women were subject to a gendered form of colonialism, their resistance was gendered as well. The oral traditions of Moroccan women were a unique form of disseminating stories of resistance, oftentimes inspired by existing Islamic oral traditions of female warriors who fought in early Islamic history, such as the stories of [[Hind bint Utbah|Hind]] and [[Sukayna bint Husayn|Sukayna]].&lt;ref name="Baker, Alison 1998"&gt;Baker, Alison. Voices of Resistance: Oral Histories of Moroccan Women. New York: SUNY Series, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moroccan women, especially those involved in the armed resistance primarily in the northern [[Rif|Rif region]], adopted their own experiences of fighting against colonialism to existing frameworks of oral traditions that address women in war. The storytelling of these events played a significant role in shaping memories and conceptualizing post-colonial identities among women.

In addition to the oral traditions of women involved in armed resistance, a role that mostly lower class women took up, upper class Moroccan women were heavily involved in the nationalist politics of resisting colonialism. The [[Istiqlal Party]] was the primary mobilizing political force in Morocco that rallied against French colonial rule. The party included the participation of various elite Moroccan women from wealthy and educated families, such as Malika Al-Fassi, from the still influential Al-Fassi family.&lt;ref&gt;“Women Movements in Morocco.” Al Akhawayn University. Retrieved 2014-03-02 http://www.aui.ma/personal/~991BE736604/women_movements_in_morocco22.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a close collaboration between women like Malika Al-Fassi, who were important figures in the political resistance, and women such as Fatima Roudania, a working-class armed resistance fighter.&lt;ref name="Baker, Alison 1998"/&gt;  The wealthier women involved with the Istiqlal Party provided educational services to lower class women involved in the armed resistance, assisted in the proliferation of nationalist literature and knowledge production, and provided protection by hiding women who were fighting against the French.&lt;ref name="Baker, Alison 1998"/&gt;

Many of the Moroccan women involved in resisting French colonialism oftentimes looked to the public presence of women in other struggles of resistance in the region for inspiration, such as in Algeria and Palestine, including women like [[Djamila Bouhired]] and [[Leila Khaled]].

==Independence (1956-present)==

===Literature, knowledge production, artistic expression===
Following independence from France in 1956, Moroccan women were at the forefront of knowledge production and artistic expression—all of which nuanced the conception and perception of a post-colonial Moroccan identity. [[Fatima Mernissi]], for example, emerged as a critical figure in the knowledge production on gender studies in Morocco. [[Laila Lalami]] has also become a popular figure in literature on Morocco, being the first Moroccan author to publish a book of fiction in English. Other Moroccan women who gained prominence through their published work include [[Leila Abouzeid]], [[Latifa Baka]], [[Khnata Bennouna]], [[Farida Diorui]], and [[Bahaa Trabelsi]].

Moroccan women artists also gained regional and international popularity, including [[Lalla Essaydi]], [[Samira Said]], [[Amel Bent]], [[Najat Aatabou]], [[Dounia Batma]], and [[Naima Samih]], among others.

===Women in politics===
In addition to art and literature, Moroccan women have been publicly present in shaping contemporary politics. In 1961, the ''Union Progresiste des Femmes Marocaines'' emerged as one of the first exclusively female organizations in Morocco. [[Princess Lalla Aicha]], the late sister of the late King Hassan II was the president of another woman's organization called the ''Union Nationale des Femmes Marocaines''. Various other woman's organizations in Morocco were created after independence with the aim of advancing the cause of women's rights, such as the Democratic Association of Moroccan Women and the Union de l’Action Feminine.&lt;ref&gt;Salime, Zakia. Between Feminism and Islam: Human Rights and Sharia Law in Morocco. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Moroccan women have held positions in the ruling government, cabinet, and high ranks in political parties, including [[Asma Chaabi]], [[Nawal El Moutawakel]], [[Bassima Hakkaoui]], [[Nouzha Skalli]], and [[:fr:Mbarka Bouaida|Mbarka Bouaida]], among others. Contrarily, Moroccan women have also been in the forefront of dissent and the opposition, who oftentimes faced jail and harassment from the Moroccan government. Among those are [[Nadia Yassine]] and [https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khadija_Ryadi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1 Khadija Riyadi]. During the beginning of Morocco's version of the [[Arab Spring|Arab Uprisings]] that began in December 2010 following the self-immolation of Tunisian fruit vendor, [[Mohammed Bouazizi]], a single Moroccan mother, Fadoua Laroui, set herself on fire in front of a municipal office in protest of her public housing application getting rejected. Laroui has been dubbed by some as the “Moroccan female Bouazizi.”&lt;ref&gt;Lalami, Laila. “The Moroccan Mohammed Bouazizi.” The Nation. 27 February 2011. http://www.thenation.com/blog/158878/fadoua-laroui-moroccan-mohamed-bouazizi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bassima Hakkaoui (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|left|Bassima Hakkaoui, Moroccan Minister for Solidarity, Women, Family and Social Development at the G8 Deauville Partnership: Women in Business Conference in London.]] Despite the fact that Morocco ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ([[CEDAW]]), the political representation of women in Morocco remains relatively low. Following the [[Moroccan general election, 2011|November 2011]] elections, only one woman was appointed minister. Like other neighboring countries, Morocco introduced Law n° 59-11 in 2011, which created a quota system that allocated one-third of the seats in the [[House of Representatives (Morocco)|Lower House of Parliament]] to women.&lt;ref name="quotaproject.org"&gt;"Morocco," ''quotaProject''. February 2014 http://www.quotaproject.org/uid/countryview.cfm?CountryCode=MA&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 66 of the 395 seats in the Lower House of Parliament belong to women as of the November 2011 elections.&lt;ref name="quotaproject.org"/&gt;

Due to this increased political voice, women's representation in parliament has increased dramatically, from 1% in 2003 to 17% in 2015; Morocco's 2004 Family Code is one of the most progressive in the Arab world; in 1993, Morocco ratified an international agreement on gender equality that has provided leverage for further progress in domestic legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's political empowerment in Morocco|url=http://www.developmentprogress.org/infographic/womens-political-empowerment-morocco|website=Development Progress|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the increase in representation, Morocco has seen improvements in women's health and social outcomes: the fertility rate is now one of the lowest in the region; the maternal mortality rate fell by two-thirds in just two decades; girls’ primary school enrolment rose from 52% in 1991 to 112% in 2012 (due to re-enrolment); and just under 23% of women are in formal employment (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castillejo|first1=Clare|last2=Tilley|first2=Helen|title=The road to reform Women’s political voice in Morocco|url=http://www.developmentprogress.org/sites/developmentprogress.org/files/case-study-report/morocco_full_report-final-digital.pdf|website=Development Progress|publisher=Overseas Development Institute|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the realm of formal politics, Moroccan women have been active in various advocacy projects and legal reforms. Most notably, following the suicide of [[Amina Filali]], a young girl who was forced to marry her rapist, various Moroccan woman organizations, such as [http://swmena.net/en/partner/swmena_advocacy_partner Union de l'Action Feminine], pushed for the reform of Article 475 from Morocco's penal code. Prior to the national campaign, Article 475 was the law cited by the judge in Amina Filali's case that stated a rapist may be acquitted of charges if he marries his victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moroccans demand change to Islamic penal code after girl, 16, kills herself because judge forced her to marry her RAPIST|author=Lee Moran|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2114884/Moroccan-girl-16-kills-judge-forced-marry-man-RAPED-her.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|date=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign led to the repeal of Article 475 on January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;"Morocco repeals 'rape marriage law'
" http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2014/01/morocco-repeals-rape-marriage-law-2014123254643455.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Moroccan women have also been active in lobbying for reforms to the personal status code laws ([[Mudawana]]). The [[Mudawana]] was initially codified following Morocco's independence from France and was used as a tool for the state's immediate consolidation of power.&lt;ref&gt;Charrad, Mounira. State and Women’s Rights: The Making of Postcolonial Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrak, Fatima (2009). "The History and Significance of the New Moroccan Family Code". Institute for the Study of Islamic Thought in Africa Working Paper Series, Northwestern University.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mohammed VI's accession to the throne in 1999, reforming the [[Mudawana]] was a major platform that guided the early years of his reign. Various women's organizations supported these measures, such as ''l’Union de l’Action Féminine (UAF)'' and ''Association Marocaine pour les Droits des Femmes (ADFM)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cavatorta, Francesco; Emanuela Salmasso (2009). "Liberal Outcomes through Undemocratic Means: The Reform of the Code de status personnel in Morocco." Journal of Modern African Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, some of the reforms included stricter measures for men wanting to marry additional wives, greater leniency for a divorce initiated by the wife, more equitable inheritance rights for women, and the increase in the legal age of marriage for women. The reception of these reforms to the [[Mudawana]] varied across class lines and the political spectrum. While members of the aforementioned UAF and ADFM championed these measures, various groups, such as the Islamist [[Al Adl Wa Al Ihssane|Al Adl Wa Al Ihsanne]] opposed these measures, claiming the reforms were "Western-inspired" and rooted in the [[neoliberal]] feminist measures of the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Guessous, Nadia. 2011. “Genealogies of Feminism: Leftist Feminist Subjectivity in the Wake of the Islamic Revival in Contemporary Morocco.” PhD diss., Columbia University.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abortion in Morocco ===
Abortion in Morocco is illegal. According to Article 453 of the Penal Code, abortion was only allowed if the mother's physical health was threatened. An amendment to Morocco's abortion law has recently been approved. The new amendment allows abortion in cases of rape, incest and foetal impairment. The debate on Morocco's abortion law was opened after the Moroccan Association for the Fight against Clandestine Abortion [[AMLAC]] reported that 800 illegal abortions were performed daily nationwide. Dr. [[Chafik Chraibi]], former head of gynaecology and obstetrics at the Matérnité des Orangers in Rabat, Morocco and founder of AMLAC was behind the study.

===Harassment===
Women in Morocco are often forced to endure daily harassment whenever they go out in public. Often the sexual harassment takes the form of [[name calling]]s, such as "whore" or even catcalling. To fight this abusive [[misogynist]]ic culture, a number of Moroccan women have stood up to their abusers. Women are also subject to the male gaze by both young and old men in the streets. The culture of sitting at a café had been dominated by men for a long time. It is only during the recent two decades that seeing women mixing with men in cafés in urban cities; Marrakech, Tangier, Rabat or Casablanca became socially acceptable. There is also a demand to uphold the law to ensure the safety of women, and to punish the abuser. Despite the fact that there is a law that protects women from abuse, the real problem is that there is no tangible intention to pursue or apply it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Moroccan women fighting daily sexual harassment | work = BBC News | date = 10 October 2016 | url =https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37589687 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 a law went into effect throughout Morocco known as the Hakkaoui law because [[Bassima Hakkaoui]] drafted it; it includes a ban on sexual harassment in public places, as well as a ban on forced marriage and harsher penalties for certain forms of violence. But it was criticized for requiring victims to file for criminal prosecution to get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45496337 |title=Morocco bans forced marriage and sexual violence - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Forum for Democratization in Asia''' ('''WFDA''') was set up in 2005 to enhance political development and conduct [[democracy]] promotion activities in Asia. WFDA's secretariat is based in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] at the [[Taiwan Foundation for Democracy]] (TFD). WFDA has organized several conferences between various civil society organizations, most notably its Biennial Conferences.

==Biennial Conferences==
The first Biennial was held in Taipei, Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2005/09/09/68302/Taipei-to.htm |title=Taipei to host 1st democracy forum |publisher=The China Post |date=2005-09-09 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed to "discuss and adopt guidelines to promote the solidarity of Asian democracies, support democracy activists who are opposed to authoritarian regimes, and solicit support from the international community on democratization in Asia" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/news/2005/09/11/68403/Taipei-to.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

The second Biennial was held in Manila, Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view/20070919-89545/Forum_sounds_call_for_Asia_democracy |title=Forum sounds call for Asia democracy - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The third Biennial was held in Seoul, South Korea around the eve of World Democracy Day. A brief controversy ensued when South Korea decided to bar the entry of an Uigyhur activist of German nationality that was scheduled to attend the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramstad |first=Evan |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125315699135218743 |title=South Korea Bars Uighur Activist - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2009-09-18 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
