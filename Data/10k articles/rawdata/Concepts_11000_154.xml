Emotional '''abandonment''' is a subjective emotional state in which people feel undesired, left behind, insecure, or discarded.  People experiencing emotional abandonment may feel at a loss, cut off from a crucial source of sustenance that has been withdrawn, either suddenly, or through a process of erosion.  

In a classic abandonment scenario, the severance of the emotional bond is unilateral, that is,  the object of one's attachment is the one who chose to break the connection. Feeling rejected, which is a significant component of emotional abandonment, has a biological impact in that it activates the [[pain sensation|physical pain centers]] of the brain and can leave an emotional imprint in the brain's warning system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Eisenberger |first= Naomi I |author-link= Naomi Eisenberger |last2= Lieberman |first2= Matthew D |author-link2= Matthew Lieberman |date= July 2004 |title= Why rejection hurts: a common neural alarm system for physical and social pain |journal= [[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]|publisher= Elsevier |volume= 8 |issue= 7 |pages= 294–300 |doi= 10.1016/j.tics.2004.05.010 |issn= 1364-6613 |pmid= 15242688}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abandonment has been a staple of poetry and literature since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lipking |first= Lawrence |date= 1988 |title= Abandoned Women and Poetic Tradition |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-2264-8452-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;



== Impairment &amp; Treatment Considerations ==

Individuals who experience feelings of emotional abandonment may also experience a broad range of maladaptive thoughts and behaviors (e.g., depressive symptoms, relationship avoidance or relationship dependence) that may be a significant source of difficulty in daily life, particularly in the context of interpersonal relationships and social settings&lt;ref name = blattzuroff&gt;Blatt, S.J. &amp; Zuroff, D.C. (1992). Interpersonal relatedness and self-definition: Two prototypes for depression. Clinical Psychology Review, 12(5), 527-562. doi.org/10.1016/0272-7358(92)90070-O &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, T. &amp; Chan, D.K.S. (2012). How anxious and avoidant attachment affect romantic relationship quality differently: A meta‐analytic review. European Journal of Social Psychology, 42(4), 406-419. doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.1842&lt;/ref&gt;. Such difficulties may impair one's ability to establish and/or maintain close and meaningful relationships with others&lt;ref name = blattzuroff/&gt;&lt;ref name = rosenthaletal&gt;Rosenthal, M.Z., Gratz, K.L., Kosson, D.S., Cheavens, J.S., Lejuez, C.W., &amp; Lynch, T.R. (2008). Borderline personality disorder and emotional responding: A review of the research literature. Clinical Psychology Review, 28(1), 75-91. doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2007.04.001 &lt;/ref&gt;. 
While such maladaptive thoughts and behaviors are sometimes present in the context of certain psychological disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, depression, anxiety disorders), not all individuals who experience feelings of emotional abandonment will meet criteria for such a psychological disorder. These individuals may function within normal limits despite the presence of these emotional difficulties&lt;ref name = dsm5&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = rosenthaletal/&gt;

Feelings of emotional abandonment alone are not enough to merit a diagnosis for a psychological disorder.  Such feelings should only be considered by a mental health professional in conjunction with all available information and diagnostic criterion prior to drawing conclusions about the state of someone's mental health.&lt;ref name = dsm5/&gt; When treatment is deemed appropriate by a mental health professional, there are several treatment plans that are helpful in improving maladaptive thoughts and behaviors commonly manifested in those who feel emotionally abandoned. For example, [[Cognitive_behavioral_therapy|Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)]] is effective in treating depression, anxiety disorders, and PTSD.&lt;ref name = psychtreat&gt;{{cite web|title = Psychological Treatments|date =2016|work= Division 12 of the American Psychological Association|url =  https://www.div12.org/treatments/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emotionally_focused_therapy|Emotion Focused Therapy (EFT)]] is effective in treating depression.&lt;ref name = psychtreat/&gt;  [[Dialectical_behavior_therapy|Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)]] is effective in treating negative emotionality and impulsive behaviors commonly seen in those diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder&lt;ref name = nolenhoeksema&gt;Nolen-Hoeksema, S. (2014). Abnormal psychology (6th ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Education. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Psychological Treatments. (2016). In Division 12 of the American Psychological Association. Retrieved from https://www.div12.org/treatments/ &lt;/ref&gt;. Another form of therapy that is suited to this population is [[Acceptance_and_commitment_therapy|Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)]]. ACT focuses on an individual's avoidance of painful emotions and memories. ACT techniques are designed to cultivate thought processes that are focused on being present in the moment and accepting uncomfortable or painful thoughts and feelings. Reframing maladaptive perceptions of one's thoughts to adaptive perceptions of thoughts and committing to aligning one's behaviors with one's goals and values is fundamental to ACT treatment.&lt;ref name = nolenhoeksema/&gt;  Just like the process of arriving at diagnostic conclusions, all modes of therapy and treatment plans should be based on individual presentation and should be evaluated by a mental health professional before beginning treatment.

== Separation anxiety ==
{{Main|Separation anxiety disorder}}

Separation anxiety, a substrate of emotional abandonment, is recognized as a primary source of human distress and dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last= Fromm |first= Erich  |author-link= Erich Fromm |date= 1989 |title= The Art of Loving |title-link= The Art of Loving |location= New York |publisher= Harper &amp; Row |isbn= 978-0-0609-1594-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When we experience a threat or disconnection within a primary attachment, it triggers a fear response referred to as separation stress or separation anxiety.&lt;ref name="Hofer 1995"&gt;Hofer, Myron. "An Evolutionary Perspective on Anxiety." In Anxiety as Symptom and Signal, edited by S. Roose and R. Glick. Hillsdale: Analytic Press, 1995. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Separation stress has been the subject of extensive research in psychological&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Colin |first= Virginia L |date= 1996 |title= Human Attachment |location= Philadelphia |publisher=  Temple University Press |isbn= 978-1-5663-9459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and neurobiological&lt;ref&gt;Coe, Christopher, Sandra Wiener, Leon Rosenbert, and Seymour Levine. "Endocrine and Immune Response to Separation and Maternal Loss in Nonhuman Primates." In The Psychobiology of Attachment and Separation, edited by Martin Reite and Tiffany Field. San Diego: Academic Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; fields, and has been shown to be a universal response to separation in the animal world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Masson |first= Jeffrey |author-link= Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson |last2= McCarthy |first2= Susan |date= 2010 |title= When Elephants Weep: The Emotional Lives of Animal |publisher= Random House |isbn=978-1-4090-0176-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which human beings are a part.  When [[laboratory rat]] pups are separated from their mothers for periods of time, researchers measure their distress vocalizations and [[stress hormones]] to determine varying conditions of the separation response.&lt;ref name="Hofer 1995" /&gt;  As the rats mature, their subsequent reactive behaviors and stress hormones are reexamined and are shown to bear a striking resemblance to the [[Depression (clinical)|depression]], [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]], [[avoidance behavior]]s, and self defeated posturing displayed by human beings known to have suffered earlier separation traumas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Sapolsky|Sapolsky, Robert M.]], Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company, 1994 and Sapolsky, "Social Subordinance as a Marker of Hypercortisolism," Social Subordinance, Annals New York Academy of Sciences, pp. 626-638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the [[neocortical]] component of human functioning, when human beings lose a primary relationship, they grasp its potential repercussions (i.e. they may feel uncertain about the future or fear being unable to climb out of an abyss), thus encumbering an additional layer of separation stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Baumeister |first= Roy F |author-link= Roy Baumeister |last2= Leary |first2= Mark R |author-link2= Mark Leary |date= 1995 |title= The need to belong: desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation |journal= Psychological Bulletin |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume= 117 |issue= 3 |pages= 497–529|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497 |issn= 0033-2909 |pmid= 7777651}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To abandon is "to withdraw one's support or help from, especially in spite of duty, allegiance, or responsibility; desert: abandon a friend in trouble."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Abandonment Free Dictionary: "Abandonment"]&lt;/ref&gt; When the loss is due to the object's voluntary withdrawal, a common response is to feel unworthy of love.  This indicates the tendency for people to blame the rejection on themselves.  "Am I unworthy of love, destined to grow old and die all alone, bereft of human connection or caring?"  Questioning one's desirability as a mate&lt;ref name="Vormbrock 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vormbrock |first= Julia K |date= 1993 |title= Attachment theory as applied to wartime and job-related marital separation |journal= Psychological Bulletin |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume= 114 |issue= 1 |pages= 122–144 |doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.122 |issn= 0033-2909}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fearing eternal isolation are among the additional anxieties incurred in abandonment scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rogers |first= Carl Ransom |author-link= Carl Rogers |date= 1980 |title= A Way of Being |location= Boston |publisher= Houghton Mifflin |isbn= 9780395299159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concurrence of self devaluation and primal fear distinguish abandonment grief from most other types of [[Grief|bereavement]].

== Psychological trauma ==
{{Main|Psychological trauma}}

The depression of abandonment grief creates a sustained type of stress that constitutes an emotional trauma which can be severe enough to leave an emotional imprint on individuals' psychobiological functioning, affecting future choices and responses to rejection, loss, or disconnection.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk 1996"&gt;{{cite book |last= van der Kolk |first= Bessel A |author-link= Bessel van der Kolk |last2= McFarlane |first2= Alexander C |last3= Weisæth |first3= Lars |author-link3= Lars Weisæth |date= 1996 |title= Traumatic Stress: The Effects of Overwhelming Experience on Mind, Body, and Society |location= New York |publisher= Guilford Press |isbn= 978-1-5723-0088-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A contributing factor to the trauma-producing event is that 'being left' triggers primal separation fear, also referred to as primal abandonment fear – the fear of being left with no one to take care of one's vital needs.  Our first [[anxiety]] is a response to separation from Mother.&lt;ref&gt;Hofer, Myron. "An Evolutionary Perspective on Anxiety," in Anxiety as Symptom and Signal, pages 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  This sensation is stored in the [[amygdala]] – a structure set deep into the brain's emotional memory system responsible for conditioning the [[Fight-or-flight response|fight/freeze/flight response]] to fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= LeDoux  |first= Joseph E |author-link= Joseph E. LeDoux |date= June 1994 |title= Emotion, Memory and the Brain |journal= Scientific American |volume= 270 |issue= 6 |pages= 50–57 |jstor= 24942732 |issn= 0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primal fear may have been initiated by birth trauma and even have some prenatal antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Smotherman |first= William P |last2= Robinson |first2= Scott R |date= 1996 |title= The development of behavior before birth |journal= Developmental Psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume= 32 |issue= 3 |pages= 425-434 |doi= 10.1037/0012-1649.32.3.425 |issn= 0012-1649}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional memory system is fairly intact at or before birth and lays down traces of the sensations and feelings of the infant's separation experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Decasper  A. ]., and W. P. Fif. "Of Human Bonding: Newborns Prefer Their Mother's Voices," Science 208, no. 4448 (June 6, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;  These primitive feelings are reawakened by later events, especially those reminiscent of unwanted or abrupt separations from a source of [[sustenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = LeDoux|first= Joseph|title = The Emotional Brain: The Mysterious Underpinnings of Emotional Life|location= New York|publisher = Simon and Schuster|date = 1998|isbn = 9780684836591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[adult]]hood, being left arouses primal fear along with other primitive sensations which contribute to feelings of terror and outright panic.  Infantile needs and urgencies reemerge and can precipitate a symbiotic regression in which individuals feel, at least momentarily, unable to survive without the lost object.&lt;ref name="Vormbrock 1993" /&gt;  People may also experience the intense stress of helplessness.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Helplessness: On Depression, Development and Death. San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; When they make repeated attempts to compel their loved one to return and are unsuccessful, they feel helpless and inadequate to the task.  This helplessness causes people to feel possessed of what [[Michael Balint]] calls “a limited capacity to perform the work of conquest – the work necessary to transform an indifferent object into a participating partner.”   According to Balint, feeling one's ‘limited capacity’ is traumatic in that it produces a fault line in the psyche which renders the person vulnerable to heightened emotional responses within primary relationships.&lt;ref name="Balint 1992"&gt;Balint, Michael. The Basic Fault: Therapeutic Aspects of Regression. Evanston: North Western University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another factor contributing to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing one's background object.   A background object is someone on whom individuals have come to rely in ways they did not realize until the object is no longer present.&lt;ref&gt;Winnecott, Donald W. "The Capacity to be Alone." In The Maturational Processes and the Facilitating Environment: Studies in the Theory of Emotional Development. Madison: International Universities Press, 1965 ; Robertiello, Richard, and Terril T. Gagnier, PhD. "Sado-masochism as a Defense Against Merging: Six Case Studies." Journal of Contemporary Psychotherapy 23, no. 3 (1993) pp. 183-192.&lt;/ref&gt;   For instance, the relationship served as a mutual regulatory system. Multiple psychobiological systems helped to maintain individuals’ equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1992"&gt;Weiner, Herbert. Perturbing the Organism: The Biology of Stressful Experience. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  As members of a couple, they became external regulators for one another. They were attuned on many levels: their pupils dilated in synchrony, they echoed one another's speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and [[EEG]] rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;Tiffany Field, "Attachment as Psychobiological Attunement: Being on the Same Wavelength," in The Psychobiology of Attachment and Separation, pp. 445-448.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a couple, they functioned like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other's bio rhythms, responding to one another's [[pheromone]]s,&lt;ref&gt;L. Monti-Bloch, and B. I. Grosser, "Effect of Putative Pheromones on the Electrical Activity of the Human Vomeronasal Organ and Alfactory Epithilium," Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 1001.&lt;/ref&gt; and addicting to the steady trickle of [[endogenous opiate]]s induced by the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Pert, Candace B. Molecules of Emotion. New York: Scribner, 1997’ and Panksepp, Jaak, Eric Nelson, and Marni Bekkedal. "Brain Systems for the Mediation of Separation Distress and Social Reward." Annals NY Academy of Sciences 807 (1997) 78-100.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the relationship ends, the many processes it helped to regulate go into disarray.&lt;ref name="Weiner 1992" /&gt; As the emotional and bio-physiological effects mount, the stressful process is heightened by the knowledge that it was not you, but your loved one who chose withdraw from the bond.&lt;ref name="Vormbrock 1993" /&gt; This knowledge may cause people to interpret their intense emotional responses to the disconnection as evidence of their putative weakness and ‘limited capacity to perform the work of conquest’.&lt;ref name="Balint 1992" /&gt;

=== Post traumatic stress disorder ===
{{Main|Posttraumatic stress disorder}}

Some people who experience the traumatic stress of abandonment go on to develop post traumatic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel. The Emotional Brain and Emotional Intelligence: New Insights. North Hampton, Mass, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Post traumatic symptoms associated with abandonment include a sequela of heightened emotional reactions (ranging from mild to severe) and habituated defense mechanisms (many of which have become maladaptive) to perceived threats or disruptions to one's sense of self or to one's connections.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Anderson, [https://www.amazon.com/Journey-Abandonment-Healing-Relationship-Beginning/dp/0425172287/ The Journey from Abandonment to Healing: The Five Stages that Accompany the Loss of Love]. Berkley 2000, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various predisposing psycho-biological and environmental factors that go into determining whether one's earlier emotional trauma might lead to the development of a true clinical picture of post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="Van der Kolk 1996" /&gt;  One factor has to do with variation in certain brain structures.  According to [[Jerome Kagan]], some people are born with a [[locus coeruleus]] that tends to produce higher concentrations of [[norepinephrine]], a brain chemical involved in arousal of your body's self-defense response.&lt;ref&gt;Kagan, Jerome. The Nature of a Child. New York: Basic Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would lower their threshold for becoming aroused and make them more likely to become anxious when they encounter stresses in life that are reminiscent of childhood separations and fears, hence making them more prone to becoming posttraumatic.

=== Borderline Personality Disorder ===
{{Main|Borderline personality disorder}}

The most distinguishing symptoms of BPD are marked sensitivity to rejection or criticism, and intense fear of possible abandonment. Overall, the features of BPD include unusually intense sensitivity in relationships with others, difficulty regulating emotions, and impulsivity. Fear of abandonment may lead to overlapping dating relationships as a new relationship is developed to protect against abandonment in the existing relationship. Other symptoms may include feeling unsure of one's personal identity, morals, and values; having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed; depersonalization; and, in moderate to severe cases, stress-induced breaks with reality or psychotic episodes.

=== Autophobia ===
{{Main|Autophobia}}

Autophobia is the [[specific phobia]] of isolation; a morbid fear of being [[egotistical]], or a dread of being alone or isolated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gould | first = Dr. George Milbry | title = The Practitioner's Medical Dictionary | publisher = P. Blackiston's Son &amp; Co | location = Philadelphia | edition = 2nd | year = 1910 | page = 101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufferers need not be physically alone, but just to believe that they are being ignored or unloved.

The law was introduced in the framework of the negotiations for accession to the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=OBCT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Turchia/Turchia-l-accesso-alle-informazioni-ai-tempi-di-Erdogan-178001#26 |title=Turchia: l'accesso alle informazioni ai tempi di Erdoğan |last=Gülseren |first=Adaklı |date=21 February 2017 |website=balcanicaucaso.org |publisher=Osservatorio Balcani Caucaso Transeuropa / Bianet |access-date=21 February 2017 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) Steering Committee designated the inactive status of Turkey with regard to the OGP action plan which included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/turkey|title=Turkey's Action Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership Initiative|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steering Committee found that the Turkish government acted contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/09/21/turkey-made-inactive-open-government-partnership|title=Turkey made inactive in the Open Government Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partneship Initiative|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal Framework ==
In addition to Law No: 4982, in 2004 a circular by the Prime Minister on “The exercise of the right of petition and access to information” was also enacted (Circular No. 25356). It identifies the basis of this policy in the principle called “citizen oriented approach in public services”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bilgiedinmehakki.org/doc/Prime%20Ministry%20Circular%20on%20Right%20to%20Information.pdf|title=The exercise of the right of petition and access to information, Circular 2004/12|last=|first=|date=|website=bilgiedinmehakki.org|series=|location=|orig-year=|publication-place=Official Gazette|publication-date=January 24, 2004|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Law No: 4982, the law applies to any natural and legal person who are entitled to apply to the institutions by way of exercising the right to information. Foreign residents can exercise the right “on the condition that the information that they require is related to them or the field of their activities and on the basis of the [[Reciprocity (international relations)|principle of reciprocity]]”.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilgiedinmehakki.org/doc/Turkey_FOI_2008_Report.pdf|title=Freedom of Information in Turkey: A Critical Assessment of the Implementation and Application of the Turkish Right to Information Act 2003|last=Akdeniz|first=Yaman|date=|website=bilgiedinmehakki.org|publisher=bilgiedinmehakki.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law applies to “any written, printed or copied file, document, book, journal, brochure, etude, letter, software, instruction, sketch, plan, film, photograph, tape and video cassette, map of the institutions and the information, news and other data that are recorded and saved in electronic format that are within the scope of (the) law”.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

Government bodies are required to respond in 15 working days. They must provide either a certified copy of the document or when it is not possible to make a copy, applicants can examine them at the institution.

Initially, the Right to Information Assessment (Review) Council (''[[Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu]]''- BEDK) provided very poor information about its activities and decisions. It started to publish all information on its decision only in 2008 with the launch of its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/default.aspx|title=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu (BEDK)|last=|first=|date=|website=bedk.gov.tr|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EBRD" /&gt; The BEDK jurisdiction on appeals for denials to requests of information was originally limited to cases relating to national security and state economic interests. In November 2005, the Law was amended in order to allow any kind of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beb.aku.edu.tr/bilgi-edinme-birimi/5432-sayili-bilgi-edinme-hakki-kanununda-degisiklik-yapilmasina-dair-kanun/|title=5432 sayılı Bilgi Edinme Hakkı Kanununda Değişiklik Yapılmasına Dair Kanun|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2005|website=beb.aku.edu.tr|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the 2016 EC progress report, the Board of Review of Access to Information was effective in its role of reviewing applicants' appeals and in publishing related decisions online. The report also notes that, however, there is no quality assurance in the responses given to applicants.&lt;ref name="EC"&gt;{{cite journal|date=9 November 2016|title=Turkey 2016 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2016/20161109_report_turkey.pdf|publisher=European Commission|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Decision No. 2016/1 of August 4, 2016 on “Applications for Information on Measures and Transactions within the Context of Emergency State Decentralization Laws”, the applicants who ask for information and documents relating with (i) persons who are removed from the public service and (ii) institutions and organizations which are closed down under the Decree Laws in the State of Emergency Law,  are excluded from the scope of the right to obtain information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedk.gov.tr/kurul-ilke-kararlari.aspx|title=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kuruluna itirazda bulunma süresi hakkında 01/09/2016 tarih ve 2016/2 sayılı İlke Kararı|last=|first=|date=|website=bedk.gov.tr|publisher=Bilgi Edinme Değerlendirme Kurulu|language=Turkish|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 [[European Commission]] (EC) Progress Report on Turkey, the Law on access to public information is not fully aligned with international standards. Another problem highlighted by the EC is the failure to adopt pending legislation on state and trade secrets, which prevents to balance between confidentiality and transparency when assessing freedom of information requests.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

=== Exceptions ===
Under Articles No. 20- 28 of Law No. 4982,  the right to information can be restricted if such information refers to:
* Information and Documents Pertaining the State Secrets, which would clearly cause harm to the security of the state or foreign affairs or national defense and national security;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the Economical Interests of the State, which would harm the economic interests of the state or cause unfair competition or enrichment;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the State Intelligence, regarding the duties and activities of the civil and military intelligence units;
* Information and Documents Pertaining the Administrative Investigation, violating the right of privacy, endangering the security or the life of an individual, jeopardising the security of the investigation, disclosing the source of the information which needs to be kept secret,;
* Information or Documents Pertaining the Judicial Investigation and Prosecution;
* Privacy of the Individuals, which would interfere with the health records, private and family life, honour and dignity, and the economical and professional interests of an individual;
* Privacy of Communication;
* Trade Secrets and Intellectual Property;
* Institutions’ Internal Regulations, Opinions, Information Notes and Recommendations.

In practice, protection of state secrets, commercial secrets and privacy were among the most common grounds for rejecting a request.&lt;ref name="EC2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=10 November 2015|title=Turkey 2015 Report|url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2015/20151110_report_turkey.pdf|publisher=European Commission|access-date=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an expert, all these conditions largely nullify the legal provisions which are intended to protect the right to public information in Turkey.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

== Access to Public Information in Practice ==
The exercise of the right of access to public information is particularly problematic in the Turkish context, where the management of public affairs is characterized by a secretive approach to power and politics, and several problems affect the exercise of the [[Freedom of speech|right of free expression]] and [[media freedom in Turkey|media freedom]].&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt; The situation has been deteriorating with the [[State of emergency|state of exception]] following the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt|attempted coupt of July 15, 2016]], entailing severe limitations to media freedom and to dissemination of information, press freedom limitations, sanctions against newspapers and journalists, censorship and self-censorship.&lt;ref name="OBCT" /&gt;

A right to information request can be made using the BIMER website (''[[Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi]]''), active since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bimer.gov.tr/|title=Başbakanlık İletişim Merkezi (BİMER)|last=|first=|date=|website=bimer.gov.tr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, only 2,7% of requests for access to information were rejected, against 3,4% in 2013.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt; The share of appeals refused by the Board of Review of the Access to Information fell from 50,6% in 2013 to 36,3% in 2014.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt; According to the European Commission, more than 2 million applications a year for access to information were submitted both in 2015 and 2016. The percentage of requests refused remained small, approximately 3.7% up to June 2016 compared with 3% in 2015.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

Regarding the right to access information for lawyers, especially when they are assisting defendants accused with terrorism charges, they face serious problems. Their access to documents pertaining to the case can be restricted before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/HRC/20/19/Add.3|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Mission to Turkey|last=Knaul|first=Gabriela|date=May 4, 2012|editor-last=|website=undocs.org|id=A/HRC/20/19/Add.3|publisher=United Nations, Human Rights Council|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the Steering Committee of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP) designated the inactive status of Turkey, for acting contrary to OGP process for two consecutive action plan cycles. The OGP action plan included, among other objectives, an improvement of the possibility to access public information for Turkish citizens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The decision follows a resolution approved unanimously by the OGP Steering Committee during their May 4, 2016 ministerial level meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. That resolution called for the government of Turkey to take steps to re-engage in OGP, including the development of a National Action with broad civil society participation by September 1, 2016.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

The '''adversarial system''' or '''adversary system''' is a legal system used in the [[common law]] countries where two advocates represent their parties' case or position before an impartial person or group of people, usually a [[jury]] or [[judge]], who attempt to determine the truth and pass judgment accordingly.&lt;ref name="Hale"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hale|first=Sandra Beatriz|title= The Discourse of Court Interpreting: Discourse Practices of the Law, the Witness and the Interpreter |publisher=John Benjamins|date=July 2004|page=31|isbn=978-1-58811-517-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVwg_sQ5a5UC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=%22adversarial+system%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Edward P. |author2=Katharine C.

The adversarial system is the two-sided structure under which [[Criminal procedure|criminal trial]] courts operate that puts the prosecution against the defense.

==History==
Some writers trace the process to the medieval mode of [[trial by combat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proquest.com/ |title=Maintaining the adversarial system: The practice of allowing jurors to question witnesses during trial |author=Kirsten DeBarba |year=2002 |work= |page=55 no. 5 (October 1): 1521–1548 |publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review |accessdate=August 15, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070815103709/http://www.proquest.com/| archivedate= 15 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Strick, ''Injustice for All'' (New York: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1977): 21.&lt;/ref&gt; in which some litigants, notably women, were allowed a champion to represent them. The use of the [[jury]] in the common law system seems to have fostered the adversarial system and provides the opportunity for both sides to argue their point of view.

==Basic features==
As an accused is not compelled to give evidence in a [[crime|criminal]] adversarial proceeding, they may not be questioned by a prosecutor or judge unless they choose to do so. However, should they decide to testify, they are subject to [[cross-examination]] and could be found guilty of [[perjury]]. As the election to maintain an accused person's [[right to silence]] prevents any examination or cross-examination of that person's position, it follows that the decision of counsel as to what evidence will be called is a crucial tactic in any case in the adversarial system and hence it might be said that it is a lawyer's manipulation of the truth. Certainly, it requires the skills of counsel on both sides to be fairly equally pitted and subjected to an impartial judge.

By contrast, while [[defendant]]s in most civil law systems can be compelled to give a statement, this statement is not subject to cross-examination by the prosecutor and not given under oath. This allows the defendant to explain his side of the case without being subject to cross-examination by a skilled opposition. However, this is mainly because it is not the prosecutor but the judges who question the defendant. The concept of "cross"-examination is entirely due to adversarial structure of the common law.

Judges in an adversarial system are impartial in ensuring the fair play of [[due process]], or [[fundamental justice]]. Such judges decide, often when called upon by counsel rather than of their own motion, what [[evidence (law)|evidence]] is to be admitted when there is a dispute; though in some common law jurisdictions judges play more of a role in deciding what evidence to admit into the record or reject. At worst, abusing [[judicial discretion]] would actually pave the way to a biased decision, rendering obsolete the judicial process in question&amp;mdash;[[rule of law]] being illicitly subordinated by [[rule of man]] under such discriminating circumstances.

The [[rules of evidence]] are also developed based upon the system of objections of adversaries and on what basis it may tend to prejudice the [[trier of fact]] which may be the judge or the jury. In a way the rules of evidence can function to give a judge limited inquisitorial powers as the judge may exclude evidence he/she believes is not trustworthy or irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.

All evidence must be relevant and not [[hearsay]] evidence.

Peter Murphy in his ''Practical Guide to Evidence'' recounts an instructive example. A frustrated judge in an English (adversarial) court finally asked a barrister after witnesses had produced conflicting accounts, 'Am I never to hear the truth?' 'No, my lord, merely the evidence', replied counsel.

The name "adversarial system" may be misleading in that it implies it is only within this type of system in which there are opposing prosecution and defense. This is not the case, and both modern adversarial and inquisitorial systems have the powers of the state separated between a prosecutor and the judge and allow the defendant the right to counsel. Indeed, the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]] in Article 6 requires these features in the legal systems of its signatory states.

The [[right to counsel]] in criminal trials was initially not accepted in some adversarial systems. It was believed that the facts should speak for themselves, and that lawyers would just blur the matters. As a consequence, it was only in 1836 that England gave suspects of felonies the formal right to have legal counsel (the [[Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836]]), although in practice English courts routinely allowed defendants to be represented by counsel from the mid-18th century. During the second half of the 18th century advocates like [[William Garrow|Sir William Garrow]] and [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine]] helped usher in the adversarial court system used in most common law countries today. In the United States, however, personally retained counsel have had a right to appear in all federal criminal cases since the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] and in state cases at least since the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], although nearly all provided this right in their state constitutions or laws much earlier. Appointment of counsel for indigent defendants was nearly universal in federal felony cases, though it varied considerably in state cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt6frag7_user.html#amdt6_hd36 |title=CRS/LII Annotated Constitution Sixth Amendment |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1963 that the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] declared that legal counsel must be provided at the expense of the state for indigent felony defendants, under the federal Sixth Amendment, in state courts. See ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'', {{ussc|372|335|1963}}.

One of the most significant differences between the adversarial system and the inquisitorial system occurs when a criminal defendant admits to the crime. In an adversarial system, there is no more controversy and the case proceeds to sentencing; though in many jurisdictions the defendant must have [[allocution]] of her or his crime; an obviously false confession will not be accepted even in common law courts. By contrast, in an inquisitorial system, the fact that the defendant has confessed is merely one more fact that is entered into evidence, and a confession by the defendant does not remove the requirement that the prosecution present a full case. This allows for [[plea bargain]]ing in adversarial systems in a way that is difficult or impossible in inquisitional system, and many felony cases in the United States are handled without trial through such plea bargains.

In some adversarial legislative systems, the court is permitted to make [[inference]]s on an accused's failure to face [[cross-examination]] or to answer a particular question. This obviously limits the usefulness of silence as a tactic by the defense. In England the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 allowed such inferences to be made for the first time in England and Wales (it was already possible in Scotland under the [[rule of criminative circumstances]]). This change was disparaged by critics as an end to the 'right to silence', though in fact an accused still has the right to remain silent and cannot be compelled to take the stand. The criticism reflects the idea that if the accused can be inferred to be guilty by exercising their right to silence, it no longer confers the protection intended by such a right. In the United States, the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] has been interpreted to prohibit a jury from drawing a negative inference based on the defendant's invocation of his right not to testify, and the jury must be so instructed if the defendant requests.

Lord Devlin in ''The Judge'' said: "It can also be argued that two prejudiced searchers starting from opposite ends of the field will between them be less likely to miss anything than the impartial searcher starting at the middle."&lt;ref&gt;P Devlin, ''The Judge'' (Oxford University Press, 1970) 60-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with the inquisitorial approach==
There are many differences in the way cases are reviewed. It is questionable that the results would be different if cases were conducted under the differing approaches; in fact no statistics exist that can show whether or not these systems would come to the same results. However, these approaches are often a matter of national pride and there are opinions amongst jurists about the merits of the differing approaches and their drawbacks as well.

Proponents of the adversarial system often argue that the system is more fair and less prone to abuse than the inquisitional approach, because it allows less room for the state to be biased against the defendant. It also allows most private litigants to settle their disputes in an amicable manner through discovery and pre-trial settlements in which non-contested facts are agreed upon and not dealt with during the trial process.

In addition, adversarial procedure defenders argue that the inquisitorial court systems are overly institutionalized and removed from the average citizen. The common law trial lawyer has ample opportunity to uncover the truth in the courtroom. Most cases that go to trial are carefully prepared through a discovery process that aids in the review of evidence and testimony before it is presented to judge or jury. The lawyers involved have a very good idea of the scope of agreement and disagreement of the issues to present at trial which develops much in the same way as the role of investigative judges.

Proponents of inquisitorial justice dispute these points. They point out that many cases in adversarial systems, and most cases in the United States, are actually resolved by [[plea bargain]] or [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]]. Plea bargain as a system does not exist in an inquisitorial system. Many legal cases in adversarial systems, and most in the United States, do not go to trial, which may lead to injustice when the defendant has an unskilled or overworked attorney, which is likely to be the case when the defendant is poor. In addition, proponents of inquisitorial systems argue that the plea bargain system causes the participants in the system to act in perverse ways, in that it encourages prosecutors to bring charges far in excess of what is warranted and defendants to plead guilty even when they believe that they are not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">In [[geometric topology]], a '''band sum''' of two ''n''-dimensional knots ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional 1-handle ''h'' called a ''band''  is an ''n''-dimensional knot ''K'' such that:

* There is an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional 1-handle ''h'' connected to (''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) embedded in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* There are points &lt;math&gt;p_1\in K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2\in K_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is attached to &lt;math&gt;K_1\sqcup K_2&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;p_1\sqcup p_2&lt;/math&gt;.

''K'' is the ''n''-dimensional knot obtained by this surgery.

A band sum is thus a generalization of the usual [[connected sum]] of knots.

Swiss banking secrecy was first codified with the [[Federal Act on Banks and Savings Banks|Banking Act of 1934]] which made it a crime to disclose client information to third parties without their consent. The law, coupled with a stable Swiss currency and international neutrality, prompted large capital flight to private Swiss accounts. During the 1940s, [[Numbered bank account|numbered bank accounts]] were introduced creating an enduring principle of bank secrecy that continues to be considered one of the main aspects of [[private banking]] globally. Advances in [[financial cryptography]] (via [[public-key cryptography]]) could make it possible to use anonymous electronic money and anonymous digital bearer certificates for financial privacy and [[anonymous Internet banking]], given enabling institutions and secure computer systems.

[[File:Al Capone in 1930.jpg|thumb|185x185px|Mobster [[Al Capone]] was charged with and prosecuted for [[Tax evasion|income tax evasion]] in the 1930s.]]
[[Numbered bank account|Numbered bank accounts]], used by Swiss banks and other offshore banks located in tax havens, have been accused by the international community of being a major instrument of the underground economy, facilitating tax evasion and money laundering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After [[Al Capone]]'s 1931 condemnation for tax evasion, according to journalist [[Lucy Komisar]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;mobster [[Meyer Lansky]] took money from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] slot machines and shifted it to accounts overseas. The Swiss secrecy law two years later assured him of [[G-Man (slang)|G-man]]-proof-banking. Later, he bought a Swiss bank and for years deposited his Havana casino take in Miami accounts, then wired the funds to Switzerland via a network of shell and [[holding company|holding]] companies and offshore accounts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2003/04/offshore-banking-the-secret-threat-to-america/|title=Offshore Banking: The Secret Threat to America|last=Komisar|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2003|website=www.thekomisarscoop.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], told Komisar:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You ask why, if there's an important role for a regulated banking system, do you allow a non-regulated banking system to continue? It's in the interest of some of the moneyed interests to allow this to occur. It's not an accident; it could have been shut down at any time. If you said the US, the UK, the major [[G7]] banks will not deal with offshore bank centers that don't comply with G7 banks regulations, these banks could not exist. They only exist because they engage in transactions with standard banks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45844">'''Civil resistance''' is political action that relies on the use of [[nonviolent resistance]] by civil groups to challenge a particular power, force, policy or [[regime]].&lt;ref&gt;Examples of the use of the term "civil resistance" include [[Erica Chenoweth]] and Maria J. Stephan, [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-15682-0/why-civil-resistance-works ''Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict''], Columbia University Press, New York, 2011; Howard Clark, [https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=Civil+Resistance+in+Kosovo ''Civil Resistance in Kosovo''], Pluto Press, London, 2000; Sharon Erickson Nepstad, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Sociology/SocialMovementSocialChange/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199778218 ''Nonviolent Revolution: Civil Resistance in the Late 20th Century''], Oxford University Press, New York, 2011; [[Michael Randle]], [http://www.civilresistance.info/randle1994 ''Civil Resistance''], Fontana, London, 1994; [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]], [http://www.aeinstein.org/english/ ''Civil Resistance in the East European and Soviet Revolutions''], Albert Einstein Institution, Massachusetts, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil resistance operates through appeals to the adversary, pressure and coercion: it can involve systematic attempts to undermine the adversary's sources of power, both domestic and international. Forms of action have included demonstrations, vigils and petitions; strikes, go-slows, boycotts and emigration movements; and sit-ins, occupations, and the creation of parallel institutions of government. Civil resistance movements' motivations for avoiding violence are generally related to context, including a society's values and its experience of war and violence, rather than to any absolute ethical principle. Cases of civil resistance can be found throughout history and in many modern struggles, against both tyrannical rulers and democratically elected governments.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;This is abstracted from the longer definition of "civil resistance" in Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 2–3. See also the short definition in Gene Sharp, [http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Reference/Subjectareareference/SocialSciences/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199829897 ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts''], Oxford University Press, New York, 2011, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of civil resistance is often associated with the advancement of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the report by Peter Ackerman, Adrian Karatnycky and others, ''How Freedom is Won. From Civil Resistance to Durable Democracy'', Freedom House, New York, 2005 [http://www.freedomhouse.org/uploads/special_report/29.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Civil resistance is a long-standing and widespread phenomenon in human history. Several works on civil resistance adopt a historical approach to the analysis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Include chapters by specialists on nineteen movements between 1917 and 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of civil resistance, both successful and unsuccessful, include:
* [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]'s role in the [[Indian independence movement]] in 1917–47
* [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]'s role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1955–68

* the campaign against Serbian domination in [[Kosovo]], 1990–98, that was followed by war
* the revolutions in [[Bulldozer Revolution|Serbia]] in 2000, [[Rose Revolution|Georgia]] in 2003, and [[Orange Revolution|Ukraine]] in 2004, all of which involved successful resistance against an incumbent government that had refused to acknowledge its defeat in an election and had sought to falsify the election results
* the [[Cedar Revolution]] in [[Lebanon]] in 2005, following the assassination of former prime minister [[Rafic Hariri]] on 14 February 2005, and calling for Syrian military withdrawal from Lebanon

* the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa, starting in [[Tunisia]] in December 2010, and resulting, in 2011, in the fall of rulers in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. In some countries the movements were followed by war (e.g. [[Syrian Civil War]] and [[Yemeni Civil War (2015)|War in Yemen]]) or by a return to military rule, as in [[Egypt]] in 2013 following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]] 
* the [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15-M or ''Indignados'' movement]], which included the peaceful occupation of squares all over Spain in May-June 2011, and a mosaic of other forms of civil disobedience by many of the groups that were created, or strengthened, after the squares occupations. In particular the [[Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca|Platform for People Affected by Mortgages, or PAH]]. 
* the [[Gezi Park protests]] in [[Turkey]] in 2013, in opposition to urban development plans, and also to government encroachments on freedom of expression and on Turkey's secularist traditions
* the early phases of the [[Euromaidan]] protests in [[Ukraine]] in 2013–14, demanding closer integration with European Union countries, and the resignation of President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]
* the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], also known as "Occupy Central" and the "Umbrella movement", opposing the [[2014–15 Hong Kong electoral reform]] in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
* Women's marches in USA from January [[2017 Women's March]] onwards to resist President Donald Trump's allegedly sexist policies. 

Numerous other campaigns, both successful and unsuccessful, could be included in a longer listing. In 1967 [[Gene Sharp]] produced a list of 84 cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Sharp]], "The Technique of Non-violent Action", in Adam Roberts (ed.), ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967, at pp. 98–104.&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this with further surveys.&lt;ref&gt;See for example his discussion of "Illustrations from the Past" in Gene Sharp, ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'' (see [[The Politics of Nonviolent Action|article]]), Porter Sargent, Boston, 1973, pp. 75–97; and his short accounts of numerous cases in Gene Sharp and others, ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle: 20th Century Practice and 21st Century Potential'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 2005, pp. 69–356.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Maciej Bartkowski authored a long list of cases in the past 200 years, arranged alphabetically by country.&lt;ref&gt;"Appendix: Conflict Summaries", in Maciej J. Bartkowski (ed.), ''Recovering Nonviolent History: Civil Resistance in Liberation Struggles'', Lynne Rienner, Boulder, Colorado, 2013, pp. 355–405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
It is not easy to devise a method of proving the relative success of different methods of struggle. Often there are problems in identifying a given campaign as successful or otherwise. In 2008 Maria J. Stephan and [[Erica Chenoweth]] produced a widely-noted article on "Why Civil Resistance Works", the most thorough and detailed analysis (to that date) of the rate of success of civil resistance campaigns, as compared to violent resistance campaigns. After looking at over 300 cases of both types of campaign, from 1900 to 2006, they concluded that "nonviolent resistance methods are likely to be more successful than violent methods in achieving strategic objectives". Their article (later developed into a book) noted particularly that "resistance campaigns that compel loyalty shifts among security forces and civilian bureaucrats are likely to succeed".&lt;ref&gt;Maria J. Stephan and Erica Chenoweth, "Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", ''International Security'', vol. 33, no. 1 (Summer 2008), p. 42. {{ISSN|0162-2889}}[http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html]. (See also their 2011 book, ''Why Civil Resistance Works'', listed below in the bibliography.)&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the evidence of several of the 2011 uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa appears to provide contrasting pathways by which this logic may fail to materialise, with splits in the armed forces contributing towards civil war in Libya and Syria, and a shift in armed forces loyalty in Egypt failing to contribute towards enduring democratic reform.&lt;ref&gt;T. R. Davies, "The failure of strategic nonviolent action in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya and Syria: ‘political ju-jitsu’ in reverse", ''Global Change, Peace and Security'', vol. 26, no. 3 (2014), pp. 299–313. {{ISSN|1478-1158}} {{DOI|10.1080/14781158.2014.924916}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of the central thesis of the book on ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' have included: 
# Forming judgements about whether a campaign is a success or failure is inherently difficult: the answer may depend on the time-frame used, and on necessarily subjective judgments about what constitutes success. Some of the authors' decisions on this are debatable. Similar difficulties arise in deciding whether a campaign is violent or non-violent, when on the ground both strategies may co-exist in several ways.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Masullo Jimenez, review of ''Why Civil Resistance Works'' on ''Global Policy'' website, 29 November 2013. [http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/29/11/2013/book-review-why-civil-resistance-works-strategic-logic-nonviolent-conflict-erica-che].&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Regimes transitioning from autocracy to democracy tend to be highly unstable, so an initial success for a movement may be followed by a more general failure.&lt;ref&gt;David Cortright, review on E-International Relations website, 17 January 2013. [http://www.e-ir.info/2013/01/17/review-why-civil-resistance-works/]&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Perhaps, more generally, sufficient account is not taken of the possibility that violence often takes place in circumstances that were already violent and chaotic, stacking the odds against any successful outcome for violence.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, "Terrorism Research: Past, Present and Future", ''Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism'', vol. 38, no. 1, January 2015, pp. 62–74. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1057610X.2014.976011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for choosing to use civil resistance==
[[File:Aung San Suu Kyi greeting supporters from Bago State.jpg|thumb|[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], Burmese pro-democracy leader, greeting supporters from Bago State, Burma, 14 August 2011. She has stated that she was attracted to non-violent civil resistance, not on moral grounds, but "on practical political grounds". ''Photo: Htoo Tay Zar'']]Some leaders of civil resistance struggles have urged the use of non-violent methods for primarily ethical reasons, while others have emphasized practical considerations. Some have indicated that both of these types of factor have to be taken into account – and that they necessarily overlap.

In his chapter on "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence" [[Martin Luther King]] gave a notably multi-faceted account of the various considerations, experiences and influences that constituted his "intellectual odyssey to nonviolence". By 1954 this had led to the intellectual conviction that "nonviolent resistance was one of the most potent weapons available to oppressed people in their quest for social justice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Luther King]], ''Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story'', Ballantine Books, New York, 1960, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have opted for civil resistance when they were in opposition to the government, but then have later, when in government, adopted or accepted very different policies and methods of action. For example, in one of her [[BBC]] [[Reith Lectures]], first broadcast in July 2011, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], the pro-democracy campaigner in [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma), stated: "Gandhi's teachings on non-violent civil resistance and the way in which he had put his theories into practice have become part of the working manual of those who would change authoritarian administrations through peaceful means. I was attracted to the way of non-violence, but not on moral grounds, as some believe. Only on practical political grounds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aung San Suu Kyi]], second BBC Reith Lecture, "Dissent", first broadcast 5 July 2011, transcript available at  [http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/radio4/transcripts/2011_reith2.pdf BBC website].&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, as State Counsellor of Myanmar from 2016 onwards, she incurred much criticism, especially in connection with the failure to prevent, and to condemn, the killings and expulsions of the [[Rohingya people]] in [[Rakhine State]].

==Relationship to other forms of power==
The experience of civil resistance suggests that it can at least partially replace other forms of power. Some have seen civil resistance as offering, potentially, a complete alternative to power politics. The core vision is of non-violent methods replacing armed force in many or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gene Sharp]], ''Social Power and Political Freedom'', Porter Sargent, Boston, 1980, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several writers, while sharing the vision of civil resistance as progressively overcoming the use of force, have warned against a narrowly instrumental view of non-violent action. For example, [[Joan Bondurant|Joan V. Bondurant]], a specialist on the Gandhian philosophy of conflict, indicated concern about "the symbolic violence of those who engage in conflict with techniques which they, at least, perceive to be nonviolent." She saw Gandhian satyagraha as a form of "creative conflict" and as "contrasted both to violence and to methods not violent or just short of violence".&lt;ref&gt;Joan V. Bondurant, "Creative Conflict and the Limits of Symbolic Violence" in Bondurant (ed.), ''Conflict: Violence and Nonviolence'', Aldine, Chicago, 1971, pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally difficult in practice to separate out entirely the use of civil resistance and power-political considerations of various kinds. One frequently-encountered aspect of this problem is that regimes facing opposition taking the form of civil resistance often launch verbal attacks on the opposition in terms designed to suggest that civil resistance is simply a front for more sinister forces. It has sometimes been attacked as being planned and directed from abroad, and as intimately connected to terrorism, imperialism, communism etc. A classic case was the Soviet accusation that the 1968 Prague Spring, and the civil resistance after the Soviet-led invasion of August 1968, were the result of Western machinations.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 21–23 (chapter by Roberts), 93 (Kramer) and 386n. (Garton Ash).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, President [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria, in March 2011, accused "enemies" of using "very sophisticated tools" to undermine Syria's stability; and President [[Vladimir Putin]] of Russia, in speeches in 2014, described events in Ukraine and the Arab countries as foreign-influenced.&lt;ref&gt;These accusations by Presidents Assad and Putin are cited and discussed in Adam Roberts, Michael J. Willis, Rory McCarthy and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oqXTCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT105 ''Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring: Triumphs and Disasters''], Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2016, pp. 277–80, 314–17 (chapter by Roberts).&lt;/ref&gt; Such accusations of sinister power-political involvement are often presented without convincing evidence.

There can be some more plausible connections between civil resistance and other forms of power. Although civil resistance can sometimes be a substitute for other forms of power, it can also operate in conjunction with them. Such conjunction is never problem-free. Michael Randle has identified a core difficulty regarding strategies that seek to combine the use of violent and non-violent methods in the same campaign: "The obvious problem about employing a mixed strategy ''in the course of an actual struggle'' is that the dynamics of military and civil resistance are at some levels diametrically opposed to each other."&lt;ref&gt;Randle, ''Civil Resistance'', p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the connections between civil resistance and other forms of power are not limited to the idea of a "mixed strategy". They can assume many forms.&lt;ref&gt;A pioneering exploration of certain examples of connections between non-violent resistance and other forms of power is in Kurt Schock, [https://www.amazon.com/Unarmed-Insurrections-Movements-Nondemocracies-Contention/dp/0816641935 ''Unarmed Insurrections: People Power Movements in Nondemocracies''], Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005, especially at pp. 153–62. A more general discussion of this question is in Adam Roberts, "Introduction", in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], especially at pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight ways in which civil resistance can in practice relate to other forms of power are identified here, with examples in each case:
#Civil resistance is often a response to changes in constellations of power. Leaders of civil resistance campaigns have often been acutely aware of power-political developments, both domestic and international.&lt;ref&gt;Schock, ''Unarmed Insurrections'', pp. 154–56.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries there has been a growth of civil opposition after, and perhaps in part because of, an occupying or colonial state's internal political turmoil or setbacks in war: for example, this was a key factor in the Finnish struggle of 1898–1905 against Russian control.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Duncan Huxley, ''Constitutional Insurgency in Finland: Finnish "Passive Resistance" against Russification as a Case of Nonmilitary Struggle in the European Resistance Tradition'', SHS, Helsinki, 1990, p. 225, where Jonas Castrén, a key figure in the constitutional insurgency, is cited as emphasizing the central importance of understanding current events in Russia and their importance for the Finnish struggle. "He exclaimed that now was the time for Finns to rise up in mass struggle."&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries the problems faced by their own armed forces, whether against conventional armies or guerrillas, played some part in the development of civil resistance: for example, in the [[People Power Revolution]] in the Philippines in 1983–86.&lt;ref&gt;Amado Mendoza, "‘People Power'" in the Philippines, 1983–86’ in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 179–96, where he discusses at pp. 186–89 the competitive relationship between the violent and non-violent anti-dictatorship movements.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Civil resistance campaigns frequently lead to a situation of partial stalemate, in which negotiation between civil resisters and those in positions of governmental power is perceived as essential. Hence, "round table talks" were critically important in the Indian independence struggle up to 1947, in [[Polish Round Table Talks|Solidarity's campaign in Poland up to 1989]], and in Ukraine in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;These three cases of round table talks are outlined by Judith Brown, Alexander Smolar and Andrew Wilson respectively in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 47, 55 (India), 136–43 (Poland), and 350–53 (Ukraine).&lt;/ref&gt;
#The relation between civil resistance and the military [[coup d'état]] can be especially multi-faceted. In some cases a civil resistance campaign has been an effective response to a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Adam Roberts (scholar) |first=Adam |last=Roberts |title=Civil Resistance to Military Coups |journal=Journal of Peace Research |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=1975 |pages=19–36 |doi= 10.1177/002234337501200102|jstor=422898 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases a campaign could succeed in its final objective—e.g. the removal of a hated regime—only when there was the reality or the threat of a military coup to bring about the desired change. Thus, the 1963 [[Buddhist crisis]] in South Vietnam a long civil resistance campaign against the government resulted in change only when the [[1963 South Vietnamese coup|South Vietnamese army coup]] of 1–2 November 1963 toppled President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Shaplen |title=The Lost Revolution: Vietnam 1945–1965 |publisher=Andre Deutsch |location=London |year=1966 |pages=188–212 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Egypt in June–July 2013, a civil resistance movement in effect called for a military coup: peaceful demonstrators and a petition supported by millions of signatures demanded the replacement of the elected Muslim Brotherhood government, and provided a degree of revolutionary legitimacy for the army take-over of 3 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[M. Cherif Bassiouni]], [http://www.mcherifbassiouni.com/wp-content/uploads/Egypt-Update-27.pdf Egypt Update no. 27], 19 February 2014, paragraphs 8–9, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  At least one non-violent campaign, the [[Carnation Revolution|Revolution of the Carnations]] in Portugal in 1974–75, was in support of a military coup that had already occurred: this campaign helped to steer Portugal in a democratic direction.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Maxwell, ‘Portugal: "The Revolution of the Carnations", 1974–75’, in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 144–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some non-violent campaigns can be seen as reluctant or unwitting harbingers of violence. They may be followed by the emergence of groups using armed force and/or by military intervention from outside the territory concerned. This can happen if, for example, they (a) are perceived as failures, or (b) are repressed with extreme violence, or (c) succeed in removing a regime but then leave a power vacuum in its place. Processes of the first two of these kinds happened, for example, in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1967–72 and in [[Kosovo]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Cases of perceived failure of civil resistance being followed by armed campaigns and military intervention are outlined by Richard English and Howard Clark in Roberts and Garton Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics''], pp. 75–90 (Northern Ireland) and 277–94 (Kosovo).&lt;/ref&gt; Processes of the third kind, involving some forms of power vacuum, included [[Libya]] from 2011 onwards, and [[Yemen]] from 2012 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Cases of armed interventions in areas where there had been an absence of governance in at least parts of a country are outlined by George Joffé and Helen Lackner in Roberts, Willis, McCarthy and Garton Ash, ''Civil Resistance in the Arab Spring: Triumphs and Disasters'', pp. 134–40 (Libya) and 160–68 (Yemen).&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of such developments can be an inducement to a government to bargain with a non-violent movement before things get out of hand. However, in several countries in the Middle East and North Africa in 2011 and after, campaigns by civil resistance movements were followed by violent internal conflict and civil war, often with the involvement of external forces: Syria is the most tragic case.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]], ''Strategic Survey 2013'', London, 2013, pp. 179–84.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Vaclav Havel IMF.jpg|thumb|[[Václav Havel]], impresario of civil resistance in the years leading up to the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]]. In April 1991, as President of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, he praised the NATO military alliance; and on 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic (with Havel still as President) joined the alliance. He is seen here on 26 September 2000. ''Photo: IMF'']]
#There have also been some cases of certain uses of force by civil resistance movements, whether against their adversaries, or to maintain internal discipline. For example, on 2 February 2011, in the generally peaceful [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|Egyptian struggle against President Mubarak]], some groups among the crowds in [[Tahrir Square]] in Cairo did use certain forms of force for a defensive purpose when they were attacked by pro-regime thugs, some of whom were riding on horses and camels.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Khalili, ‘The two sets of protesters were left to fight it out,’ ''The Guardian'', London, 3 February 2011, provides an eye-witness account of the events of 2 February. Also available at [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/02/cairo-clashes].&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent days the crowds in Tahrir Square reverted to using non-violent methods.
#Some civil resistance movements have sought, or welcomed, a measure of armed protection for their activities. Thus in the American civil rights movement of the 1960s, the [[Freedom Rides|Freedom Ride]] of May 1961, having been opposed violently, received armed protection for part of its hazardous journey;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Peck (pacifist)|James Peck]], ''Freedom Ride'', Grove Press, New York, 1962, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Selma to Montgomery March]] of March 1965 only succeeded in reaching Montgomery, Alabama, at the third attempt, when it was protected by troops and federal agents.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Williams, ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years, 1954–1965'', Viking Press, New York, 1987, p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Some campaigns of civil resistance may depend up the existence of militarily defended space. A life-saving example of an effective civil resistance enabling threatened people to reach a defended space occurred with the [[Rescue of the Danish Jews]] in 1943 when thousands of Jews were spirited out of German-occupied Denmark and across a narrow stretch of sea (the Sound) to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Semelin, ''Unarmed Against Hitler: Civilian Resistance in Europe, 1939–1943'', Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, 1993, pp. 151–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
#When leaders of even the most determinedly non-violent movements have come to power in their countries, they have generally accepted the continued existence of armed forces and other more or less conventional security arrangements. For example, in 1991 [[Václav Havel]] who had been a leading figure in civil resistance in communist Czechoslovakia from the founding of [[Charter 77]] to the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, in his new capacity as President of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic paid tribute to the [[NATO]] alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Václav Havel]], address to NATO Council, 21 March 1991, ''NATO Review'', Brussels, April 1991, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 1999 the Czech Republic, along with Poland and Hungary, became a member of NATO.

==Proposals for defence by civil resistance==
The promise of civil resistance as a means of opposing oppressive rule has led to many proposals that countries might rely, in whole or in part, on civil resistance as a means of defence against external attack (for example, invasion) and internal usurpation (for example, [[coup d'état]]). Preparations for such resistance are sometimes seen as potentially helping to deter such threats in the first place. Various terms have been used to describe either the policy of relying on such non-military action by a society or social group, or the general phenomenon of sustained country-wide campaigns against outside attack or dictatorial rule. These terms - all near-synonyms - include "defence by civil resistance", "non-violent defence", "civilian defence", "civilian-based defence", and "[[social defence]]". For further information and references to some relevant literature, see [[social defence]].

==The term "civil resistance": merits and concerns==
[[File:Gandhi suit.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]] in South Africa in about 1906–1909. Referring to his years there, he later wrote: "... I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance."]]The term is not new. [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]] used it in many of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], "The Momentous Issue", ''Young India'', 10 November 1921; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 25, pp. 76–78. [http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL025.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he wrote: "... I found that even civil disobedience failed to convey the full meaning of the struggle. I therefore adopted the phrase civil resistance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], letter to P. Kodanda Rao, 10 September 1935; in ''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'', electronic edition, vol. 67, p. 400.[http://www.gandhiserve.org/cwmg/VOL067.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a near-synonym for [[nonviolent resistance]], [[civil disobedience]], [[People Power Revolution|people power]] and [[satyagraha]]. While each of these terms has its uses and connotations, "civil resistance" is one appropriate term to use in cases where the resistance has a civic quality, relating to a society as a whole; where the action involved is not necessarily disobedience, but instead involves supporting the norms of a society against usurpers; where the decision not to use violent methods is not based on a general philosophy of [[nonviolence]], but on a wide range of prudential, ethical and legal considerations; and where the technical and communications infrastructure of modern civil societies provides a means of organizing resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Fabien Miard, ''Mobile Phones as a Tool for Civil Resistance: Case Studies from Serbia and Belarus'', DigiActive Research Series, June 2009. 
[http://www.digiactive.org/wp-content/uploads/research3_miard.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of such considerations, the term has been used in this century in many analyses in academic journals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, by {{cite journal |first=Maria J. |last=Stephan |first2=Erica |last2=Chenoweth |title=Why Civil Resistance Works: The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict |journal=International Security |volume=33 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=7–44 |issn=0162-2889 |url=http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/18407/why_civil_resistance_works.html |doi=10.1162/isec.2008.33.1.7}} And {{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Ackerman |first2=Berel |last2=Rodal |title=The Strategic Dimensions of Civil Resistance |journal=Survival |volume=50 |issue=3 |year=2008 |pages=111–25 |url=http://www.david-kilgour.com/2008/pdf/misc/50-3%2010%20Ackerman%20Author%20Proof.pdf |doi=10.1080/00396330802173131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What exactly are the advantages of the term "civil resistance", as distinct from its near-synonyms "non-violent action" and "[[non-violent resistance]]"? All these terms have merits, and refer to largely the same phenomena. Indeed, there is a long history, in many languages, of using a wide variety of terms to describe these phenomena. The term "civil resistance" has been used increasingly for two main reasons:
#It emphasises the positive (civic goals; widespread civil society involvement; and civil as distinct from uncivil conduct) rather than the negative (avoidance of the use of violence).
#It conveys, more effectively perhaps than such terms as "[[nonviolent resistance]]", that a movement's avoidance of violence in pursuit of a particular cause is not necessarily tied to a general belief in "[[nonviolence]]" in all circumstances, nor to a philosophy of "[[Gandhism]]", but rather arises from the particular values and circumstances of the society concerned.

There have been concerns that the term "civil resistance" might on occasion be misused, or at least stretched in a highly controversial way, to encompass acts of violence. Thus, arising from experience within the [[anti-globalization movement]], one participant-observer has seen "new forms of civil resistance" as being associated with a problematic departure from a previously more widely shared commitment to maintaining non-violent discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Janet |last=Conway |title=Civil Resistance and the 'Diversity of Tactics' in the Anti-Globalization Movement: Problems of Violence, Silence, and Solidarity in Activist Politics |journal=Osgoode Hall Law Journal |volume=41 |issue=2 &amp; 3 |year=2003 |pages=505–17 |url=http://www.ohlj.ca/archive/articles/41_23_conway.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these concerns, those who have used the term "civil resistance" have tended to emphasise its non-violent character, and to use it in addition to – and not in substitution of – such terms as "non-violent resistance".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''conditionality principle''' is a Fisherian principle of [[statistical inference]] that [[Allan Birnbaum]] formally defined and studied in his 1962 [[Journal of the American Statistical Association|JASA]] article. Informally, the conditionality principle can be taken as the claim that experiments which were not actually performed are statistically irrelevant.

Together with the [[sufficiency principle]], Birnbaum's version of the principle implies the famous [[likelihood principle]]. Although the relevance of the proof to data analysis remains controversial among statisticians, many [[Bayesian inference|Bayesians]] and likelihoodists consider the likelihood principle foundational for statistical inference.

==Formulation==

The conditionality principle makes an assertion about an experiment ''E'' that can be described as a mixture of several component experiments ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''h'' is an [[ancillary statistic]] (i.e. a statistic whose probability distribution does not depend on unknown parameter values). This means that observing a specific outcome ''x'' of experiment ''E'' is equivalent to observing the value of ''h'' and taking an observation ''x&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' from the component experiment ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The conditionality principle can be formally stated thus:

'''Conditionality Principle''': If ''E'' is any experiment having the form of a mixture of component experiments ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', then for each outcome &lt;math&gt;(E_h, x_h)&lt;/math&gt; of ''E'', [...] the evidential meaning of any outcome ''x'' of any mixture experiment ''E'' is the same as that of the corresponding outcome ''x&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the corresponding component experiment ''E&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', ignoring the over-all structure of the mixed experiment (See Birnbaum 1962). An illustration of the conditionality principle, in a [[bioinformatics]] context, is given by Barker (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barker | first1 = D | year = 2014 | title = Seeing the wood for the trees: philosophical aspects of classical, Bayesian and likelihood approaches in statistical inference and some implications for phylogenetic analysis | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-014-9455-x | journal = Biology and Philosophy | volume =  30| issue = | pages =  505–525| doi = 10.1007/s10539-014-9455-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contingent self-esteem''' (CSE) is [[self-esteem]] based on the approval of others or on [[Social comparison theory|social comparisons]]. Certain events will shape one's self-esteem when the individual bases their self-worth on the outcome of those events.&lt;ref name="Ups and Downs"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knee|first=Chip|author2=Amber L. Bush |author3=Amy Canevello |author4=Astrid Cook |title=Relationship-Contingent Self-Esteem and the Ups and Downs of Romantic Relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=95 |issue=3|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.608|url=http://www.class.uh.edu/enews/2008/11/__docs/Knee_study.pdf|accessdate=16 October 2011 |pages=608–627 |pmid=18729698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success or failure of any situation can result in fluctuations of an individual's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="Ups and Downs" /&gt; A manifestation of someone with contingent self-esteem is excessive [[self-consciousness]]. Such excessive self-consciousness, as occurs with contingent self-esteem, involves extreme criticism of one's self, concern of how they are perceived by their peers, and feelings of discomfort in social settings.&lt;ref name="Ups and Downs" /&gt; One's [[self-esteem]] is directly affected when domains of [[contingencies]] are used to measure one's [[self worth]]. [[Self-esteem]] can also be affected when an [[individual]] compares their [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  or [[objective (goal)|success]] to that of someone else or when their [[self-esteem]] is [[contingent]] to the [[interpersonal|relationships]] around them.

==Self-esteem and contingent self-worth==
According to William James in his journal ''The Principles of Psychology'', [[self-esteem]] can be a stable and unstable trait.&lt;ref name="self worth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crocker|first=Jennifer|author2=Katherine M. Knight|title=Contingencies of Self-Worth|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2005|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/14/4/200.full.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2011|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00364.x  | volume=14 | pages=200–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; An individual's self-esteem fluctuates in response to different events.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Men and women alike are also selective about which events affect their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; This instability of self-esteem is the result of having contingent [[self worth]].&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Good and bad events can momentarily raise or lower feelings of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Those fluctuations can cause an individual to seek those positive feelings associated with success and avoid the negative feelings associated with failure.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Therefore, contingencies of self-worth have control over one's behavior.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt;

Students who base their self-esteem on their [[academic]] successes use their school work to prove their intelligence.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Since [[objective (goal)|failure]]s in domains of contingency have negative effects on one's self-esteem, students will avoid failure by increasing their effort, by abandoning their goals and becoming completely unmotivated, or by making excuses to lessen the impact on their self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; In [[Jennifer Crocker]]'s journal ''Contingencies of self-worth: Implications for self-regulation and [[psychology|psychological]] [[vulnerability]]'', the author states that contingencies of self-worth are used as a source of [[motivation]] and a [[psychology|psychological]] [[vulnerability]].&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; This means that contingencies of self-worth can cause one to strive for success or weaken one's self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; Contingencies of self-worth are associated with validation of one's abilities in the domain of contingency, and students spend more time on activities related to their specific domains of contingency.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; When individuals have self-validation goals, mistakes, failures, [[criticism]], and [[negative feedback]] are seen as [[threat]]s rather than learning opportunities.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt; A solution would be to replace self-validating goals with learning goals. Adopting goals that are good for the individual as well as others around them may lessen the impact of contingent self-esteem.&lt;ref name="self worth" /&gt;

==Appearance Related Social Comparisons==
People with high levels of CSE are prone to making [[social comparison theory|social comparisons]] based on [[human physical appearance|appearance]] . As a result, these individuals more than often feel diminished.&lt;ref name="SPA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Patrick|first=Heather|author2=Clayton Neighbors |author3=C. Raymond Knee |title=Appearance-Related Social Comparison: The Role of Contingent Self Esteem and Self Perceptions of Attractiveness|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=April 1, 2004|doi=10.1177/0146167203261891|url=http://psp.sagepub.com/content/30/4/501.full.pdf+html|accessdate=19 November 2011|volume=30|pages=501–514}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Appearance Related Social Comparisons''' are comparisons of one's perceived [[human physical appearance|appearance]] to the [[human physical appearance|appearance]] of other people.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Those who make [[social comparison theory|social comparisons]] base their feelings of self-worth on meeting social standards and expectations.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Appearance Related Social Comparisons can affect one's [[self-esteem]] in both positive and negative ways. On the positive side, appearance related social comparisons can help develop and maintain one's level of [[self worth]]. On the negative side, [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  related social comparisons can cause the decline of an individual's [[self worth]] and value.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Women who measure their self-worth based on cultural standards may be affected more by [[social comparison theory|social comparisons]], particularly when they have a low [[Self-perception theory|Self perception]] of [[attractiveness]].&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt;

Images in the media are notorious for creating unrealistic standards of [[beauty]], most especially for women.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Comparisons with [[mass media|media]] standards can cause an individual with high levels of CSE to acquire feelings of inadequacy. Mass media provides examples of beauty that are often unattainable by the average male or female.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Although this is true in most cases, everyone is not equally affected by unrealistic standards of beauty in the media and social comparisons with the people they are surrounded by.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; One's [[Self-perception theory|Self perception]] of [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  is how an individual measures his/her own beauty.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; Women with lower [[Self-perception theory|Self perceptions]] of [[human physical appearance|appearance]]  tend to be more dissatisfied after viewing "ideal" images of women in the media. This same issue can also be seen in the male population but isn't as prevalent and widespread as in the female population.&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt; In the journal "Media Images and Women's Self-evaluations", researchers D. Henderson-King, Henderson-King, and Hoffman demonstrated that the importance that women place on [[physical attractiveness]] is associated with images displayed in the [[mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="SPA" /&gt;

===Body image===
'''Body image''' is a very important developmental concern for children and young adults.&lt;ref name="Body Image"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossbard|first=Joel R.|author2=Christine M. Lee |author3=Clayton Neighbors |author4=Mary E. Larimer |title=Body Image Concerns and Contingent Self Esteem in Male and Female College Students|journal=Sex Roles|date=September 13, 2008|doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9535-y|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/4gm78520r55910j8/|accessdate=15 November 2011 |volume=60 |pages=198–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contingent self-esteem in this area is shown when one's self-image is contingent upon the approval of others, meeting social expectations, or other criteria.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Individuals with higher levels of contingent self-esteem are more likely to view acceptance from others as contingent upon the ideal standard for [[body image]].&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Individuals who base their [[self worth]] upon contingencies of outer image often spend a lot of time trying to reach standards for appearance and obtain social acceptance.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; This constant self-evaluation has a negative relationship on one's [[mental health]].&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt;

[[Body mass index]] (BMI) has a great influence on the attitudes and behaviors in men and women.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Women in the [[western world|westernized society]] believe being thin is the cultural [[norm (social)|norm]], while men are thriving to gain weight and muscles.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Both men and women are striving for a lower BMI in order to fit in with "society".&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; Joel R. Grossbard, Christine M. Lee, Clayton Neighbors, and Mary E. Larimer did a study to investigate gender differences in body image concerns, and the influence of contingent self-esteem on body dissatisfaction.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; The results proved that female college students focused more on weight/body shape, while male students focused on muscularity.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; When the association of contingent self-esteem and weight/body shape was  examined, evidence proved higher levels of contingent self-esteem is more strongly associated with greater concern regarding weight/body shape in females in comparison to males.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt; In contrast, when the association of contingent self-esteem and muscularity was examined, evidence proved higher levels of contingent self-esteem is associated more with greater concern regarding muscle gain in males in comparison to females.&lt;ref name="Body Image" /&gt;

==Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem==
{{Main|Relationship-contingent self-esteem}}
Relationship contingent self-esteem (RCSE) is a [[psychological disorder]] that has been researched by Chip Knee and his colleagues at the [[University of Houston]].&lt;ref name="RCSE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Science Daily|title=Too Much Commitment May be Unhealthy for Relationships, Professor Says|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081202170828.htm|publisher=ScienceDaily LLC|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCSE is the way one determines how they feel about themselves based on the outcome of their [[intimate relationship|relationship]].&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; Individuals with RCSE take problems in their relationship personally.&lt;ref name="rcsesteem" /&gt; They do not tend to think rationally about situations, which may result to them feeling bad for themselves in the end.&lt;ref name="rcsesteem" /&gt; Any setback in a relationship can lead to many negative feelings such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anxiety]], and changes in mood.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; Individuals with high levels of relationship based self-esteem are highly committed to their relationships, but become devastated when faced with challenges in their relationship. In extreme cases, they may resort to [[Self-harm|hurting]] or [[Suicide|killing themselves]].&lt;ref name="rcsesteem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vjeru|first=Tudor|title=Wrong Kind of Commitment Undermines Relationships|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Wrong-Kind-of-Commitment-Undermines-Relationships-99129.shtml|publisher=Softpedia|accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RCSE is seen as a negative and unhealthy factor of a relationship, which can be mediated if identified in its early stages.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt;

Chip Knee and a group of researchers also studied [[heterosexual]] relationships in college and how they are affected by RCSE.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; They presented the results of this study in a paper entitled “Relationship Contingent Self-Esteem – The Ups and Downs of Romantic Relationship”.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; RCSE was present in some of these relationships; however, some levels were higher than others.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt; Relationships with higher levels of RCSE are placed under unnecessary strain.&lt;ref name="rcsesteem" /&gt; The point of the study is to show how relationships can guide one’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors; and the unhealthy way people attach themselves to relationships.&lt;ref name="RCSE" /&gt;

'''Criticism of government''' may refer to criticism of particular government, or of the concept of government itself. In certain cases, such as in certain monarchies and authoritarian (or sometimes totalitarian or dictatorial) governments, criticizing the government is considered [[criminal speech]] and is punished in accord which the perceived severity of the claimed crime.
* [[Anarchism]] – according to one definition, is the concept that all government is bad, and people would do better with no government.
* [[Criticism of royalty]] – this includes criticism of the monarchy, and royal families
* [[Criticism of democracy]] – criticism of democracy comes from various points of view, including monarchical, authoritarian, totalitarian, and libertarian points of view.
* [[Criticism of communism (disambiguation)]]
* [[Criticism of socialism]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5746">A '''cultural invention''' is any [[innovation]] developed by people that is not a [[Material culture|material object]].&lt;ref&gt;Saper, Craig J.,(January 1997), ''Artificial Mythologies: A Guide to Cultural Invention'' , University of Minnesota Press  {{ISBN|0-8166-2873-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural inventions include sets of [[behaviour]] adopted by [[Group dynamics|groups]] of [[people]]. They are perpetuated by being passed on to others within the group or outside it. They are also passed on to future groups and [[Generation|generations]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ostherr, Kirsten; Review of ''Artificial Mythologies. A Guide to Cultural Invention'', Fall 1998 http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_199810/ai_n8821092&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of cultural invention can either come from outside a specific group or from within that group.

[[Allan Hanson]], a [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] anthropologist, believed that the analytical purpose of studying cultural inventions was not to uncover which portions of a culture's belief systems are invented, but rather to study how cultural inventions become accepted as authentic within groups.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention &amp; its Logic. In Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms, eds. Pp 549-562. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has been met with criticism from within the anthropological community as well as from outside sources, and has been referred to as both politically revisionist and anti-native.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Linnekin.  American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 93, No. 2 (Jun., 1991), pp. 446-449&lt;/ref&gt; The fear is that viewing cultural invention as a process which leads to something authentic and widely accepted may undermine indigenous people's traditions in addition to questioning the authority they have over their own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Jocelyn Linnekin.  American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 93, No. 2 (Jun., 1991), pp. 446-449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of areas where cultural inventions may take place include:

==Cultural transmission==
One way that cultural inventions can be spread is through [[cultural transmission]].  Cultural transmission refers to the means by which culturally specific ideas and patterns of behavior are shared so that they become cultural reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Sharing and Cultural Theory: Some Findings of a Five-Society Study.  Marc J. Swartz.  American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marc J. Swartz, people of status within society play an important role in deciding what is understood as cultural reality.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Sharing and Cultural Theory: Some Findings of a Five-Society Study.  Marc J. Swartz.  American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338&lt;/ref&gt; Such people have the correct kinds of skills and knowledge within society to help transmit ideas in such a way that they are accepted by society at large, and this is one method by which cultural inventions can become cultural realities.&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Sharing and Cultural Theory: Some Findings of a Five-Society Study.  Marc J. Swartz.  American Anthropologist , New Series, Vol. 84, No. 2 (Jun., 1982), pp. 314-338&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case study: the Maori of New Zealand==
Allan Hanson proposed that several aspects of [[Māori culture|Maori culture]] had been invented by European scholars who were accustomed to analytical frameworks focused on long-distance migration and diffusion.  Because of this, he believed that European scholars constructed the notion that a "[[Great Fleet]]" headed by a man named Kupe from a neighboring island was responsible for the initial discovery and peopling of New Zealand.  Although Maori ancestors most likely did arrive in canoes coming from nearby islands, Hanson believed that the account of the Great Fleet was created in order to simplify various Maori traditions into a single tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention &amp; its Logic. In Anthropological Theory: An Introductory History. R. Jon McGee and Richard L. Warms, eds. Pp 549-562. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Additionally, in order to make the Maori seem more elevated in European eyes, scholars may have invented a cult to a god named Io. Io was thought to be a supreme being that controlled all the other gods in the Maori pantheon. The story of Io creating the world is very similar to that of the [[Book of Genesis]] in the Bible, so similar that it is believed to be of European invention.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroa, Te Rangi (Peter H. Buck). 1950. The Coming of the Maori. 2nd Edition.  Wellington: Whitecombe and Tombs.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanson asserted that these and other elements of Maori tradition were incorporated and taken to be true by the Maori, and that they have been passed down through generations by way of oral tradition. According to Hanson, "Io and the Great Fleet have been incorporated into Maori lore and are passed down from elders to juniors in storytelling, oratory, and other Maori contexts."&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Allan 2012 [1989] The Making of the Maori: Culture Invention &amp; its Logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70109">A hallmark of [[Albert Einstein]]'s career was his use of visualized [[thought experiment]]s ({{lang-de|Gedankenexperiment}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Gedankenexperiment |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Gedankenexperiment |first=Sidney |last=Perkowitz |authorlink=Sidney Perkowitz |encyclopedia=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Online]]'' |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as a fundamental tool for understanding physical issues and for elucidating his concepts to others. '''Einstein's thought experiments''' took diverse forms. In his youth, he mentally chased beams of light. For [[special relativity]], he employed moving trains and flashes of lightning to explain his most penetrating insights. For [[general relativity]], he considered a person falling off a roof, accelerating elevators, blind beetles crawling on curved surfaces and the like. In his debates with [[Niels Bohr]] on the nature of reality, he proposed imaginary devices intended to show, at least in concept, how the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] might be evaded. In a profound contribution to the literature on [[quantum mechanics]], Einstein considered two particles briefly interacting and then flying apart so that their states are correlated, anticipating the phenomenon known as [[quantum entanglement]]. 

==Introduction==
{{see also|Thought experiment}}
A thought experiment is a logical argument or mental model cast within the context of an imaginary (hypothetical or even counterfactual) scenario. A scientific thought experiment, in particular, may examine the implications of a theory, law, or set of principles with the aid of fictive and/or natural particulars (demons sorting molecules, cats whose lives hinge upon a radioactive disintegration, men in enclosed elevators) in an idealized environment (massless trapdoors, absence of friction). They describe experiments that, except for some specific and necessary idealizations, could conceivably be performed in the real world.&lt;ref name="Rawad2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=El Skaf|first1=Rawad|title=What Notion of Possibility Should We Use in Assessing Scientific Thought Experiments?|journal=Revue de la Société de Philosophie des Sciences|date=2017|volume=4|issue=1|pages=18–30|accessdate=28 April 2018|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13202/1/543-4973-1-PB.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428133949/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/13202/1/543-4973-1-PB.pdf|archivedate=29 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As opposed to ''physical'' experiments, thought experiments do not report new empirical data. They can only provide conclusions based on deductive or inductive reasoning from their starting assumptions. Thought experiments invoke particulars that are irrelevant to the generality of their conclusions. It is the invocation of these particulars that give thought experiments their experiment-like appearance. A thought experiment can always be reconstructed as a straightforward argument, without the irrelevant particulars. [[John D. Norton]], a well-known philosopher of science, has noted that "a good thought experiment is a good argument; a bad thought experiment is a bad argument."&lt;ref name="Norton1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norton, John|year=1991|chapter=Thought Experiments in Einstein's Work |editor1-last=Horowitz|editor1-first=Tamara|editor2-last=Massey|editor2-first=Gerald J.|title=Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847677061|pages=129–148|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3190/1/8_norton.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601110138/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3190/1/8_norton.pdf |archive-date=June 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When effectively used, the irrelevant particulars that convert a straightforward argument into a thought experiment can act as "intuition pumps" that stimulate readers' ability to apply their ''intuitions'' to their understanding of a scenario.&lt;ref name="Brendel2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brendel|first1=Elke|title=Intuition Pumps and the Proper Use of Thought Experiments |journal=Dialectica|date=2004|volume=58|issue=1|pages=89–108|accessdate=28 April 2018 |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbf3/641682da1249147aaabce84fd99392f0d701.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428150735/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fbf3/641682da1249147aaabce84fd99392f0d701.pdf|archivedate=28 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thought experiments have a long history. Perhaps the best known in the history of modern science is [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This has sometimes been taken to be an actual physical demonstration, involving his climbing up the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and dropping two heavy weights off it.  In fact, it was a logical demonstration  described by Galileo in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche]]'' (1638).&lt;ref name="Cohen2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Martin|title=Wittgenstein's Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-1405121927|pages=33–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein had a highly visual understanding of physics. His work in the patent office "stimulated [him] to see the physical ramifications of theoretical concepts." These aspects of his thinking style inspired him to fill his papers with vivid practical detail making them quite different from, say, the papers of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] or [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]. This included his use of thought experiments.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|26–27;121–127}}

==Special relativity==
===Pursuing a beam of light===
{{see also|Einstein's views on the aether}}
Late in life, Einstein recalled

{{quote|...a paradox upon which I had already hit at the age of sixteen: If I pursue a beam of light with the velocity c (velocity of light in a vacuum), I should observe such a beam of light as an electromagnetic field at rest though spatially oscillating. There seems to be no such thing, however, neither on the basis of experience nor according to Maxwell's equations. From the very beginning it appeared to me intuitively clear that, judged from the standpoint of such an observer, everything would have to happen according to the same laws as for an observer who, relative to the earth, was at rest. For how should the first observer know or be able to determine, that he is in a state of fast uniform motion? One sees in this paradox the germ of the special relativity theory is already contained.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1951"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Schilpp|editor1-first=P. A.|title=Albert Einstein-Philosopher Scientist|date=1951|publisher=Tudor Publishing|location=New York|pages=2–95|edition=2nd|chapter=Autobiographical Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}} }}

[[File:Young Einstein chasing a beam of light.png|thumb|Einstein's thought experiment as a 16-year-old student]]
Einstein's recollections of his youthful musings are widely cited because of the hints they provide of his later great discovery. However, Norton has noted that Einstein's reminiscences were probably colored by a half-century of hindsight. Norton lists several problems with Einstein's recounting, both historical and scientific:&lt;ref name="Norton2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Brown|editor1-first=James Robert|editor2-last=Frappier|editor2-first=Mélanie|editor3-last=Meynell|editor3-first=Letitia|title=Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Science and the Arts|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|pages=123–140|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124072020/www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf|archivedate=November 24, 2017|chapter=Chasing the Light: Einsteinʼs Most Famous Thought Experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. At 16 years old and a student at the Gymnasium in Aarau, Einstein would have had the thought experiment in late 1895 to early 1896. But various sources note that Einstein did not learn Maxwell's theory until 1898, in university.&lt;ref name="Norton2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stachel1983"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stachel|first1=John|title=How Did Einstein Discover Relativity|url=https://history.aip.org/exhibits/einstein/essay-einstein-relativity.htm|website=AIP Center for History of Physics|publisher=American Institute of Physics|accessdate=15 April 2018|archiveurl=https://history.aip.org/exhibits/einstein/essay-einstein-relativity.htm|archivedate=June 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:2. The second issue is that a 19th century [[Aether theories|aether theorist]] would have had no difficulties with the thought experiment. Einstein's statement, "...there seems to be no such thing...on the basis of experience," would not have counted as an objection, but would have represented a mere statement of fact, since no one had ever traveled at such speeds. 
:3. An aether theorist would have regarded "...nor according to Maxwell's equations" as simply representing a misunderstanding on Einstein's part. Unfettered by any notion that the speed of light represents a cosmic limit, the aether theorist would simply have set velocity equal to ''c'', noted that yes indeed, the light would appear to be frozen, and then thought no more of it.&lt;ref name="Norton2013"/&gt;

Rather than the thought experiment being at all incompatible with aether theories (which it is not), the youthful Einstein appears to have reacted to the scenario out of an intuitive sense of wrongness. He felt that the laws of optics should obey the principle of relativity. As he grew older, his early thought experiment acquired deeper levels of significance: Einstein felt that Maxwell's equations should be the same for all observers in inertial motion. From Maxwell's equations, one can deduce a single speed of light, and there is nothing in this computation that depends on an observer's speed. Einstein sensed a conflict between Newtonian mechanics and the constant speed of light determined by Maxwell's equations.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|114–115}}

Regardless of the historical and scientific issues described above, Einstein's early thought experiment was part of the repertoire of test cases that he used to check on the viability of physical theories. Norton suggests that the real importance of the thought experiment was that it provided a powerful objection to [[Emission theory|emission theories]] of light, which Einstein had worked on for several years prior to 1905.&lt;ref name="Norton2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stachel1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Norton2004"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|title=Einstein’s Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics prior to 1905|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/|website=PhilSci Archive|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=15 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704061550/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/|archivedate=July 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnet and conductor===
{{see also|Moving magnet and conductor problem}}
In the very first paragraph of Einstein's seminal 1905 work introducing special relativity, he writes: {{quote|It is well known that Maxwell's electrodynamics—as usually understood at present—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries that do not seem to attach to the phenomena. Let us recall, for example, the electrodynamic interaction between a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon depends here only on the relative motion of conductor and magnet, while according to the customary conception the two cases, in which, respectively, either the one or the other of the two bodies is the one in motion, are to be strictly differentiated from each other. For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor is at rest, there arises in the surroundings of the magnet an electric field endowed with a certain energy value that produces a current in the places where parts of the conductor are located. But if the magnet is at rest and the conductor is in motion, no electric field arises in the surroundings of the magnet, while in the conductor an electromotive force will arise, to which in itself there does not correspond any energy, but which, provided that the relative motion in the two cases considered is the same, gives rise to electrical currents that have the same magnitude and the same course as those produced by the electric forces in the first-mentioned case.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1905"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies ( Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper)|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1905|volume=322|issue=10|pages=891–921|url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/154|accessdate=17 August 2018|bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E|doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Magnet and conductor.svg|thumb|Magnet and conductor thought experiment]]
This opening paragraph recounts well-known experimental results obtained by [[Faraday's law of induction#History|Michael Faraday]] in 1831. The experiments describe what appeared to be two different phenomena: the ''motional EMF'' generated when a wire moves through a magnetic field (see [[Lorentz force#Force on a current-carrying wire|Lorentz force]]), and the ''transformer EMF'' generated by a changing magnetic field (due to the [[#Maxwell–Faraday equation|Maxwell–Faraday equation]]).&lt;ref name=Norton2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Norton2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller1998/&gt;{{rp|135–157}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] himself drew attention to this fact in his 1861 paper ''[[On Physical Lines of Force]]''. In the latter half of Part II of that paper, Maxwell gave a separate physical explanation for each of the two phenomena.&lt;ref group=p name=Maxwell1861&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clerk Maxwell|first= James|journal = Philosophical Magazine|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_Physical_Lines_of_Force |pages = 11–23|publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis|title = On physical lines of force|volume = 90|year = 1861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Einstein calls the asymmetry "well-known", there is no evidence that any of Einstein's contemporaries considered the distinction between motional EMF and transformer EMF to be in any way odd or pointing to a lack of understanding of the underlying physics. Maxwell, for instance, had repeatedly discussed Faraday's laws of induction, stressing that the magnitude and direction of the induced current was a function only of the relative motion of the magnet and the conductor, without being bothered by the clear distinction between conductor-in-motion and magnet-in-motion in the underlying theoretical treatment.&lt;ref name="Miller1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Arthur I.|title=Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity: Emergence (1905) and Early Interpretation (1905–1911)|date=1998|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-94870-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135–138}}

Yet Einstein's reflection on this experiment represented the decisive moment in his long and tortuous path to special relativity. Although the equations describing the two scenarios are entirely different, there is no measurement that can distinguish whether the magnet is moving, the conductor is moving, or both.&lt;ref name="Norton2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|editor1-last=Janssen|editor1-first=M.|editor2-last=Lehner|editor2-first=C.|title=Cambridge Companion to Einstein|date=2014|isbn=978-0521828345|pages=72–102|url=https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/companion_final.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124071615/https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/companion_final.pdf|archivedate=Nov 24, 2017|chapter=Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and the Problems in the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies that Led him to it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1920 review on the ''Fundamental Ideas and Methods of the Theory of Relativity'' (unpublished), Einstein related how disturbing he found this asymmetry: 
{{quote|The idea that these two cases should essentially be different was unbearable to me. According to my conviction, the difference between the two could only lie in the choice of the point of view, but not in a real difference &lt;in the reality of nature&gt;.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1920"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|editor1-last=Janssen|editor1-first=Michel|editor2-last=Schulmann|editor2-first=Robert|editor3-last=Illy|editor3-first=József|editor4-last=Lehner|editor4-first=Christoph|editor5-last=Buchwald|editor5-first=Diana Kormos|title=The Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.

II.  The  Theory  of  General  Relativity}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}} }}

Einstein needed to extend the relativity of motion that he perceived between magnet and conductor in the above thought experiment to a full theory. For years, however, he did not know how this might be done. The exact path that Einstein took to resolve this issue is unknown. We do know, however, that Einstein spent several years pursuing an emission theory of light, encountering difficulties that eventually led him to give up the attempt.&lt;ref name="Norton2014"/&gt; 
{{quote|Gradually I despaired of the possibility of discovering the true laws by means of constructive efforts based on known facts. The longer and more desperately I tried, the more I came to the conviction that only the discovery of a universal formal principle could lead us to assured results.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1951"/&gt;{{rp|49}} }}

That decision ultimately led to his development of special relativity as a theory founded on two postulates of which he could be sure.&lt;ref name="Norton2014"/&gt; Expressed in contemporary physics vocabulary, his postulates were as follows:{{refn|group=note|Einstein's original expression of these postulates was as follows: "1.&amp;nbsp;The laws governing the changes of the state of any physical system do not depend on which one of two coordinate systems in uniform translational motion relative to each other these changes of the state are referred to. 2.&amp;nbsp;Each ray of light moves in the coordinate system "at rest" with the definite velocity ''V'' independent of whether this ray of light is emitted by a body at rest or a body in motion."&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1905"/&gt;}}
:1. The laws of physics take the same form in all inertial frames.
:2. In any given inertial frame, the velocity of light ''c'' is the same ''whether the light be emitted by a body at rest or by a body in uniform motion.'' [Emphasis added by editor]&lt;ref name="Pais2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=Subtle is the Lord: The Science and Life of Albert Einstein|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-280672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|140–141}}

Einstein's wording of the second postulate was one with which nearly all theorists of his day could agree. His wording is a far more intuitive form of the second postulate than the stronger version frequently encountered in popular writings and college textbooks.&lt;ref name="Baierlein"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marquit|first1=Miranda|title='Relativity' Speaking|url=https://phys.org/news/2006-03-relativity.html|publisher=PhysOrg.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306013946/https://phys.org/news/2006-03-relativity.html|archivedate=6 Mar 2016|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|One popular textbook expresses the second postulate as, "The speed of light in free space has the same value ''c'' in all directions and in all inertial reference frames."&lt;ref name="Halliday1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|date=1988|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-81995-6|page=954|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Trains, embankments, and lightning flashes===
{{see also|Relativity of simultaneity}}
The topic of how Einstein arrived at special relativity has been a fascinating one to many scholars: A lowly, twenty-six year old patent officer (third class), largely self-taught in physics and completely divorced from mainstream research, nevertheless in the year 1905 produced four extraordinary works ([[Annus Mirabilis papers|''Annus Mirabilis'' papers]]), only one of which (his paper on [[Brownian motion]]) appeared related to anything that he had ever published before.&lt;ref name=Stachel1983/&gt;

Einstein's paper, ''[[On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies]]'', is a polished work that bears few traces of its gestation. Documentary evidence concerning the development of the ideas that went into it consist of, quite literally, only two sentences in a handful of preserved early letters, and various later historical remarks by Einstein himself, some of them known only second-hand and at times contradictory.&lt;ref name=Stachel1983/&gt;

[[File:Einstein's train and embankment thought experiment.png|thumb|330px|Train and embankment thought experiment]]
In regards to the [[relativity of simultaneity]], Einstein's 1905 paper develops the concept vividly by carefully considering the basics of how time may be disseminated through the exchange of signals between clocks.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"/&gt; In his popular work, ''Relativity: The Special and General Theory,'' Einstein translates the formal presentation of his paper into a thought experiment using a train, a railway embankment, and lightning flashes. The essence of the thought experiment is as follows: 
*Observer ''M'' stands on an embankment, while observer ''M{{'}}'' rides on a rapidly traveling train. At the precise moment that ''M'' and ''M{{'}}'' coincide in their positions, lightning strikes points ''A'' and ''B'' equidistant from ''M'' and ''M{{'}}''. 
*Light from these two flashes reach ''M'' at the same time, from which ''M'' concludes that the bolts were synchronous. 
*The combination of Einstein's first and second postulates implies that, despite the rapid motion of the train relative to the embankment, ''M{{'}}'' measures exactly the same speed of light as does ''M''. Since ''M{{'}}'' was equidistant from ''A'' and ''B'' when lightning struck, the fact that ''M{{'}}'' receives light from ''B'' before light from ''A'' means that to ''M{{'}}'', the bolts were ''not'' synchronous. Instead, the bolt at ''B'' struck first.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1916"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=Relativity: The Special and the General Theory|date=1961|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-517-88441-0|edition=15th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29–31}} {{refn|group=note|Other than that ''M{{'}}'' witnesses the bolt at ''B'' striking before the bolt at ''A'', details of what ''M{{'}}'' observes are not often considered. An animation of a [[:File:Train and Embankment Thought Experiment And Its Inverse.gif|modified train-and-embankment thought experiment and its inverse is available here.]]  }}

A routine supposition among historians of science is that, in accordance with the analysis given in his 1905 special relativity paper and in his popular writings, Einstein discovered the relativity of simultaneity by thinking about how clocks could be synchronized by light signals.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Norton|first1=John D.|title=Discovering the Relativity of Simultaneity How did Einstein take "The Step"?|url=https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/AE_1905_Tsinghua.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124073235/https://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/AE_1905_Tsinghua.pdf|archivedate=24 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Einstein synchronization]] convention was originally developed by telegraphers in the middle 19th century. The dissemination of precise time was an increasingly important topic during this period. Trains needed accurate time to schedule use of track, cartographers needed accurate time to determine longitude, while astronomers and surveyors dared to consider the worldwide dissemination of time to accuracies of thousandths of a second.&lt;ref name="Galison2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galison|first1=Peter|title=Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps|date=2003|publisher=W.

However, all of the above is supposition. In later recollections, when Einstein was asked about what inspired him to develop special relativity, he would mention his riding a light beam and his magnet and conductor thought experiments. He would also mention the importance of the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the observation of [[stellar aberration]]. "They were enough", he said.&lt;ref name="Shankland1963_1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shankland|first1=R. S.|title=Conversations with Albert Einstein|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=1963|volume=31|issue=1|pages=47–57|url=https://archive.org/stream/EinsteinConversations/Einstein#page/n0/mode/2up|accessdate=17 April 2018|bibcode=1963AmJPh..31...47S|doi=10.1119/1.1969236}}&lt;/ref&gt; He never mentioned thought experiments about clocks and their synchronization.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"/&gt;

The routine analyses of the Fizeau experiment and of stellar aberration, that treat light as Newtonian corpuscles, do not require relativity. But problems arise if one considers light as waves traveling through an aether, which are resolved by applying the relativity of simultaneity. It is entirely possible, therefore, that Einstein arrived at special relativity through a different path than that commonly assumed, through  Einstein's examination of Fizeau's experiment and stellar aberration.&lt;ref name="Norton_TheStep"/&gt;

We therefore do not know just how important clock synchronization and the train and embankment thought experiment were to Einstein's development of the concept of the relativity of simultaneity. We do know, however, that the train and embankment thought experiment was the preferred means whereby he chose to teach this concept to the general public.&lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1916"/&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

==General relativity==
===Falling painters and accelerating elevators===
{{see also|Equivalence principle}}
In his unpublished 1920 review, Einstein related the genesis of his thoughts on the equivalence principle: {{quote|When I was busy (in 1907) writing a summary of my work on the theory of special relativity for the ''Jahrbuch für Radioaktivität und Elektronik'' [Yearbook for Radioactivity and Electronics], I also had to try to modify the Newtonian theory of gravitation such as to fit its laws into the theory. While attempts in this direction showed the practicability of this enterprise, they did not satisfy me because they would have had to be based upon unfounded physical hypotheses. At that moment I got the happiest thought of my life in the following form: In an example worth considering, the gravitational field has a relative existence only in a manner similar to the electric field generated by magneto-electric induction. ''Because for an observer in free-fall from the roof of a house there is during the fall''—at least in his immediate vicinity—''no gravitational field.'' Namely, if the observer lets go of any bodies, they remain relative to him, in a state of rest or uniform motion, independent of their special chemical or physical nature. The observer, therefore, is justified in interpreting his state as being "at rest."&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1920/&gt;{{rp|20–21}} }}

The realization "startled" Einstein, and inspired him to begin an eight-year quest that led to what is considered to be his greatest work, the [[theory of general relativity]]. Over the years, the story of the falling man has become an iconic one, much embellished by other writers. In most retellings of Einstein's story, the falling man is identified as a painter. In some accounts, Einstein was inspired after he witnessed a painter falling from the roof of a building adjacent to the patent office where he worked. This version of the story leaves unanswered the question of why Einstein might consider his observation of such an unfortunate accident to represent the happiest thought in his life.&lt;ref name="Isaacson2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Isaacson |first1=Walter |title=Einstein: His Life and Universe |date=2007 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0-7432-6473-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

[[File:Equivalence principle thought experiment.png|thumb|300px|A thought experiment used by Einstein to illustrate the equivalence principle]]
Einstein later refined his thought experiment to consider a man inside a large enclosed chest or elevator falling freely in space. While in free fall, the man would consider himself weightless, and any loose objects that he emptied from his pockets would float alongside him. Then Einstein imagined a rope attached to the roof of the chamber. A powerful "being" of some sort begins pulling on the rope with constant force. The chamber begins to move "upwards" with a uniformly accelerated motion. Within the chamber, all of the man's perceptions are consistent with his being in a uniform gravitational field. Einstein asked, "Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion?" Einstein answered no. Rather, the thought experiment provided "good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity."&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1916/&gt;{{rp|75–79}} &lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|145–147}}

Through this thought experiment, Einstein addressed an issue that was so well known, scientists rarely worried about it or considered it puzzling: Objects have "gravitational mass," which determines the force with which they are attracted to other objects. Objects also have "inertial mass," which determines the relationship between the force applied to an object and how much it accelerates. [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] had pointed out that, even though they are defined differently, gravitational mass and inertial mass always seem to be equal. But until Einstein, no one had conceived a good explanation as to why this should be so. From the correspondence revealed by his thought experiment, Einstein concluded that "it is impossible to discover by experiment whether a given system of coordinates is accelerated, or whether...the observed effects are due to a gravitational field." This correspondence between gravitational mass and inertial mass is the ''[[equivalence principle]]''.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|147}}

An extension to his accelerating observer thought experiment allowed Einstein to deduce that "rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields."&lt;ref group=p name=Einstein1916/&gt;{{rp|83–84}} &lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|190}}

==Quantum mechanics==
===Background: Einstein and the quantum===
Many myths have grown up about Einstein's relationship with [[quantum mechanics]]. Freshman physics students are aware that Einstein explained the [[photoelectric effect]] and introduced the concept of the [[photon]]. But students who have grown up with the photon may not be aware of how revolutionary the concept was for his time. The best-known factoids about Einstein's relationship with quantum mechanics are his statement, "God does not play dice" and the indisputable fact that he just didn't like the theory in its final form. This has led to the general impression that, despite his initial contributions, Einstein was out of touch with quantum research and played at best a secondary role in its development.&lt;ref name="Stone2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=A. Douglas|title=Einstein and the Quantum: The Quest of the Valiant Swabian|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|year=2013|isbn=978-0-691-13968-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–4}} Concerning Einstein's estrangement from the general direction of physics research after 1925, his well-known scientific biographer, [[Abraham Pais]], wrote:
{{quote|Einstein is the only scientist to be justly held equal to Newton. That comparison is based exclusively on what he did before 1925. In the remaining 30 years of his life he remained active in research but his fame would be undiminished, if not enhanced, had he gone fishing instead.&lt;ref name="Pais1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=Einstein Lived Here|date=1994|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-198-53994-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} }}

In hindsight, we know that Pais was incorrect in his assessment.

Einstein was arguably the greatest single contributor to the [[Old quantum theory|"old" quantum theory]].&lt;ref name="Stone2013"/&gt;{{refn|group=note|The ''old quantum theory'' refers to a mixed collection of [[heuristic]] corrections to [[classical mechanics]] which predate modern [[quantum mechanics]].

* In his 1906 [[Einstein solid#Einstein's theory of specific heats|theory of specific heats]], Einstein was the first to realize that quantized energy levels explained the specific heat of solids.&lt;ref group=p&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein|first=Albert|journal=Annalen der Physik|series=4|volume=22|pages=180&amp;ndash;190, 800|title=Planck's theory of radiation and the theory of specific heat|year=1906|url=http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/228|access-date=21 April 2018|bibcode = 1906AnP...327..180E |doi = 10.1002/andp.19063270110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, he found a rational justification for the [[third law of thermodynamics]] (''i.e.'' the entropy of any system approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero{{refn|group=note|This statement is only ''exactly'' true for perfect crystals.

* Einstein proposed the wave-particle duality of light. In 1909, using a rigorous fluctuation argument based on a thought experiment and drawing on his previous work on [[Brownian motion]], he predicted the emergence of a "fusion theory" that would combine the two views.&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|136–140}} &lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1909a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=On the present status of the radiation problem|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift|date=1909a|volume=10|pages=185–193 |url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/371|bibcode=1909PhyZ...10..185E}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref group=p name="Einstein1909b"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=Albert|title=On the development of our views concerning the nature and constitution of radiation|journal=Physikalische Zeitschrift |date=1909b|volume=10 |pages=817–826|url=https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/393|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, he demonstrated that the Brownian motion experienced by a mirror in thermal equilibrium with black body radiation would be the sum of two terms, one due to the wave properties of radiation, the other due to its particulate properties.&lt;ref name=Norton1991/&gt;
* Although Planck is justly hailed as the father of quantum mechanics, his derivation of the [[Planck's law of black-body radiation|law of black-body radiation]] rested on fragile ground, since it required ''ad hoc'' assumptions of an unreasonable character.{{refn|group=note|Planck's derivation required that hypothetical "resonators" in the walls of a cavity take on ''equally spaced'' states of definite energy, with intermediate energies being forbidden.

* In 1924, Einstein received a short manuscript by an unknown Indian professor, [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], outlining a new  method of deriving the law of blackbody radiation.{{refn|group=note|Bose claimed that both  Planck's and Einstein's methods of deriving the law relied on a previously derived classical result, [[Wien's distribution law]], for the factor 8π𝜈&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was "a most unsatisfactory point in all derivations." Einstein privately corrected Bose on this point, showing that he was wrong in believing that Wien's distribution law presupposed classical wave theory.}} Einstein was intrigued by Bose's peculiar method of counting the number of distinct ways of putting photons into the available states, a method of counting that Bose apparently did not realize was unusual.{{refn|group=note|When asked about whether he understood the fundamental implications of his counting method, Bose replied with great candor: "I had no idea that what I had done was really novel.... I was not a statistician to the extent of really knowing that I was doing something which was really different from what Boltzmann would have done, from Boltzmann statistics."&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|223}} }} Einstein, however, understood that Bose's counting method implied that photons are, in a deep sense, indistinguishable. He translated the paper into German and had it published. Einstein then followed Bose's paper with an extension to Bose's work which predicted [[Bose-Einstein condensation]], one of the fundamental research topics of [[condensed matter physics]].&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|215–240}}
* While trying to develop a mathematical theory of light which would fully encompass its wavelike and particle-like aspects, Einstein developed the concept of "ghost fields". A guiding wave obeying Maxwell's classical laws would propagate following the normal laws of optics, but would not transmit any energy. This guiding wave, however, would govern the appearance of quanta of energy &lt;math&gt; h \nu &lt;/math&gt; on a statistical basis, so that the appearance of these quanta would be proportional to the intensity of the interference radiation. These ideas became widely known in the physics community, and through [[Max Born|Born]]'s work in 1926, later became a key concept in the modern quantum theory of radiation and matter.&lt;ref name=Stone2013/&gt;{{rp|193–203}} {{refn|group=note|In his Nobel lecture, Born gave Einstein full credit for having been the source of his idea: "...we missed the correct approach. This was left to Schrödinger, and I immediately took up his method since it held promise of leading to an interpretation of the ψ-function. Again an idea of Einstein’s gave me the lead. He had tried to make the duality of particles - light quanta or photons - and waves comprehensible by interpreting the square of the optical wave amplitudes as probability density for the occurrence of photons. This concept could at once be carried over to the ψ-function: ψ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ought to represent the probability density for electrons (or other particles)."&lt;ref group=p name=Nobel&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/born-lecture.pdf |title=The statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics |last1=Born |first1=Max |date=11 December 1954 |website=www.nobelprize.org |publisher=nobelprize.org |accessdate=30 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Therefore, Einstein before 1925 originated most of the key concepts of quantum theory: light quanta, wave-particle duality, the fundamental randomness of physical processes, the concept of indistinguishability, and the probability density interpretation of the wave equation. In addition, Einstein can arguably be considered the father of [[solid state physics]] and condensed matter physics.&lt;ref name="Cardona2005"&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Cardona|first1=Manuel|title=Albert Einstein as the father of solid state physics|eprint=physics/0508237|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided a correct derivation of the blackbody radiation law and sparked the notion of the laser.

What of ''after'' 1925? In 1935, working with two younger colleagues, Einstein issued a final challenge to quantum mechanics, attempting to show that it could not represent a final solution.&lt;ref group=p name="EPR"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete? | date = 1935 | first = A | last = Einstein |author2=B Podolsky |author3=N Rosen  | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 47 | issue = 10 | pages = 777–780 | url=https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |bibcode = 1935PhRv...47..777E |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325070120/https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777 | archivedate=25 Mar 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the questions raised by this paper, it made little or no difference to how physicists employed quantum mechanics in their work. Of this paper, Pais was to write:
{{quote|The only part of this article that will ultimately survive, I believe, is this last phrase [i.e. "''No reasonable definition of reality could be expect to permit this''" where "''this''" refers to the instantaneous transmission of information over a distance], which so poignantly summarizes Einstein's views on quantum mechanics in his later years....This conclusion has not affected subsequent developments in physics, and it is doubtful that it ever will.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|454–457}} }}

===Einstein's light box===
{{see also|Bohr–Einstein debates}}
Einstein did not like the direction in which quantum mechanics had turned after 1925. Although excited by Heisenberg's matrix mechanics, Schroedinger's wave mechanics, and Born's clarification of the meaning of the Schroedinger wave equation (''i.e.'' that the absolute square of the wave function is to be interpreted as a probability density), his instincts told him that something was missing.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|326–335}} In a letter to Born, he wrote:
{{quote|Quantum mechanics is very impressive. But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing. The theory produces a good deal but hardly brings us closer to the secret of the Old One.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|440–443}} }}

The [[Bohr–Einstein debates|Solvay Debates]] between Bohr and Einstein began in dining-room discussions at the ''[[Solvay Conference#Fifth Conference|Fifth Solvay International Conference on Electrons and Photons]]''  in 1927. Einstein's issue with the new quantum mechanics was not just that, with the probability interpretation, it rendered invalid the notion of rigorous causality. After all, as noted above, Einstein himself had introduced random processes in his 1916 theory of radiation. Rather, by defining and delimiting the maximum amount of information obtainable in a given experimental arrangement, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] denied the existence of any knowable reality in terms of a complete specification of the momenta and description of individual particles, an objective reality that would exist whether or not we could ever observe it.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|325–326}} &lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|443–446}}

Over dinner, during after-dinner discussions, and at breakfast, Einstein debated with Bohr and his followers on the question whether quantum mechanics in its present form could be called complete. Einstein illustrated his points with increasingly clever thought experiments intended to prove that position and momentum could in principle be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision. For example, one of his thought experiments involved sending a beam of electrons through a shuttered screen, recording the positions of the electrons as they struck a photographic screen. Bohr and his allies would always be able to counter Einstein's proposal, usually by the end of the same day.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|344–347}}

On the final day of the conference, Einstein revealed that the uncertainty principle was not the only aspect of the new quantum mechanics that bothered him. Quantum mechanics, at least in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], appeared to allow [[action at a distance]], the ability for two separated objects to communicate at speeds greater than light. By 1928, the consensus was that Einstein had lost the debate, and even his closest allies during the Fifth Solvay Conference, for example [[Louis de Broglie]], conceded that quantum mechanics appeared to be complete.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|346–347}}

[[File:Einstein's light box.svg|thumb|Einstein's light box]]
At the Sixth Solvay International Conference on Magnetism (1930), Einstein came armed with a new thought experiment. This involved a box with a shutter that operated so quickly, it would allow only one photon to escape at a time. The box would first be weighed exactly. Then, at a precise moment, the shutter would open, allowing a photon to escape. The box would then be re-weighed. The well-known relationship between mass and energy &lt;math&gt;E = m c^2&lt;/math&gt; would allow the energy of the particle to be precisely determined. With this gadget, Einstein believed that he had demonstrated a means to obtain, simultaneously, a precise determination of the energy of the photon as well as its exact time of departure from the system.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|346–347}} &lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|446–448}}

Bohr was shaken by this thought experiment. Unable to think of a refutation, he went from one conference participant to another, trying to convince them that Einstein's thought experiment couldn't be true, that if it were true, it would literally mean the end of physics. After a sleepless night, he finally worked out a response which, ironically, depended on Einstein's general relativity.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|348–349}} Consider the illustration of Einstein's light box:&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|446–448}}
:1. After emitting a photon, the loss of weight causes the box to rise in the gravitational field. 
:2. The observer returns the box to its original height by adding weights until the pointer points to its initial position. It takes a certain amount of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for the observer to perform this procedure. How long it takes depends on the strength of the spring and on how well-damped the system is. If undamped, the box will bounce up and down forever. If over-damped, the box will return to its original position sluggishly (See [[Damped spring-mass system]]).{{refn|group=note|Frictional damping adds heat (and therefore mass-energy) to the system, but it can be demonstrated that errors due to this effect, which was not considered by Bohr, are within an acceptable range.&lt;ref name="Hnizdo2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hnizdo|first1=V.|title=On Bohr's response to the clock-in-the-box thought experiment of Einstein|journal=Eur. J. Phys.|date=2002|volume=23|pages=L9–L13|arxiv=quant-ph/0107028|bibcode=2001quant.ph..7028H}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}
:3. The longer that the observer allows the damped spring-mass system to settle, the closer the pointer will reach its equilibrium position. At some point, the observer will conclude that his setting of the pointer to its initial position is within an allowable tolerance. There will be some residual error &lt;math&gt;\Delta q&lt;/math&gt; in returning the pointer to its initial position. Correspondingly, there will be some residual error &lt;math&gt;\Delta m&lt;/math&gt; in the weight measurement.
:4. Adding the weights imparts a momentum &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; to the box which can be measured with an accuracy &lt;math&gt;\Delta p&lt;/math&gt; delimited by &lt;math&gt;\Delta p \Delta q \approx h .&lt;/math&gt; It is clear that &lt;math&gt;\Delta p &lt; gt \Delta m ,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant. Plugging in yields &lt;math&gt;gt \Delta m \Delta q &gt; h .&lt;/math&gt;
:5. General relativity informs us that while the box has been at a height different than its original height, it has been ticking at a rate different than its original rate. The red shift formula informs us that there will be an uncertainty &lt;math&gt;\Delta t = c^{-2} g t \Delta q&lt;/math&gt; in the determination of &lt;math&gt;t_0 ,&lt;/math&gt; the emission time of the photon.
:6. Hence, &lt;math&gt;c^2 \Delta m \Delta t = \Delta E \Delta t &gt; h .&lt;/math&gt; The accuracy with which the energy of the photon is measured restricts the precision with which its moment of emission can be measured, following the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

After finding his last attempt at finding a loophole around the uncertainty principle refuted, Einstein quit trying to search for inconsistencies in quantum mechanics. Instead, he shifted his focus to the other aspects of quantum mechanics with which he was uncomfortable, focusing on his critique of action at a distance. His next paper on quantum mechanics foreshadowed his later paper on the EPR paradox.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|448}}

Einstein was gracious in his defeat. The following September, Einstein nominated Heisenberg and Schroedinger for the Nobel Prize, stating, "I am convinced that this theory undoubtedly contains a part of the ultimate truth."&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|448}}

===EPR Paradox===
{{see also|EPR paradox|Quantum entanglement}}
{{quote|Both Bohr and Einstein were subtle men. Einstein tried very hard to show that quantum mechanics was inconsistent; Bohr, however, was always able to counter his arguments. But in his final attack Einstein pointed to something so deep, so counterintuitive, so troubling, and yet so exciting, that at the beginning of the twenty-first century it has returned to fascinate theoretical physicists. Bohr’s only answer to Einstein’s last great discovery—the discovery of [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]]—was to ignore it.|[[Leonard Susskind]]&lt;ref name="Susskind2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Susskind|first1=Leonard|last2=Friedman|first2=Art|title=Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum|date=2014|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-06290-4|pages=xi–xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Einstein's fundamental dispute with quantum mechanics wasn't about whether God rolled dice, whether the uncertainty principle allowed simultaneous measurement of position and momentum, or even whether quantum mechanics was complete. It was about reality. Does a physical reality exist independent of our ability to observe it? To Bohr and his followers, such questions were meaningless. All that we can know are the results of measurements and observations. It makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|460–461}}

Einstein's beliefs had evolved over the years from those that he had held when he was young, when, as a logical positivist heavily influenced by his reading of [[David Hume]] and [[Ernst Mach]], he had rejected such unobservable concepts as absolute time and space. Einstein believed:&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|460–461}} 
:1. A reality exists independent of our ability to observe it.
:2. Objects are located at distinct points in spacetime and have their own independent, real existence. In other words, he believed in ''separability and locality.'' 
:3. Although at a superficial level, quantum events may appear random, at some ultimate level, strict causality underlies all processes in nature.

Einstein considered that realism and localism were fundamental underpinnings of physics. After leaving Nazi Germany and settling in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Studies]], Einstein began writing up a thought experiment that he had been mulling over since attending a lecture by [[Léon Rosenfeld]] in 1933. Since the paper was to be in English, Einstein enlisted the help of the 46-year-old [[Boris Podolsky]], a fellow who had moved to the Institute from Caltech; he also enlisted the help of the 26-year-old [[Nathan Rosen]], also at the Institute, who did much of the math.{{refn|group=note|Fölsing, in his otherwise reliable biography of Einstein, suggests that Rosen actually originated the ideas in the EPR paper.&lt;ref name="Folsing1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fölsing|first1=Albrecht|title=Albert Einstein: A Biography|date=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-140-23719-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|696}} This claim is contradicted by statements made by Rosenfeld: "&amp;nbsp;“What would you say of the following
situation?” he asked me [following a seminar by Rosenfeld in Brussels in 1933 that
Einstein attended]. “Suppose two particles are set in motion towards each other with
the same, very large momentum, and that they interact with each other for a very short
time when they pass at known positions. Consider now an observer who gets hold of one
of the particles, far away from the region of interaction, and measures its momentum;
then, from the conditions of the experiment, he will obviously be able to deduce the
momentum of the other particle. If, however, he chooses to measure the position of
the first particle, he will be able to tell where the other particle is. This is a perfectly
correct and straightforward deduction from the principles of quantum mechanics; but is
it not very paradoxical? How can the final state of the second particle be influenced by
a measurement performed on the first, after all physical interaction has ceased between
them?”&amp;nbsp;"&lt;ref name="Landsman2005"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|last1=Landsman|first1=N. P.|title=When champions meet: Rethinking the Bohr–Einstein debate|eprint=quant-ph/0507220|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The result of their collaboration was the four page [[EPR paradox|EPR paper]], which in its title asked the question ''Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?''&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|448–450}} &lt;ref group=p name="EPR"/&gt;

After seeing the paper in print, Einstein found himself unhappy with the result. His clear conceptual visualization had been buried under layers of mathematical formalism.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|448–450}}

Einstein's thought experiment involved two particles that have collided or which have been created in such a way that they have properties which are correlated. The total wave function for the pair links the positions of the particles as well as their linear momenta.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|450–453}} &lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt; The figure depicts the spreading of the wave function from the collision point. However, observation of the position of the first particle allows us to determine precisely the position of the second particle no matter how far the pair have separated. Likewise, measuring the momentum of the first particle allows us to determine precisely the momentum of the second particle. "In accordance with our criterion for reality, in the first case we must consider the quantity P as being an element of reality, in the second case the quantity Q is an element of reality."&lt;ref group=p name=EPR/&gt;

Einstein concluded that the second particle, which we have never directly observed, must have at any moment a position that is real and a momentum that is real. Quantum mechanics does not account for these features of reality. Therefore, quantum mechanics is not complete.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|451}} It is known, from the uncertainty principle, that position and momentum cannot be measured at the same time. But even though their values can only be determined in distinct contexts of measurement, can they both be definite at the same time? Einstein concluded that the answer must be yes.&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt;

The only alternative, claimed Einstein, would be to assert that measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle.&lt;ref name=Isaacson2007/&gt;{{rp|451}} "No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this."&lt;ref group=p name=EPR/&gt;

Bohr was stunned when he read Einstein's paper and spent more than six weeks framing his response, which he gave exactly the same title as the EPR paper.&lt;ref group=p name="Bohr1935"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bohr|first1=Niels|title=Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality be Considered Complete?|journal=Physical Review|date=1935|volume=48|issue=8|pages=696–702|url=https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|accessdate=27 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401145604/https://journals.aps.org/pr/pdf/10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|archivedate=1 Apr 2017|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.696|bibcode=1935PhRv...48..696B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPR paper forced Bohr to make a major revision in his understanding of [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt;

Prior to EPR, Bohr had maintained that disturbance caused by the act of observation was the physical explanation for quantum uncertainty. In the EPR thought experiment, however, Bohr had to admit that "there is no question of a mechanical disturbance of the system under investigation." On the other hand, he noted that the two particles were one system described by one quantum function. Furthermore, the EPR paper did nothing to dispel the uncertainty principle.&lt;ref name=Pais2005/&gt;{{rp|454–457}} {{refn|group=note|Bohr claimed that a measurement on one particle does involve "an influence on the very conditions which define the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior of [the other particle]."&lt;ref group=p name="Bohr1935"/&gt; Arthur Fine noted that "The meaning of this claim is not at all clear," and indeed, "it is difficult to know whether a coherent response can be attributed to Bohr reliably that would derail EPR."&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt; }}

Later commentators have questioned the strength and coherence of Bohr's response. As a practical matter, however, physicists for the most part did not pay much attention to the debate between Bohr and Einstein, since the opposing views did not affect one's ability to apply quantum mechanics to practical problems, but only affected one's interpretation of the quantum formalism. If they thought about the problem at all, most working physicists tended to follow Bohr's leadership.&lt;ref name=Fine2017/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bacciagaluppi2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bacciagaluppi, G.|editor1-last=Aaserud|editor1-first=F.|editor2-last=Kragh|editor2-first=H.|title=One Hundred Years of the Bohr Atom|date=2015|publisher=Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters |location=Copenhagen|url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11023/1/Bacciagaluppi_Bohr_centenary_final.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809103054/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/11023/1/Bacciagaluppi_Bohr_centenary_final.pdf |archivedate=9 Aug 2017|chapter=Did Bohr understand EPR?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Ryan K.|title=Assessing Bohr's rhetorical success in the EPR debate|journal=Southern Communication Journal|date=2005|volume=70|issue=4|pages=301–315|doi=10.1080/10417940509373336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So stood the situation for nearly 30 years. Then, in 1964, [[John Stewart Bell]] made the groundbreaking discovery that Einstein's local realist world view made experimentally verifiable predictions that would be in conflict with those of quantum mechanics. Bell's discovery shifted the Einstein–Bohr debate from philosophy to the realm of experimental physics. [[Bell's theorem]] showed that, for any local realist formalism, there exist limits on the predicted correlations between pairs of particles in an experimental realization of the EPR thought experiment. In 1972, the first experimental tests were carried out. Successive experiments improved the accuracy of observation and closed loopholes. To date, it is virtually certain that local realist theories have been falsified.&lt;ref name="Aspect2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aspect|first1=Alain|title=Viewpoint: Closing the Door on Einstein and Bohr’s Quantum Debate|journal=Physics|date=2015|volume=8|page=123|url=https://physics.aps.org/articles/v8/123|accessdate=28 April 2018|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6z0aBQ74y|archivedate=28 Apr 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So Einstein was wrong. But it has several times been the case that Einstein's "mistakes" have foreshadowed and provoked major shifts in scientific research. Such, for instance, has been the case with his proposal of the [[cosmological constant]], which Einstein considered his greatest blunder, but which currently is being actively investigated for its possible role in the [[accelerating expansion of the universe]]. In his Princeton years, Einstein was virtually shunned as he pursued the unified field theory. Nowadays, innumerable physicists pursue Einstein's dream for a "[[theory of everything]]."&lt;ref name="Smolin2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smolin|first1=Lee|title=Einstein's Legacy — Where are the "Einsteinians?"|journal=Logos|date=2005|volume=4|issue=3|url=http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.3/smolin.htm|accessdate=28 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927005620/http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_4.3/smolin.htm|archivedate=27 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPR paper did not prove quantum mechanics to be incorrect. What it did prove was that quantum mechanics, with its "spooky action at a distance," is completely incompatible with commonsense understanding.&lt;ref name="Maudlin2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maudlin|first1=Tim|title=What Bell Did|journal=J.

'''''Electronic Poet''''', also known as '''''E.P. (Electronic Poet)''''', is an outdoor 1984 sculpture by [[Keith Jellum]], located above the sidewalk on Southwest Morrison Street, between 9th and 10th Avenues in downtown [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. The abstract piece is made of bronze and an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light board which displays poems programmed in a loop. It is administered by the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].

The sculpture measures {{Convert|10|in|m}} x {{Convert|52|in|m}} x {{Convert|20|in|m}} and is made of bronze and an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light board.&lt;ref name=Regional&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Poet|url=http://racc.org/public-art/search/?recid=969.178|publisher=[[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]]|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It displays curated collections of poems programmed in an "evolving" loop, intended to be rotated every six months. Selections of Jellum's favorite poems from around the world have featured American poets born before 1990, European, Native American and Northwestern poets, and Oregon place names, among others.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=Stumptown Stumper|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=92227|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[The Portland Tribune]]|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Electronic Poet|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/electronic-poet|publisher=Public Art Archive|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist wanted to create "opportunities for moments of reflection within the urban landscape".&lt;ref name=PAA/&gt;

"Dr. Know" (Marty Smith) of ''[[Willamette Week]]'' emphasized that the sculpture does not compose the text it displays and said its six-month rotation schedule "does not appear to be religiously observed".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Marty|title=Dr. Know: Whale Tail Tale|url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-22722-dr_know_whale_tail_tale.html|accessdate=September 25, 2014|work=[[Willamette Week]]|date=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the work's introduction, in the form of the text "I am E.P." being displayed approximately every ten minutes, Smith hypothesized: "Since ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' came out in 1982, possibly the Poet’s name was a play on the then-recent sci-fi blockbuster about another technologically advanced being with a wide, flat head.

An '''ethical dilemma''' or '''ethical paradox''' is a decision-making problem between two possible [[moral imperative]]s, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The complexity arises out of the situational conflict in which obeying one would result in transgressing another. 
Sometimes called ethical paradoxes in [[moral philosophy]], ethical dilemmas may be invoked to refute an [[ethical]] system or [[moral code]], or to improve it so as to resolve the [[paradox]].

==Definition==
An '''ethical dilemma''' is a decision making problem between two possible [[moral imperative]]s, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable.

== Examples ==
* A runaway trolley is heading down the tracks toward five workmen who will be killed if the trolley proceeds on its present course. You are on a footbridge over the tracks that is in between the approaching trolley and the five workmen. Next to you on this footbridge is a stranger who happens to be very large. If you do nothing the trolley will proceed, causing the deaths of the five workmen. The only way to save the lives of these workmen is to push this stranger off the bridge and onto the tracks below, where his large body will stop the trolley, causing his death. Should you push the stranger onto the tracks in order to save the five workmen?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://psychopixi.com/uncategorized/25-moral-dilemmas/|title=25 Moral Dilemmas|date=2013-05-09|work=Pixi's Blog|access-date=2017-11-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responses to the arguments ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Ethical dilemmas can be solved in various ways, for example by showing that the claimed situation is only apparent and does not really exist (thus is not a [[paradox]] logically), or that the solution to the ethical dilemma involves choosing the greater good and lesser evil (as discussed in [[value theory]]), or that the whole [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] of the problem omits creative alternatives (such as [[peacemaking]]), or (more recently) that [[situational ethics]] or [[situated ethics]] must apply because the case cannot be removed from context and still be understood. ''See also [[case-based reasoning]] on this process.'' An alternative to situational ethics is [[graded absolutism]].

A popular ethical conflict is that between an [[Moral imperative|imperative]] or [[injunction]] not to steal and one to care for a family that you cannot afford to feed without stolen money. Debates on this often revolve around the availability of alternate means of income or support such as a [[social safety net]], [[charitable organization|charity]], etc.  The debate is in its starkest form when framed as stealing food. Under an ethical system in which stealing is always wrong and letting one's family die from starvation is always wrong, a person in such a situation would be forced to commit one wrong to avoid committing another, and be in constant conflict with those whose view of the acts varied.

However, there are no legitimate ethical systems in which stealing is more wrong than letting one's family die.  Ethical systems do in fact allow for, and sometimes outline, tradeoffs or priorities in decisions. Resolving ethical dilemmas is rarely simple or clearcut and very often involves revisiting similar dilemmas that recur within societies.

According to some philosophers and sociologists, e.g. [[Karl Marx]] and [[marxist ethics]], it is the different life experience of people and the different exposure of them and their families in these roles (the rich constantly robbing the poor, the poor in a position of constant begging and subordination) that creates [[social class]] differences. In other words, ethical dilemmas can become political and economic factions that engage in long-term recurring struggles.

==Process==
[[File:Maze.JPG|{{largethumb}}|In a [[maze]] one can get lost on a voluntary basis]]
[[Psychology]] and [[neuroscience]] help to understand the underlying processes which take place before, during and after getting lost. Getting lost is an aspect of [[behavioral geography]], in which human [[wayfinding]] and cognitive and environmental factors play a role. For successful travel, it is necessary to be able to identify origin and destination, to determine turn angles, to identify segment lengths and directions of movement, to recognize on route and distant landmarks. This information is required to plot a course designed to reach a destination (previously known or unknown) or to return to a home base after wandering. If a destination is known but is not directly connected by a path, road, or track to the origin, successful travel may involve search and exploration, spatial updating of one's location, finding familiar landmarks, recognition of segment length and sequencing, identification of a frame of reference. Human movement is often guided by external aids (cartographic maps, charts, compasses, pedometers, and the like).&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Reginald G. Golledge}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TjzxpAWiamUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=cognitive+processes+and+geography&amp;ots=T8W1z316N9&amp;sig=PZ71cLoy1udZjvK4fsLMP76YRzw#v=onepage&amp;q=cognitive%20processes%20and%20geography&amp;f=false ''Wayfinding Behavior: Cognitive Mapping and Other Spatial Processes''] (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting lost is particularly problematic for children (who have not yet developed tools and strategies for maintaining their bearings) and for the [[elderly]], particularly those experiencing the onset of [[dementia]].&lt;ref name="Rudd"&gt;Betty Rudd, ''Introducing Psychopathology'' (2013), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Such individuals "can get lost while trying to find their local shop – due to their diminishing memory they can forget where the shop is, or where they live and why they went out of their house in the first place".&lt;ref name="Rudd"/&gt; People experiencing dementia also get lost more easily in poor visibility conditions because the mind fails to appropriately fill in cues as to missing landmarks.&lt;ref name="Rudd"/&gt; Getting lost in unfamiliar terrain can lead even an adult with a healthy mind to [[panic]] and engage in unthinking behaviors that make the situation even worse.&lt;ref name="Huth"&gt;John Edward Huth, ''The Lost Art of Finding Our Way'' (2013), p. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency of the mind to seek patterns and familiar signs can contribute to this in two ways. First the lost person may mistake features of the terrain for markers that were seen before they became lost, creating a false sense of orientation that may lead the lost person to pursue routes that take them even further off course. Second, the lost person may mistake such features for markers that were seen ''after'' they became lost, creating a false sense that they have made a circle and returned to an earlier point of their effort to find their bearings.&lt;ref name="Huth"/&gt;

==Historical occasions==
There have been some historically notable instances of people getting lost and either being rescued or dying. [[George Shannon (explorer)|George Shannon]], the youngest adult member of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] got lost on two occasions after being separated from the expedition. On August 26, 1804, he was sent to retrieve two pack horses; he was separated from the party for sixteen days and nearly starved, as he went without food for twelve days except for some grapes and rabbits. At first he thought he was behind the expedition, so he sped up thinking he could catch up.  Then, getting hungry, he went downstream to look for a trading party he could stay with. Finally [[John Colter]] was sent to find him. The second time was on August 6, 1805, when the expedition was at the [[Three Forks, Gallatin County, Montana|Three Forks]]. Shannon was dispatched up a fork the party had named Wisdom (the middle fork was named Jefferson and the placid fork, Philanthropy). He rejoined the party after three days by backtracking to the forks and following the trail of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Hs40SqVO0tIJ:www.heinzhistorycenter.org/secondary.aspx%3Fid%3D55%26contentID%3D494+lewis+and+clark+pittsburgh+1803&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiPP2H7MEk7K8VINv8XQ0R4_gfv-abmcUwhmM4BHIye7up3Cf2BQgWhGAepUQDGk_Y_ljhM57MzjJFozGtijoN-vkPszpY1JuKBVpAR-sf8hJZsukRAnxGNYO5cE4UcP6gDRqc3&amp;sig=AHIEtbSCubTHn2lUz2h2yZ9kTwIlt5lwxA "Chapter 4: Lewis and Clark".]  Heniz History Center exhibit.

[[John Muir]] wrote in his journals of an occasion when a visiting artist named Billy Simms "went forth to sketch while I was among the glaciers, and got lost - was thirty-six hours without food".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Muir]], in William Frederic Badè, ''The Writings of John Muir'' (1923), Vol. 9, p. 389.&lt;/ref&gt; Mentally ailing Church of England mission priest [[Alexander Mackonochie]] died after getting lost on December 14, 1887, while walking in the [[Mamore Forest|Forest of Mamore]], near [[Loch Leven (Highlands)|Loch Leven]], Scotland: the circumstances were later commemorated in a poem by [[William McGonagall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGonagall|first=William|title=The Tragic Death of the Rev.

==Fiction==
People are sometimes depicted in fiction and literature as getting lost, with substantial consequences. For example, due to "the physical structure of [[Rome]], whose streets were notoriously labyrinthine", it has been observed that "getting lost in Rome was staple of travel narratives".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wrigley, ''Regarding Romantic Rome'' (2007), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of getting lost is also a commonly reported theme of [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gislason, ''Neuroscience Notes'' (2015), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global waste trade''' is the [[international trade]] of [[waste]] between countries for further [[waste treatment|treatment]], [[waste disposal|disposal]], or [[waste recycling|recycling]]. Toxic or [[hazardous waste]]s are often exported from developed countries to [[developing countries]], also known as countries of the [[Global South]]. Therefore, the burden of the toxicity of wastes from Western countries falls predominantly onto developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name=laha&gt;Laha, Somjita. Transboundary Toxic E-Waste Flow: Environmental Injustice through Neo-ecological Imperialism. Diss. Erasmus U Rotterdam, 2011. N.p.: International Institute of Social Studies, n.d. Web. &lt;http://www.iss.nl/fileadmin/ASSETS/iss/Documents/Conference_presentations/NatureInc_Somjita_Laha.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[World Bank]] Report ''What a Waste: A Global Review of Solid Waste Management'', describes the amount of solid waste produced in a given country. Specifically, countries which produce more solid waste are more economically developed and more industrialized.&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;"What a Waste: A Global Review of Solid Waste Management." World Bank: 8–13. Urban Development. Web. http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTURBANDEVELOPMENT/Resources/336387-1334852610766/Chap3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The report explains that "[g]enerally, the higher the economic development and rate of urbanization, the greater the amount of solid waste produced.”&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt; Therefore, countries in the Global North, which are more economically developed and urbanized, produce more solid waste than Global South countries.&lt;ref name=worldbank /&gt;

Current international trade flows of waste follow a pattern of waste being produced in the Global North and being exported to and disposed of in the Global South. Multiple factors affect which countries produce waste and at what magnitude, including geographic location, degree of [[industrialization]], and level of integration into the global economy.

Numerous scholars and researchers have linked the sharp increase in waste trading and the negative impacts of waste trading to the prevalence of [[Neoliberalism#Economic neoliberalism|neoliberal economic policy]].&lt;ref name=nixon&gt;Nixon, Rob.

Pol'y 373 (1992)Fallacies of Free Market Environmentalism, The ; Blumm, Michael C.&lt;/ref&gt;  With the major economic transition towards neoliberal economic policy in the 1980s, the shift towards [[Free market|“free-market”]] policy has facilitated the sharp increase in the global waste trade. [[Henry Giroux]], Chair of Cultural Studies at McMaster University, gives his definition of neoliberal economic policy: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Neoliberalism ...removes economics and markets from the discourse of social obligations and social costs. ...As a policy and political project, neoliberalism is wedded to the privatization of public services, selling off of state functions, deregulation of finance and labor, elimination of the welfare state and unions, liberalization of trade in goods and capital investment, and the marketization and [[commodification]] of society.”&lt;ref&gt;Polychroniou, CJ. "Neoliberalism and the Politics of Higher Education: An Interview With Henry A. Giroux." Truthout. N.p., 26 Mar. 2013. Web. 13 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://truth-out.org/news/item/15237-predatory-capitalism-and-the-attack-on-higher-education-an-interview-with-henry-a-giroux&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Given this economic platform of privatization, neoliberalism is based on expanding free-trade agreements and establishing open-borders to international trade markets. [[Free trade|Trade liberalization]], a [[neoliberal]] economic policy in which trade is completely [[deregulation|deregulated]], leaving no tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions on international trade, is designed to further developing countries’ economies and integrate them into the global economy. Critics claim that although free-market trade liberalization was designed to allow any country the opportunity to reach economic success, the consequences of these policies have been devastating for Global South countries, essentially crippling their economies in a servitude to the Global North.&lt;ref name=laha /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Neoliberalism – Neoimperialism." EconomiX-CNRS (2005): 1–12. Web. &lt;http://www.oid-ido.org/IMG/pdf/neoico.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even supporters such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], “progress of integration has been uneven in recent decades” &lt;ref&gt;"Global Trade Liberalization and the Developing Countries – An IMF Issues Brief. International Monetary Fund. Nov. 2001. Web. 11 Apr. 2014. http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2001/110801.htm#i&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, developing countries have been targeted by trade liberalization policies to import waste as a means of [[economic expansion]].&lt;ref name=cato&gt;Johnson, J. “Potential Gains from Trade in Dirty Industries: Revisiting Lawrence Summers’ Memo.” 398–402. Cato Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; The guiding neoliberal economic policy argues that the way to be integrated into the global economy is to participate in trade liberalization and exchange in international trade markets.&lt;ref name=cato /&gt; Their claim is that smaller countries, with less infrastructure, less wealth, and less manufacturing ability, should take in hazardous wastes as a way to increase profits and stimulate their economies.&lt;ref name=cato /&gt;

==Current debate over global waste trade==

===Arguments supporting global waste trade===
Current supporters of global waste trade argue that importing waste is an economic transaction which can benefit countries with little to offer the [[global economy]].&lt;ref name=cato /&gt; Countries which do not have the production capacity to manufacture high quality products can import waste to stimulate their economy.

[[Lawrence Summers]], former President of Harvard University and Chief Economist of the World Bank, issued a confidential memo arguing for global waste trade in 1991. The memo stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I think the economic logic behind dumping a load of toxic waste in the lowest wage country is impeccable and we should face up to that… I’ve always thought that countries in Africa are vastly under polluted; their air quality is probably vastly inefficiently low compared to Los Angeles… Just between you and me shouldn't the World Bank be encouraging more migration of the dirty industries to the Least Developed Countries?"&lt;ref name=nixon /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This position, which is mainly motivated by economics and financial profit in particular, demonstrates the main argument for global waste trade. The Cato Institute published an article supporting global waste trade suggesting that “there is little evidence that hazardous wastes, which are often chronic carcinogens, contribute to death rates in developing countries.”&lt;ref name=cato /&gt; Elaborating on this point, the article argues that “people in developing countries would rationally accept increased exposure to hazardous pollutants in exchange for opportunities to increase their productivity—and, hence, their income.”&lt;ref name=cato /&gt;

Overall, the argument for global waste trade rests largely upon a perception that developing countries need to further their economic development. Supporters suggest that in engaging in global waste trade, developing countries of the Global South will expand their economies and increase profits.&lt;ref name=cato /&gt;

===Critiques of global waste trade===
Critics of global waste trade claim that lack of regulation and failed policies have allowed developing nations to become toxic dump yards for hazardous waste. The ever-increasing amounts of hazardous waste being shipped to developing countries increases the disproportionate risk that the people in these nations face. Critics of the effects of the global waste trade emphasize the enormous amount of hazardous wastes that people in poorer countries must deal with. They highlight the fact that most of the world’s hazardous wastes are produced by Western countries (the United States and Europe), yet the people who suffer [[health threat|negative health effects]] from these wastes are from poorer countries that did not produce the waste.

Peter Newell, Professor of Development Studies, argues that “environmental inequality reinforces and, at the same time reflects, other forms of hierarchy and exploitation along lines of class, race and gender.”&lt;ref name=newell&gt;Newell, Peter. "Race, Class, and the Global Politics of Environmental Inequality." Global Environmental Politics 5.3 (2005): 70–94. MIT Press Journals. Web. 14 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/1526380054794835&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguing that the detrimental effects of hazardous waste trade affect the disadvantaged more than others, critics of global waste trade suggest that the implications of dumping hazardous waste has significant consequences for [[Person of color|People of Color]], women, and low-income people in particular.&lt;ref name=newell /&gt;

Critiquing the global waste trade for reproducing inequality on a global scale, many activists, organizers, and environmentalists from regions affected in the Global South have vocalized their disappointment with global waste trade policies. Evo Morales, the first indigenous [[Amerind peoples|Amerindian]] President of Bolivia, argues against the current economic system forcing the exploitation of his country and people. He claims:&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we want to save the planet earth, to save life and humanity, we have a duty to put an end to the capitalist system. Unless we put an end to the capitalist system, it is impossible to imagine that there will be equality and justice on this planet earth. This is why I believe that it is important to put an end to the exploitation of human beings and to the pillage of natural resources, to put an end to destructive wars for markets and raw materials, to the plundering of energy, particularly fossil fuels, to the excessive consumption of goods and to the accumulation of waste. The capitalist system only allows us to heap up waste.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan. "Material World: Evo Morales:A Call for Socialism?" World Socialist Movement. The Socialist Party of Great Britain, n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2008/no-1246-june-2008/material-world-evo-moralesa-call-socialism&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Jean Francois Kouadio, an African native living near a toxic dump site in the Ivory Coast, explains his experience with the effects of toxic substances lingering throughout his community. With major Western corporations dumping their toxic wastes in the Ivory Coast, Kuoadio has lost two children to the effects of toxic wastes. He describes the loss of his second daughter Ama Grace, and how the doctors "said she suffered from acute glycemia caused by the toxic waste."&lt;ref&gt;Kauodio, Jean Francois. "Dirty Tricks and Toxic Waste in Ivory Coast." BBC, n.d. Web. 26 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article23715.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to critics from the Global South, researchers and scholars in the West have begun critiquing the uneven distribution of negative effects these hazardous waste dumpings are causing. [[Dorceta Taylor]], Professor at the University of Michigan, argues how Women of Color in the United States are disproportionately affected by these policies: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Women of color have been at the forefront of the struggle to bring attention to the issues that are devastating minority communities – issues such as hazardous waste disposal; exposure to toxins; ...Their communities, some of the most degraded environments ... are repositories of the waste products of capitalist production and excessive consumption. As a result, they have been in the vanguard of the struggle for environmental justice; they are the founders of environmental groups, grassroots activists, researchers, conference organizers, workshop leaders, lobbyists, and campaign and community organizers."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Dorceta E. "Women of Color, Environmental Justice, and Ecofeminism." In K. Warren (ed.) ''Ecofeminism: Women, Culture, Nature''(1997), pages 58–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

T.V. Reed, Professor of English and American Studies at Washington State University, argues that the correlation between historical colonialism and toxic colonialism is based on perceptions of indigenous land as ‘waste.’&lt;ref name=reed&gt;Toxic Colonialism, Environmental Justice, and Native Resistance in Silko's "Almanac of the Dead" T. V. Reed MELUS , Vol. 34, No. 2, Ethnicity and Ecocriticism (Summer, 2009) , pp. 25–42. https://www.jstor.org/stable/20532677.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that Western cultures have deemed indigenous land as “underdeveloped” and “empty,” and that the people inhabiting it are therefore less “civilized.”&lt;ref name=reed /&gt; Using the historical premises of colonialism, toxic colonialism reproduces these same arguments by defining Global South land as expendable for Western wastes.&lt;ref name=reed /&gt;

====Toxic colonialism====
[[Toxic Colonialism|Toxic colonialism]], defined as the process by which “underdeveloped states are used as inexpensive alternatives for the export or disposal of hazardous waste pollution by developed states,” is the core critique against the global waste trade.&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;Laura A. Pratt, Decreasing Dirty Dumping? A Reevaluation of Toxic Waste Colonialism and the Global Management of Transboundary Hazardous Waste, 35 Wm. &amp; Mary Envtl. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. (2011), http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmelpr/vol35/iss2/5&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic colonialism represents the [[neocolonial]] policy which continues to maintain [[global inequality]] today through unfair [[trade system]]s.&lt;ref name=pratt /&gt; Toxic colonialism uses the term colonialism because “the characteristics of colonialism, involving [[economic dependence]], [[exploitation of labour]], and cultural inequality are intimately associated within the new realm of toxic waste colonialism.” &lt;ref name=pratt /&gt;

==Electronic waste==
{{main|Electronic waste}}
Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices. A rapidly growing surplus of electronic waste around the world has resulted from quickly evolving technological advances, changes in media (tapes, software, MP3), falling prices, and [[planned obsolescence]]. An estimated 50 million tons of e-waste are produced each year, the majority of which comes from the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=developing&gt;Sthiannopkao S, Wong MH. (2012) Handling e-waste in developed and developing countries: Initiatives, practices, and consequences. Sci Total Environ.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of this electronic waste is shipped to developing countries in Asia and Africa to be processed and recycled.&lt;ref name=developing /&gt;

Various studies have investigated the [[Electronic waste#Environmental Impact of Electronic Waste|environmental and health effects]] of this e-waste upon the people who live and work around electronic waste dumps.  [[Heavy metal (chemical element)|Heavy metal]]s, [[toxin]]s, and chemicals leak from these discarded products into surrounding waterways and groundwater, [[poisoning]] the local people.&lt;ref name=E-Waste&gt;Wong, M.h., S.c. Wu, W.j. Deng, X.z. Yu, Q. Luo, A.o.w. Leung, C.s.c. Wong, W.j. Luksemburg, and A.s. Wong. "Export of Toxic Chemicals – A Review of the Case of Uncontrolled Electronic-Waste Recycling." Environmental Pollution 149.2 (2007): 131–40. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; People who work in these dumps, local children searching for items to sell, and people living in the surrounding communities are all exposed to these deadly toxins.

One city suffering from the negative results of the hazardous waste trade is [[Electronic waste in China|Guiyu, China]], which has been called the electronic waste dump of the world. It may be the world's largest e-waste dump, with workers dismantling over 1.5 million pounds of junked computers, cell phones and other electronic devices per year.&lt;ref&gt;"China's Electronic Waste Village – Photo Essays." Time. Time Inc., n.d. Web. 24 Apr. 2014. &lt;http://content.time.com/time/photogallery/0%2C29307%2C1870162_1822153%2C00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incinerator ash==
[[Incinerator bottom ash|Incinerator Ash]] is the [[Incineration|ash]] produced when incinerators burn waste in order to dispose of it. Incineration has many [[Incineration#pollution|polluting]] effects which include the release of various hazardous gases, [[Heavy metal (chemistry)#Heavy metal pollution|heavy metals]], and [[Sulfur dioxide#As an air pollutant|sulfur dioxide]].

===Khian Sea incident===
An example of incinerator ash being dumped onto the Global South from the Global North in an unjust trade exchange is the [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident]]. Carrying 14,000 tons of ash from an incinerator in Philadelphia, the cargo ship, Khian Sea, was to dispose of its waste.&lt;ref&gt;"Ash From Khian Sea Is On The Move Again The 14-year-old Philadelphia Waste, Dumped In Haiti 12 Years Ago, Is On Its Way To Be Disposed Of In Louisiana"&lt;/ref&gt; However, upon being rejected by The Dominican Republic, Panama, Honduras, Bermuda, Guinea Bissau, and the Dutch Antilles, the crew finally dumped a portion of the ash near Haiti.&lt;ref name=mcgraw&gt;Cunningham, William P &amp; Mary A (2004). Principles of Environmental Science. McGrw-Hill Further Education. p. Chapter 13, Further Case Studies. {{ISBN|0072919833}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After changing the name of the ship twice to try and conceal the original identity, Senegal, Morocco, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Singapore still banned the ship’s entry.&lt;ref name=mcgraw /&gt; Upon consistent rejections, the ash is believed to have been disposed of in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Hope (2001-02-18). "A Trail of Refuse". New York Times – Magazine. Retrieved 5 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Following this disaster of handling hazardous waste, the Haitian government banned all waste imports leading a movement to recognize all of the disastrous consequences of this global waste trade. Based on the Khian Sea waste disposal incident and similar events, the [[Basel Convention]] was written to resist what is known to developing countries as ‘toxic colonialism.’&lt;ref&gt;Dalyell, Tam (July 2, 1992). "Thistle Diary: Toxic Wastes and Other Ethical Issues". New Scientist: 50.&lt;/ref&gt; It was open for signature in March 1989 and went into effect in May 1992.&lt;ref name=basel&gt;"Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal."

==Chemical waste==
[[Chemical waste]] is the excess and unusable waste from hazardous chemicals, mainly produced by large factories. It is extremely difficult and costly to dispose of. It poses many problems and health risks upon exposure, and must be carefully treated in toxic waste processing facilities.

===Italy dumping hazardous chemicals in Nigeria===
One example of chemical waste being exported from the Global North onto the Global South was the event of an Italian business man seeking to avoid European economic regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Clapp, J. "Africa, NGOs, and the International Toxic Waste Trade." The Journal of Environment &amp; Development 3.2 (1994): 17–46. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly exporting 4,000 tons of toxic waste, containing 150 tons of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s, or PCBs, the Italian businessman made $4.3 million in shipping hazardous waste to Nigeria.&lt;ref name=okaru&gt;Okaru, Valentina O. "The Basil Convention: Controlling the Movement of Hazardous Wastes to Developing Countries." Fordham Environmental Law Review 6th ser. 4.2 (2011): 138. Web. 11 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fordham Environmental Law Review published an article explaining the impacts of the toxic waste imposed on Nigeria in further detail:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mislabelling the garbage as fertilizers, the Italian company deceived a retired/illiterate timber worker into agreeing to store the poison in his backyard at the Nigerian river port of [[Koko, Nigeria|Koko]] for as little as 100 dollars a month. These toxic chemicals were exposed to the hot sun and to children playing nearby. They leaked into the Koko water system resulting in the death of nineteen villagers who ate contaminated rice from a nearby farm."&lt;ref name=okaru /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; This is just one example of how the traditional trade flow, from developed Western countries has severely, unfairly, and disproportionately impacted developing countries in the Global South.

===Shipbreaking in Asia===
[[File:Jafrabad Chittagong shipbreaking (8).JPG|thumb|Shipbreaking in [[Chittagong]], Bangladesh]]
Another danger to developing countries is the growing issue of [[Ship breaking|shipbreaking]], which is occurring mainly in Asia. Industrialized countries seeking to retire used vessels find it cheaper to send these ships to Asia for dismantling. [[China]] and [[Bangladesh]] are seen as the two hubs of shipbreaking in Asia. One of the main issues lies in the fact that these ships which are now too aged to continue, were constructed at a time with less environmental regulation. In an environmental fact sheet, researchers demonstrate the immense impact this new toxic trade sector has on workers and the environment. For one, the older ships contain health-damaging substances such as [[asbestos]], [[lead oxide]], [[zinc chromate]]s, [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], and [[tributyltin]].&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, Samantha L. "A Toxic Trade: Ship Breaking in China." A China Environmental Health Project Fact Sheet (2007): n. 2. Web. &lt;http://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/shipbreaking_feb1.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, shipbreaking workers in China and in other developing countries traditionally lack proper equipment or protective gear when handling these toxic substances.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt;

==Impacts of the global waste trade==
The global waste trade has had negative effects for many people, particularly in poorer, developing nations. These countries often do not have safe recycling processes or facilities, and people process the toxic waste with their bare hands.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth. "Where Computers Go to Die — and Kill." Salon. N.p., 10 Apr. 2006. Web. &lt;http://www.salon.com/2006/04/10/ewaste&lt;/ref&gt; Hazardous wastes are often not properly disposed of or treated, leading to poisoning of the surrounding environment and resulting in illness and death in people and animals.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli&gt;Frazzoli, Chiara, Orish Ebere Orisakwe, Roberto Dragone, and Alberto Mantovani. "Diagnostic Health Risk Assessment of Electronic Waste on the General Population in Developing Countries' Scenarios." Environmental Impact Assessment Review 30 (2010): 388–99. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people have experienced illnesses or death due to the unsafe way these hazardous wastes are handled.

===Effects upon the environment===
The hazardous waste trade has disastrous effects upon the environment and natural ecosystems. Various studies explore how the concentrations of persistent organic pollutants have poisoned the areas surrounding the dump sites, killing numerous birds, fish, and other wildlife.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt; There are heavy metal chemical concentrations in the air, water, soil, and sediment in and around these toxic dump areas, and the concentration levels of heavy metals in these areas are extremely high and toxic.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt;

===Implications for human health===
The hazardous waste trade has serious damaging effects upon the health of humans. People living in developing countries may be more vulnerable to the dangerous effects of the hazardous waste trade, and are particularly at risk from developing health problems.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt; The methods of disposal of these toxic wastes in developing countries expose the general population (including future generations) to the highly toxic chemicals. These toxic wastes are often disposed of in open landfills, burned in incinerators, or in other dangerous processes. Workers wear little to no protective gear when processing these toxic chemicals, and are exposed to these toxins through direct contact, inhalation, contact with soil and dust, as well as oral intake of contaminated locally produced food and drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth. "Where Computers Go to Die — and Kill." Salon. N.p., 10 Apr. 2006. Web. &lt;http://www.salon.com/2006/04/10/ewaste/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Health problems resulting from these hazardous wastes affect humans by causing cancers, diabetes, alterations in neurochemical balances, hormone disruptions from [[endocrine disruptor]]s, skin alterations, [[neurotoxicity]], kidney damage, [[liver damage]], [[bone disease]], [[emphysema]], [[ovotoxicity]], [[reproductive damage]], and many other fatal diseases.&lt;ref name=Frazzoli /&gt; The improper disposal of these hazardous wastes creates fatal health problems, and is a serious public health risk.

==International responses to global waste trade issues==
There have been various international responses to the problems associated with the global waste trade and multiple attempts to regulate it for over thirty years. The hazardous waste trade has proven difficult to regulate as there is so much waste being traded, and laws are often difficult to enforce. Furthermore, there are often large loopholes in these international agreements that allow countries and corporations to dump hazardous wastes in dangerous ways. The most notable attempt to regulate the hazardous waste trade has been the [[Basel Convention]].&lt;ref name=Basel&gt;Abrams, David J. "Regulating the International Hazardous Waste Trade: A Proposed Global Solution." Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 28 (1990): 801–46. Hein Online. Web. 24 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International treaties and relevant trade law===

====Basel Convention====
The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the '''[[Basel Convention]]''', is an international treaty that plays a crucial role in regulating the transnational movement of hazardous wastes. The Basel Convention was created in 1989 and attempts to regulate the hazardous waste trade, specifically to prevent the dumping of hazardous waste from more developed countries into less developed countries.&lt;ref name=Basel /&gt; The Basel Convention was developed following a series of high-profile cases in which large amounts of toxic waste were dumped into less developed countries, poisoning the people and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Jonathan. "The Basel Convention and the International Trade in Hazardous Wastes." YEARBOOK OF INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT (2001/2002): 43–51. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention seeks to reduce the creation of hazardous wastes, and to control and reduce its trade across borders.

The Convention was opened for signatures on 22 March 1989, and officially entered into force on 5 May 1992.&lt;ref name=Basel /&gt; As of May 2014, 180 states and the European Union are parties to the Convention.&lt;ref name=Basel2&gt;"Parties to the Basel Convention." The Basel Convention. N.p., n.d. Web. 2 May 2014. &lt;http://www.basel.int/Countries/StatusofRatifications/PartiesSignatories/tabid/1290/Default.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Haiti and the United States have signed the Convention but not ratified it.&lt;ref name=Basel2 /&gt;

====ENFORCE====
The [[Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic]] (ENFORCE) is an agency staffed by relevant experts to promote compliance with the Basel Convention.&lt;ref name=ENFORCE&gt;ENFORCE. Terms of Reference for Cooperative Arrangements on Preventing and Combating Illegal Traffic: The Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic (ENFORCE). By UNEP. Bangkok, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an international body created to deal with transboundary issues of the international hazardous waste trade. Because the issue of the transnational hazardous waste trade crosses many borders and affects many nations, it has been important to have a multinational, multilateral organization presiding over these affairs. The members of ENFORCE include one representative from each of the five United Nations regions that are parties to the Convention as well as five representatives from the Basel Convention regional and coordinating centers, based on equitable geographical representation.&lt;ref name=ENFORCE /&gt; Members of organizations such as the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP), International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), NGOs working to prevent and stop illegal traffic such as the Basel Action Network (BAN), and many other organizations are also eligible to become members of ENFORCE.&lt;ref&gt;ENFORCE. Report of the First Meeting of the Environmental Network for Optimizing Regulatory Compliance on Illegal Traffic (ENFORCE). Bangkok, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protocol on Liability and Compensation====

In 1999 the Basel Convention passed the Protocol on Liability and Compensation that sought to improve regulatory measures and better protect people from hazardous waste. The Protocol on Liability and Compensation attempts to “assign appropriate liability procedures when the transboundary movements of hazardous wastes result in damages to human health and the environment”.&lt;ref name=Pratt&gt;Pratt, Laura A. "Decreasing Dirty Dumping? A Reevaluation of Toxic Waste Colonialism and the Global Management of Transboundary Hazardous Waste." William &amp; Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review 35.2 (2011): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol “imposes strict liability for damages in situations involving Parties to the Basel Convention, but only while they maintain control of the hazardous waste through their respective notifying, transporting, or disposing entities.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; It seeks to regulate and ensure countries’ and corporations’ compliance with the Basel Convention laws. However, this Protocol remains unsigned by most countries, so its applicability is limited.&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;

====Lomé IV Convention and Cotonou Agreement====

In an effort to protect themselves against unfair hazardous waste dumping, the African, Caribbean, and Pacific States (ACP) signed the Lome IV Convention, which is a supplement to the Basel Convention and prohibits the “export of hazardous wastes from the European Community to ACP States.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; This Convention is one attempt by developing countries to protect themselves from Western countries exporting their waste to poorer nations through the hazardous waste trade. When the Lomé IV Convention expired in 2000, the ACP countries and the European countries entered into a new agreement known as the Cotonou Agreement, which “recognizes the existence of disproportionate risks in developing countries and desires to protect against inappropriate hazardous waste shipments to these countries.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;

====The Bamako Convention====

In 1991 multiple developing nations in Africa met to discuss their dissatisfaction with the Basel Convention in regulating the dumping of hazardous waste into their countries, and designed a ban on the import of hazardous wastes into their countries called the [[Bamako Convention]]. The Bamako Convention is different from the Basel Convention in that Bamako “essentially bans the import of all hazardous waste generated outside of the OAU [the Organization of African Unity] for disposal or recycling and deems any import from a non-Party to be an illegal act.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; However, these countries could not effectively implement the stipulations of the Convention and could not prevent the dump of toxic wastes due to limited resources and a lack of powerful enforcement. Therefore, the application of the Bamako Convention was very limited.

===Critiques of these responses===
[[Laura Pratt]], expert on the hazardous waste trade, claims that despite local and international attempts to regulate the hazardous waste trade, the “current international agreements, both the widespread, legally binding agreements and the ad hoc agendas among smaller groups of countries, have not been as successful at eliminating toxic waste colonialism as proponents would have hoped.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; She explains that there are various loopholes in the current system that allow toxic waste to continue being dumped, and toxic colonialism to go unchecked. Some of the problems with these international agreements include continued illegal shipments and unclear definitions of terms.

====Fraudulent shipments and concealments====
Pratt explains that despite attempts to regulate illegal dumping, “[o]ftentimes hazardous waste is simply moved under false permits, bribes, improper labels, or even the pretext of 'recycling,' which is a growing trend.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; Companies often export their hazardous wastes to poorer countries through illegal smuggling.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Elisabeth. "Smuggling Europe’s Waste to Poorer Countries." The New York Times. N.p., 26 Sept. 2009. Web. &lt;http://www.mrwmd.org/archives/2009%20Board%20Meeting/October/MRWMDSep09_6a_Smuggling_Europe.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to regulate this market have been hindered by a lack of ability to monitor the trade, as many countries do not have any authoritative legislative bodies in place to prevent or punish the illegal trafficking of hazardous wastes.&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; Furthermore, Pratt explains that without coordinated international methods to enforce the regulations, it is extremely difficult for countries to "control the illegal trade of hazardous waste, due to the disparity between enforcement resources and regulation uniformity.” &lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt; Developing nations still bear the brunt of this illegal activity the most, and often do not have the resources or capability to protect themselves.

====Issues with legal definitions====
Another issue with the Basel Convention and other international agreements to regulate the waste trade is the difficulty of establishing clear, uniform definitions regarding wastes. These overly broad and ambiguous definitions cause problems with the international agreements, as different parties interpret the language of the agreements differently and thus act accordingly. For example, the “‘lack of distinction between ‘waste’ and ‘products’ in the convention and its vague criteria for ‘hazardous’ allowed the continued export of 'hazardous waste’ under the label of commodities or raw materials, despite the fact that these wastes still present environmental and health risks to developing countries.”&lt;ref name=Pratt /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7575">In [[optics]], '''group velocity dispersion''' (GVD) is a characteristic of a [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersive medium]], used most often to determine how the medium will affect the duration of an optical pulse traveling through it. Formally, GVD is defined as the derivative of the inverse of [[group velocity]] of light in a material with respect to [[angular frequency]],&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega} \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega)} \right)_{\omega=\omega_0},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; are angular frequencies, and the group velocity &lt;math&gt;v_g(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;v_g(\omega) \equiv \partial \omega / \partial k&lt;/math&gt;. The units of group velocity dispersion are [time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[distance], often expressed in fs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/mm.

Equivalently, group velocity dispersion can be defined in terms of the medium-dependent wave vector &lt;math&gt;k(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \left( \frac{\partial^2 k}{\partial \omega^2}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0},&lt;/math&gt;
or in terms of the [[refractive index]] &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; according to
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \equiv \frac{2}{c} \left(\frac{\partial n}{\partial \omega}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0} + \frac{\omega_0}{c}\left( \frac{\partial^2 n}{\partial \omega^2}\right)_{\omega=\omega_0}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==

Group velocity dispersion is most commonly used to estimate the amount of [[chirp]] that will be imposed on a pulse of light after passing through a material of interest. The relevant expression is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\textrm{chirp} = (\textrm{material} \,\, \textrm{thickness}) \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \, \times \, (\textrm{bandwidth}).&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation===

A simple illustration of how GVD can be used to determine pulse chirp can be seen by looking at the effect of a [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform-limited]]  pulse of duration &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; passing through a planar medium of thickness ''d''. Before passing through the medium, the phase offsets of all frequencies are aligned in time, and the pulse can be described as a function of time according to the expression
:&lt;math&gt;E(t) = Ae^{-\frac{t^2}{4 \sigma^2}}e^{-i \omega_0 t},&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently, as a function of frequency according to the expression
:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega) = Be^{-\frac{(w-w_0)^2}{4 (1/2\sigma)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
(the parameters ''A'' and ''B'' are normalization constants).
Passing through the medium results in a frequency-dependent phase accumulation &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi(\omega) = k(\omega) d&lt;/math&gt; , such that the post-medium pulse can be described by 
:&lt;math&gt;E(\omega) = Be^{-\frac{(w-w_0)^2}{4 (1/2\sigma)^2}}e^{i k(\omega) d}.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, the refractive index &lt;math&gt;n(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and therefore the wave vector &lt;math&gt;k(\omega) = n(\omega)\omega/c&lt;/math&gt;, can be an arbitrary function of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, making it difficult to analytically perform the inverse Fourier transform back into the time domain. However, if the bandwidth of the pulse is narrow relative to the curvature of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then good approximations of the impact of the refractive index can be obtained by replacing &lt;math&gt;k(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; with its [[Taylor Series|Taylor expansion]] centered about &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{n(\omega)\omega}{c} = \underbrace{\frac{n(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c}}_{k(\omega_0)} \quad+\quad \underbrace{\left[ \frac{n(\omega_0)+n'(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c}\right]}_{k'(\omega_0)}(\omega-\omega_0) \quad+\quad\frac{1}{2}\underbrace{\left[ \frac{2 n'(\omega_0) + n''(\omega_0)\omega_0}{c} \right]}_{\textrm{GVD}} (\omega-\omega_0)^2 \quad+\quad ...&lt;/math&gt;

Truncating this expression and inserting it into the post-medium frequency-domain expression results in a post-medium time-domain expression of 
:&lt;math&gt;E_{post}(t) = A_{post}\exp\left[-\frac{(t - k'(\omega_0) d)^2}{4 (\sigma^2-i \, \textrm{GVD} \, d/2)}\right] e^{i[k(\omega_0) d - \omega_0 t]}&lt;/math&gt;.
On balance, the pulse will have lengthened to an intensity [[standard deviation]] value of
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{post} = \sqrt{ \sigma^2 + \left[ d \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_0) \, \times \, \left(\frac{1}{2\sigma}\right)\right]^2  }&lt;/math&gt;
thus validating the initial expression. Note that for a [[Bandwidth-limited pulse|transform-limited]] pulse σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/2, which makes it appropriate to identify 1/(2σ&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) as the bandwidth.

===Alternate derivation===

An alternate derivation of the relationship between pulse chirp and GVD, which more immediately illustrates the reason why GVD can be defined by the derivative of inverse group velocity, can be outlined as follows. Consider two transform-limited pulses of carrier frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2&lt;/math&gt;, which are initially overlapping in time. After passing through the medium, these two pulses will exhibit a time delay between their respective pulse-envelope centers, given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_2)} - \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
The expression can be approximated as a [[Taylor Series|Taylor expansion]], giving 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} + \frac{\partial}{\partial \omega}\left( \frac{1}{v_g(\omega')}\right)_{\omega' = \omega_1}(\omega_2-\omega_1) - \frac{1}{v_g(\omega_1)} \right), &lt;/math&gt;
or,
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = d \, \times \, \textrm{GVD}(\omega_1) \, \times \, (\omega_2-\omega_1).&lt;/math&gt;
From here it is possible to imagine scaling this expression up two pulses to infinitely many. The frequency difference &lt;math&gt;\omega_2-\omega_1&lt;/math&gt; must be replaced by the bandwidth, and the time delay &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; evolves into the induced chirp.

==Group delay dispersion==

A closely related yet independent quantity is the '''group delay dispersion''' ('''GDD'''), defined such that group velocity dispersion is the group delay dispersion per unit length. GDD is commonly used as a parameter in characterizing layered mirrors, where the group velocity dispersion is not particularly-well defined, yet the chirp induced after bouncing off the mirror can be well-characterized. The units of group delay dispersion are [time]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, often expressed in fs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The group delay dispersion (GDD) of an optical element is the derivative of the [[group delay]] with respect to [[angular frequency]], and also the second derivative of the optical phase. &lt;math&gt;D_2(\omega) = -\frac{\partial T_g}{d \omega} = \frac{d^2 \phi}{d\omega^2}&lt;/math&gt;. It is a measure of the [[chromatic dispersion]] of the element. GDD is related to the total dispersion parameter &lt;math&gt;D_{tot}&lt;/math&gt; as

&lt;math display="block"&gt; D_2(\omega) = -\frac{2\pi c}{\lambda^2}D_{tot}&lt;/math&gt;

'''The Hermit's Cave''', situated on Scenic Hill on the northeastern outskirts of [[Griffith, New South Wales]], [[Australia]], is in fact a complex of stone structures.

Misleadingly called 'The Hermit's Cave', the site in reality comprises a complex of shelters, terraced gardens, exotic plants, water-cisterns, dry-stone walling and linking bridges, stairways and paths that stretch intermittently across more than a kilometre of the escarpment. Made single-handedly  by  a reclusive Italian migrant, [[Valerio Ricetti]], these structures involved the moving of hundreds of tons of stone and earth, together with the ingenious incorporation of natural features in the landscape.

The site is recognised for being a rare example of an Australian hermit's domain. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 12 January 2007.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5056544|Hermit's Cave Complex|hr=01766|fn=H05/00285|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Over the period from around 1929 to 1952 the hermit [[Valerio Ricetti]] fashioned an outcrop of rock shelters and rock overhangs on a ridge top site outside Griffith into his living quarters. The historical archaeological complex includes rock shelters (some modified into cave-like enclosures), dry-stone walling, stone stairways and paths, terraced gardens, water cisterns, remnant plantings, inscriptions and rock murals. Over more than two decades Ricetti developed, utilised and occupied structures along the one kilometre long site where he lived in isolated seclusion from 1929 to 1941. He continued to work on the site until 1952 when he returned to Italy where he died in the same year.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

===Valerio Ricetti's history as told by others===

Valerio Ricetti was born in north [[Italy]] around 1897-98 in [[Sondalo]], a small town in a valley in the Italian [[Alps]], close to the border with [[Switzerland]]. In his home region he was apprenticed as a cement and stonemason and gained experience working on road and rail tunnel constructions. With the declining economic situation and impending war in Europe, his uncle encouraged him to migrate to Australia to seek better opportunities. Aged 16 or 17, Ricetti arrived at [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]],  [[South Australia]], in October 1914. He worked at Port Pirie for a few months before heading off to [[Broken Hill]] where he stayed at the Ceccato boarding house (signed-on as being 18 years old) and obtained work in the mines with Valentino Ceccato and Francesco Bicego. During his time at Broken Hill Ricetti learned to speak English which he spoke well although he retained an accent. Later, Ceccato and Bicego left Broken Hill and came to Griffith. Ricetti continued to work in the mines until 1918 when he left Broken Hill, heartbroken from being spurned by a barmaid he intended to marry. This love affair devastated him and scarred him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3793&gt;P Ceccato 2001:15,43, pers.comm. 2004;  B Ceccato pers.comm. 2004; J Bicego pers. comm. 2004; J Bugno n.d: 1, cited in Caillard 2005: 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti travelled to South Australia where he worked at various jobs for several years. His life experiences fed his disillusionment with humanity.  With a year's timber-cutting wages in his pocket he departed for [[Adelaide]] where he visited a brothel. On leaving he found that he had left his wallet behind, but the bouncer would not allow him back in. He hurled a rock through a window, was chased and ended up in [[Adelaide Gaol]]. On release he left for [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].  In [[Melbourne]] he intended to pawn his one remaining possession, a coat, but a passer-by who offered to pawn it for him never returned. He moved on to [[Burrinjuck, New South Wales|Burrinjuck]], NSW, in 1928. In the decade since he left Broken Hill Ricetti had befriended many people but few of these friendships had lasted long. Leaving Burrinjuck, he set out on his own. For the next twelve months or so Ricetti followed the [[Murrumbidgee River]] downstream to the [[Lachlan River]] then upstream to [[Hillston, New South Wales|Hillston]], NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Griffith's newspaper, "The Area News", reported in 1977 that "He finally found work on a riverboat of the period. He later explained that he had been a sailor on the Murray and that his "ship" had been the Mary Anne. The Mary Anne was one of the many boats that steamed the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, and it would appear that Ricetti was to learn more about life during the period he spent on board her; perhaps something about love, unrequited. On the walls of his cave he etched a brief, pathetic epitaph to those days - two hearts and an anchor".&lt;ref&gt;(Fenwick 1977: 8 )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti walked along the railway line to Griffith, with no idea of where he was heading. He was searching for a location where he could be on his own. That did not eventuate and he reached in Griffith in 1929.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Arriving on the outskirts of Griffith, a sudden rainstorm drove him to seek shelter on Scenic Hill. Next day he explored the area. About a quarter of the way down from the hilltop, he found a huge overhanging rock which was dry underneath. Close by he saw  two reservoirs full of water and fruit and vegetable farms at the foot of the hill. To the west was the town rubbish dump which teemed with rabbits.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Tired of travelling, and with no money left, he later recalled saying to himself "I have found the [[Garden of Eden]]". Ricetti decided to construct a private utopia, by making the cave his permanent home. He scavenged the rubbish dump where he found a half-worn out shovel, a pick head and an axe head. He felled tree branches to make handles for them. He believed himself to be the only Italian in the area and kept entirely to himself. In reality, his old compatriots Ceccato and Bicego from Broken Hill had settled nearby and increasing numbers of Italian migrants were settling the area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti cleared and decorated the caves, creating massive stone galleries and pathways, cliff-side gardens and floral painted rock walls. He worked at night and early in the morning, to remain unseen, eventually moving hundreds of tonnes of rock. Digging under the huge rock, the earth that he threw out rolled down the steep hillside. So he set about building a stone retaining wall. As it was gradually back-filled, he increased the retaining wall height and length. Finally it reached 9 metres long and 2.4 metres high. This gave him a level surface of 2.7 to 3.7 metres outside the cave. Portions on either side of the rock were closed off with stones and clay mortar leaving an opening just  over 1 metre wide and 2 metres high to enter the cave.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Outside he planted flowers on both sides of a path that led to the top of the retaining wall. Turning right, he then followed along the top of the wall for about 6 metres where he had made a pathway a little over half a metre wide that led to and from the cave.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Under the lookout, some 36 metres to the right, is a formation of three high rocks in a half circle. The centre one is fashioned by nature as a dome. In front of these rocks he built a stone retaining wall about 1.5 metres high and 4.5 metres long. This he filled with earth to level it, and then he planted more flowers. He called it his "shrine".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Further west he found an area that was partly surrounded by a sheer wall of rocks jutting out from the sloping hill. He made flower beds with pathways leading from one bed to another. On the sloping side he built small stone retaining walls. Near a corner of this complex were four large rocks, joined together front and back, with one either side forming a central open space about 3 metres in diameter. The top was open. On the garden side was a hole about a metre deep that he had to crawl through to get inside. Ricetti dug down in front of the hole to make it large enough to walk through, but just over half a metre down he found rock. At this level he dug inwards, carrying the soil up and forming more flowerbeds. At the centre of this "room" was a rock a little over half a metre high and too large to move. So with stone and clay mortar he shaped it into a table. At the entrance he made a stairway so he could walk down to the cave. For the top he laid thin poles across like a lattice, planting grapevines and wisteria to form a canopy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Close to these gardens he had a couple of places to hide when people came. These places were not developed in any prominent way. But over the other side of the hill, some 180 metres from the main cave,  he built a stone walled circular cave amongst shrubs, around a large tree with a peephole which afforded him another place to hide when people appeared.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In 1935 Ricetti fell off some rocks, breaking his leg and badly bruising his ribs. A passing swagman found him and notified an ambulance that took Ricetti to hospital where the Government Medical Officer, Dr E.W. Burrell, attended to him. He became a celebrity when the enormity of his work on Scenic Hill was discovered. During Ricetti's hospitalisation Wade Shire Council came to his assistance, resolving 'to attend to and maintain the gardens during the hermit's indisposition. Councillor Lenehan stated that the recluse, by vast labour, had added considerably to the interest of Griffith outlook and it was up to the Council to do something for him.'&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

After leaving hospital Ricetti returned to his reclusive existence. Anxious to pay Dr Burrell for his treatment, however, Ricetti slipped into town at night and worked in the doctor's garden. After a few visits the doctor caught him and explained to Ricetti that payment was made to him by the Government.  A friendship grew between the two, which Ricetti valued greatly. Dr Burrell would visit Ricetti regularly at the cave and leave boxes with useful items such as clothes and shoes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In 1937 a Mr Agostini wandered up the hill one night and came face to face with Ricetti. In conversation the names Ceccato and Bicego came up and Ricetti commented  that he had worked at Broken Hill with people of those names.  Agostini informed Ceccato of his contact with  Ricetti and the acquaintance between Ceccato, Bicego and Ricetti was renewed.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

On weekends they would pick up Ricetti, and take him to places where he met many people. They would try to coax him to come and live among them, but the hill remained his home. By now Ricetti had become more socialised and did not shy away from people.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

During World War II  Ricetti was interned as an enemy alien. He had allegedly lined one of his caves with newspapers that included reports of Hitler with the swastika prominently displayed (Fenwick 1977: 9 ). He was put to work building roads and instructed his captors on how to improve their road-building methods. After four months he was assessed, declared a deranged person and moved to a mental institution at [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], NSW. Six months later he was released and sent back to Griffith where the police met him and told him to get a job, find accommodation and not go back to the hill. Asked if he could name someone he gave Valentino Ceccato's name, who agreed to take him in.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

From 1942 to 1952 Ricetti  worked and lived at the Ceccato's, first on Valentino Ceccato's farm until 1948 and then on the farm of Valentino'a son and daughter-in-law, Bruno and Nora Ceccato. From 1943-47 Ricetti worked in the orchards and vineyards alongside Valentino's son, Peter Ceccato, to whom he told stories of his life.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3794&gt;P. Ceccato 2001: 43, 45;  B &amp; N Ceccato pers. comm. 2004, cited in Caillard 2005: 29, 32-33&lt;/ref&gt; But Ricetti was always a loner, working away from others on the farm and sleeping in the pruning shed. He was troubled by visions and obsessed with his cave: "Disturbing him also was an illusion - a "man and woman in the sky". Very real to him, they towered above him, demanding that he do more and more work." By all accounts these visions stemmed from his disastrous love affair in Broken Hill.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3795&gt;Ceccato 2001: 37; pers. comm. B &amp; N Ceccato and P. Ceccato 2004, cited in Caillard 2005: 33&lt;/ref&gt; Ricetti spent as much time as possible at his cave where he stuffed his earnings from Ceccato into clefts in the rocks before Ceccato opened a bank account into which he paid Ricetti's wages direct (Fenwick 1977: 9 ).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In May 1952 Ricetti  was in bad health and used the 1400 pounds he had amassed in wages to return to Italy and his brother, with whom he had lost contact.  He clearly intended to return as he bought a return ticket and left his savings in the bank.  But in November 1952 Bruno Ceccato received notice from the Municipality of Sondrio Vatellina that Ricetti had died&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3796&gt;B&amp;N; Ceccato pers. comm. 2004; P Ceccato 2001: 47, cited in Caillard 2005: 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most information for this section is taken from: Peter Kabaila, "Griffith Heritage", 2005: 105-108. Also consulted:  W.H. Fenwick, "The Area News", 3 February 1977, 8-9; Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, [[University of Sydney]], 2005: Vol 1, 28-34).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

===Valero Ricetti's history as documented===
There is very little documentation on Valerio Ricetti's life in Australia and it is almost exclusively confined to records of his internment, dated 1942-45, held by National Archives Australia. Much of the information contained in these records is in the form of Ricetti's answers to a Military Police Questionnaire prior to his internment in 1942. But very little of  this information provided by Ricetti can be substantiated by other documents.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Additionally, a photocopy of an employee record for [[BHP]] mines was obtained by both J Bicego and J Bugno.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Photocopies of most documents are reproduced in Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 2, 1-30.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Additional enquiries were undertaken by the Heritage Office with National Archives Australia (NAA);  State [[Record (magazine)|Record]] Offices in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales;  Glenside Campus (formerly Parkside Lunatic Asylum), Adelaide and Griffith Base Hospital, NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

There is no record of Ricetti's date of birth. In 1942 it is recorded as 12 March 1897&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3797&gt;Caillard 2005: 7, 8, 11,12&lt;/ref&gt; and also as 12 March 1903.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3798&gt;http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/Imagine.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The latter date is likely incorrect as Ricetti would have been only 11 or 12 years old on arrival in Australia.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's arrival date and port of entry into Australia cannot be verified. In 1942 he reports that he arrived in 1914 at Adelaide, date and ship's name unknown, that he paid his own fare and that he had no family or friends in Australia on arrival.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3799&gt;Caillard 2005: 7, 8, 11, 12&lt;/ref&gt; But there is no record of his entry into a South Australian port as either a passenger, crew member or ship's deserter over a wide date range around 1914. Neither is he recorded as a passenger entering through a port in [[Western Australia]] or Victoria over an equally wide date range. Passenger shipping arrivals into [[Sydney]] for this period are not indexed, therefore were not searched (Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: NAA Adelaide, [[Perth]], Melbourne; State Records SA, NSW; Public Record Office Victoria).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

On arrival in Australia, Ricetti claims to have spent "about one year in a mental hospital in South Australia, after which he went to Alice Springs and on to the [[Northern Territory]]".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3800&gt;Caillard 2005: 8&lt;/ref&gt; One month later Ricetti claims that he worked in the Broken Hill mines from 1914–17 and on the railways at [[Grafton, New South Wales|Grafton]], NSW, from 1917-21 after which he came to Griffith where he was employed by various Italian farmers for a few days at a time. The records from 1942 also note Ricetti's two court appearances in the period before his arrival in Griffith:  at Adelaide on 7 October 1919 for a breach of the War Precautions Act (Aliens) (offence unspecified), fined five pounds or one month's hard labour and at [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]], NSW, on 14 October 1927 for stealing, fined ten pounds or two months hard labour. The same records note that Ricetti claimed to have left his passport at the Adelaide Police Station but that enquiries failed to confirm this and that examination of his finger prints revealed that Ricetti was also known in Adelaide as Frank Pullen and Frank Muler.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3801&gt;Caillard 2005: 12, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Of these claims, only Ricetti's employment at the Broken Hill mines in 1917, his 1927 fine for stealing and a possible gaol sentence in Adelaide in 1919 can be substantiated in the documentary record.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Records of the former Parkside Lunatic Asylum, Adelaide (the only such institution in South Australia at that time) for the period 1914-20 reveal no entries under various possible spellings of Valerio Ricetti or his two aliases.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3802&gt;Caillard 2005: 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's employment at Broken Hill mines can be verified for only 9 days, 17 to 26 May 1917, after which date he left. The record shows that he resided at Eyre St, [[South Broken Hill, New South Wales|South Broken Hill]] which was the Ceccato boarding house at 305 Eyre Street. He is recorded as Vito Ricetti and his age given as 22 years (instead of 20 years), his age probably falsified to gain employment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3803&gt;Caillard 2005: 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Adelaide Register of Prisoners has no record for Valerio Ricetti but has two entries for Franz Recitti in 1919 and 1920. The related documents have not been sighted by the Heritage Office but these entries may tally with one of Ricetti's aliases and relate to either his 1919 breach of War Precautions or the Adelaide brothel offence related by Peter Ceccato&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3804&gt;Ceccato 2001: 17-23&lt;/ref&gt;(Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: State Records SA).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

There is no record of Ricetti working on the railways at Grafton between 1917 and 1921 (Heritage Office pers. comm. 2006: NSW State Records).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Police Charges and Summons Book, 1924-28 for Barham, NSW, (on the [[Murray River]]) records that Ricetti pleaded guilty on 14 October 1927 to stealing 40 dozen oranges for which he was fined 10 pounds in default of two months hard labour in [[Deniliquin]] Gaol ([[Charles Sturt University]], NSW, Regional Archives).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

During World War II, "enemy aliens" resident in Australia were required to register under National Security (Aliens Control) Regulations, to report to the police station each week and to carry an identify card at all time to avoid arrest ([[Dalton, New South Wales|Dalton]] &amp; Polkinghorne 1990: 845). Ricetti's internment record&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3798/&gt; and associated documents held by the NAA&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3805&gt;Caillard 2005: 16-25&lt;/ref&gt; confirm his internment as an enemy alien between May 1942 and December 1943. The documents also reveal the difference in assessment of Ricetti the individual by the local and state police services.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti was arrested by Griffith Police on 4 March 1942 for failing to register as an alien and to report to police .  Ricetti's statement that he was unaware of the requirement to register was accepted by the local police. He was charged with "being deemed insane and found wandering at large" but was discharged five days later following examination by Dr Burrell (who had attended him in Griffith Hospital in 1935) who pronounced him "completely harmless and therefor (sic) not a subject for medical attention in an institution".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3800/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

In his reports to the Commissioner of Police, Sydney, the Officer-in-Charge of Griffith Police noted that Ricetti spoke German, French and Italian quite fluently. He commented on Ricetti's residence on Scenic Hill, his "considerable skill in stonework", and his work "to beautify the hill" which Ricetti had asserted to him to be "his mission in life" .  The officer noted that Ricetti had "long been regarded as an eccentric" and the "difficulty is experienced in getting anything like a coherent story from him" . He concluded that Ricetti was a "harmless mental deficient who lives the life of a hermit" and that it was not proposed to begin proceedings against him.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3806&gt;Caillard 2005: 8, 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Military Police [[Intelligence (newspaper)|Intelligence]], Sydney, however, thought otherwise. They required Ricetti's completion of a four page questionnaire and a search of his premises for "literature of subversive or disloyal nature" or "prohibited possessions". The search carried out on 10 April 1942 by Griffith Police found nothing.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3807&gt;Caillard 2005: 10, 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The questionnaire appears to have been completed in two stages with handwritten entries by Griffith Police and later, typed entries (that include Ricetti's court appearances) probably entered by Military Police Intelligence in Sydney. These typed entries give a more critical assessment of Ricetti. They comment that Ricetti resides "in the highest and most secluded locality in the District  ... about a mile from the various petrol depots, electricity substations and water channels in the Irrigation Area" and that he "is known to wander about at night". The entry continues that Ricetti "is regarded with a good deal of suspicion"—a statement that does not square with Griffith Police's assessment of Ricetti as "harmless" and "eccentric"—and concludes "We are of the opinion that this alien should be interned.".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3808&gt;Caillard 2005: 8, 12-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti was arrested on 3 May 1942 on Scenic Hall and removed to the [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] internment camp (south-west of Sydney) from where he was transferred to [[Cowra]] in July 1942. Records show he was released from Camp 12, Cowra on 16 December 1942  but also transferred from Cowra to [[Loveday, South Australia|Loveday]] internment camp, SA, on 21 April 1943.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3809&gt;Caillard 2005: 18, 23&lt;/ref&gt; One account suggests Ricetti was moved during his internment to a mental institution in Orange, NSW, for treatment.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3810&gt;Ceccato 2001: 35 &amp; 9&lt;/ref&gt; However there is no record for that period of Ricetti being admitted to [[Orange Health Service|Bloomfield Hospital]], Orange (at that time the only mental institution in Orange) .&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3811&gt;Caillard 2005: 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti was released from Loveday on 5 December 1943 and taken to Sydney where he gave his new place of abode as Farm 219 [[Yoogali]], Griffith (Valentino and Elizabeth Ceccato's farm). A year later (30 November 1944) Ricetti notified his change of abode from Farm 219 Yoogali to Scenic Hill, Griffith. This would indicate the earliest official acceptance of his occupation of this Crown Reserve as his place of abode, even though he is remembered as living on the Ceccato farm at that time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's departure from Sydney cannot be confirmed as NSW passenger shipping lists for 1952 are not indexed and therefore were not searched.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The absence of documentary verification for much of Ricetti's story can be at least partly explained by the loss or destruction of many records over time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

===European traditions of hermitism and North Italian cultural influences===

Ricetti's experience aligns with European traditions of hermitism that are not essentially religious in origin whereby an individual makes a conscious (rather than an enforced) choice to remove himself or herself from society, often after a long period of solitary wandering (Ricetti trekked on foot for a decade from Adelaide through north Victoria and southern NSW to Griffith). Ricetti's choice of landscape conforms to many European hermit dwellings. Caves are frequently chosen, particularly those located on steep hillsides or in mountains. In this respect Ricetti would have drawn on his Italian upbringing  in a mountain valley of north Italy in making his choice of dwelling on the 200 metre high escarpment of the southern edge of the [[McPherson Range]]—a prominent ridge top location in the predominantly flat [[Riverina]] Plain. Spiritual iconography is common even among hermits living outside a recognised religious tradition.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's use of:
:(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling combined with backfilling  to create terraces for cultivation on steep and rocky slopes. The use of stone for farmhouses and the skill of dry stone (with no mortar) constructions are prominent in this region as is the use of terracing for cultivation.
:(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees
:(c) the "Chapel"  with its painted Christian iconography.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sources: http://www.hermitary.com; http://www.councilgrove.com/her_cave.htm; Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005: Vol 1: 134)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

== Description ==
The Hermit's Cave Complex is a collection of rock shelters and rock [[Overhang (architecture)|overhangs]] (several of which have been modified by Ricetti to create cave-like enclosures) with elaborate stoneworks and earthworks created by Ricetti, all of which are located along a long, narrow ridge top site outside Griffith. Ricetti's work is over more than one kilometre along the south-eastern face of Scenic Hill which is a  200 metre high escarpment on the southern-most part of the McPherson Range. Scenic Hill is now adjacent to the western edge of  the Collina residential suburb. The southern and northern edges of the site are defined by  Ricetti's hide-outs constructed in rocky outcrops.  The western perimeter is currently defined by  the road reserve boundary of Scenic Drive although there are possibly remnants of other constructions west and north-west of this road.  The area of the nominated site comprises 16.16 ha with a length of 1150 m and varying widths of approximately 120 to 190m.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The archaeological remains of the site are located in discrete areas along the length of the site across a distance of  over one kilometre.  From south-east to north-west these remains are grouped as follows:&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;1) Far South Rock Shelter  (possible main western hide-out)
* 40-step stone stair;
* hide-out with open rock shelter with three large stone blocks placed in a row;
* small, natural shelter with a narrow passage leading into a small chamber containing natural stone blocks that form a window opening.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;2) South Rock Shelter (possible first dwelling)

Rock shelter containing:
* 18-step stone stair;
* dwelling with partly intact stone enclosure walls;
* remnant stonework (remains of the wall and another stone stair).
The small size of the shelter and absence of rock inscriptions and rock murals suggests this was a short-term dwelling used by Ricetti before he constructed and moved into the second, more substantial dwelling.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;3) Southern Garden and Rock Shelter (possible second dwelling)
This dwelling is associated with two gardens, three cisterns, a rock shelter popularly known as "La Scala" (Opera House) and its inscriptions. It is recorded in historical photographs and is remembered to have been built and occupied before the third dwelling.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''A) Rock Shelter containing:''
* east stone stair leading to the garden;
* bottom stone stair from the east, leading to a narrow passage between two boulders with a low wall into the dwelling;
* dwelling, being a rock shelter overhang that was walled off, containing a stonework window;
* top stone stair rising from the rock shelter overhang;
* west stone stair into a narrow passage between two boulders leading to a second, small chamber that contains a large flattish stone). This chamber is thought to have been a cistern.
* holes (chiselled out) that were used to support timber [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] structures.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''B) Gardens''
The largest and most complex zone of the site being 60 metres long and 35 metres wide. Located along the base of a cliff face below the ridge top with a drop in level of 10 metres.
:i) Upper Garden. Designed as three terraces with cisterns, connecting [[stairs]], paths and a dwelling. Its remnant features are earthwork terraces with stone [[retaining wall]]s; metal materials (steel sheet, wire) for shoring terraces and construction; remnant fig plantings; remnant yucca plantings and yucca plantings that have invaded the surrounding area.
:ii) Lower Garden.  Contains the best -constructed and best-preserved example of Ricetti's stonework. It comprises an earth-filled stone retaining wall forming an elevated walkway.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''C) Cisterns''
:i) Uppermost Cistern.  Situated in the top terrace and fed by moisture from the cliff face.
:ii) Second Cistern.  Situated outside the north-eastern retaining walls of the garden at the middle terrace level and fed by moisture from the cliff face and surface run-off.
:iii) Lower Cistern. Adjacent to and below the lower garden and fed by  surface run-off from the gardens and possibly the top cistern.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''D) Natural Amphitheatre-Shaped Rock Shelter featuring:''
* stone retaining wall to form a bridge;
* stone staircase remnants;
* location of a bush timber ladder that was used to provide access to a rock shelf;
* rock inscriptions at the base of the cliff with a mixture of Christian and other motifs.
i) Rock shelter popularly known as 'La Scala' (or the 'Opera House')
* a place of suitable acoustics where Ricetti used to stand and call out. His voice could sometimes be heard as far away as the town
ii) Rock inscriptions at 'La Scala':

Rock inscriptions occur in three areas.

a) The lower rock gallery is at the base of the cliff and contains a mixture of Christian and other symbols:
* a court jester's face and hat, with three crucifixes representing the hill of Calvary;
* three fishes (an early Christian symbol) intertwined;
* apocalyptic message, incomplete, in back to front lettering in a combination of Latin and Italian: 'paratus nun qua no...'('be prepared').
b) Partly up the rock face, near the stone stair to the "La Scala" rock shelf, is the date 1918 and initials RV ( Valerio Ricetti's, back to front). This date predates Ricetti's known arrival in the area.

c) Inscription on a rock floor of later date is {{circa|1923}} (also predates Ricetti's arrival).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''E) Two Stone Stairs''
*  upper stone stair built with low risers (possibly for carrying rocks from the quarry);
*  hidden stone stair, winding down through a passage between boulders.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;4) Central 'Hide-Outs'
*  stone stair on contour forming part of the main track linking the gardens with the 'Main Cave';
*  natural chamber formed by two boulders with stone blocks at the entrance (the lower hide-out);
*  small natural rock shelter with no stonework (the upper hide-out).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;5) Main Cave (possible third dwelling)
This dwelling is the best-known and best-maintained of Ricetti's works. It is associated with other structures that are popularly known as "Kitchen", "Gun Post", "Art Gallery", "Chapel", stone stair and "The Cliffs Cave" inscription.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''A) Rock Shelter containing:''
* stone-walled sleeping chamber with doorway;
* painted rock murals featuring flower and ship's anchor motifs;
* second chamber with fireplace, known as the 'Kitchen';
* remnant fig planting;
* remnant oleander planting;
* back-filled retaining walls separating the dwelling from the "Gun Post".&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''B) 'Gun Post'''

A stone earthwork resembling a small fortification. Historical photographs show a gang plank bridge connecting it to the third dwelling. No evidence of a real defensive purpose has been found, but it appears to have been used by Ricetti to monitor his surroundings.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''C) 'Art Gallery'''

A separate chamber connected to the third dwelling. This was remembered to contain a cinema poster of King Kong.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''D) 'Chapel'''

* natural rock amphitheatre with views to the east;
* earthwork terraces with stone retaining walls;
* various materials (steel, wire) still in place and visible, for shoring up and reinforcing the terraces;
* rock mural with cross and the initials VR to the left of the cross and RV to the right of it.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''E) Stone Stair''

90-step remnant of stone stair constructed by Ricetti.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

''F) "The Cliffs Cave" Inscription''

A historic inscription (predating Ricetti's occupation) reads "H.M. Alf. Irv. Driver The Cliffs Born Nov. 21/-70". Alf Driver was the pioneer selector of the local property, The Cliffs. The inscription is chiselled in elegant, cursive script into the floor of the rock shelter which is located near a hazardous rock ledge that is reached by a narrow passage between two boulders. From the rock shelter there is a magnificent 180 degree view of the Riverina Plain and the slopes of the hill below. The site clearly has a larger and previous history of use by settlers and travellers and probably an even older Aboriginal association.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;6) North Rock Shelter (1)
A narrow, rectangular shelter with two built walls, it is  well concealed at the foot of a sheer rock face. Located about 100 metres north-east of the third dwelling, it is connected by pathways to the third dwelling, ridge top and North Rock Shelter (2).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;7) North Rock Shelter (2)
Defining the northern limits of the Hermit's Cave Complex, it is located about 100 metres north-east of North Rock Shelter (1):
*  enclosed rock shelter, well concealed and out of sight from both the ridge top and from below;
*  30-step stone stair connecting the shelter to the ridge top and the bottom of the hill. The top section (10 steps) is steep and narrow, descending between two rock faces.
*  faded white diagonal lines painted on one internal rock face.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

;8) Site of Western Shelter
This site is known through archival photographs and supported by oral history although no physical evidence of the structure has been found. Its stone structures were probably dismantled for use in gardens. Its location has been given as 'just to the west of the track [Scenic Drive] about 100-200 yards in on the flat, north-north-west of the cave's old entrance, north of the look-out'.

Archival photographs indicate a worked stone structure with large, smooth-finished rectangular blocks framing a wooden doorway with jambs and curved [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]] of "wilga timber". The structure was a small room built around a hollow wilga tree at the base of which Ricetti had built a fireplace so that the tree could serve as a [[chimney]]. The door and a peephole allowed Ricetti to view the approaches from all sides.  Ricetti used the structure as both a kitchen and a hide-out but abandoned it because of visitors or vandals.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Sources: Peter Kabaila, 'Hermit's Cave, Conservation Management Strategy for Griffith City Council', 2006; Bobby Caillard, "Recovering the Lost Landscape of Valeri Ricetti: the archaeology of an individual", BA (Hons) thesis, University of Sydney, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

=== Condition ===

The gardens were reported to be in a fair condition as at 19 June 2006, although erosion of clay mortar supporting the stone masonry work on the retaining walls is a concern. Erosion is equally a concern on the retaining walls to the "Chapel". Graffiti is a concern, with graffiti damage to some of Ricetti's original rock art.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Some of the staircases are still in a pristine condition. Taking into account the nature of the rudimentary construction, the site is remarkably intact.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The site has considerable archaeological potential. There are possibly remnants of constructions to the west and north-west of Scenic Drive  (outside the nominated curtilage) but their locations are unknown.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The site retains most of its original design and material. Much of the original stonewalling is intact. It has suffered some damage due to graffiti, vandalism and erosion of original material.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
The landscape has been modified on several occasions between the 1970s and 1990s. The most prominent modifications ( by Council) are the Sir Dudley de Chair look-out area  above the "Chapel" and a steel hand-rail along the stairs from the lookout to the "Chapel" together with work undertaken by the Apex Club in the 1970s, being the construction of a 60-step stone stair  from the lookout to the "Chapel". Apex have also attempted to reconstruct part of the "Main Cave". Apex, however, used cement mortar, which deviated from Ricetti's utilisation of clay-mortar and dry-stone techniques.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==

The cultural landscape and historical archaeological complex known as the Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance as a rare example in New South Wales of a documented, extensive  and relatively intact complex of recluse dwellings that is an outstanding twentieth century archaeological site containing rare examples of rock art, historic graffiti, numerous stone structures, earthworks and remnant cultivation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Hermit's Cave Complex has multicultural heritage values that constitute material evidence of the response of one individual, the Italian migrant Valerio Ricetti, to the impact of migration in the period after World War 1. The site documents Ricetti's resourcefulness and skill and demonstrates a rare interpretation and integration of natural landscape and materials to create not just a shelter but, over time, an elaborate complex comprising hide-outs, a lookout and modified cave-like enclosures supplemented by retaining stone walls, linking bridges, stone stairways, paths and earthworks with terraced gardens, remnant plantings and water cisterns.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Hermit's Cave Complex illustrates a European tradition of hermitism that is rarely found in New South Wales.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The Hermit's Cave Complex  has outstanding educational, interpretative and research potential as a resource for the study of historical archaeology and ethnic history.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Hermit's Cave Complex was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 12 January 2007 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance for its capacity to demonstrate a historical pattern of migration experiences in material form. Ricetti's story of a  young, non English-speaking migrant with no family or friendship networks in Australia  is significant for the individuality of his response (in an Australian context) to the pressures and opportunities of migration.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's retreat from human interraction  was marked initially by a decade of aimless solitary trekking around inland southern New South Wales and adjacent parts of Victoria and South Australia that ended with his decision to set down roots, build a retreat and live off the land in seclusion when he sighted the rocky ridge top of Scenic Hill on the outskirts of Griffith.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Over a 23-year period Ricetti did more than merely construct a habitable shelter on the ridge top. He invested a vast amount of time and physical labour in considerably modifying the landscape to suit his purposes and to create an aesthetically pleasing environment. He backfilled a total area of 505 square metres to create terraces for cultivation on the steep slopes of the escarpment. The soil in the cultivated areas has been identified as fine and pebble-free in an otherwise stony environment which indicates a sieving process (Ricetti could access and adapt materials located on the town dump nearby). The terraces were planted with a variety of edible and ornamental plants which demonstrates aesthetic as well as practical values. Ricetti collected, shifted, cut and placed thousands of cubic metres of stone to create the series of retaining walls around the ten identified terrraces and the extensive stairways that link the elements of the site.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The plantings have been identified as including grape vines, fig, olive and stone-fruit trees. These take several years to fruit which would indicate Ricetti viewed this cultivation as long term investment. Other plantings such as tomato, passion-fruit vines, sweet peas and lettuce would have required intensive care and nurturing in Griffith's semi-arid climate, evidenced by Ricetti's construction of water cisterns.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

This level of activity and attention demonstrates that Ricetti valued his dwelling with a high degree of both physical and emotional investment as a permanent home and a long-term project.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766-3812&gt;Caillard 2005: Vol 1: 139-141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Oral history indicates he was driven by "visions" to work on his project. Ricetti's response can perhaps be understood in the context of European traditions of hermitism, especially in the Alpine regions of northern Italy where his choice of landscape echoes that of many European hermit dwellings.  North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's use of :
:(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling;
:(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees; and
:(c) the chapel cave with its painted Christian iconography.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Ricetti's is an important story in the narratives of "difference" or  "the other", not only for his response to society but also for society's response to him. At the local level the community understands his "difference" and values his work on Scenic Hill: his hospitalisation engenders community support during his absence and, in World War II, the local police consider him no threat and his work to be valuable. At the impersonal level of state jurisdiction, however, his "difference" is viewed unfavourably. He is  demonised for his nationality and nonconformity and interned as an enemy alien, suspicions compounded by his 14 years of social alienation. These distinctions may reflect wider patterns in wartime internment processes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex is of local significance for its association with the extensively documented life of Valerio Ricetti, the subject of local folklore as the "hermit" of Scenic Hill.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex is significant at state level  as an example of multicultural heritage and as an aesthetically distinctive cultural landscape. It demonstrates through its landmark qualities an individual's adaptation of  the landscape and natural materials to provide shelter, food and an aesthetically pleasing environment as a response to social dislocation and isolation.  As such it is in the tradition of European ascetic/hermit retreat dwellings created to provide for seclusion from society.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The landmark qualities of the Hermit's Cave Complex align with European traditions of hermitism that are not essentially religious in origin. Ricetti's choice of landscape conforms to many European hermit dwellings. Caves are frequently chosen, particularly those located on steep hillsides or on mountains. In this respect Ricetti would have drawn on his Italian upbringing  in a mountain valley of north Italy in making his choice of dwelling the 200 metre high escarpment of the southern edge of the McPherson Range—a prominent ridge top location in the predominantly flat Riverina Plain.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

Spiritual iconography is common even among hermits living outside a recognised religious tradition. Ricetti's work reflects Italian hermit traditions of painting and inscribing important images and texts on cave walls.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

North Italian cultural influences can be seen in Ricetti's creative and technical achievements, specifically in his:
:(a) skilled stonemasonry with dry stone walling combined with backfilling  to create terraces for cultivation on steep and rocky slopes. The use of stone for farmhouse building and the skill of dry stone (with no mortar) constructions are prominent in this region and are reflected in the stonework of the Hermit's Cave Complex,  as is the use of terracing for cultivation.
:(b) planting of grape vines and fruit trees
:(c) decoration of the chapel cave with its painted Christian iconography.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

The site is a popular place for meditative walks, in a setting reminiscent of ancient European archaeological monuments. The stonework and gardens recall  the stone structures and intensively modified rural landscapes of northern Italy.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex has social significance at the local level for the Griffith community,  and in particular the Italian community of Griffith and the surrounding [[Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area]], as an important element of local folklore.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex is of state significance as an outstanding example of a twentieth century historical archaeological site that is suitable for further research.
It has outstanding educational, interpretative and research potential as a resource for the study of historical archaeology, multicultural heritage and migration history:
* as an example of "ethnic nostalgia", reproducing aspects of structures and modified landscapes of rural  Italy in an alien setting (specifically the stonework and gardens)
* as a complex historical archaeological site
* as a migration story of an individual's response to the impact of settlement, internment and poverty.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Outstanding level of rarity. The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance as a rare, documented example of a known hermit dwelling and a document of recluse living, especially in terms of the extent and complex nature of the site.
Some of the known examples of hermit and/or cave dwellings evidence some construction techniques similar to Ricetti's, such as dry stone walling, some terracing and water provision. But these examples are either on a considerably smaller scale, are evidence of community activity or are constructions by squatters who were not hermits.
The known examples of cave dwellings appear to be linked to squatting, mainly in the 1930s depression. None of these examples show similar evidence of the extent and complexity of Ricetti's construction works at the Hermit's Cave Complex.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''

The Hermit's Cave Complex has state significance for being representative in its physical forms of some aspects of the small number of known examples of recluse living in New South Wales, most of which are in the Sydney region.
Enquiries have revealed a number of previously occupied caves in New South Wales that reflect either depression era occupation, squatting by individuals who are not necessarily hermits, or more elaborate constructions by communities of fringe dwellers.
Many cave shelters throughout the national parks that flank Sydney --- the Royal to the south, the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]] to the west  and Kuring-gai Chase to the north --- were depression-era dwellings of the 1930s, such as the former fishermen's caves at Cape Solander ([[Botany Bay]]), the caves in the Domain in the city, and Poet's Cave in [[Lane Cove National Park]], Sydney, that was inhabited by a  hermit who was also believed to be responsible for a biblical inscription on a rock in the park.
In north-western New South Wales caves were occupied at Lightening Ridge and in the Warrumbungle Ranges, the latter reputedly used by cattle duffers (dates unknown).
Other "hermit-type" dwellings like the Crater Cove huts on [[Sydney Harbour]] and huts along the [[Hawkesbury River]] grew in popularity in the 1930s depression but originated earlier and continued their existence later as communities of fringe dwellers. The Crater Cove huts were first constructed by squatters during the 1920s in the [[Middle Harbour]] bushland and remained inhabited until 1988. They were built on the low cliffs and wide rock platforms facing the harbour with water tanks carved into the rock, stone built chimneys, paths and edging. A group of Hawkesbury River huts (with boat access only) were occupied by one family group and included wells, terracing of the ridges, gardens, extensive dry stone walling and linking pathways.
A large and impressive two-storey, Swiss chalet style dwelling was constructed by a squatter over a 40-year period from the 1920s at Hungry Beach in Kuring-gai Chase National Park. The building had 2 metre high circular stone walls, its own water supply, polished concrete floors and all fixed furniture (sofas, kitchen benches, cupbords, wardrobes etc)  was built of polished ferrocement. During World War II it was occupied by the United States military. The builder was not a hermit and he sourced (and paid for) building materials that he brought in by barge from Sydney. The building was reputedly demolished in 1969 while the occupant (then in his eighties) was hospitalised.
The Hermit's Cave Complex is representative of some of these construction techniques as a class or type of item and is the finest known example of its type.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1766/&gt;

'''Hoi polloi''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:en:ὁ#Greek|οἱ]] [[wikt:en:πολύς#Greek|πολλοί]]}}, ''hoi polloi'', "the many") is an expression from Greek that means ''the [[Majority (sociology)|many]]'' or, in the strictest sense, ''the people''. In English, it has been given a negative connotation to signify deprecation of the [[working class]], [[commoner]]s, the [[Commoner|masses]] or common people in a derogatory or (more often today) [[ironic]] sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of 'hoi polloi' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hoi%20polloi |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=17 August 2018 |quote=In its original and primary sense, hoi polloi is a term used by snobs or—more often—in mocking imitation of snobs.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms for hoi polloi, which also express the same or similar distaste for the common people felt by those who believe themselves to be superior, include "[[Edward_Bulwer-Lytton#Quotations|the great unwashed]]", "the [[Plebs|plebeians]]" or "plebs", "the rabble", "the masses","the dregs of society", "[[wikt:riffraff|riffraff]]", "the herd", "the canaille", [[proletariat|"the proles" (proletariat)]], "[[sheeple]]", and "[[peon]]s".&lt;ref name="Thesaurus"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://thesaurus.reference.com/browse/Hoi%20polloi|title=Roget's New Millennium Thesaurus|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC.|accessdate=2006-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase probably became known to English scholars through [[Pericles' Funeral Oration]], as mentioned in [[Thucydides]]' ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. [[Pericles]] uses it in a positive way when praising the [[Athenian democracy]], contrasting it with ''[[hoi oligoi]]'', "the few" ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|οἱ ὀλίγοι}}, see also ''[[oligarchy]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''History of the Peloponnesian War'', Book&amp;nbsp;2.34-46: "{{lang|grc|καὶ ὄνομα μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ὀλίγους ἀλλ᾿ ἐς πλείονας οἰκεῖν δημοκρατία κέκληται}} " (''"It is true that we are called a democracy, for the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few"'').&lt;/ref&gt;

Its current [[Linguistic prescription|English usage]] originated in the early 19th&amp;nbsp;century, a time when it was generally accepted that one must be familiar with Greek and [[Latin language|Latin]] in order to be considered well educated.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite book|title=Review of The Scientist's Thesaurus: A Treasury of the Stock Words of Science by George F.

==Pronunciation==
Pronunciation depends on the speaker:
* English speakers pronounce it {{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɔɪ|_|p|ɒ||l|ɔɪ}}.
* [[Ancient Greek]] speakers pronounced it {{IPA-el|hoi polloi˨˦|}}. Double-λ is pronounced as [[gemination|geminated]].
* [[Modern Greek]] speakers pronounce it {{IPA|[i poˈli]}} since in Modern Greek there is no voiceless glottal /h/ phoneme and ''οι'' is pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} (all Ancient Greek [[diphthongs]] are now pronounced as [[monophthongs]]). [[Greek Cypriots]] still pronounce the double-λ ({{IPA|[i polˈli]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athensnews.gr/paideia/1pai4.htm|title=The chicken and the egg: the pluralism of Greek spelling|work=[[Athens News]]|accessdate=2007-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210083026/http://www.athensnews.gr/paideia/1pai4.htm|archivedate=2006-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Some [[Linguistic prescription|linguistic prescriptivists]] argue that, given that ''hoi'' is a [[definite article]], the phrase "the hoi polloi" is redundant, akin to saying "the the masses". Others argue that this is inconsistent with other English loanwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of 'hoi polloi' |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hoi_polloi |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]] |accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "alcohol", for instance, derives from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''al-kuhl'', ''al'' being an [[Article (grammar)|article]], yet "the alcohol" is universally accepted as good grammar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/183475.html&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous uses of the term in [[English literature]]. [[James Fenimore Cooper]], author of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]'', is often credited with making the first recorded usage of the term in English.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hoi%20polloi American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tln01"&gt;[http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showpost.php?p=100982&amp;postcount=84 The Literature Network].&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded use by Cooper occurs in his 1837 work ''[[Gleanings in Europe]]'' where he writes "After which the oi polloi are enrolled as they can find interest."&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, James Fenimore ''Gleanings in Europe: England'' 1837.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lord Byron]] had, in fact, previously used the term in his letters and journal. In one journal entry, dated 24 November 1813, Byron writes "I have not answered [[Walter Scott|W. Scott]]'s last letter,—but I will. I regret to hear from others, that he has lately been unfortunate in pecuniary involvements. He is undoubtedly the Monarch of [[Parnassus]], and the most English of bards. I should place [[Samuel Rogers|Rogers]] next in the living list (I value him more as the last of the best school) —[[Thomas Moore|Moore]] and [[Thomas Campbell (poet)|Campbell]] both third—[[Robert Southey|Southey]] and [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]—the rest, οι πολλοί [hoi polloi in Greek]—thus:— (''see image reproduced on this page'').&lt;ref name="Journal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoi polloi: Word of the Day|url=http://kmecholsky.multiply.com/journal|date=November 25, 2006|accessdate=2007-01-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025152808/http://kmecholsky.multiply.com/journal|archivedate=October 25, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/8bpt110.txt|author=Byron, George Gordon, sixth Baron Byron|title=Byron's 1813 diary|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=2006-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron also wrote an 1821 entry in his journal "...&amp;nbsp;one or two others, with myself, put on masks, and went on the stage with the 'oi polloi."&lt;ref&gt;Lord Byron ''Detached Thoughts'', 1821.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Charles Darwin]] was at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1828 to 1831, undergraduates used the term "hoi polloi" or "Poll" for those reading for an ''[[British undergraduate degree classification|ordinary]]'' degree, the "pass degree".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter 1189 — Darwin, C. R. to Henslow, J. S., 2 July (1848)|url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-1189#mark-1189.f4|publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project|year=2012|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time only capable mathematicians would take the [[Tripos]] or honours degree. In his autobiography written in the 1870s, Darwin recalled that "By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the οἱ πολλοί, or crowd of men who do not go in for honours."&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Nora ed. 1958. ''The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809–1882. With the original omissions restored. Edited and with appendix and notes by his grand-daughter Nora Barlow''. London: Collins. p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=61&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;viewtype=text 59].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. S. Gilbert]] used the term in 1882 when he wrote the libretto of the [[comic opera]] [[Iolanthe]]. In Act I, the following exchange occurs between a group of disgruntled [[fairy|fairies]] who are arranging to elevate a lowly shepherd to the [[peerage]], and members of the [[House of Lords]] who will not hear of such a thing:

{{quote|
PEERS: Our lordly style&lt;br&gt;
You shall not quench&lt;br&gt;
With base canaille!

FAIRIES: (That word is French.)

PEERS: Distinction ebbs&lt;br&gt;
Before a herd&lt;br&gt;
Of vulgar plebs!

FAIRIES: (A Latin word.)

PEERS: 'Twould fill with joy,&lt;br&gt;
And madness stark&lt;br&gt;
The hoi polloi!

FAIRIES: (A Greek remark.)}}

Gilbert's parallel use of ''canaille'', ''plebs'' (''plebeians''), and ''hoi polloi'' makes it clear that the term is derogatory of the [[Social class|lower classes]]. In many versions of the vocal score, it is written as "οἱ πολλοί", likely confusing generations of amateur choristers who had not had the advantages of a British [[Public school (UK)|Public School]] education.

[[John Dryden]] used the phrase in his [[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]], published in 1668. Dryden spells the phrase with Greek letters, but the rest of the sentence is in English (and he does precede it with "the").

==Appearances in the twentieth century==
The term has appeared in several films and radio programs. For example, one of the earliest [[Short subject|short films]] from the [[Three Stooges]], ''[[Hoi Polloi (1935 film)|Hoi Polloi]]'' (1935), opens in an exclusive restaurant where two wealthy gentlemen are arguing whether heredity or environment is more important in shaping character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=228988|title=- Trailer - Showtimes - Cast - Movies - New York Times|website=movies2.nytimes.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make a bet and pick on nearby [[waste collector|trashmen]] (the Stooges) to prove their theory. At the conclusion of three months in training, the Stooges attend a dinner party, where they thoroughly embarrass the professors.

The [[University of Dayton]]'s Don Morlan says, "The theme in these shorts of the Stooges against the rich is bringing the rich down to their level and shaking their heads." A typical Stooges joke from the film is when someone addresses them as "gentlemen", and they look over their shoulders to see who is being addressed.&lt;ref&gt;von Busack, Richard, [http://www.ratical.org/ratville/3stooges75yrs.html Pure Slap Shtik] ''[[Metro Santa Cruz]]'' - January 16–22, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Three Stooges]] turn the tables on their hosts by calling them "hoi polloi" at the end.

At the English public school (i.e., private school) [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]], in the 1950s and '60s, grammar schoolboys from nearby Hertford were referred to as "oips", from "hoi polloi", to distinguish them from comprehensive and secondary modern schoolboys, the lowest of the low, who were called "oiks".

[[Carole King]]'s TV special ''[[Really Rosie]]'' (based on [[Maurice Sendak]]'s works) contains a song called "My Simple Humble Neighborhood", in which Rosie remembers those whom she's met over the years.  In the process, she mentions the hoi polloi as well as the grand [[elite]].

The term continues to be used in contemporary writing. In his 1983&amp;nbsp;introduction to [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'', [[Israel Regardie]] writes, "Once I was even so presumptuous as to warn (Wilson) in a letter that his humor was much too good to waste on hoi polloi who generally speaking would not understand it and might even resent it."&lt;ref&gt;Regardie, Israel [http://www.solharvest.com/cclosers/RAWilson-Prometheus.pdf Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225165556/http://www.solharvest.com/cclosers/RAWilson-Prometheus.pdf |date=2006-02-25 }} ''[[Prometheus]]'' 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "hoi polloi" was used in a dramatic scene in the film ''[[Dead Poets Society]]'' (1989). In this scene, Professor Keating speaks negatively about the use of the article "the" in front of the phrase:

{{quote|Keating: This is battle, boys. War! Your souls are at a critical juncture. Either you will succumb to the hoi polloi and the fruit will die on the vine—or you will triumph as individuals. It may be a coincidence that part of my duties are to teach you about [[Romanticism]], but let me assure you that I take the task quite seriously. You will learn what this school wants you to learn in my class, but if I do my job properly, you will also learn a great deal more. You will learn to savor language and words because they are the stepping stones to everything you might endeavor to do in life and do well. A moment ago I used the term 'hoi polloi.' Who knows what it means? Come on, Overstreet, you twirp. (laughter) Anderson, are you a man or a boil?

Anderson shakes his head "no", but Meeks raises his hands and speaks: "The hoi polloi. Doesn't it mean the herd?"

Keating: Precisely, Meeks. Greek for the herd. However, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying "the the herd." Indicating that you too are "hoi polloi".&lt;ref&gt;Schulman, Tom [http://www.ellopos.net/education/writersword_schulman_deadpoetsociety.htm Excerpts from the script] of Dead Poets Society.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Keating's tone makes clear that he considers this statement to be an insult. He used the phrase "the hoi polloi", to demonstrate the mistake he warned against.

The term was also used in the comedy film ''[[Caddyshack]]'' (1980). In a rare moment of cleverness, Spaulding Smails greets Danny Noonan as he arrives for the christening of The Flying Wasp, the boat belonging to Judge Elihu Smails (Spaulding's grandfather), with "Ahoy, polloi! Where did you come from, a scotch ad?" This is particularly ironic, because Danny has just finished mowing the Judge's lawn, and arrives overdressed, wearing a sailboat captain's outfit (as the girl seated next to him points out, Danny "looks like [[Dick Cavett]]").&lt;ref name="Journal"/&gt;

[[Todd Rundgren]]'s band [[Utopia]] recorded a song titled "Hoi Polloi" on their album ''[[Deface the Music]]'' (1980), in which all of the songs are written and performed in the style of [[the Beatles]].

[[The Lovin' Spoonful]]'s song "Jug Band Music" includes the line: "He tried to mooch a towel from the hoi polloi."

In the song "[[Risingson]]" on [[Massive Attack]]'s ''[[Mezzanine (album)|Mezzanine]]'' album, the singer apparently appeals to his company to leave the [[Nightclub|club]] they're in, deriding the common persons' infatuation with them, and implying that he's about to slide into [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial behaviour]]:

{{quote|

In an episode of ''[[This American Life]]'', radio host [[Ira Glass]] uses the term hoi polloi while relaying a story about a woman who believes the letter 'q' should occur later in the alphabet. He goes on to say that "Q does not belong in the middle of the alphabet where it is, with the hoi polloi of the alphabet, with your 'm' 'n' and 'p'. Letters that will just join any word for the asking."

The term was used in a [[List of Keeping Up Appearances episodes#Series 1 (1990)|first-series episode]] (The New Vicar, aired 5 November 1990) of the British sitcom ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]''. The main character, [[Hyacinth Bucket]], gets into a telephone argument with a bakery employee. When the employee abruptly hangs up in frustration, Hyacinth disparagingly refers to him as "hoi polloi". This is in keeping with her character; she looks down upon those she considers to be of lesser social standing, including working-class people.&lt;ref&gt;Keeping Up Appearances 02 - Welcoming The Dishy Vicar [http://www.divxmoviesenglishsubtitles.com/K/Keeping_Up_Appearances_02_-_Welcoming_The_Dishy_Vicar.html Divxmoviesenglishsubtitles.com] Accessed on 11 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first scene of The PlayStation ad "[[Double Life (PlayStation ad)|Double Life]]," a [[Great Britain|British]] man says, "In the day, I do my job, I ride the bus, Roll up my sleeves with the Hoi polloi".

The August 14, 2001 episode of [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' program included a discussion about whether the sport of [[polo]] was an appropriate part of the image of the [[British Royal Family]]. Joining King on the program were "best-selling biographer and veteran royal watcher [[Robert Lacey]]" and [[Kitty Kelley]], author of the book ''The Royals''. Their discussions focused on [[Prince Charles]] and his son [[Prince William]]:

{{quote|Lacey said, "There is another risk that I see in polo. Polo is a very [[nouveau riche]], I think, rather vulgar game. I can say that having played it myself, and I don't think it does Prince Charles's image, or, I dare say, this is probably arrogant of me, his spirit any good. I don't think it is a good thing for him to be involved in. I also, I'm afraid, don't think [polo] is a good thing for [Charles] to be encouraging his sons to get involved in. It is a very "playboy" set. We saw Harry recently all night clubbing, and why not, some might say, playing polo down in the south of Spain. I think the whole polo syndrome is something that [[The Royal Family|the royal family]] would do very well to get uninvolved with as soon as possible.

King turned the question to Kelley, saying, "Kitty, it is kind of hoi polloi, although it is an incredible sport in which, I have been told, that the horse is 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the game, the rider 20&amp;nbsp;percent. But it is a great sport to watch. But it is hoi polloi isn't it?"

To which Kelley replied, "Yes, I do agree with Robert. The time is come and gone for the royals to be involved with polo. I mean it is – it just increases that dissipated aristo-image that they have, and it is too bad to encourage someone like Prince William to get involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0108/14/lkl.00.html|title=CNN.com - Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term also appears in the 2003 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'', where it is used by the characters [[Elphaba]] and [[Glinda]] to refer to the many inhabitants of the [[Emerald City]]: "...

[[Jack Cafferty]], a [[CNN]] [[anchorman]], was caught misusing the term. On 9&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;2004 he retracted his statement, saying "And hoi-polloi refers to common people, not those rich morons that are evicting those two red-tail hawks (ph) from that fifth Avenue [[Cooperative|co-op]]. I misused the word hoi-polloi.

[[New media]] and new inventions have also been described as being by or for the hoi polloi.

'''Information and media literacy''' ('''IML''') enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media, as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"/&gt;

Prior to the 1990s, the primary focus of [[information literacy]] was research skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422143339/http://wik.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/Information_Literacy |archivedate=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Media literacy]], a study that emerged around the 1970s, traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |title=About CML &amp;#124; Center for Media Literacy |publisher=Medialit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825191946/http://www.medialit.org/about_cml.html |archivedate=2010-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like the UK,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730105014/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions.aspx |date=July 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530015206/http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf |archivedate=2009-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "information and media literacy" is used by [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15886&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Media and Information Literacy |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy. It is also referred to as information and communication technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711210412/http://www.infolit.org/definitions.html |date=July 11, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Research/pdf/ICTREPORT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Educators such as [[Gregory Ulmer]] have also defined the field as [[electracy]].

IML is a combination of information literacy and media literacy. The purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society; one needs to be able to understand, inquire, create, communicate and think critically. It is important to effectively access, organize, analyze, evaluate, and create messages in a variety of forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204091732/http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/Information_literacy_definitions/Definitions.aspx |date=February 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transformative nature of IML includes creative works and creating new knowledge; to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical, cultural and social understanding.

==21st-century students==
The IML learning capacities prepare students to be 21st century literate.  According to Jeff Wilhelm (2000), "technology has everything to do with literacy. And being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm Literacy by Design:  Why is all This Technology so Important?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034957/http://www.teachnet-lab.org/fklane/wilhelm.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He supports his argument with J. David Bolter's statement that "if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies, then they are illiterate. They are not just unprepared for the future; they are illiterate right now, in our current time and context".&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilhelm's statement is supported by the 2005 Wired World Phase II (YCWW II) survey conducted by the Media Awareness Network of Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-awareness.ca |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 5000 Grade 4 – 11 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |title=MediaSmarts |publisher=Media-awareness.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425195852/http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/research/YCWW/phaseII/key_findings.cfm |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key findings of the survey were:
*62% of Grade 4 students prefer the [[Internet]].
*38% of Grade 4 students prefer the library.
*91% of Grade 11 students prefer the Internet.
*9% of Grade 11 students prefer the library.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005a, para. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Marc Prensky (2001) uses the term "[[digital native]]" to describe people who have been brought up in a digital world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marcprensky.com/writing/Prensky%20-%20Digital%20Natives,%20Digital%20Immigrants%20-%20Part1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has been a pervasive element of young people's home lives. 94% of kids reported that they had Internet access at home, and a significant majority (61%) had a high-speed connection.

By the time kids reach Grade 11, half of them (51 percent) have their own Internet-connected computer, separate and apart from the family computer.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; The survey also showed that young Canadians are now among the most wired in the world. Contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd, today's wired kid is a social kid.&lt;ref&gt;YCWW II, 2005b, p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents, who may not understand the abilities of technology. Students are no longer limited to desktop computera. They may use mobile technologies to graph mathematical problems, research a question for social studies, text message an expert for information, or send homework to a drop box.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.wmich.edu/~b4poppen/IPhoneArticle3.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are accessing information by using [[MSN]], personal Web pages, [[Weblog]]s and [[social network service|social networking sites]].

== Teaching and learning in the 21st century ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Many teachers continue the tradition of teaching of the past 50 years. Traditionally teachers have been the experts sharing their knowledge with children. Technology, and the learning tools it provides access to, forces us to change to being facilitators of learning.  We have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information, and students as consumers of information, in order to meet the needs of digital students. Teachers not only need to learn to speak digital, but also to embrace the language of digital natives.

Language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information.  Digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices. People born prior to 1988 are sometimes referred to as "digital immigrants."  They experience difficulty programming simple devices like a VCR.  Digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work.

Learning a language is best done early in a child's development.

In acquiring a second language, Hyltenstam (1992) found that around the age of 6 and 7 seemed to be a cut-off point for bilinguals to achieve native-like proficiency.  After that age, second language learners could get near-native-like-ness but their language would, while consisting of very few actual errors, have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group.

Kindergarten and grades 1 and 2 are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have a "digital"-rich childhood.  Students learning technological skills before Grade 3 can become equivalently bilingual. "Language-minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in English cannot participate fully in American schools, workplaces, or society. They face limited job opportunities and earning power." Speaking "digital" is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in North American society and opportunities.

==Students' struggle==
Many students are considered illiterate in media and information for various reasons. They may not see the value of media and information literacy in the 21st-century classroom.  Others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information.  Educators need to introduce IML to these students to help them become media and information literate.  Very little changes will be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms.

Performance standards, the foundation to support them, and tools to implement them are readily available.  Success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established.  Shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary.

When the staff and community, working together, identify and clarify their values, beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do, an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt; Using the capacity tools to assess IML will allow students, staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology.

The IML Performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student-learning needs are being met.  After assessing student IML, three questions can be asked:

* What does each student need to learn?
* How does one know whether students have met the capacities?
* How does one respond when students have difficulty in learning?

Teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support.  Students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves.

==In the curriculum==
This integration of technology across the [[curriculum]] is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]].  In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology. [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iste.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=About_ISTE&lt;/ref&gt; has been developing a standard IML curriculum for the US and other countries by implementing the [[National Educational Technology Standards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net/ |title=NETS Implementation - home |publisher=Nets-implementation.iste.wikispaces.net |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK===
In the UK, IML has been promoted among educators through an information literacy website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.informationliteracy.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field.

===US===
IML is included in the Partnership for the 21st Century program sponsored by the US Department of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314140756/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=254&amp;Itemid=120 |archivedate=2009-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special mandates have been provided to Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522125507/http://www.21stcenturyskills.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=505&amp;Itemid=189 |archivedate=2009-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual school districts, such as the Clarkstown Central School District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060913115949/http://www.ccsd.edu/bardonia/CCSDLibraryCurriculum/hrdcpy/Final%20Draft1.pdf |archivedate=2006-09-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; have also developed their own information literacy curriculum. ISTE has also produced the National Educational Technology Standards for Students, Teachers and Administrators.

===Canada===
In [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], the Ministry of Education has de-listed the Information Technology K to 7 IRP &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/irp/resdocs/itk7.pdf Information Technology K to 7 IRP (1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; as a stand-alone course.  It is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes continue to be integrated.

This integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as [[technical communication tools]]. In addition, recent learning [[pedagogy]] recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology.  Unfortunately, there has been no clear direction to implement IML.

The BC Ministry of Education published the Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/perf_stands/icti/ Information and Communications Technology Integration Performance Standards, Grades 5 to 10 ICTI (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;  These standards provide performance standards expectations for Grade 5 to 10; however, they do not provide guidance for other grades, and the expectation for a Grade 5 and Grade 10 student are the same.

===Arab World===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
In the Arab region, media and information literacy was largely ignored up until 2011, when the Media Studies Program at the American University of Beirut, the Open Society Foundations and the Arab-US Association for Communication Educators (AUSACE) launched a regional conference themed "New Directions: Digital and Media Literacy". The conference attracted significant attention from Arab universities and scholars, who discussed obstacles and needs to advance media literacy in the Arab region, including developing curricula in Arabic, training faculty and promoting the field. 

Following up on that recommendation, the Media Studies Program at AUB and the Open Society Foundations in collaboration with the Salzburg Academy on Media and Global Change launched in 2013 the first regional initiative to develop, vitalize, and advance media literacy education in the Arab region. The Media and Digital Literacy Academy of Beirut (MDLAB) offered an annual two-week summer training program in addition to working year-round to develop media literacy curricula and programs. The academy is conducted in Arabic and English and brings pioneering international instructors and professionals to teach advanced digital and media literacy concepts to young Arab academics and graduate students from various fields. MDLAB hopes that the participating Arab academics will carry what they learned to their countries and institutions and offers free curricular material in Arabic and English, including media literacy syllabi, lectures, exercises, lesson plans, and multi-media material, to assist and encourage the integration of digital and media literacy into Arab university and school curricula. 

In recognition of MDLAB's accomplishments in advancing media literacy education in the Arab region, the founder of MDLAB received the 2015 UNESCO-UNAOC International Media and Information Literacy Award. 

Prior to 2013, only two Arab universities offered media literacy courses: the American University of Beirut (AUB) and the American University of Sharjah (AUS). Three years after the launch of MDLAB, over two dozen Arab universities incorporated media literacy education into their curricula, both as stand-alone courses or as modules injected into their existing media courses. Among the universities who have full-fledged media literacy courses (as of 2015) are Lebanese American University (Lebanon), Birzeit University (Palestine), University of Balamand (Lebanon), Damascus University (Syria), Rafik Hariri University (Lebanon), Notre Dame University (Lebanon), Ahram Canadian University (Egypt), American University of Beirut (Lebanon), American University of Sharjah (UAE), and Al Azm University (Lebanon). The first Arab school to adopt media literacy as part of its strategic plan is the International College (IC) in Lebanon. Efforts to introduce media literacy to the region's other universities and schools continues with the help of other international organizations, such as UNESCO, UNAOC, AREACORE, DAAD, and OSF.

===Asia===
In Singapore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.sg/edumall/mpite/overview/index.html |accessdate=July 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108150824/http://www.moe.gov.sg/edumall/mpite/overview/index.html |archivedate=January 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hong Kong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2004/en/07_07.htm |title=HONG KONG 2004 - Education |publisher=Yearbook.gov.hk |date=2005-09-16 |accessdate=2013-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; information literacy or information technology was listed as a formal curriculum.

==Barriers==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
One barrier to learning to read is the lack of books, while a barrier to learning IML is the lack of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within school infrastructure, staff development, and support systems.  While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle is school climate.

Marc Prensky&lt;ref&gt;Marc Prensky 2006, para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions: "Let's admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that, given the opportunity to use them, students would vote with their attention, just as adults would 'vote with their feet' by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling."{{clarification needed|date=June 2018}}

The mindset of banning new technology, and fearing the bad things that can happen, can affect educational decisions. The decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives.

Any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe.  Safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science.  Yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology.

Not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs.  One school district in Ontario banned digital devices from their schools.  Local schools have been looking at doing the same. These kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching, learning or creating solutions.  Many barriers to IML exist.

The most extreme form of such violence may be termed ''battering'', ''intimate terrorism'', ''coercive controlling violence'', or simply ''[[coercive control]]'', in which one person is violent and controlling; this is generally perpetrated by men against women, and is the most likely of the types to require medical services and the use of a [[women's shelter]].&lt;ref name="Regan"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela Regan|title=Close Relationships|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=1136851607|year=2011|pages=456–460|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZCsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emery"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert E.

The most common but less injurious form of intimate partner violence is ''situational couple violence'' (also known as ''situational violence''), which is conducted by individuals of both genders nearly equally,&lt;ref name="Emery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Anglin &amp; Homeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt; and is more likely to occur among younger couples, including adolescents (see [[teen dating violence]]) and those of college age.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowen"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Erica Bowen, Kate Walker|title=The Psychology of Violence in Adolescent Romantic Relationships|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=1137321407|year=2015|pages=107–108|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6TsTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT107}}&lt;/ref&gt; A last form of violence, in which both partners in the relationship engage in controlling and violent behavior, is called ''mutual violent control''.

==Background==
[[File:Maltraitance fait aux femmes.jpg|thumb|Physical violence against a woman in [[Benin]].]]
Intimate partner violence occurs between two people in an intimate relationship. It may occur between heterosexual or homosexual couples and victims can be male or female. Couples may be dating, cohabiting or married and violence can occur in or outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370"/&gt;

Studies in the 1990s showed that both men and women could be abusers or victims of domestic violence.{{refn|Gelles 1980, 1989; McNeely and Mann 1990; Shupe, Stacey, and Hazelwood 1987; Straus 1973; Straus, Gelles, and Steinmetz 1980; Steinmetz 1977/1978.|group=nb}} Women are more likely to act violently in retaliation or self-defense and tend to engage in less severe forms of violence than men whereas men are more likely to commit long-term cycles of abuse than women. 

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines intimate partner violence as "any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological or sexual harm to those in the relationship".&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krug | first1 = Etienne G. | last2 = Dahlberg | first2 = Linda L. | last3 = Mercy | first3 = James A. | last4 = Zwi | first4 = Anthony B. | last5 = Lozano | first5 = Rafael | title = World report on violence and health | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2002 | url = http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf | isbn = 9789240681804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHO also adds controlling behaviors as a form of abuse.&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"&gt;{{cite book | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Understanding and addressing intimate partner violence | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77432/1/WHO_RHR_12.36_eng.pdf | id = WHO/RHR/12.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study conducted in 2010, 30% of women globally aged 15 and older have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devries|first=K.M.|date=2013|title=The Global Prevalence of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women.|url=|journal=Science|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO reported in 2013 that the incidence of women who had experienced physical or sexual abuse from an intimate partner in their lifetime was:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Moreno | first = Claudia | contribution = Section 2: Results - lifetime prevalence estimates | editor-last = Moreno | editor-first = Claudia | title = Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence | pages = 16, 18 | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva, Switzerland | year = 2013 | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/85239/1/9789241564625_eng.pdf | isbn = 9789241564625 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Screening tools===
The [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) as of 2018 recommends screening women of reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft Recommendation Statement: Intimate Partner Violence, Elder Abuse, and Abuse of Vulnerable Adults: Screening  - US Preventive Services Task Force|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/draft-recommendation-statement/intimate-partner-violence-and-abuse-of-elderly-and-vulnerable-adults-screening1|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most studied IPV screening tools were the Hurt, Insult, Threaten, and Scream (HITS),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sherin|first=K. M.|last2=Sinacore|first2=J. M.|last3=Li|first3=X.

The HITS is a four-item scale rated on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (never) to 5 (frequently). This tool was Initially developed and tested among family physicians and family practice offices, and since then has been evaluated in diverse outpatient settings. Internal reliability and concurrent validity are acceptable. Generally, sensitivity of this measure has found to be lower among men than among women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WAST is an eight-item measure (there is a short form of the WAST that consists of the first two items only). It was originally developed for family physicians, but subsequently has been tested in the emergency department. It has been found to have good internal reliability and acceptable concurrent validity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The PVS is a three-item measure scored on a yes/no scale, with positive responses to any question denoting abuse. It was developed as a brief instrument for the emergency department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The AAS is a five-item measure scored on a yes/no scale, with positive responses to any question denoting abuse. It was created to detect abuse perpetrated against pregnant women. The screening tool has been tested predominantly with young, poor women. It has acceptable test retest reliability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rabin|first=Rebecca F.|last2=Jennings|first2=Jacky M.|last3=Campbell|first3=Jacquelyn C.|last4=Bair-Merritt|first4=Megan H.|date=2009-05-01|title=Intimate Partner Violence Screening Tools: A Systematic Review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379709000907|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=36|issue=5|pages=439–445.e4|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2009.01.024|pmc=2688958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probably most widely used instrument in research on family violence is the [[Conflict Tactics Scale]] (CTS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Straus |first=Murray A. |date=1979 |title=Measuring Intrafamily Conflict and Violence: The Conflict Tactics (CT) Scales |jstor=351733 |journal=Journal of Marriage and Family |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=75–88 |doi=10.2307/351733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two versions have been developed from the original CTS: the CTS2 (an expanded and modified version of the original CTS)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Straus |first=Murray A. |last2=Hamby |first2=Sherry L. |last3=Boney-McCoy |first3=Sue |last4=Sugarman |first4=David B. |date=2016-06-30|title=The Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2) |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Sugarman/publication/233896237_The_Revised_Conflict_Tactics_Scale/links/02e7e52d40675130e5000000.pdf |journal=Journal of Family Issues |language=en |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=283–316 |doi=10.1177/019251396017003001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the CTSPC (CTS Parent-Child).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author1=Straus, Murray A. |author2=Hamby, Sherry L. |date=March 1997 |title=Measuring Physical &amp; Psychological Maltreatment of Children with the Conflict Tactics Scales |id=Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Educational Research Association, Chicago, Ill. |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED410301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elaine Storkey]] in her comprehensive analysis, Scars Across Humanity IVP Academic 2018, argues that intimate partner violence is one aspect of a global manifestation of violence against women. Other examples she cites are selective abortion, female genital mutilation, early, enforced marriage, honour killings, rape, trafficking, prostitution and sexual violence in war.

===Intimate terrorism===

Intimate terrorism, or coercive controlling violence (CCV), occurs when one partner in a relationship, typically a man, uses [[Abusive power and control|coercive control and power]] over the other partner,&lt;ref name="Anglin &amp; Homeier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Flood 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bogat 2016"/&gt; using threats, [[intimidation]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]].

===Violent resistance===
Violent resistance (VR), a form of [[self-defense]], is violence perpetrated by victims against their partners who have exerted intimate terrorism against them.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt;  Within relationships of intimate terrorism and violent resistance, 96% of the violent resisters are women.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt; VR can occur as an instinctive reaction in response to an initial attack or a defense mechanism after prolonged instances of violence.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Michael P.|date=July 2011|title=Gender and types of intimate partner violence: A response to an anti-feminist literature review|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.006|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|volume=16|issue=4|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.006|issn=1359-1789}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of resistance can sometimes become fatal if the victim feels as though their only way out is to kill their partner. &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

===Situational couple violence===
{{See also|Teen dating violence}}
Situational couple violence, also called common couple violence, is not connected to general control behavior, but arises in a single argument where one or both partners physically lash out at the other.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt; This is the most common form of intimate partner violence, particularly in the western world and among young couples, and involves members of both sexes nearly equally. Among college students, Johnson found it to be perpetrated about 44% of the time by women and 56% of the time by men.&lt;ref name="Howe p. 370" /&gt;

Johnson states that situational couple violence involves a relationship dynamic "in which conflict occasionally gets 'out of hand,' leading usually to 'minor' forms of violence, and rarely escalating into serious or life-threatening forms of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Johnson | first = Michael P. | author-link = Michael P. Johnson | title = Patriarchal terrorism and common couple violence: two forms of violence against women | journal = [[Journal of Marriage and Family]] | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–294 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] for the National Council on Family Relations | doi = 10.2307/353683 | jstor = 353683 | date = May 1995 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/353683 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.personal.psu.edu/mpj/1995%20JMF.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situational couple violence, acts of violence by men and women occur at fairly equal rates, with rare occurrences of injury, and are not committed in an attempt to control a partner.&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Olson | first = Loreen N. | title = Exploring "common couple violence" in heterosexual romantic relationships | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 66 | issue = 1 | pages = 104–128 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/10570310209374727 | date = March 2002 | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10570310209374727 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that approximately 50% of couples experience situational couple violence in their relationships.&lt;ref name="olson"/&gt;

Situational couple violence involves:

* Mode: Mildly aggressive behavior such as throwing objects, ranging to more aggressive behaviors such as pushing, slapping, biting, hitting, scratching, or hair pulling.
* Frequency: Less frequent than partner terrorism, occurring once in a while during an argument or disagreement.
* Severity: Milder than intimate terrorism, very rarely escalates to more severe abuse, generally does not include injuries that were serious or that caused one partner to be admitted to a hospital.
* Mutuality: Violence may be equally expressed by either partner in the relationship.
* Intent: Occurs out of anger or frustration rather than as a means of gaining control and power over the other partner.

===Mutual violent control===
Mutual violent control (MVC) is rare type of intimate partner violence occurring when both partners act in a violent manner, battling for control.&lt;ref name="Nicolson p. 40" /&gt;

=== Reciprocal and non-reciprocal ===
The CDC divides domestic violence into two types: reciprocal, in which both partners are violent, and non-reciprocal violence, in which one partner is violent.&lt;ref name="Straus_Dom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020"/&gt; Of the four types, situational couple violence and mutual violent control are reciprocal, while intimate terrorism is non-reciprocal. Violent resistance on its own is non-reciprocal, but is reciprocal when in response to intimate terrorism.

In the 1970s and 1980s, studies using large, nationally representative samples resulted in findings indicating that women were as violent as men in intimate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archer|first=John|title=Sex differences in aggression between heterosexual partners: A meta-analytic review.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651|journal=Psychological Bulletin|language=en|volume=126|issue=5|pages=651–680|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.5.651}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information diverged significantly from shelter, hospital, and police data, initiating a long-standing debate, termed "the gender symmetry debate".

Researchers such as [[Michael Kimmel|Michael S Kimmel]] have criticized CTS methodology in assessing relations between gender and domestic violence. Kimmel argued that the CTS excluded two important facets in gender violence: conflict-motivated aggression and control motivated aggression.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first facet is a form of family conflict (such as an argument) while the latter is using violence as a tool for control. Kimmel also argued that the CTS failed to assess for the severity of the injury, sexual assaults and abuse from ex-partners or spouses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Women generally suffer more severe and long-lasting forms of partner abuse than men, and men generally have more opportunities to leave an abusive partner than women do.{{refn|name=Wallace &amp; Robertson 2016}} Researchers have found different outcomes in men and women in response to such abuse. A 2012 review from the journal ''[[Psychology of Violence]]'' found that women suffered from over-proportionate numbers of injuries, fear, and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]] as a result of partner violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Jennifer E.|date=January 2012|title=Gender differences in intimate partner violence outcomes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026296|journal=[[Psychology of Violence]]|publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]]|volume=2|issue=1|pages=42–45|doi=10.1037/a0026296|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://people.cas.sc.edu/swansc/1.swan_web_articles/2012_CaldwellSwan_GenderDiffIPVOutcomes.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that 70% of female victims felt frightened as a result of violence perpetrated by their partners whereas 85% of male victims expressed "no fear" in response to such violence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lastly, IPV correlated with relationship satisfaction for women but it did not do so for men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to government statistics from the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]], male perpetrators constituted 96% of federal prosecution on domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvs02.pdf|title=Family violence statistics including statistics on strangers and acquaintances|last=Durose|first=Matthew R|date=2005|website=bjs.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another report by the [[United States Department of Justice|US department of Justice]] on non-fatal domestic violence from 2003–2012 found that 76% of domestic violence was committed against women and 24% was committed against men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/ndv0312.pdf|title=Nonfatal Domestic Violence, 2003–2012|last=Truman|first=Jennifer L|date=2014|website=bjs.gov|publisher=US Department of Justice|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the percentage of victims killed by their spouses or ex-spouses was 77.4% for women and 22.6% for men in selected countries across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/congress/background-information/Crime_Statistics/Global_Study_on_Homicide_2011.pdf|title=Global study on homicide|last=Gibbons|first=Jonathan|date=2011|website=unodc.org|publisher=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (Vienna)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Globally, men's perpetration of intimate partner violence against women often stems from conceptions of masculinity and patriarchy.

=== Gender symmetry ===
{{See also|Domestic violence against men#Gender symmetry}}The theory that women perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV) at roughly the same rate as men has been termed "gender symmetry." The earliest empirical evidence of gender symmetry was presented in the 1975 U.S. National Family Violence Survey carried out by [[Murray A. Straus]] and [[Richard James Gelles|Richard J. Gelles]] on a nationally representative sample of 2,146 "intact families." The survey found 11.6% of men and 12% of women had experienced some kind of IPV in the last twelve months, while 4.6% of men and 3.8% of women had experienced "severe" IPV.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{citation|title=Intimate violence: the causes and consequences of abuse in the American family|url=http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/Straus-Intimate%20Partner%20Violence-Book.pdf|year=1988|ref=harv|postscript=.|last1=Gelles|last2=Straus|first1=Richard J.|first2=Murray A.|page=104|contribution=How violent are American families?|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=9780671682965|editor-last1=Gelles|editor-first1=Richard J.|editor-last2=Straus|editor-first2=Murray A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thirty years"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Straus|first=Murray A.|date=June 2010|title=Thirty years of denying the evidence on gender symmetry in partner violence: implications for prevention and treatment|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/springer/vav/1991/00000006/00000002/art00003|journal=Partner Abuse|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|volume=1|issue=3|pages=332–362|doi=10.1891/1946-6560.1.3.332|postscript=.|ref=harv}} [http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/V71-Straus_Thirty-Years-Denying-Evidence-PV_10.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|333}}

A 2013 review examined studies from five [[continents]] and the correlation between a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence. The authors found that when partner abuse is defined broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, partner abuse is relatively even. They also stated if one examines who is physically harmed and how seriously, expresses more fear, and experiences subsequent psychological problems, domestic violence is significantly gendered toward women as victims.&lt;ref name="Eugenio"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Esquivel-Santovena |first1=Esteban Eugenio | last2=Lambert | first2=Teri | last3=Hamel | first3=John | title = Partner abuse worldwide | journal = Partner Abuse | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1891/1946-6560.4.1.e14 |url =http://domesticviolenceresearch.org/pdf/PASK.Tables14.Revised.pdf| date = January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual violence ==
{{Main article|Sexual violence by intimate partners}}
Sexual violence by intimate partners varies by country and can reach as high as 25% of the women having been subject to forced sex. In some countries forced sex, or marital rape, often occurs with other forms of domestic violence, particularly physical abuse.

==Treatment==

===Individual treatment===

Due to the high prevalence and devastating consequences of IPV, approaches to decrease and prevent violence from re-occurring is of upmost importance. Initial police response and arrest is not always enough to protect victims from recurrence of abuse; thus, many states have mandated participation in batterer intervention programs (BIPs) for men who have been charged with assault against an intimate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zarling|first=Amie|last2=Bannon|first2=Sarah|last3=Berta|first3=Meg|title=Evaluation of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Domestic Violence Offenders.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/vio0000097|journal=Psychology of Violence|language=en|doi=10.1037/vio0000097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these BIPs are based on the Duluth Model and incorporate some cognitive behavioral techniques.

The Duluth model is one of the most common current interventions for IPV. It represents a psycho-educational approach that was developed by paraprofessionals from information gathered from interviewing battered women in shelters and using principles from feminist and sociological frameworks.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pBjZSdZ1LsEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=).+Education+groups+for+men+who+batter:+The+Duluth+model&amp;ots=fQnu6Ou9XE&amp;sig=Y5ubS5ovAdoGA4jN4KpnzzqGbRY#v=onepage&amp;q=).%20Education%20groups%20for%20men%20who%20batter:%20The%20Duluth%20model&amp;f=false|title=Education Groups for Men Who Batter: The Duluth Model|last=Pence|first=Ellen|last2=Paymar|first2=Michael|date=1993-04-06|publisher=Springer Publishing Company|isbn=9780826179913|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main components used in the Duluth Model is the 'power and control wheel,' which conceptualizes IPV as one form of abuse to maintain male privilege. Using the 'power and control wheel,' the goal of treatment is to achieve behaviors that fall on the 'equality wheel' by re-educate men and by replacing maladaptive attitudes held by men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) techniques focus on modifying faulty or problematic cognitions, beliefs, and emotions to prevent future violent behavior and include skills training such as anger management, assertiveness, and relaxation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist perspectives on wife abuse|last=Adams|first=David|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=176–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the addition of Duluth and CBT approaches results in a 5% reduction in IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babcock|first=Julia C|last2=Green|first2=Charles E|last3=Robie|first3=Chet|title=Does batterers' treatment work? A meta-analytic review of domestic violence treatment|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2002.07.001|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=23|issue=8|pages=1023–1053|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2002.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This low reduction rate might be explained, at least in part, by the high prevalence of bidirectional violence&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as well as client-treatment matching versus “one-size-fits-all” approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cornell|first=Dewey G.|last2=Warren|first2=Janet|last3=Hawk|first3=Gary|last4=Stafford|first4=Ed|last5=Oram|first5=Guy|last6=Pine|first6=Denise|title=Psychopathy in instrumental and reactive violent offenders.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-006X.64.4.783|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=64|issue=4|pages=783–790|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.64.4.783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving change through values-based behavior (ACTV) is a newly developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based program. Developed by domestic violence researcher Amie Zarling and colleagues at Iowa State University, the aim of ACTV is teach abusers "situational awareness"—to recognize and tolerate uncomfortable feelings – so that they can stop themselves from exploding into rage.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/10/21/558623534/iowa-tries-a-new-domestic-violence-intervention-mindfulness|title=Iowa Tries A New Domestic Violence Intervention: Mindfulness|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial evidence of the ACTV program has shown high promise: Using a sample 3,474 men who were arrested for domestic assault and court-mandated to a BIP (either ACTV or Duluth/CBT), Zarling and colleagues showed that compared with Duluth/CBT participants, significantly fewer ACTV participants acquired any new charges, domestic assault charges, or violent charges. ACTV participants also acquired significantly fewer charges on average in the 1 year after treatment than Duluth/CBT participants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conjoint treatment===

Some estimates show that as many as 50% of couples who experience IPV engage in some form of reciprocal violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, most services address offenders and survivors separately. In addition, many couples who have experienced IPV decide to stay together. These couples may present to couples or family therapy. In fact, 37-58% of couples who seek regular outpatient treatment have experienced physical assault in the past year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prevalence of partner aggression in representative and clinic samples.|last=Jose O'Leary|first=|publisher=APA|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=15–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, clinicians are faced with the decision as to whether they should accept or refuse to treat these couples. Although the use of conjoint treatment for IPV is controversial as it may present a danger to victims and potentially escalate abuse, it may be useful to others, such as couples experiencing situational couple violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stith|first=Sandra M.|last2=McCollum|first2=Eric E.|date=2011-07-01|title=Conjoint treatment of couples who have experienced intimate partner violence|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178911000644|journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior|series=Current Controversies on the Role of Gender in Partner Violence|volume=16|issue=4|pages=312–318|doi=10.1016/j.avb.2011.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars and practitioners in the field call for tailoring of interventions to various sub-types of violence and individuals served.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCollum|first=Eric E.|last2=Stith|first2=Sandra M.|date=2007-06-25|title=Conjoint Couple's Treatment for Intimate Partner Violence|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J398v06n01_07|journal=Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy|volume=6|issue=1-2|pages=71–82|doi=10.1300/J398v06n01_07|issn=1533-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral couple's therapy (BCT) is cognitive-behavioral approach, typically delivered to outpatients in 15-20 sessions over several months. Research suggests that BCT can be effective in reducing IPV when used to treat co-occurring addictions, which is important work because IPV and substance abuse and misuse frequently co-occur.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Domestic conflict containment program (DCCP) is a highly structured skills-based program whose goal is to teach couples conflict containment skills.

Physical aggression couples treatment (PACT) is a modification of DCCP, which includes additional psychoeducational components designed to improve relationship quality, including such things as communication skills, fair fighting tactics, and dealing with gender differences, sex, and jealousy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The primary goal of domestic violence focused couples treatment (DVFCT) is to end violence with the additional goal of helping couples improve the quality of their relationships. It is designed to be conducted over 18 weeks and can be delivered in either individual or multi-couple group format.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stith, S. M., McCollum, E. E., Rosen, K. H., Locke, L., &amp; Goldberg, P. (2005). Domestic violence focused couples treatment. ''Handbook of clinical family therapy'', 406-430.

[[Sharia]] or sharia law is the basic Islamic [[religious law]] derived from the religious precepts of [[Islam]], particularly the [[Quran]] and the opinions and life example of [[Muhammad]] ([[Hadith]] and [[Sunnah]]) which are the primary [[sources of sharia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Dictionar Definition of sharia in English|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia|website=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L.

Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; For topics and issues not directly addressed in these primary sources, sharia is derived. The derivation differs between the various [[Islamic schools and branches|sects of Islam]] ([[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] are the majority), and various jurisprudence schools such as [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]].&lt;ref name=hmr&gt;Hisham M.

The first military rulings were formulated during the first hundred years after Muhammad [[Hijra (Islam)|established an Islamic state in Medina]]. These rulings evolved in accordance with the interpretations of the Quran (the Muslim Holy scriptures) and Hadith (the recorded traditions of Muhammad). The key themes in these rulings were the [[Justice|justness]] of war (see [[Justice in the Quran]]), and the injunction to jihad. The rulings do not cover [[feud]]s and armed conflicts in general.&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aboul-Enein|first1=H.

Some have pointed out that the current Western view of the need for a clear separation between Church and State was only [[Separation of church and state#Jefferson and the Bill of Rights|first legislated into effect]] after 18 centuries of Christianity in the Western world.&lt;ref name="church state evolution"&gt;[http://counterjihad.com/separation-church-state-west-sharia "Separation of Church and State: In the West and Under Sharia"] By Immanuel Al-Manteeqi.

Islam has never had any officially recognized tradition of [[pacifism]], and throughout its history warfare has been an integral part of the Islamic theological system.&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Since the time of Muhammad, Islam has considered warfare to be a legitimate expression of religious faith, and has accepted its use for the defense of Islam.&lt;ref&gt; name=Zuhur&gt;Aboul-Enein, H.

While the early spread of Islam was often borne on the back of military conquest, within Christianity its early spread was often a matter of political expediency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophyandscripture.org/Issue3-1/Adams/Adams.html "Paul and the Government of the Soul"] Journal of Philosophy and Scripture.

Downloaded Mar. 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The minority [[Sufi]] movement within Islam, which includes certain pacifist elements, has often been officially "tolerated" by many Muslim majority governments. Additionally, some notable Muslim clerics, such as [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] have developed alternative non-violent Muslim theologies. Some hold that the formal juristic definition of [[Islam and war|war in Islam]] constitutes an irrevokable and permanent link within Islam between the political and religious justifications for war.&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quranic concept of ''[[Jihad]]'' includes aspects of both a physical and an internal struggle.&lt;ref name="morgan2010"/&gt;

According to [[Jonathan Berkey]], jihad in the Quran was maybe originally intended against Muhammad's local enemies, the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pagans]] of Mecca or the [[Banu Qurayza|Jews of Medina]], but the Quranic statements supporting jihad could be redirected once new enemies appeared.&lt;ref name="Berkey2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berkey|first=Jonathan Porter|authorlink=Jonathan Berkey|title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mLV6lo4mvj0C&amp;pg=PA73|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-58813-3|page=73|quote=The Koran is not a squeamish document, and exhort the believers to jihad.

The first forms of military Jihad occurred after the migration ([[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]) of Muhammad and his small group of followers to [[Muhammad in Medina|Medina]] from [[Muhammad in Mecca|Mecca]] and the conversion of several inhabitants of the city to Islam. The first revelation concerning the struggle against the Meccans was [[Al-Hajj|surah 22]], verses 39–40:&lt;ref&gt;William M. Watt: ''Muhammad at Medina'', p. 4; q.v. the [[Tafsir]] regarding these verses&lt;/ref&gt;
The main focus of Muhammad's later years was increasing the number of allies as well as the amount of territory under Muslim control.&lt;ref name="DavidCook2005"&gt;David Cook, ''Understanding Jihad''; University of California Press: CA, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Richard Edwards and [[Sherifa Zuhur]], offensive jihad was the type of jihad practiced by the early Muslim community, because their weakness meant "no defensive action would have sufficed to protect them against the allied tribal forces determined to exterminate them." Jihad as a collective duty (''[[Fard]] Kifaya'') and offensive jihad are synonymous in classical Islamic law and tradition, which also asserted that offensive jihad could only be declared by the caliph, but an "individually incumbent jihad" (''Fard Ayn'') required only "awareness of an oppression targeting Islam or Islamic peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards |first1=Richard |last2=Zuhur|first2=Sherifa |title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and|page=553|publisher=ABC-CLIO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC&amp;pg=PA553&amp;dq=jihad+declared+by+caliph&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIh7D86LCfyAIVFxKSCh1bnQiW#v=onepage&amp;q=jihad%20declared%20by%20caliph&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tina Magaard, associate professor at the [[Aarhus University]] Department of Business Development and Technology, has analyzed the texts of the 10 largest religions in the world. In an interview, she stated that the basic texts of Islam call for violence and aggression against followers of other faiths to a greater extent than texts of other religions. She has also argued that they contain direct incitements to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Jyllands-Posten|url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE5097347/Islam-er-den-mest-krigeriske-religion/|title=Islam er den mest krigeriske religion|date=Oct 9, 2005|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=====Caravan raids=====

{{Main article|Caravan raids|Ghazi (warrior)}}
[[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]] ([[Wiktionary:ghazi|غازي]]) is an Arabic term originally referring to an individual who participates in Ghazw (غزو), meaning military expeditions or raiding; after the emergence of Islam, it took on new connotations of religious warfare. The related word Ghazwa (غزوة) is a singulative form meaning a battle or military expedition, often one led by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein, H. Yousuf and Zuhur, Sherifa,"''[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1428910395&amp;id=5F-JEmNr9yUC&amp;printsec=frontcover Islamic Rulings on Warfare'']", Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, Diane Publishing Co., Darby PA, {{ISBN|1-4289-1039-5}} p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Caravan raids]] were a series of raids in which Muhammed and his [[Sahabah|companions]] participated. The raids were generally offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of [[Caravan (travellers)|caravans]] financed by the [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]].&lt;ref name="Watt1974"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Montgomery Watt|title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RV7uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=1974|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raids were intended to weaken the economy of [[Mecca]] by Muhammad.

Islamic Doctrines teachings on matters of war and peace have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. Charles Matthews writes that there is a "large debate about what the Quran commands as regards the '[[sword verses]]' and the 'peace verses'".  According to Matthews, "the question of the proper prioritization of these verses, and how they should be understood in relation to one another, has been a central issue for Islamic thinking about war."&lt;ref name=Mathewes&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Religious Ethics |first=Charles T. |last=Mathewes|publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2010 |page=197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyCsZE_iHp4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dipak Gupta, "much of the religious justification of violence against nonbelievers (Dar ul [[Kufr]]) by the promoters of jihad is based on the Quranic “sword verses.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=

On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context,&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', Princeton University Press, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www-rohan.sdsu.edu"&gt;Khaleel Muhammad, professor of religious studies at San Diego State University, states, regarding his discussion with the critic Robert Spencer, that "when I am told ... that Jihad only means war, or that I have to accept interpretations of the Qur'an that non-Muslims (with no good intentions or knowledge of Islam) seek to force upon me, I see a certain agendum developing: one that is based on hate, and I refuse to be part of such an intellectual crime." {{cite web|url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708102707/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~khaleel/ |archivedate= 8 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Micheline R. Ishay has argued that "the Quran justifies wars for self-defense to protect Islamic communities against internal or external aggression by non-Islamic populations, and wars waged against those who 'violate their oaths' by breaking a treaty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|9|12|end=15|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|39|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ishay, Micheline|title=The history of human rights |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley |year=|page=45 |isbn=0-520-25641-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] [[Gottlieb Wilhelm Leitner]] stated that jihad, even in self-defence, is "strictly limited".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaiil.org/uk/newsletters/2002/0302ukbulletin.pdf Article on Jihad] by Dr. G. W. Leitner (founder of The Oriental Institute, UK) published in Asiatic Quarterly Review, 1886. ("Jihad, even when explained as a righteous effort of waging war in self defense against the grossest outrage on one's religion, is strictly limited..")&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Oliver Leaman, a number of Islamic jurists asserted the primacy of the “sword verses” over the conciliatory verses in specific historical circumstances.&lt;ref name="Leaman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Oliver Leaman|authorlink=Oliver Leaman|title=Jewish Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DLLKcZuGCQ4C&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08868-5|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to Diane Morgan, [[Ibn Kathir]] (1301–1372) asserted that the Sword Verse [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] all [[Hudna|peace treaties]] that had been promulgated between Muhammad and idolaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essential Islam: a comprehensive guide to belief and practice |first=Diane |last=Morgan|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |page=89 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=sword+verses+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=sword%20verses%20quran&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic Modernism|Islamic modernists]] reject the abrogating status of the sword verses, which would result in the abrogation (naskh) of numerous Quranic verses that counsel peace and reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Shariʻa as discourse: legal traditions and the encounter with Europe |first1=Jørgen S.|last1=Nielsen |first2=Lisbet |last2=Christoffersen |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year=2010 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0VJ_t0F7ZGEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Quran+%22sword+verses%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22sword%20verses%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muslims and modernity: an introduction to the issues and debates |first=Clinton |last=Bennett |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D0vYYovH7OQC&amp;dq=Koran+%22sword+verses%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his oppressors in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more defensive perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; From that point onward, those dubious about the need to go to war were typically portrayed as lazy cowards allowing their love of peace to become a [[Fitna (word)|fitna]] to them.&lt;ref name="church"&gt;Churchill, Robert Paul.

====Ahmadiyya====
{{Main article|Ahmadiyya view on Jihad|Ahmadiyya#Abrogation|Persecution of Ahmadis}}

According to [[Ahmadi]] Muslim belief, Jihad can be divided into three categories: ''Jihad al-Akbar'' (Greater Jihad) is that against the self and refers to striving against one's low desires such as anger, lust and hatred; ''Jihad al-Kabīr'' (Great Jihad) refers to the peaceful propagation of Islam, with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the ''pen''; ''Jihad al-Asghar'' (Smaller Jihad) is only for self-defence under situations of extreme religious persecution whilst not being able to follow one's fundamental religious beliefs, and even then only under the direct instruction of the [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414065050/http://www.whyahmadi.org/3_10.html | archivedate=2012-04-14 | title=Suspension of Jihad | accessdate=September 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valentine2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Simon Ross Valentine|title=Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA190|year=2008|publisher=C.

{{Quote|As far as Islam is concerned, it categorically rejects and condemns every form of terrorism. It does not provide any cover or justification for any act of violence, be it committed by an individual, a group or a government.}}

Various Ahmadis scholars, such as [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]], [[Maulana Sadr-ud-Din]] and [[Basharat Ahmad]], argue that when the Quran's verses are read in context, it clearly appears that the Quran prohibits initial aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.&lt;ref name="Ali, Maulana Muhammad - p. 414"&gt;Ali, Maulana Muhammad; The Religion of Islam (6th Edition), Ch V "Jihad" p. 414 "When shall war cease".

[http://www.aaiil.org/text/books/mali/religionislam/religionofislam.pdf link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadi Muslims believe that no verse of the Quran abrogates or cancels another verse. All Quranic verses have equal validity, in keeping with their emphasis on the "unsurpassable beauty and unquestionable validity of the Qur'ān".&lt;ref name="Friedmann"&gt;[[Yohanan Friedmann|Friedmann]], ''Jihād in Ahmadī Thought'', {{ISBN|965-264-014-X}}, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; The harmonization of apparently incompatible rulings is resolved through their juridical deflation in Ahmadī ''[[fiqh]]'', so that a ruling (considered to have applicability only to the specific [[asbab al-nuzul|situation for which it was revealed]]), is effective not because it was revealed last, but because it is most suited to the situation at hand.&lt;ref name="Friedmann"/&gt;

Ahmadis are considered non-Muslims by the mainstream Muslims since they consider [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], founder of Ahmadiyya, as the promised [[Mahdi]] and [[Messiah]].&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/3in1/chap2/index.html | title=An Enemy a Disbeliever a Liar, Claims of Hadhrat Ahmad | publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Naeem Osman Memon | year=1994 |isbn=1-85372-552-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/books/truth/reflection.html | title=Truth about Ahmadiyyat, Reflection of all the Prophets |publisher=London Mosque | author=B.A Rafiq | year=1978 |isbn=0-85525-013-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirza Tahir Ahmad 1998"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.alislam.org/library/books/revelation/part_7_section_1.html | title=Revelation Rationality Knowledge and Truth, Future of Revelation|publisher=Islam International Publications | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | authorlink=Mirza Tahir Ahmad | year=1998 |isbn=1-85372-640-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Lago|title=The Handbook of Transcultural Counselling and Psychotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vREBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA312|accessdate=13 December 2015|year=2011|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|isbn=978-0-335-23851-4|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of Islamic countries, especially Sunni-dominated nations, Ahmadis have been considered heretics and non-Muslim, and have been subject to various forms of [[Persecution of religious minorities by Muslims|religious persecution]], [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]] and systematic oppression since the movement's inception in 1889.&lt;ref name="Naeem Osman Memon 1994"/&gt;&lt;ref name="B.A Rafiq 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lago2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819140154/http://www.theasa.org/conferences/asa04/panels/panel21.htm "Localising Diaspora: the Ahmadi Muslims and the problem of multi-sited ethnography".] Association of Social Anthropologists, 2004 conference panel.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and crime===

The Islamic criminal law is [[criminal law]] in accordance with Sharia. Strictly speaking, Islamic law does not have a distinct corpus of "criminal law."

* '''Hudud''' is an Islamic concept: punishments which under Islamic law (Shariah) are mandated and fixed by God. The Shariah divided offenses into those against God and those against man. Crimes against God violated His Hudud, or 'boundaries'. These punishments were specified by the Quran, and in some instances by the Sunnah.&lt;ref name=msea/&gt;&lt;ref name=mdth1&gt;Silvia Tellenbach (2015), The Oxford Handbook of Criminal Law (Ed: Markus D.

In contrast to human rights activists, Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and sexual codes that are central to Islam. Zina laws come under hudud—seen as crime against [[Allah]]; the Islamists refer to this pressure and proposals to reform zina and other laws as ‘contrary to Islam’. Attempts by international human rights to reform religious laws and codes of Islam has become the Islamist rallying platforms during political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;A.

[[Islamic terrorism]] is, by definition, [[Terrorism|terrorist acts]] committed by Muslim groups or individuals who profess Islamic or [[Islamism|Islamist]] motivations or goals. Islamic terrorists have relied on particular interpretations of the tenets of the Quran and the Hadith, citing these scriptures to justify violent tactics including mass murder, genocide, [[Islam and Pedophilia|child-molestation]] and slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/12/world/meast/isis-justification-female-slaves/index.html?hpt=hp_t2|title=ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK |author=Greg Botelho|date=12 December 2014|work=CNN|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, incidents of Islamic terrorism have occurred on a global scale, occurring not only in Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also abroad in [[Terrorism in the European Union|Europe]], [[Terrorism in Russia|Russia]], and the [[Terrorism in the United States|United States]], and such attacks have targeted Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/24/isis-ideology-islamic-militants-british-appeal-iraq-syria|title=Isis: a contrived ideology justifying barbarism and sexual control|author=Mona Siddiqui|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a number of the worst-affected Muslim-majority regions, these terrorists have been met by armed, independent resistance groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/kurdish-peshmerga-kobani-isis-syria|title=Kurdish peshmerga forces arrive in Kobani to bolster fight against Isis|author=Constanze Letsch|work=the Guardian|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; state actors and their [[proxy war|proxies]], and politically liberal Muslim protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/388593/moderate-muslims-stand-against-isis-christine-sisto|title=Moderate Muslims Stand against ISIS |author=Christine Sisto|work=National Review Online|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pacifism in Islam ==
Islam does not have any normative tradition of [[pacifism]], and [[Islam and war|warfare]] has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Johnson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=James Turner|title=Holy War Idea in Western and Islamic Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoEjpRsvuzUC&amp;pg=PA20|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04214-1|pages=20–25|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300198171/islamic-imperialism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lews, Bernard, Islam and the West, Oxford University Press, 1993, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] travel Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca.&lt;ref name="cultures"&gt;Boulding, Elise. "Cultures of Peace: The Hidden Side of History", p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until after the exile that the [[Muhammad's first revelation|Quranic revelations]] began to adopt a more violent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, Lawrence. "Terrorism: Roots, Impact, Responses", p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting in self-defense is not only legitimate but considered obligatory upon Muslims, according to the Qur'an. The Qur'an, however, says that should the enemy's hostile behavior cease, then the reason for engaging the enemy also lapses.&lt;ref name =afsaruddin&gt;Afsaruddin, Asma (2007). ''Views of Jihad Throughout History''. Religion Compass 1 (1), pp. 165–69.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, different Muslim movements through history had linked pacifism with [[Muslim theology]].&lt;ref name="Osborn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emily Lynn Osborn|title=Our New Husbands Are Here: Households, Gender, and Politics in a West African State from the Slave Trade to Colonial Rule|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vFHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=10 October 2011|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-4397-2|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Müller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Louise Müller|title=Religion and Chieftaincy in Ghana: An Explanation of the Persistence of a Traditional Political Institution in West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T890Drkv9AoC&amp;pg=PA207|year=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-643-90360-0|pages=207–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An American Witness to India's Partition by Phillips Talbot Year (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception of Islam==
===Negative perceptions===
Philip W. Sutton and Stephen Vertigans describe Western views on Islam as based on a [[stereotype]] of it as an inherently violent religion, characterizing it as a 'religion of the sword'. They characterize the image of Islam in the [[Western world]] as "dominated by conflict, aggression, 'fundamentalism', and global-scale violent terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Resurgent Islam: a sociological approach |first1=Philip W. |last1=Sutton |first2=Stephen |last2=Vertigans |publisher=Polity |year=2005 |page=7 |quote=Stereotypical views which portray Islam as an inherently violent religion, a 'religion of the sword' and an increasing global threat have thus been reinforced and even extended over recent years. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jhx1XlbhFhgC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QN4FTaL-Jo7msQOepuWODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan Eduardo Campo writes that, "Europeans (have) viewed Islam in various ways: sometimes as a backward, violent religion; sometimes as an [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] fantasy; and sometimes as a complex and changing product of history and social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |first=Juan Eduardo |last=Campo |page=374 |publisher = Infobase Publishing| year= 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Gleave writes that, "at the centre of popular conceptions of Islam as a violent religion are the punishments carried out by regimes hoping to bolster both their domestic and international Islamic credentials."&lt;ref name="HinnellsKing2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Hinnells|author2=Richard King|title=Religion and Violence in South Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wb1OBi3zvdkC&amp;pg=PA79|accessdate=26 February 2016|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-203-08869-2|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attack on the US]] has led many non-Muslims to indict Islam as a violent religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times|first=Ram |last=Puniyani |publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |pages=97–98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=X30ETYusGcq-nAfihpnmDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Corrigan and Hudson, "some conservative Christian leaders (have) complained that Islam (is) incompatible with what they believed to be a Christian America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in America: an historical account of the development of American religious life |first1=John|last1=Corrigan |first2=Winthrop Still |last2=Hudson |publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall |year=2004 |page=444 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVTuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;dq=Pat+Robertson+Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TdQFTa6ZAY72tgPb9aDHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of [[evangelical Christian]]s who have expressed such sentiments include [[Franklin Graham]], an [[Christianity in the United States|American Christian]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and [[missionary]], and [[Pat Robertson]], an American [[media mogul]], [[executive chairman]], and a former [[Southern Baptist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Nation Challenged: The Religious Right; Islam Is Violent in Nature, Pat Robertson Says |publisher=New York Times |date=23 February 2002 |quote=The religious broadcaster Pat Robertson has described Islam as a"violent religion that wants to 'dominate and then, if need be, destroy'."|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/23/us/nation-challenged-religious-right-islam-violent-nature-pat-robertson-says.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a survey conducted by [[LifeWay Christian Resources|LifeWay Research]], a research group affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], said that two out of three [[Protestantism|Protestant]] pastors believe that Islam is a "dangerous" religion.

Dr. Johannes J.G. Jansen was an Arabist who wrote an essay called “Religious Roots of Muslim Violence”, in which he discusses at length all aspects of the issue and unequivocally concludes that Muslim violence is mostly based on Islamic religious commands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabistjansen.nl/Arabist/pub_list_Engl_files/RelRootsMusViol.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

Media coverage on terrorist attacks play a critical role in creating negative perceptions on Islam and Muslims. Powell  &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kimberly|date=2011|title=Framing Islam: An Analysis of U.S. Media Coverage of Terrorism Since 9/11|url=|journal=Communication Studies|volume=62|pages=90-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; described how Islam initially appeared in U.S. news cycles because of its relationships to oil, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and terrorism (92). Thus the audience was provided the base to associate Muslims to control of the resource of oil, war, and terrorism. A total of 11 terrorist attacks in the U.S. soil since the 9/11 and their content coverage (in 1,638 news stories) in the national media had been analyzed "through frames composed of labels, common themes, and rhetorical associations" (Powell 94)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The key findings are summarized below: 
* The media coverage of terrorism in the U.S. feeds a culture of fear of Islam and describes  the United States as a good Christian nation (Powell 105). 
* A clear pattern of reporting had been detected that differentiates "terrorists who were Muslim with international ties and terrorists who were U.S. citizens with no clear international ties" (Powell 105). This was utilized to frame "war of Islam on the United States".
* "Muslim Americans are no longer ‘‘free’’ to practice and to name their religion without fear of prosecution, judgment, or connection to terrorism." (Powell 107)

Islamophobia denotes the [[prejudice]] against, hatred towards, or fear of the religion of Islam or Muslims.&lt;ref name=levandedefinitioner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levandehistoria.se/fakta-fordjupning/islamofobi/definitioner-och-uttryck|title=Islamofobi – definitioner och uttryck|work=Forum för levande historia|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Runnymede5&gt;Runnymede 1997, p. 5, cited in Quraishi 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; While the term is now widely used, both the term itself and the underlying concept of Islamophobia have been heavily criticized.&lt;ref name="Aldridge1"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Aldridge |first=Alan |title=Religion in the Contemporary World: A Sociological Introduction |date=February 1, 2000 |publisher=Polity Press |isbn=978-0-7456-2083-1 |page=138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bleich"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bleich | first1 = Erik | year = 2011 | title = What Is Islamophobia and How Much Is There?

Some commentators have posited an increase in Islamophobia [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks|resulting from the September 11 attacks]], while others have associated it with the increased presence of [[Islam in the United States|Muslims]] in the [[Islamophobia in the United States|United States]], the [[European Union]] and other [[secular state|secular nations]]. Steven Salaita contends that indeed since 9/11, [[Arab Americans]] have evolved from what Nadine Naber described as an invisible group in the United States into a highly visible community that directly or indirectly has an effect on the United States' culture wars, foreign policy, presidential elections and legislative tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond Orientalism and Islamophobia: 9/11, Anti-Arab Racism, and the Mythos of National Pride|last = Salaita|first = Steven|date = Fall 2006|journal = CR: The New Centennial Review|doi = |pmid = |issue = 2|volume = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Favorable perceptions===
{{See also|Liberal Muslim movements|Cultural Muslim}}

In response to these perceptions, [[Ram Puniyani]], a [[secular]] activist and writer, says that "Islam does not condone violence but, like other religions, does believe in self-defence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion, power &amp; violence: expression of politics in contemporary times |first=Ram |last=Puniyani|publisher=SAGE |year=2005 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fd5Fm79VMk8C&amp;pg=PA98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Juergensmeyer]] describes the teachings of Islam as ambiguous about violence. He states that, like all religions, Islam occasionally allows for force while stressing that the main spiritual goal is one of nonviolence and peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror in the mind of God: the global rise of religious violence |first=Mark |last=Juergensmeyer |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |page=80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpb1mbaHjGQC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=Qur%27an+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eUsMTZ37PIqcsQON5uCJCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Qur%27an%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ralph W. Hood]], Peter C. Hill and Bernard Spilka write in ''The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach'', "Although it would be a mistake to think that Islam is inherently a violent religion, it would be equally inappropriate to fail to understand the conditions under which believers might feel justified in acting violently against those whom their tradition feels should be opposed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Psychology of Religion: An Empirical Approach|first1=Ralph W. |last1=Hood |first2=Peter C.|last2=Hill |first3=Bernard |last3=Spilka |publisher=Guilford Press |year=2009|page=257 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETVk59xbc90C&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=Islam+%22violent+religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZbcFTb21G4uosAOp3ZiKDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Islam%20%22violent%20religion%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Chandra Muzaffar]], a [[political scientist]], [[Liberal Muslim movements#Reform|Islamic reformist]] and [[activist]], says, "The Quranic exposition on resisting aggression, oppression and injustice lays down the parameters within which fighting or the use of violence is legitimate. What this means is that one can use the Quran as the criterion for when violence is legitimate and when it is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rights, religion and reform: enhancing human dignity through spiritual and moral transformation |first=Chandra |last=Muzaffar |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2002|page=345|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQA02NT6tmAC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;dq=Quran+violence&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-C8HTdGqOoOusAPNn4DZDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20violence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics===
[[Pew Research Center|Pew research]] in 2010 found that in [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Nigeria]], roughly 50% of Muslims had favourable views of [[Hezbollah]], and that [[Hamas]] also saw similar support.&lt;ref name=PewDivided&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/|title=Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah|date=2 December 2010|work=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Counter-terrorism]] researchers suggests that support for suicide bombings is rooted in opposition to real or perceived foreign military occupation, rather than Islam, according to a Department of Defense-funded study by University of Chicago researcher Robert Pape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/laurarozen/1010/Researcher_Suicide_terrorism_linked_to_military_occupation.html?showall |title=Researcher: Suicide terrorism linked to military occupation - Laura Rozen |publisher=Politico.Com |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for the [[National Post]], [[Barbara Kay]] stated that [[honor killing]] is not strictly a Muslim phenomenon and that it is enabled by factors including [[sexism]], dowries and a lack of a dependable legal system. Nevertheless, Kay says that the murders are a Muslim phenomenon in the West, where 95% of honor killings are perpetrated by "Muslim fathers and brothers or their proxies". Kay warns that females do not dissent as one might expect either: The women may describe victims of honor killing as having needed punishment.&lt;ref&gt;[Continue calling ‘honour killings’ by its rightful name, Barbara Kay, September 21, 2011, Full comment, National Post.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center also found that support for the [[Islam and capital punishment|death penalty]] as punishment for "people who leave the Muslim religion" was 86% in Jordan, 84% in Egypt, 76% in Pakistan, 80% in Nigeria (all very large Muslim populations) and yet lower in some other countries.&lt;ref name=PewDivided/&gt; The different factors at play (e.g. sectarianism, poverty, etc.) and their relative impacts are not clarified.

According to 2006 data, Pew says that 46% of [[Islam in Nigeria|Nigerian Muslims]], 29% of [[Islam in Jordan|Jordan Muslims]], 28% of [[Islam in Egypt|Egyptian Muslims]], 15% of [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslims]], and 8% of [[Islam in the United States|American Muslims]] thought suicide bombings are often or sometimes justified.&lt;ref name=PewMuslimAmericans&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/files/old-assets/pdf/muslim-americans.pdf|title=Muslim Americans – Middle class and mostly mainstream|date=22 May 2007|publisher=Pew Research Center|page=60|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure was unchanged – still 8% – for American Muslims by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people-press.org/2011/08/30/muslim-americans-no-signs-of-growth-in-alienation-or-support-for-extremism/|title=Muslim Americans: No Signs of Growth in Alienation or Support for Extremism|date=30 August 2011|work=Pew Research Center for the People and the Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls have found Muslim-Americans to report less violent views than any other religious group in America. 89% of Muslim-Americans claimed that the killing of civilians is never justified, compared to 71% of Catholics and Protestants, 75% of Jews, and 76% of atheists and non-religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/Muslim-Americans-No-Justification-Violence.aspx|title=Most Muslim Americans See No Justification for Violence|publisher=gallup.com|date=2 August 2011|author=Nicole Naurath|accessdate=3 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pew Research Center's 2013 poll showed that the majority of 14,244 Muslim, Christian and other respondents in 14 countries with substantial Muslim populations are concerned about Islamic extremism and hold negative views on known terrorist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/01/concerns-about-islamic-extremism-on-the-rise-in-middle-east/|title=Concerns about Islamic Extremism on the Rise in Middle East|publisher=Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Project|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gallup poll====
Gallup poll collected extensive data in a project called "Who Speaks for Islam?". [[John Esposito]] and [[Dalia Mogahed]] present data relevant to Islamic views on peace, and more, in their book ''Who Speaks for Islam?'' The book reports Gallup poll data from random samples in over 35 countries using Gallup's various research techniques (e.g. pairing male and female interviewers, testing the questions beforehand, communicating with local leaders when approval is necessary, travelling by foot if that is the only way to reach a region, etc.) &lt;ref name=GallupEM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307065817/http://www.gallup.com/press/108457/Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx|archivedate=2009-03-07|title=FAQs: Who Speaks for Islam?|publisher=gallup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a great deal of data. It suggests, firstly, that individuals who dislike America and consider the September 11 attacks to be "perfectly justified" form a statistically distinct group, with much more extreme views. The authors call this 7% of Muslims "Politically Radicalized".&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt; They chose that title "because of their radical political orientation" and clarify "we are not saying that all in this group commit acts of violence. However, those with extremist views are a potential source for recruitment or support for terrorist groups."&lt;ref name=GallupRadical&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/104941/what-makes-radical.aspx|publisher=Gallup.com|title=What Makes a Radical?|author=Gallup Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data also indicates that poverty is not simply to blame for the comparatively radical views of this 7% of Muslims, who tend to be better educated than moderates.&lt;ref name=GallupRadical/&gt;

The authors say that, contrary to what the media may indicate, most Muslims believe that the September 11 attacks cannot actually be justified at all. The authors called this 55% of Muslims "Moderates". Included in that category were an additional 12% who said the attacks ''almost'' cannot be justified at all (thus 67% of Muslims were classified as Moderates). 26% of Muslims were neither moderates nor radicals, leaving the remaining 7% called "[[Political radicalism|Politically Radicalized]]". Esposito and Mogahed explain that the labels should not be taken as being perfectly definitive. Because there may be individuals who would generally not be considered radical, although they believe the attacks were justified, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=GallupEM/&gt;

'''Jackson structured programming''' ('''JSP''') is a method for [[structured programming]] based on correspondences between data stream structure and program structure.  JSP structures programs and data in terms of sequences, iterations and selections, and as a consequence it is applied when designing a program's detailed control structure. The method applies to processing of any data structure or data stream that is describable as a hierarchical structure of sequential, optional and iterated elements. This could be a stream of messages that a process reads to invoke and coordinate other modules or objects, or it could be a string of characters in parameters passed to a single operation on an "object" coded in an object-oriented programming language. In other words, it could be either above or below the level where [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented methods]] are applied &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = R | last = Wieringa  | title = A survey of structured and object-oriented software specification methods and techniques | publisher = ACM | journal = Comput Surv | volume = 30 | issue = 4 |date=Dec 1998 | pages = 459–527 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/299917.299919 | doi=10.1145/299917.299919}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Brian | last1 = Henderson-Sellers | author1-link = Brian Henderson-Sellers | first2 = JM | last2 = Edwards  | title = The object-oriented systems life cycle | journal = Commun | publisher = ACM | volume = 33 | issue = 9 |date=Sep 1990 | pages = 142–59 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/83880.84529 | doi=10.1145/83880.84529}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[Michael A. Jackson]] originally developed JSP in the 1970s. He documented the system in his 1975 book ''Principles of Program Design''.&lt;ref name="PoPD"&gt;{{Citation | first = MA | last = Jackson | title = Principles of Program Design | publisher = Academic | year = 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 conference talk,&lt;ref name="perspective"&gt;{{Citation | first = MA | last = Jackson | title = JSP in Perspective | place = sd&amp;m Pioneers’ Conference, Bonn, June 2001 | year=2001 | url = http://mcs.open.ac.uk/mj665/JSPPers1.pdf | access-date = 2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; he provided a retrospective analysis of the original driving forces behind the method, and related it to subsequent software engineering developments. Jackson's aim was to make [[COBOL]] batch file processing programs easier to modify and maintain, but the method can be used to design programs for any [[programming language]] that has structured control constructs, languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Perl]]. Despite its age, JSP is still in use and is supported by diagramming tools such as Microsoft's Visio and CASE tools such as Jackson Workbench.&lt;ref name= "Ourusoff 2003"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proceedings.informingscience.org/IS2003Proceedings/docs/091Ourus.pdf|title = Using Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) and Jackson Workbench to Teach Program Design | accessdate = 2017-01-16 | publisher =Informing Science|year= 2003| first =Nicholas | last = Ourusoff|work= InSite 2003 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson Structured Programming was seen by many as related&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = KT | last = Orr | year = 1980 | contribution = Structured programming in the 1980s | title = Proceedings of the ACM 1980 Annual Conference | publisher = ACM Press | place = New York, NY | pages = 323–26 | url = http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/800176.809987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Warnier/Orr Diagrams|Warnier structured programming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = JD | last = Warnier | year = 1974 | title = Logical Construction of Programs | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | place = NY}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the latter method focused almost exclusively on the structure of the output stream.  JSP and Warnier's method both structure programs and data using only sequences, iterations and selections, so they essentially create programs that are [[parser]]s for [[regular expression]]s which simultaneously match the program's input and output data streams.

Because JSP focuses on the existing input and output data streams, designing a program using JSP is claimed to be more straightforward than with other structured programming methods, avoiding the leaps of intuition needed to successfully program using methods such as top-down decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Sorensen | first1 = K | last2 = Verelst | first2 = J | title = On the conversion of program specifications into pseudo code using Jackson structured programming | journal = Journal of Computing and Information Technology | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | year = 2001 | pages = 71–80 | doi=10.2498/cit.2001.01.06}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consequence of JSP's focus on data streams is that it creates program designs with a very different structure to the kind created by the stepwise refinement methods of [[Niklaus Wirth|Wirth]] and [[Edsger Dijkstra|Dijkstra]].  One typical feature of the structure of JSP programs is that they have several input operations distributed throughout the code in contrast to programs designed using stepwise refinement, which tend to have only one input operation. Jackson illustrates this difference in Chapter 3 of ''Principles of Program Design''.&lt;ref name="PoPD"/&gt;  He presents two versions of a program, one designed using JSP, the other using "traditional" methods.

== Structural equivalent ==
For an example comparing Jackson Structured Programming to "traditional" structured programming, let us consider a Java program to count repeated lines in a file.

The JSP version of the program is structurally equivalent to

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
String line;

line = in.readLine();
while (line != null) {
    int count = 0;
    String firstLineOfGroup = line;

    while (line != null &amp;&amp; line.equals(firstLineOfGroup)) {
        count++;
        line = in.readLine();
    }
    System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + " " + count);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and the traditional version of the program is equivalent to

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
String line;

int count = 0;
String firstLineOfGroup = null;
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
    if (firstLineOfGroup == null
            || !line.equals(firstLineOfGroup)) {
        if (firstLineOfGroup != null) {
            System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + " " + count);
        }
        count = 0;
        firstLineOfGroup = line;
    }
    count++;
}
if (firstLineOfGroup != null) {
    System.out.println(firstLineOfGroup + " " + count);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Jackson criticises the traditional version, claiming that it hides the relationships which exist between the input lines, compromising the program's understandability and maintainability by, for example, forcing the use of a special case for the first line and forcing another special case for a final output operation.

== The method ==
JSP uses semi-formal steps to capture the existing structure of a program's inputs and outputs in the structure of the program itself.

The intent is to create programs which are easy to modify over their lifetime.  Jackson's major insight was that requirement changes are usually minor tweaks to the existing structures.  For a program constructed using JSP, the inputs, the outputs, and the internal structures of the program all match, so small changes to the inputs and outputs should translate into small changes to the program.

JSP structures programs in terms of four component types:

* fundamental operations
* sequences
* iterations
* selections

The method begins by describing a program's inputs in terms of the four fundamental component types.  It then goes on to describe the program's outputs in the same way.  Each input and output is modelled as a separate [[Data structure diagram|Data Structure Diagram]] (DSD).  To make JSP work for compute-intensive applications, such as digital signal processing (DSP) it is also necessary to draw algorithm structure diagrams, which focus on internal data structures rather than input and output ones.

The input and output structures are then unified or merged into a final program structure, known as a Program Structure Diagram (PSD).  This step may involve the addition of a small amount of high level control structure to marry up the inputs and outputs.  Some programs process all the input before doing any output, whilst others  read in one record, write one record and iterate.  Such approaches have to be captured in the PSD.

The PSD, which is language neutral, is then implemented in a programming language.  JSP is geared towards programming at the level of control structures, so the implemented designs use just primitive operations, sequences, iterations and selections.  JSP is not used to structure programs at the level of classes and objects, although it can helpfully structure [[control flow]] within a class's methods.

JSP uses a diagramming notation to describe the structure of inputs, outputs and programs, with diagram elements for each of the fundamental component types.

A simple operation is drawn as a box.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Element Jackson.png|A box labeled 'A']]&lt;br&gt;An operation&lt;/center&gt;

A sequence of operations is represented by boxes connected with lines.  In the example below, operation A consists of the sequence of operations B, C and D.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP Sequence.png|A box labeled 'A' connected to three boxes below it labeled 'B', 'C' and 'D']]&lt;br&gt;A sequence&lt;/center&gt;

An iteration is again represented with joined boxes.  In addition the iterated operation has a star in the top right corner of its box.  In the example below, operation A consists of an iteration of zero or more invocations of operation B.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP Iteration.png|A box labeled 'A' connected to a box labeled 'B' below it with a star in the top right corner]]&lt;br&gt;An iteration&lt;/center&gt;

Selection is similar to a sequence, but with a circle drawn in the top right hand corner of each optional operation.  In the example, operation A consists of one and only one of operations B, C or D.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP Selection.png|A box labeled 'A' connected to three boxes below it labeled 'B', 'C' and 'D' each with a circle in the top right hand corner]]&lt;br&gt;A selection&lt;/center&gt;

==A worked example==

As an example, here is how a programmer would design and code a [[Run-length encoding|run length encoder]] using JSP.

A run length encoder is a program which takes as its input a stream of bytes.  It outputs a stream of pairs consisting of a byte along with a count of the byte's consecutive occurrences.  Run length encoders are often used for crudely compressing bitmaps.

With JSP, the first step is to describe the structure of a program's inputs.  A run length encoder has only one input, a stream of bytes which can be viewed as zero or more ''runs''.  Each run consists of one or more bytes of the same value.  This is represented by the following JSP diagram.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE input.png]]&lt;br&gt;The run length encoder input&lt;/center&gt;

The second step is to describe the structure of the output.  The run length encoder output can be described as zero or more pairs, each pair consisting of a byte and its count.  In this example, the count will also be a byte.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE output1.png]]&lt;br&gt;The run length encoder output&lt;/center&gt;

The next step is to describe the correspondences between the operations in the input and output structures.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE correspondence.png]]&lt;br&gt;The correspondences between the run length encoders inputs and its outputs&lt;/center&gt;

It is at this stage that the astute programmer may encounter a ''structure clash'', in which there is no obvious correspondence between the input and output structures.  If a structure clash is found, it is usually resolved by splitting the program into two parts, using an intermediate data structure to provide a common structural framework with which the two program parts can communicate.  The two programs parts are often implemented as [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[coroutine]]s.

In this example, there is no structure clash, so the two structures can be merged to give the final program structure.

&lt;center&gt;[[Image:JSP RLE program.png]]&lt;br&gt;The run length encoder program structure&lt;/center&gt;

At this stage the program can be fleshed out by hanging various primitive operations off the elements of the structure.  Primitives which suggest themselves are

# read a byte
# remember byte
# set counter to zero
# increment counter
# output remembered byte
# output counter

The iterations also have to be fleshed out. They need conditions added. Suitable conditions would be

# while there are more bytes
# while there are more bytes and this byte is the same as the run's first byte and the count will still fit in a byte

If we put all this together, we can convert the diagram and the primitive operations into C, maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the code and the operations and structure of the program design diagram.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int c;

    c = getchar();
    while (c != EOF) {
        int count = 1;

        int first_byte = c;

        c = getchar();

        while (c != EOF &amp;&amp; c == first_byte &amp;&amp; count &lt; 255) {
            count++;
            c = getchar();
        }

        putchar(first_byte);
        putchar(count);
    }
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4736">'''Kavka's toxin puzzle''' is a [[thought experiment]] about the possibility of forming an intention to perform an act which, following from reason, is an action one would not actually perform. It was presented by moral and political philosopher [[Gregory S. Kavka]] in "The Toxin Puzzle" (1983), and grew out of his work in [[deterrence theory]] and [[mutual assured destruction]].

==The puzzle==
Kavka's original version of the puzzle is the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''An eccentric billionaire places before you a vial of toxin that, if you drink it, will make you painfully ill for a day, but will not threaten your life or have any lasting effects. The billionaire will pay you one million dollars tomorrow morning if, at midnight tonight, you ''intend'' to drink the toxin tomorrow afternoon. He emphasizes that you need not drink the toxin to receive the money; in fact, the money will already be in your bank account hours before the time for drinking it arrives, if you succeed. All you have to do is. . . intend at midnight tonight to drink the stuff tomorrow afternoon. You are perfectly free to change your mind after receiving the money and not drink the toxin.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=33–36 [pp. 33–34] |last=Kavka |first=Gregory |title=The Toxin Puzzle |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=43 |issue=1 |year=1983 |jstor= |doi=10.1093/analys/43.1.33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A possible interpretation: Can you intend to drink the toxin if you also intend to change your mind at a later time?

==The paradox==
The paradoxical nature can be stated in many ways, which may be useful for understanding analysis proposed by philosophers:
* In line with [[Newcomb's paradox]], an [[omniscient]] pay-off mechanism makes a person's decision known to him before he makes the decision, but it is  also assumed that the person may change his decision afterwards, of [[free will]].
* Similarly in line with Newcomb's paradox; Kavka's claim, that one cannot intend what one will not do, makes pay-off mechanism an example of [[retrocausality|reverse causation]].
* Pay-off for decision to drink the poison is ambiguous.
* There are two decisions for one event with different pay-offs.

Since the pain caused by the poison would be more than off-set by the money received, we can sketch the pay-off table as follows.
{| class="wikitable"
|+Pay-offs (Initial analysis)
|-
! !!Intend
! Do not intend
|-
! Drink
| 90
| −10
|-
! Do not drink
| 100
| 0
|}

According to Kavka: Drinking the poison is never to your advantage regardless of whether you are paid. A rational person would know he would not drink the poison and thus could not intend to drink it.
{| class="wikitable"
|+Pay-offs (According to Kavka)
|-
! !!Intend
! Do not intend
|-
! Drink
| Impossible
| −10
|-
! Do not drink
| Impossible
| 0
|}

[[David Gauthier]] argues once a person intends drinking the poison one cannot entertain ideas of not drinking it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=David |title=Assure and Threaten |journal=[[Ethics (journal)|Ethics]] |volume=104 |issue=4 |year=1994 |pages=690–721 |jstor=2382214 |doi=10.1086/293651}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::''The rational outcome of your deliberation tomorrow morning is the action that will be part of your life going as well as possible, subject to the constraint that it be compatible with your commitment---in  this case, compatible with the sincere intention that you form today to drink the toxin. And so the rational action is to drink the toxin.''
{| class="wikitable"
|+Pay-offs (According to Gauthier)
|-
! !!Intend
! Do not intend
|-
! Drink
| 90
| −10
|-
! Do not drink
| Impossible
| 0
|}

One of the central tenets of the puzzle is that for a reasonable person
* There is reasonable grounds for that person to intend to drink the toxin, since some reward may be obtained.
* Having come to the above conclusion there is no reasonable grounds for that person to drink the toxin, since no further reward may be obtained, and no reasonable person would partake in self-harm for no benefit.

Thus a reasonable person must intend to drink the toxin by the first argument, yet if that person intends to drink the toxin, he is being irrational by the second argument.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7581">'''Language nest'''s, an [[language immersion|immersion]]-based approach to [[language revitalization]], originated in [[New Zealand]] in 1982 as a part of the [[Māori language revival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "language nest" is a translation of the Māori phrase [[Māori language revival#K.C5.8Dhanga reo|''kōhanga reo'']].

In a language nest, older speakers of the language take part in [[early childhood education|early-childhood education]] with a view to improving intergenerational language transference.

== In New Zealand ==
The first ''kōhanga reo'' was founded in [[Wainuiomata]] in 1982, and was followed by the establishment of primary schools and secondary schools ([[Kura Kaupapa Māori]]) where [[Māori language|Māori]] is the primary language of instruction.

According to Al Jazeera, the percentage of Maori people speaking the language has increased by a few percentage points from the early 1980s to 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Linguist Christopher Moseley says that this statistic is "quite encouraging" because "compared to how quickly a language can disappear, in just one generation in extreme cases, the figures are good."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/livingthelanguage/2012/04/2012416141630195978.html|title = New Zealand: The Maori|date = July 17, 2014|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Al Jazeera|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the United States ==
In [[Hawaii]], the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian-language]] equivalent, the [[Pūnana Leo]], has been running for 24 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/united-states/aha-p-nana-leo|title = ‘Aha Pūnana Leo|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = Cultural Survival|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been successful in producing first-language speakers of Hawaiian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ahapunanaleo.org/index.php?/about/a_timeline_of_revitalization/|title = A Timeline of Revitalization|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = Aha Punana Leo|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Minnesota]], the Enweyang Ojibwe Language Nest, started in 2009. In collaboration with UMD's College of Education and Human Services Professionals and Eni-gikendaasoyang, the Center for Indigenous Knowledge and [[Language revitalization|Language Revitalization]], the program targets 4-5 year olds in a half day session in the [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://d.umn.edu/external-affairs/homepage/10/languagenest.html|title=Enweyang Ojibwe Language Nest|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Minnesota Duluth|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[North Dakota]], Lakȟól’yapi Wahóȟpi, the Lakota Language Immersion Nest, opened on September 12, 2012. Full day schooling aimed at 3-year olds, with parents also receiving training to encourage at home efforts is key to this program. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lastrealindians.com/lakota-language-immersion-nest/|title=Lakota Language Immersion Nest|date=2012-09-10|work=Last Real Indians|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Australia ==
In August 2009, the [[Australian government]] pledged to pilot language nests as part of its National Indigenous Languages Policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gov.au/indigenous/languages_policy|title=Indigenous Languages Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of five Aboriginal language and culture nests in [[New South Wales]] launched in 2013, although these are government service delivery centres and not immersion pre-schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theconversation.com/language-nests-a-way-to-revive-indigenous-languages-at-risk-19824|title = Language Nests: a way to revive Indigenous languages at risk|date = November 12, 2013|accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = The Conversation|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Aboriginal Language and Culture Nests - Aboriginal Affairs|url = http://www.aboriginalaffairs.nsw.gov.au/aboriginal-language-and-culture-nests/|accessdate = 2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Miriwoong]] Language Nest has been running in [[Kununurra]] since early 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://soundcloud.com/abcwa/theyre-just-so-proud-to-see-their-grandchildren-learning-their-language|title = They're just so proud to see their grandchildren learning their language|date = |accessdate = March 30, 2015|website = |publisher = ABC Kimberley|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with over 300 children attending per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mirima.org.au/language-nest.html|title = Language Nest|date = |accessdate = March 30, 2015|website = |publisher = Mirima Dawang Woorlab-gerring Language and Culture Centre|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Canada ==
A study in 2004 reported on two language nests in British Columbia: a ''Cseyseten'' ("language nest") at [[Adam’s Lake]] in the [[Secwepemc]] language, and a ''Clao7alcw'' ("Raven’s nest") at [[Lil’wat Nation]] in the [[Lillooet language|Lil’wat]] language written about by [[Onowa McIvor]] for her Master's thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fpcc.ca/files/PDF/language-nest-programs_in_BC.pdf|title = Language Nest programs in BC (MA Thesis)|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = |last = McIvor|first = Onowa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Peoples' Cultural Council]] in Canada provides grants to [[First Nations]] communities in [[British Columbia]] as part of the Pre-School Language Nest Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fpcc.ca/language/Programs/Language-nest.aspx|title = Pre-School Language Nest Program|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = |publisher = First People's Cultural Council|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Northwest Territories]], there are language nests for each of the official Aboriginal languages, with more than 20 language nests in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ece.gov.nt.ca/early-childhood-and-school-services/early-childhood/language-nests|title = Language Nests|date = |accessdate = March 28, 2015|website = Northwest Territories: Education, Culture, and Employment|publisher = Government of the Northwest Territories|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Estonia==

There is only one language nest for [[Võro language|Võro]] working three days a week in [[Haanja]] and several initiatives, so called "language nest days" (''keelepesäpäiv'') that are working one day in week in 18 different kindergartens of Võro area. Võro language nest initiatives are organised by [[Võro Institute]].

==In Finland==

There are language nests for [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sámi]], [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]], and the Karelian languages in Finland.

[[File:Loesje ukraine.jpg|thumb|UKRAINE&lt;br&gt;WHEN DEMOCRACY ISN'T WORKING&lt;br&gt;PEOPLE ARE]]

'''Loesje''' ({{IPAc-en|'|l|uː|ʃ|ə}}; {{IPA-nl|ˈluʃə|lang}}) is an international [[free speech]] [[organisation]] started in [[Arnhem]] ([[Netherlands]]) in 1983 and went international in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/page/3661  This is Loesje]&lt;/ref&gt; Its charter is to spread creativity, positive criticism, ideas, philosophical ponderings and thoughts on current events by way of short slogans on [[poster]]s. The posters are signed by Loesje, which is a Dutch female name, representing "a world wide collective of people who want to make the world a more positive creative place".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/page/3661  This is Loesje]&lt;/ref&gt;

Loesje is currently to some extent active in over 30 countries, including [[Argentina]], [[Armenia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Belgium]], [[Spain]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]],  [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Mexico]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Nigeria]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United States|United States of America]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]. In one country it is possible to have several more or less active writing groups.

It is not clear how many active writers there are and also the number of people who decide to spread the posters that can be downloaded from the poster archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/posterarchive/advanced  Poster archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation cannot hold track of who spreads posters and where, partly because it is impossible to see how often a poster is downloaded (or printed at home)  from the website, and partly because Loesje is not responsible for any misdeeds of individuals who paste posters on places where it is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/node/3456  Sticking law]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2005 and 2013, Loesje's international headquarters were located in [[Berlin]], but since then Loesje International has moved back to Arnhem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loesje.org/contact  Address of Loesje International]&lt;/ref&gt; From there Loesje implements and coordinates many diverse international projects around the world. Loesje gives creative writing [http://www.loesje.org/page/3671  workshops], for team building for example and joins conferences about issues that connect to her values, such as this environmental conference called [http://www.loesje.org/CEI2012  Caretakers of the environment international] in 2012 in [[Maastricht]] in the Netherlands. Loesje is especially active on [[World Press Freedom Day]].

Logotherapy is based on an [[Existential therapy|existential analysis]]&lt;ref name="InstituteVienna"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=About Logotherapy|publisher=Viktor Frankl Institute Vienna|url=http://www.viktorfrankl.org/e/logotherapy.html|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on [[Kierkegaard]]'s ''[[Meaning (existential)|will to meaning]]'' as opposed to Adler's [[Nietzsche]]an doctrine of ''[[will to power]]'' or Freud's ''[[Pleasure principle (psychology)|will to pleasure]]''. Rather than power or pleasure, logotherapy is founded upon the belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name="Marshall2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maria Marshall|author2=Edward Marshall|title=Logotherapy Revisited: Review of the Tenets of Viktor E. Frankl's Logotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gnZxPpqDjUUC|accessdate=|date=4 August 2012|publisher=Ottawa Institute of Logotherapy|isbn=978-1-4781-9377-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A short introduction to this system is given in Frankl's most famous book, ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his [[Holocaust]] experience and how that experience further developed and reinforced his theories. Presently, there are a number of [[List of logotherapy institutes|logotherapy institutes]] around the world.

==Basic principles==
The notion of ''Logotherapy'' was created with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''[[logos]]'' ("reason"). Frankl’s concept is based on the premise that the primary motivational force of an individual is to find a meaning in life. The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy:
* Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
* Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
* We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.&lt;ref name="Marshall2012" /&gt;

The human spirit is referred to in several of the assumptions of logotherapy, but the use of the term spirit is not "spiritual" or "religious". In Frankl's view, the spirit is the will of the human being. The emphasis, therefore, is on the search for meaning, which is not necessarily the search for [[God]] or any other supernatural being.&lt;ref name="Marshall2012" /&gt; Frankl also noted the barriers to humanity's quest for meaning in life. He warns against "...affluence, [[hedonism]], [and] [[Economic materialism|materialism]]..." in the search for meaning.&lt;ref name="FranklInstitute"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=About Logotherapy|publisher=Viktor Frankl Institute of Logotherapy|url=http://www.logotherapyinstitute.org/About_Logotherapy.html|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Purpose in life and [[Meaning of life|meaning in life]] constructs appeared in Frankl's logotherapy writings with relation to [[existential vacuum]] and will to meaning, as well as others who have theorized about and defined [[Positive psychology|positive psychological]] functioning. Frankl observed that it may be psychologically damaging when a person's search for meaning is blocked. Positive life purpose and meaning was associated with strong religious beliefs, membership in groups, dedication to a cause, life values, and clear goals. Adult development and [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] theories include the purpose in life concept. Maturity emphasizes a clear comprehension of life's purpose, directedness, and intentionality which contributes to the feeling that life is meaningful.&lt;ref name="Adler1997"&gt;{{cite web | last = Adler | first = Nancy | authorlink = | title = Purpose in Life | work = Psychosocial workgroup | publisher = MacArthur Foundation | date = November 1997 | url = http://www.macses.ucsf.edu/research/psychosocial/purpose.php | accessdate = 2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankl's ideas were operationalized by Crumbaugh and Maholick's Purpose in Life (PIL) test, which measures an individual's meaning and purpose in life.&lt;ref name="Adler1997" /&gt;  With the test, investigators found that meaning in life mediated the relationships between religiosity and well-being;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dufton | first = Brian | authorlink = | title = The association between religiosity and the Purpose-in-Life test: Does it reflect purpose or satisfaction? | journal = Journal of Psychology and Theology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–48 | publisher = Biola University | date = Spring 1986 | url = http://journals.biola.edu/jpt/volumes/14/issues/1/articles/42|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; uncontrollable stress and substance use; depression and self-derogation.&lt;ref name="Adler1997" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Harlow | first = Lisa L. | authorlink = |author2=Newcomb, Michael D. |author3=Bentler, P.

While the PIL measures the presence of meaning, the SONG measures orientation towards meaning. A low score in the PIL but a high score in the SONG, would predict a better outcome in the application of Logotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Crumbaugh | first = James C. | authorlink = | title = The seeking of noetic goals test (SONG): A complementary scale to the purpose in life test (PIL) | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 900–907 | publisher = Wiley | location = | date = July 1977 | doi = 10.1002/1097-4679(197707)33:3&lt;900::AID-JCLP2270330362&gt;3.0.CO;2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovering meaning===
According to Frankl, "We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering" and that "everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms – to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances".&lt;ref name="Frankl2006" /&gt; On the meaning of suffering, Frankl gives the following example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now how could I help him? What should I tell him? I refrained from telling him anything, but instead confronted him with a question, "What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive without you?:" "Oh," he said, "for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!" Whereupon I replied, "You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it is you who have spared her this suffering; but now, you have to pay for it by surviving and mourning her." He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left the office.&lt;ref name="Frankl2006" /&gt;{{rp|178–179}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frankl emphasized that realizing the value of suffering is meaningful only when the first two creative possibilities are not available (for example, in a concentration camp) and only when such suffering is inevitable{{spaced ndash}}he was not proposing that people suffer unnecessarily.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"&gt;{{cite book|author= Frankl, Viktor|title=The Doctor and the Soul: From Psychotherapy to Logotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_qiURM2r2MC|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=12 October 1986|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-394-74317-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}}

==Philosophical basis of logotherapy==
Frankl described the meta-clinical implications of logotherapy in his book ''The Will to Meaning: Foundations and Applications of Logotherapy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934802526|title=The will to meaning : foundations and applications of logotherapy|last=1905-1997,|first=Frankl, Viktor E. (Viktor Emil),|isbn=9781101664025|edition= Expanded |location=New York, New York|oclc=934802526}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that there is no psychotherapy apart from the theory of man. As an existential psychologist, he inherently disagreed with the “machine model” or “rat model”, as it undermines the human quality of humans. As a neurologist and psychiatrist, Frankl developed a unique view of [[determinism]] to coexist with the three basic pillars of logotherapy (the freedom of will). Though Frankl admitted that man can never be free from every condition, such as, biological, sociological, or psychological determinants, based on his experience during his life in the Nazi concentration camps, he believed that man is “capable of resisting and braving even the worst conditions”. In doing such, man can detach from situations, himself, choose an attitude about himself, determine his own determinants, thus shaping his own character and becoming responsible for himself.&lt;ref name="Frankl1988"&gt;{{cite book|author= Frankl, Viktor|title=The Will to Meaning: Foundations and Applications of Logotherapy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5gImYTIc7BcC|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=1 September 1988|publisher=Meridian|isbn=978-0-452-01034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logotherapeutic views and treatment==

===Overcoming anxiety===
By recognizing the purpose of our circumstances, one can master anxiety. Anecdotes about this use of logotherapy are given by ''New York Times'' writer Tim Sanders, who explained how he uses its concept to relieve the stress of fellow airline travelers by asking them the purpose of their journey. When he does this, no matter how miserable they are, their whole demeanor changes, and they remain happy throughout the flight.&lt;ref name="Sanders2008"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanders|first=Tim|title=A Chatterer's Guide to Easing Anxiety|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/travel/27iht-25flier.18204176.html|accessdate=|date=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Frankl believed that the anxious individual does not understand that his anxiety is the result of dealing with a sense of “unfulfilled responsibility” and ultimately a lack of meaning.&lt;ref name="Boeree"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boeree|first=C. George|title=Viktor Frankl|publisher=Shippensburg University|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/frankl.html|year=2006|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of neurosis===
Frankl cites two neurotic pathogens: hyper-intention, a forced intention toward some end which makes that end unattainable; and hyper-reflection, an excessive attention to oneself which stifles attempts to avoid the [[neurosis]] to which one thinks oneself predisposed. Frankl identified [[anticipatory anxiety]], a fear of a given outcome which makes that outcome more likely. To relieve the anticipatory anxiety and treat the resulting neuroses, logotherapy offers [[paradoxical intention]], wherein the patient intends to do the opposite of their hyper-intended goal.

A person, then, who fears (i.e. experiences anticipatory anxiety over) not getting a good night's sleep may try too hard (that is, hyper-intend) to fall asleep, and this would hinder their ability to do so. A logotherapist would recommend, then, that the person go to bed and intentionally try not to fall asleep. This would relieve the anticipatory anxiety which kept the person awake in the first place, thus allowing them to fall asleep in an acceptable amount of time.&lt;ref name="Frankl2006" /&gt;

===Depression===
Viktor Frankl believed depression occurred at the psychological, physiological, and spiritual levels.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; At the psychological level, he believed that feelings of inadequacy stem from undertaking tasks beyond our abilities. At the physiological level, he recognized a “vital low”, which he defined as a “diminishment of physical energy”.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; Finally, Frankl believed that at the spiritual level, the depressed man faces tension between who he actually is in relation to what he should be. Frankl refers to this as the gaping abyss.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;{{rp|202}}&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; Finally Frankl suggests that if goals seem unreachable, an individual loses a sense of future and thus meaning resulting in depression.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; Thus logotherapy aims “to change the patient’s attitude toward their disease as well as toward their life as a task”.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

===Obsessive-compulsive disorder===
Frankl believed that those suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder lack the sense of completion that most other individuals possess.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; Instead of fighting the tendencies to repeat thoughts or actions, or focusing on changing the individual symptoms of the disease, the therapist should focus on “transform[ing] the neurotic’s attitude toward their neurosis”.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;{{rp|185}} Therefore, it is important to recognize that the patient is “not responsible for his obsessional ideas”, but that “he is certainly responsible for his attitude toward these ideas”.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;{{rp|188}} Frankl suggested that it is important for the patient to recognize his inclinations toward perfection as fate, and therefore, must learn to accept some degrees of uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; Ultimately, following the premise of logotherapy, the patient must eventually ignore his obsessional thoughts and find meaning in his life despite such thoughts.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;

===Schizophrenia===
Though logotherapy wasn’t intended to deal with severe disorders, Frankl believed that logotherapy could benefit even those suffering from schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; He recognized the roots of schizophrenia in physiological dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; In this dysfunction, the person with schizophrenia “experiences himself as an object” rather than as a subject.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;{{rp|208}} Frankl suggested that a person with schizophrenia could be helped by logotherapy by first being taught to ignore voices and to end persistent self-observation.&lt;ref name="Boeree"/&gt; Then, during this same period, the person with schizophrenia must be led toward meaningful activity, as “even for the schizophrenic there remains that residue of freedom toward fate and toward the disease which man always possesses, no matter how ill he may be, in all situations and at every moment of life, to the very last”.&lt;ref name="Frankl1986"/&gt;{{rp|216}}

===Terminally ill patients===
In 1977, Terry Zuehlke and John Watkins conducted a study analyzing the effectiveness of logotherapy in treating terminally ill patients. The study’s design used 20 male Veterans Administration volunteers who were randomly assigned to one of two possible treatments – (1) group that received 8-45 minute sessions over a 2 week period and (2) group used as control that received delayed treatment. Each group was tested on 5 scales – the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory|MMPI K Scale]], MMPI L Scale, Death Anxiety Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Purpose of Life Test. The results showed an overall significant difference between the control and treatment groups. While the univariate analyses showed that there were significant group differences in 3/5 of the dependent measures. These results confirm the idea that terminally ill patients can benefit from logotherapy in coping with death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zuehlke|first=T.E.|author2=Watkins, J.T. |title=Psychotherapy with Terminally Ill Patients|journal=Psychotherapy, Therapy, Research, and Practice|year=1977|volume=14|issue=4|pages=403–410|doi=10.1037/h0087512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{See also|Psychotherapy#General critiques}}

===Authoritarianism===
In 1969 [[Rollo May]] argued that logotherapy is, in essence, [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]]. He suggested that Frankl’s therapy presents a plain solution to all of life’s problems, an assertion that would seem to undermine the complexity of human life itself. May contended that if a patient could not find his own meaning, Frankl would provide a goal for his patient. In effect, this would negate the patient’s personal responsibility, thus “diminish[ing] the patient as a person”.&lt;ref name="May1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rollo May|title=Existential psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BWRZHZrR4IYC|accessdate=21 May 2012|year=1969|publisher=Random House|page=42}} (First Edition 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankl explicitly replied to May’s arguments through a written dialogue, sparked by Rabbi [[Reuven Bulka]]’s article “Is Logotherapy Authoritarian?”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bulka | first =Reuven P. | title = Is Logotherapy Authoritarian? | journal = Journal of Humanistic Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 45–54 | date = Fall 1978 | doi =10.1177/002216787801800406  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frankl responded that he combined the prescription of medication, if necessary, with logotherapy, to deal with the person's psychological and emotional reaction to the illness, and highlighted areas of freedom and responsibility, where the person is free to search and to find meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Frankl | first =Viktor | title = Reply to Rollo May | journal = Journal of Humanistic Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 85–86 | date = Fall 1979 | doi =10.1177/002216787901900410 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religiousness===
Critical views of the life of logotherapy's founder and his work assume that Frankl's religious background and experience of suffering guided his conception of meaning within the boundaries of the person&lt;ref name="Pytell 2006 490–503"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pytell|first=T.|title=Transcending the Angel Beast: Viktor Frankl and Humanistic Psychology|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|year=2006|volume=23|issue=3|pages=490–503|doi=10.1037/0736-9735.23.3.490}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore that logotherapy is founded on Viktor Frankl's worldview.&lt;ref name="Pytell 2007 641–657"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pytell|first=T.|title=Extreme Experience, Psychological Insight, and Holocaust Perception: Reflections on Bettelheim and Frankl|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|year=2007|volume=24|issue=4|pages=641–657|doi=10.1037/0736-9735.24.4.641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frankl openly spoke and wrote on religion and psychiatry, throughout his life, and specifically in his last book, ''Man’s Search for Ultimate Meaning'' (1997). He asserted that every person has a spiritual unconscious, independently of religious views or beliefs, yet Frankl's conception of the spiritual unconscious does not necessarily entail religiosity. In Frankl's words: “It is true, Logotherapy, deals with the Logos; it deals with Meaning. Specifically, I see Logotherapy in helping others to see meaning in life. But we cannot “give” meaning to the life of others. And if this is true of meaning per se, how much does it hold for Ultimate Meaning?”&lt;ref name="Frankl2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frankl, Viktor|title=Man's search for ultimate meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hcQAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=10 May 2012|date=10 August 2000|publisher=Perseus Pub.|isbn=978-0-7382-0354-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychiatric Association]] awarded Viktor Frankl the 1985 [[Oskar Pfister Award]] (for important contributions to religion and psychiatry).&lt;ref name="Frankl2000"/&gt;

===Origins===
On Frankl's doctrine that one must instill meaning in the events in ones life, that work and suffering to find meaning, will ultimately lead to fulfillment and happiness. In 1982 the highly cited scholar and holocaust analyst [[Lawrence L. Langer]], who while also critical of Frankl's distortions on the true experience of those at Auschwitz,&lt;ref&gt;[Suicide Prohibition: The Shame of Medicine
By Thomas Szasz. pg 60-62]&lt;/ref&gt; and Frankl's amoral focus on "meaning" that could just as equally be applied to Nazis "finding meaning in making the world free from Jews",&lt;ref&gt;[Suicide Prohibition: The Shame of Medicine By Thomas Szasz pg 62]&lt;/ref&gt; Langer would go on to write: "If this [logotherapy] doctrine had been more succinctly worded, the Nazis might have substituted it for the cruel mockery of [[Arbeit Macht Frei]] [the sign chosen to be placed over the entry to Auschwitz]".&lt;ref&gt;[Lawrence Langer, Versions of Survival: The Holocaust and the Human Spirit (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1982), p.24. [End Page 107]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A biographer of Frankl would later remark on the penetrating insight of Langer's reading of Frankl's holocaust testimony, with Langer's criticism published in 1982 before ther biographer's research, the former had thus drawn the controversial parallels, or accommodations in ideology without the knowledge that Victor Frankl was an advocate/"embraced"&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Lives
By Günter Bischof pg 241-242&lt;/ref&gt; the key ideas of the [[Matthias Goring|Nazi psychotherapy]] movement ("will and responsibility"&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Frankl's Search for Meaning: An Emblematic 20th-Century Life
By Timothy Pytell pg 70-72, 111&lt;/ref&gt;) as a form of therapy in the late 1930s. When at that time Frankl would submit a paper and contributed to the [[Matthias Göring|Göring institute]] in Vienna 1937 and again in early 1938 connecting the logotherapy focus on "world-view" to the "work of some of the leading Nazi psychotherapists",&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Lives
By Günter Bischof pg 242&lt;/ref&gt; both at a time before [[Anschluss|Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938]].&lt;ref&gt;Austrian Lives By Günter Bischof p.255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/article/43137#REF104 "What is perhaps most impressive about Langer's reading is that he was unaware of Frankl's 1937 article promoting a form of psychotherapy palatable to the Nazis".]&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of logotherapy, as described by Frankl, were therefore a major issue of continuity that Biographer Pytell argues were potentially problematic for Frankl because he had laid out the main elements of logotherapy while working for/contributing to the Nazi-affiliated Göring Institute. Principally Frankl's 1937 paper, that was published by the institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/article/43137#REF104 "What is perhaps most impressive about Langer's reading is that he was unaware of Frankl's 1937 article promoting a form of psychotherapy palatable to the Nazis".]&lt;/ref&gt; This association, as a source of controversy, that logotherapy was palatable to [[National Socialism]] is the reason Pytell suggests, Frankl took two different stances on how the concentration-camp experience affected the course of his psychotherapy theory. Namely, that within the original English edition of Frankl's most well known book, ''Man's Search for Meaning'', the suggestion is made and still largely held that logotherapy was itself derived from his camp experience, with the claim as it appears in the original edition, that this form of psychotherapy was "not concocted in the philosopher's armchair nor at the analyst's couch; it took shape in the hard school of air-raid shelters and bomb craters; in concentration camps and prisoner of war camps." Frankl's statements however to this effect would be deleted from later editions, though in the 1963 edition, a similar statement again appeared on the back of the book jacket of ''Man's Search for Meaning''. Frankl over the years would switch between the claim that logotherapy took shape in the camps to the claim that the camps merely justified his already preconceived theories, as the definitive word on the matter, in 1977 Frankl himself began to clarify the controversy stating "People think I came out of Auschwitz with a brand-new psychotherapy. This is not the case."&lt;ref&gt;["http://muse.jhu.edu/article/43137 Redeeming the Unredeemable:Auschwitz and Man's Search for Meaning, Timothy E. Pytell, California State University. Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Volume 17, Number 1, Spring 2003 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul T. P.

New York, NY: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; This extension not only integrates meaning therapy with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[positive psychotherapy]], but also connects meaning therapy with the [[positive psychology]] research on meaning. Another new development is the application of logotherapy to palliative care.&lt;ref&gt;Breitbart, W. S. &amp; Poppet, S. R. (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3129">The main components of automobile exhaust are [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and  water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Carbon dioxide is the most important [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) and the most significant [[Greenhouse Gas]] emitted in the U.S. (with 82-84% of all U.S. emissions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html July 1999 SBC Newsletter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427125401/http://www.greenbuilder.com/sbc/newsletters/99july.html |date=2007-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in carbon dioxide concentration are due primarily to [[fossil fuel]] use and [[land-use]] change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]], ''{{cite web|url= http://www.20minutos.es/data/adj/2007/02/02/456.pdf |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(2.20&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}}'' .&lt;/ref&gt;

The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission standards can be referred to the [[fuel]] or to the [[vehicle]] :

*The [[European Union]] is moving towards fuel mandatory CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; standards and USA has reflected it in the [[Greenhouse Gas Score]].
*There are information, but no mandatory, standards for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; limits in vehicle (engine) emissions, excepting some state regulations (i.e. California). See [[hybrid vehicles]].

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mass emission in vehicles is measured in '''g/km''' (g/[[mile|mi]] * 0.621371192 = g/km).

== Low carbon fuel standard ==
Transportation accounts for forty percent of California's annual [[greenhouse gas emission]]s, and California relies on [[petroleum-based fuel]]s for 96 percent of its transportation needs.

The [[Californian Governor]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] issued an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] in January 2007 for California adopt a [[Low-carbon fuel standard|Low-Carbon Fuel Standard]] (LCFS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ca.gov/index.php?/press-release/5074|title= Gov. Schwarzenegger Issues Directive to Establish World's First Low Carbon Standard for Transportation Fuels|publisher=Press Release by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger#Governor of California|Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger]] |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LCFS requires [[oil refinery|oil refineries]] to ensure that the mix of fuel they sell in the California Market meets, on average, a declining target for [[greenhouse gas]] emissions measured in [[carbon dioxide equivalent|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalent]] grams per unit of fuel energy sold. By 2020, the LCFS will produce a '''10 %''' reduction in carbon intensity from production and use of transport fuels in California.&lt;ref name="CARB01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/fuels/lcfs/lcfs.htm|title=Low-Carbon Fuel Standard Program|publisher=[[California Air Resources Board]]|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support the [[AUTOSAR]] (AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture) standard (AUTOSAR is a [[standardized]] [[automotive software]] architecture)
* Develop the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]] standardized interface

The MODELISAR project started in 2008 , ended Dec 2011 to define the [[Functional Mock-up Interface]] specifications, deliver technology studies, prove the FMI concepts through Use Cases elaborated by the consortium partners and enable tool vendors to build advanced prototypes or in some cases even products.
MODELISAR has been awarded during ITEA 2 &amp; ARTEMIS co summit with a Silver award. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20120905081532/http://www.itea2.org/cosummit2012_achievementaward ITEA 2 achievement award]

Although in MODELISAR the focus was driven by automotive Use Cases, the FMI specifications could be independently defined. Therefore the FMI can now address others industrial domains such as Energy, Aerospace, Rail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13416">'''Management due diligence''' is the process of appraising a company's [[senior management]]—evaluating each individual's effectiveness in contributing to the organization's [[Strategic management|strategic objectives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Audit|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/management-audit.asp|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assessing company management is crucial when closing business deals. It can mean the difference between long-term success or sudden failure. It also helps the organisation understand how the teams perform their roles in context with the company's future business plan. This helps clarify the structure of the organisation's work-force.&lt;ref name="Best practice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Best practice guideline- Due Diligence|url=http://www.crelos.com/assets/Human-capital-due-diligence-the-assessment-and-development-of-management-teams.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="good manager"&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes a good manager|url=http://www.mas.org.uk/management-advisory-service/what-makes-a-good-manager.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The management due diligence process can be identified as an informative tool for external stakeholders, and can also be referred to as Management Assessment as it addresses the team’s dynamics and highlight the risks.&lt;ref name=Assessment&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessment and development- Management Due Diligence|url=http://www.ashleyhoyle.co.uk/leadership_development_consulting/due_diligence_management.aspx|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management assessment ==

Management assessment usually focuses on assessing the leadership skills and characteristics of the organisation's managers—such as the ability to adjust to a changing environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior management|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/senior-management.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communicate effectively with other individuals. These characteristics are key points in successful leaders.&lt;ref name="good manager"/&gt;

A leader must consider all factors concerning a strategic decision, such as possible effects on employees and customers. Engaging employees and customers in the decision process helps build better relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Five characteristics of great leaders|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3004914/5-characteristics-great-leaders|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transactions that require management due diligence==
Companies typically apply the due diligence process when they are about to engage in a major transaction with another company—such as selling or purchasing products or services, or buying (merging with or acquiring) the other company.&lt;ref name="What is"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Due Diligence and how do you perform it?|url=http://www.businessknowhow.com/money/duediligence.htm|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some transactions require a due diligence report that includes managements.&lt;ref name=Meaning&gt;{{cite web|title=Meaning of due diligence|url=http://www.jsandco.in/Uploaded%20Image/Due%20diligence.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transactions that might require managerial assessments include:

=== Mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances ===
Organizations considering a merger, acquisition or alliance should perform due diligence. This due diligence should investigate the other party's management team. Many mergers and acquisitions fail because of human resources and management-related issues, such as cultural clashes. These incidents occur because of different cultural values or different individual beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merger Due Diligence- The devil in details|url=http://www.workforce.com/articles/merger-due-diligence-the-devil-in-the-details|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid such incidents, and cut costs on the long run, management teams must be assessed thoroughly.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

=== Partnerships ===
Before organizations signs a partnership contract, they must investigate the other organization’s matters and affiliations, organizational structures, and behaviors. A management due diligence process achieves this.

=== Joint ventures and collaborations ===
When forming a relationship with another organizations, management due diligence helps an organization introduce  management structure the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

=== Management due diligence's responsibility ===
Not only buyers carry out management due diligence, but also sellers of an organization. Usually, the process of selling an organization or adopting any external growth strategies requires the sharing of warranties. These warranties require private information from the organization—possibly including information and activities that they must shield from the view of third parties. In this case, the seller should carry out due diligence to ensure secure data.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;

==Importance==
Management due diligence ensures sustainable profit and growth for organisations, as it identifies the human capital components. It ensures that highly skilled people are assigned the correct jobs and responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; It increases the chance of a good return on investment by reducing risk.&lt;ref name=Assessment/&gt;

Management due diligence identifies strengths and weaknesses of individuals in the management team and assesses their contributions to the organisation.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; It assesses management team members' abilities to reach common goals.&lt;ref name=Firefly&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Due Diligence|url=http://www.fireflypartners.co.uk/mngmentduediligence.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It identifies undiscovered dangers that eventually affect productivity. These might include unacknowledged motives or personal conflicts between individuals in management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence- The management team aspect: who's driving your company|url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=803|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps organizations efficiently appraise candidates for a management team position.&lt;ref name=Firefly/&gt;

Management due diligence gives an organization a basis for expectations for team and individual performance. Accordingly, the organization can determine whether managers need training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Performance appraisal for teams|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/reference-materials/historical/teams.pdf|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
Since management due diligence lies in the financial analysis of a due diligence report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence|url=http://www.icaew.com/en/members/business-resources/business-management-and-strategy/m-and-a/types-of-due-diligence|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the same process as creating a due diligence report with few variations. 

===Preparation===
Preparation is key to an effective management due diligence process. In this phase, organizations gain sufficient knowledge about other organizations. This helps them decide on communication methods between them and other entities, in addition to putting resources in place to promote a successful process.  After settling those issues, the organization must:

''Form a team for the analysis process'' from skilled people with enough experience. After forming the team, the organization assigns responsibilities and settles on a process timeline. The organization may fill gaps in expertise by hiring or contracting external people.

''Involve managers'' as early as possible''' as they must get to know the other organization's management team. Early introductions help managers deal with later obstacles.

''Create checklists'' tailored to particular risks associated with the other organization.

''Prepare a list of data requests'' for the information an organization needs to complete the process.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt;  Such data could include the business plan's management team section,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence information request|url=http://www.stevensonco.com/documents/Due-Diligence-Information-Request-Sample.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or management organizational structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sample Due Diligence request list|url=http://www.theventurealley.com/files/2013/08/Sample-due-diligence-request-list-Trent-Dykes.pd_1.pdf|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''After negotiations, have both parties sign a confidentiality report'' to protect sensitive data from third parties. Agree on a method to store all confidential data—for example, an online data repository&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt; that both parties can view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Data Room|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/Virtual_Data_Room.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution===
In this phase the organization begins analyzing gathered data. The team tries to confirm the target's representations and "soft" aspects of the target, such as its corporate culture. The team must make sure the other organization fits with its own after assessing their management quality. After gathering all the information, the team advises on whether their organization should continue to work with the other organization.

===Closure===
After the team finishes analyzing the management team, they submit a report to the final decision makers. If the team exposes irregularities or unexpected risks, the organization can bid on contract changes. If everything passes the assessment, team members switch to integration planning.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt;

==Aspects==
By performing management due diligence to assess the individuals working in an organization, different aspects must be appraised. The diagram outlines the main aspects that must be evaluated. The four circles in the middle represent the basic qualities that are considered essential for an individual assessment. The bigger circle "Role" represents the duties of the individuals in a certain organization. These duties usually vary from one individual to another depending on the job description of that individual. The biggest circle representing the employing organization is located in a market, making it easy to get affected by various external factors.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt; These external factors are capable of hindering the organization from achieving its strategic goals and long-term objectives, making this a challenge that has to be dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External Factors|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/external-factors.html|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the individual assessment to be precise and accurate, it must be done after the organization's requirements have been highlighted and responsibilities of each individual are clear. Having such knowledge helps the business organization overcome future challenges and move closer to strategic objectives.&lt;ref name="Best practice"/&gt;

==Key points==
Management due diligence needs:
*Clear, defined objectives—set expectations in terms of management styles and qualities in individuals
* Commitment—assess whether management resources can make the business succeed.&lt;ref name=Meaning/&gt;
* Assess strengths—recognize strengths of individual members to use them effectively
The management team is an asset to any organisation,&lt;ref name="most important"&gt;{{cite web|title=The most important assets are not on the balance sheet|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2010/09/the-most-important-assets-are-not-on-the-balance-sheet/|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations and drawbacks==

To assure reliable data, both investor and individuals under assessment must be involved in the feedback process. This can be costly and time-consuming to both parties. Since due diligence can be a detective game, organizations must find individuals who can detect small issues and opportunities. Organizations sometimes bring in outside experts.&lt;ref name="Main steps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence: Main steps and success factors|url=http://www.gecapital.eu/en/docs/GE_Capital_Overview_Due_Diligence.pdf|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expense of the due diligence process, and the time involved, can be softened by dividing it into two stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PRELIMINARY DUE DILIGENCE (This is the 9th article in the series on M&amp;A) |url=http://businessthinker.com/preliminary-due-diligence-this-is-the-8th-article-in-the-series-on-ma/|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Due Diligence in mergers and acquisition|url=http://www.accountingcpd.net/Due_Diligence_in_Mergers_and_Acquisitions_by_Peter_Howson|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Executives may be so interested in a deal that they ignore identified risks and move ahead—and later suffer from management issues.&lt;ref name="Main steps"/&gt; 
Information gathering can involve interviewing the management team, but the team may see them as expensive and time-consuming.&lt;ref name="What is"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interviews|url=http://compass.port.ac.uk/UoP/file/d8a7aedc-be56-461b-85e8-ae38ccf49670/1/Interviews_IMSLRN.zip/page_03.htm|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People doing the analysis might not be familiar with the organization's sector, which can lead to wrong conclusions.&lt;ref name="most important"/&gt;

In [[Finland]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is a '''mandatory school subject''' for [[Finnish language|Finnish]]-speaking pupils in the last four years of the [[Education in Finland|primary education]] (grades 6 to 9). This so-called ''other domestic language'' is also mandatory in [[high school]]s, [[vocational school]]s, and [[vocational university|vocational universities]]. Furthermore, all university graduates must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in Swedish (the so-called ''public servant's Swedish''). Altogether 89% of Finnish citizens are native Finnish speakers, whereas 5.3% of the population report Swedish as their mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161013132323/http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_vaesto_en.html Swedophone population]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it is possible for Finnish citizens to report a different mother tongue for themselves at any time, and as many times as desired, by submitting a form to the Population Register Center.

According to the [[Constitution of Finland|Finnish constitution]], both [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are national languages. The employees of the national government and the bilingual municipal governments are required to be able to serve citizens in Swedish. Military service is not required in the autonomous region of [[Åland]]. The official term for both mandatory Swedish and Finnish is ''the other domestic language''. However, the requirement to study Swedish is often referred to as ''pakkoruotsi'', a somewhat charged term in Finnish meaning "mandatory Swedish", or "enforced Swedish".

== Overview ==
The status of Swedish as a national language in Finland is defined by the Finnish constitution. There was migration of Swedish-speaking peasants to some Finnish coastal areas during the Middle Ages. During this period, when Finland was ruled by Sweden, Swedish language became part of the culture in the coastal areas. Swedish was also the language of the ruling class. The Finnish language was forbidden an official status alongside Swedish until the period of [[Russian Empire|Russian rule]] (1809–1917), in 1860. The autonomous [[Åland Islands]] (pop. 26,000, 95% Swedish, 5% Finnish) has only one official language, Swedish, and the speaking of Finnish between employees is forbidden in some public services.

In [[Mainland Finland]] both official languages, Finnish and Swedish, are mandatory subjects for pupils in [[Primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools. The Swedish test of the [[Abitur|Matriculation Examination]] was made voluntary in 2004, although all university graduates must demonstrate that their skills in the other official language meet the standard required of all academically educated public servants. Usually this means the completion of a so-called ''public servant's Swedish'' test. The Swedish language is also one of the main agendas of the [[Swedish People's Party (Finland)|Swedish People's Party]] that has been a minor partner in most [[Cabinet of Finland|Cabinets]] since Finland's independence, and in all Cabinets between 1972 and 2015.

Supporters of Mandatory Swedish argue that it brings Finland closer to the [[Nordic countries]], since Swedish is quite similar to, and to some extent [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with, both [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], while Finnish belongs to the unrelated [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]] group. Supporters also say that studying Swedish makes it easier to learn other [[Germanic languages]], such as English and German. Lastly, they argue, mandatory Swedish is necessary to ensure that Swedish-speakers can interact with governmental institutions and get service, such as health care, in their own mother tongue.

== History ==
{{Main|Finland's language strife}}
The area that today is Finland was an integral part of [[Sweden proper]] from the Middle Ages to the end of the [[Finnish War]] in 1809. Swedish migrants settled in coastal areas, and the language of administration was Swedish. This prompted many Finnish-speakers to learn Swedish in hopes of improving their social status, and some switched to Swedish altogether.

As a result of the Finnish War, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, and the Russian tsar established the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. Although a Governor-General was installed by the Russians as the highest authority within the Grand Duchy, much of the political system remained the same: Finland was allowed to keep its ”laws, religion and language” from the Swedish time. The tsar wanted to avoid trouble in the new territory and also used former Swedish upper class to further modernisation in Russia; Finnish was not an option at that time as official language, as the administration did not know Finnish well enough and the language was undeveloped regarding such use.

When Finland became autonomous there was a big interest in creating a new national identity. There was an immense interest in the Finnish language and Finnish culture in the mostly Swedish speaking upper class. At some point the [[Fennoman]] movement arose, that thought that the country should be a united [[nationalism|nation]], with only one language, and, as a reaction, the [[Svecoman]] movement, that was afraid that abandoning Swedish would lead to [[slavicisation]] or worse.

However, during the 1860s, under Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], it was decided that legal equality between Finnish and Swedish as languages of administration was to be gradually introduced. Thus since the late 19th century Finnish has been a co-official language of administration in Finland. Modernizations typical for the era in Europe were introduced, boosting the status of the Finnish-speaking majority: the special rights of the higher [[estates of the realm]] were abolished, a modern parliament based on [[universal suffrage]] was introduced 1907 and in 1917 Finland became independent.

In the current form, mandatory Swedish was implemented as a part of the modernisation of the [[Education in Finland|educational system]] in the 1970s. Previously, a Swedish test had been compulsory on university level and in ''oppikoulu'', a secondary school that was a prerequisite to matriculation to a university, but not in the common ''kansakoulu''. The introduction of the ''peruskoulu'' (student ages 7–15), compulsory for all children, introduced a course in Swedish compulsory to all pupils, while Swedish courses and standardized tests at higher levels remained compulsory. This was motivated by the possibility that any student could become a public official and would thus be required to know Swedish.

== Current situation ==
A compulsory introductory course to Swedish for all pupils in [[primary education]] was introduced in the 1960s as a part of modernization of the primary education system, where the nine-year school (''peruskoulu, grundskola'') was made universally compulsory. Until then there had been mandatory courses only in [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[tertiary education]]. Administrative services have, since the end of the 19th century, been offered in both domestic languages; therefore, theoretically employees should be proficient in both Finnish and Swedish. The reform was to some extent based on a political ambition to strengthen the ties with [[Western world|the Western world]] through Scandinavia, and to show that Finland was a part of the [[Nordic countries]], and not an [[Eastern Bloc]] country. It also sought to improve social mobility by ensuring that a decision on language in the early school years would not become an obstacle for applicants to the civil service.

In the [[secondary education|upper secondary general school]] all the students learn at least two languages besides their mother tongue, one of which is the other domestic language, except for people studying some other language as mother tongue (e.g. immigrants and those studying [[Sami languages|Sami]]). Finnish speakers take Swedish, and vice versa. According to [[Statistics Finland]], practically all the students take [[English language|English]], either as a compulsory or an optional language. There is also a possibility to take one or more extra foreign languages. Despite Finland being a neighbour of Russia, Russian is not taught in most schools of Finland, and only 1.5% of Finns know some Russian. The hindrances are cultural and political, as there has been relatively little cultural exchange between the Finns and Russians in the 20th century, and Finland's relations with the Soviet Union were hostile from the [[Finnish Civil War]] (1918) until [[World War II]] (1939–1944).

The arrangement of "mandatory Swedish and practically-mandatory English" has been criticized, because it reduces the diversity of the language skills of the population.&lt;ref&gt; Hult, F.M., &amp; Pietikäinen, S. (2014). Shaping discourses of multilingualism through a language ideological debate: The case of Swedish in Finland. ''Journal of Language and Politics'', 13, 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The EU target is to teach two foreign languages. As English is an overwhelmingly popular choice, it has been suggested by, for example, the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]] that keeping Swedish compulsory directly prevents choosing other languages, such as Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EK: Pakkoruotsista luovuttava valintamahdollisuuksien lisäämiseksi |first=Liiten |last=Marjukka |newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat |date=June 1, 2010 |url=http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013131532/http://www.hs.fi/paivanlehti/arkisto/ |archivedate=October 13, 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of studies into opinions regarding mandatory Swedish have been made with various results. The big differences between studies exemplifies the problems in conducting a neutral and broad study without asking [[leading question]]s on the particular subject. Furthermore, some of the studies have been commissioned by organizations that have politically partisan views on the subject of mandatory Swedish.

Between 1990 and 2003 Taloustutkimus Oy conducted a series of more than ten surveys for [[Association of Finnish Culture and Identity|Suomalaisuuden liitto]], an organisation opposing mandatory Swedish. According to these surveys, 66–72% of Finns were "in favour of voluntary Swedish education or against mandatory Swedish education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suomalaisuudenliitto.fi/ruotsi.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207045737/http://www.suomalaisuudenliitto.fi/ruotsi.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2004 |title=Mandatory Swedish |df= }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suomen Gallup]]'s 2003 survey concluded that while a small majority supported "compulsory second domestic language studying", it was opposed by 42% of Finns while 25% did not want both Finnish and Swedish to be official languages of Finland. This study was commissioned by [[Yle]], the Finnish publicly funded national broadcasting company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suomen Gallupin tutkimus 2003 |url=http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2003/02/157245 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430083604/http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2003/02/157245 |archivedate=April 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The question posed to those surveyed was very verbose in comparison to the Taloustutkimus surveys on the same subject. The question did not include the word "Swedish".{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

In 1992 a study by ''Valitut Palat'' (the Finnish edition of ''[[Reader's Digest]]'') concluded that 90 percent of the parents of third to fourth grade pupils "supported a reduction of compulsory languages" (only Finnish and Swedish are compulsory). When ''Valitut Palat'' did a new survey in 2003 it found 64% opposing mandatory Swedish, and 25% not wanting to have two official languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-fi.valitutpalat.fi/lehti/tiedotteet/20000824a.html Valittujen Palojen tutkimus 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928020523/http://www-fi.valitutpalat.fi/lehti/tiedotteet/20000824a.html |date=2007-09-28 }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement|IEA]] study (2000) revealed that 67% of young people studying in Finnish-speaking schools wanted to make Swedish a voluntary subject. The most politically aware youths were the most critical against Swedishness in this study.&lt;ref&gt;IEA/Civic Education Study: [http://www.jyu.fi/ktl/civicsIII/SaSuKolm.htm Nuorten käsityksiä Ruotsista ja ruotsalaisuudesta] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105175621/http://www.jyu.fi/ktl/civicsIII/SaSuKolm.htm |date=2006-01-05 }} {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt; {{Link language|sv}}&lt;!--Swedish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 1997 by [[Folktinget]], an official consultative organisation representing Finland's Swedish-speakers, concluded that 70% of the Finnish-speaking population  considered "Swedish a vital and important part of Finnish society." This study also indicated that the most negative opinions about mandatory Swedish were found among those with academic degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Vårt land, vårt språk – kahden kielen Kansa. rapport 35. {{Link language|fi}}&lt;!--Finnish--&gt; {{Link language|sv}}&lt;!--Swedish--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by Taloustutkimus for Yle in 2013 indicated that 63 percent of respondents were opposed to mandatory Swedish. Further, the study indicated that among the supporters of the different political parties, only the supporters of the Swedish People's Party and the Green League favoured retaining mandatory Swedish teaching. A majority of supporters in all the other parties wanted Swedish teaching to be voluntary – the supporters of the Finns Party and the Social Democrats were most heavily in favour of making Swedish voluntary (76 and 73 percent respectively).&lt;ref name="yle.fi"/&gt;

A study conducted by [[Åbo Akademi]] in 2014 indicated that 74 percent of Finnish speaking respondents agreed with the statement "The teaching of the Swedish language should be voluntary".&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.abo.fi/pressmaterial/sprakundersokning_Finska.pdf Tutkimus kartoitti suomalaisten mielipiteitä ruotsin kielestä], Åbo Akademi 22 December 2014, accessed 22 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==
[[Image:Pois pakkoruotsi.svg|thumb|"Away with mandatory Swedish". &lt;br/&gt; A campaign logo against mandatory Swedish.&lt;br/&gt;The character on the logo throws away an [[Å]], a letter found in [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] words, but not in native [[Finnish alphabet|Finnish]].]]
In many cases, pupils have negative expectations and experiences of learning Swedish which may foster a negative attitude towards the Swedish language and culture. This behavior is claimed to hark back to the time when Finland was a part of Sweden (see [[Sweden–Finland]]), and Swedish was the language of prestige while Finnish was looked down on by the government. Negative opinions towards studying Swedish are also grounded in the fact that mandatory Swedish is taught throughout the country, even though there are few Swedish-speakers in [[mainland Finland]] outside the coastal area by the [[Baltic Sea]], and thus contact with Swedish-speakers is rare for most Finns. This fact can for some make the policy of bilingualism seem artificial, but the basic curriculum remains the same for the entire country.

According to a study published in 2002 students are interested in the Swedish language, and find it an important part of education, but they perceived Swedish being compulsory lessened their motivation&lt;ref name="lammi"&gt;Lammi, Kati. ''Kielisalkku motivoi ruotsin kielen opiskeluun.'' (''Language portfolio as a tool in promoting motivation in the study of Swedish at senior high school: student and teacher views and experiences.'') Dissertation at [[University of Jyväskylä]], 2002. [https://www.jyu.fi/ajankohtaista/arkisto/2002/11/tiedote-2007-09-18-15-40-42-566699/ Announcement in Finnish and abstract in English])&lt;!-- No such document at URL [http://info.adm.jyu.fi/main/portti/tiedotteet/2002/11/2469/show_announcement] --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (this argument has been made very frequently in the public debate). The experiment of making the Swedish test voluntary in the matriculation examination (the completion of which is a ''de facto'' requirement for university enrollment) was declared successful and was made permanent. The percentage of students taking the Swedish test has since been constantly dropping and was 67% in 2009 (less than 50% of boys).&lt;ref&gt;[[YLE]]: [http://svenska.yle.fi/nyheter/sok.php?id=203491&amp;lookfor=&amp;sokvariant=arkivet&amp;advanced=yes&amp;antal=10 Svenskan stadigt nedåt i studentskrivningarna]&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a lot of criticism of the methodology used to teach Swedish and the lack of competence in many of the teachers. This has contributed to students' lack of motivation to study Swedish, and many may not learn to speak the language beyond a very basic level. Some students argue that they will never need Swedish as its utility in the Finnish job market is limited to a few fields. Moreover, the rationale of mandatory tuition in Swedish and other subjects is to give the students more of a general knowledge base, and not train them for a specific field.

In addition to the direct costs of the tuition, some argue that mandatory Swedish effectively replaces elective courses in languages such as French, German and Russian, that these persons argue are more important than Swedish in a globalized world. University students are required not only to master their selected field, but also to study at least two languages beside their mother tongue, one of which is obligatorily Swedish for Finnish-speakers. As study material is often in English, this effectively removes the free choice; the two "voluntarily chosen" languages must be Swedish and English. Despite being a neighbour of Russia, it is in practice possible to study Russian only in some schools (due to low interest or it not being offered); only 1.5% of the Finns have a good knowledge of Russian. Also very few Finns speak Estonian (which is not taught in most schools), a language of the same [[Finnic languages|Finnic language group]] as Finnish, and national language of Finland's southern neighbour [[Estonia]], although Finnish is popular in Estonia.

Sentiments toward mandatory Swedish vary. Many prominent politicians (both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking) wholeheartedly support mandatory Swedish in schools, while others oppose it. There have been numerous petitions and other similar campaigns arranged by some small but dedicated organizations to pressure the lawmakers to abolish mandatory Swedish, but to date, they have had no significant impact on the established policy. Thus, while the ongoing debate is often heated and passionate, the support for mandatory Swedish tuition remains strong enough among politicians for the government not to consider a change of policy.

Mandatory Swedish is supported by most political parties in Finland, like the [[National Coalition Party]], the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]] and the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]]. The [[Finns Party]] opposes mandatory Swedish,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkisto.perussuomalaiset.fi/ohjelmat/getfile.php?file=1536 Finns Party electoral programme, 2011, s. 26-27] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928083239/http://arkisto.perussuomalaiset.fi/ohjelmat/getfile.php?file=1536 |date=2013-09-28 }}, accessed 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and so does the youth wing of the National Coalition Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kokoomusnuoret.fi/kannanotot/2013/03/kokoomusnuoret-kannattavat-vapaaehtoista-kieltenopiskelua/ Kokoomusnuoret kannattaa vapaaehtoista kieltenopiskelua] 4 March 2013, accessed 22 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Confederation of Finnish Industries]] came out in favour of making Swedish teaching voluntary. They referred to a study which indicated that in the future Swedish will be only the tenth most important language to Finnish companies, when they are considering the language skills of their potential employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/artikkeli/elinkeinoelama-ajaa-pakkoruotsin-poistoa---tulevaisuudessa-tarvitaan-portugalia-/1904284 Elinkeinoelämä ajaa pakkoruotsin poistoa – tulevaisuudessa tarvitaan portugalia], MTV Uutiset 13 August 2013, accessed 23 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hufvudstadsbladet]], the Confederation has subsequently changed their stance and no longer favours making Swedish voluntary, while maintaining the need for learning other languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbl.fi/opinion/ledare/2014-11-14/681976/valkommen-kursandring-om-svenskan-av-ek Välkommen kursändring om svenskan av EK], Hufvudstadsbladet November 14, 2014, accessed 29 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Parliament of Finland===
In the 2000s the government dropped the requirement to take Swedish (or Finnish in the case of the Swedish-speaking minority) as part of the high school [[Abitur#Abitur in Finland|matriculation examination]].

In 2014 a citizens' initiative demanding an end to mandatory Swedish teaching on all levels of education was brought to the Finnish Parliament. In 2015 the MPs voted, 134 to 48, to keep mandatory Swedish. In another vote the MPs voted, 93 to 89, to demand that the government should examine, whether a regional experimentation, where another language would be taught instead of Swedish, is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/ruotsi_sailyy_pakollisena__ita-suomeen_mahdollisuus_kielikokeiluun/7850273 Ruotsi säilyy pakollisena – Itä-Suomeen mahdollisuus kielikokeiluun?], YLE 6 March 2015, accessed 6 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1417">'''Material monism''' is a [[Presocratic]] belief which provides an explanation of the physical world by saying that all of the world's objects are composed of a single element. Among the material monists were the three Milesian philosophers: [[Thales]], who believed that everything was composed of water; [[Anaximander]], who believed it was ''[[apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]''; and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], who believed it was air.&lt;ref&gt;Curd, Patricia, ''A Presocratics Reader: Selected Fragments and Testimonia'' ([[Hackett Publishing]], 1996), pp. 9, 11 &amp; 14.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first and last of these thinkers, however, that element was infused by mind, so it would be a mistake to call them material monists.

Although their theories were primitive, these philosophers were the first to give an explanation of the physical world without referencing the supernatural; this opened the way for much of modern science (and philosophy), which has the same goal of explaining the world without dependence on the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David C., ''The Beginnings of Western Science'' ([[University of Chicago Press]], 2010), pp. 28–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meta''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]]&lt;!--[[preposition]] and [[prefix]]--&gt; ''[[wikt:meta-|meta-]]'' μετά- meaning "after" or "beyond") is a prefix used in [[English language|English]] to indicate a concept which is an [[abstraction]] behind another concept, used to complete or add to the latter.

==Original Greek meaning==
In [[Greek (language)|Greek]], the prefix ''meta-'' is generally less esoteric than in [[English (language)|English]]; Greek ''meta-'' is equivalent to the [[Latin language|Latin]] words ''post-'' or ''ad-''. The use of the prefix in this sense occurs occasionally in [[English language|scientific English]] terms derived from [[Greek (language)|Greek]]. For example: the term ''[[Metatheria]]'' (the name for the [[clade]] of [[marsupial]] [[mammals]]) uses the prefix ''meta-'' in the sense the ''[[Metatheria]]'' occur on the tree of life adjacent to the ''[[Theria]]'' (the [[placental mammals]]).

==Epistemology==
{{anchor|About}}
In [[epistemology]], and often in common use, the prefix ''meta-'' is used to mean ''about (its own category)''. For example, [[metadata]] are data about data (who has produced them, when, what format the data are in and so on). In a database, [[metadata]] are also data about data stored in a data dictionary and describe information (data) about database tables such as the table name, table owner, details about columns, – essentially describing the table.   Also, [[metamemory]] in psychology means an individual's [[knowledge]] about whether or not they would remember something if they concentrated on recalling it. The modern sense of "an X about X" has given rise to concepts like "[[meta-cognition]]" (i.e. cognition about cognition), "[[meta-emotion]]" (i.e. emotion about emotion), "[[meta-discussion]]" (i.e. discussion about discussion), "[[meta-joke]]" (i.e. joke about jokes), and "[[metaprogramming]]" (i.e. writing programs that manipulate programs).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In a [[rule-based system]], a [[wiktionary:metarule|metarule]] is a rule governing the application of other rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/158976.158989 |title=The Use of Meta-rules in Rule Based Legal Computer Systems|first1=Uri J.|last1=Schild |first2=Shai|last2=Herzog |work=Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law |series=ICAIL '93|date=1993|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=100–109|doi=10.1145/158976.158989|publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On higher level of abstraction==
Any subject can be said to have a ''[[metatheory]]'', a theoretical consideration of its properties, such as its [[wikt:foundation|foundation]]s, [[wikt:method|method]]s, [[wikt:form|form]] and [[utility]], on a higher level of abstraction. In linguistics, a grammar is considered as being expressed in a [[metalanguage]], language operating on a higher level to describe properties of the plain language (and not itself).

==Etymology==
The prefix comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[preposition]] and [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] ''meta-'' (μετά-), from μετά,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dmeta%2F μητά], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; which meant "after", "beside", "with", "among" (with respect to the preposition, some of these meanings were distinguished by [[case marking]]). Other meanings include "beyond", "adjacent" and "self", and it is also used in the form μητα- as a prefix in Greek, with variants μετ- before vowels and μεθ- "meth-" before [[aspirated vowel]]s.

The earliest form of the word "meta" is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''me-ta'', written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=417|work=Palaeolexicon.com|title=The Linear B word me-ta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek preposition is [[cognate]] with the Old English preposition [[wikt:mid#Etymology 1|''mid'']] "with", still found as a prefix in ''midwife''. Its use in English is the result of [[back-formation]] from the word "metaphysics". In origin ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' was just the title of one of the principal works of [[Aristotle]]; it was so named (by [[Andronicus of Rhodes]]) because in the customary ordering of the works of Aristotle it was the book following ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]''; it thus meant nothing more than "[the book that comes] after [the book entitled] ''Physics''". However, even Latin writers misinterpreted this as entailing metaphysics constituted "the science of what is beyond the physical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metaphysics|title=Metaphysics|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Aristotle's ''Metaphysics'' enunciates considerations of natures above physical realities, which one can examine through this particular part of philosophy, e.g., the existence of God. The use of the prefix was later extended to other contexts based on the understanding of metaphysics to mean "the science of what is beyond the physical".

==Quine and Hofstadter==

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites uses of the meta- prefix as "beyond, about" (such as meta-economics and meta-philosophy) going back to 1917. However, these formations are parallel to the original "metaphysics" and "metaphysical", that is, as a prefix to general nouns (fields of study) or adjectives. Going by the ''OED'' citations, it began being used with specific nouns in connection with mathematical logic sometime before 1929. (In 1920 [[David Hilbert]] proposed a research project in what was called "[[metamathematics]].")

A notable early citation is [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s 1937 use of the word "metatheorem",&lt;ref&gt;Willard Van Orman Quine, "Logic Based on Inclusion and Abstraction", The ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 2, No. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;145–152, December 1937&lt;/ref&gt; where meta- has the modern meaning of "an X about X". (Note earlier uses of "meta-economics" and even "metaphysics" do not have this doubled conceptual structure – they are about or beyond X but they do not themselves constitute an X).

[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (and in the sequel, ''[[Metamagical Themas]]''), popularized this meaning of the term. The book, which deals with  [[self-reference]] and [[strange loop]]s, and touches on Quine and his work, was influential in many computer-related subcultures and may be responsible for the popularity of the prefix, for its use as a solo term, and for the many recent coinages which use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Meta-Musings|last=Cohen|first=Noam|date=Sep 5, 1988|work=The New Republic|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hofstadter uses meta as a stand-alone word, as an adjective and as a directional preposition ("going meta," a term he coins for the old rhetorical trick of taking a debate or analysis to another level of abstraction, as when somebody says "This debate isn't going anywhere"). This book may also be responsible for the association of "meta" with strange loops, as opposed to just abstraction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The sentence "This sentence contains thirty-six letters," and the sentence which embeds it, are examples of "metasentences" referencing themselves in this way.

In [[mathematics]], a '''metric''' or '''distance function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that defines a [[distance]]  between each pair of elements of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. A set with a metric is called a [[metric space]]. A metric induces a [[topology]] on a set, but not all topologies can be generated by a metric. A [[topological space]] whose topology can be described by a metric is called [[metrizable]].

An important source of metrics in [[differential geometry]] are [[metric tensor]]s, [[bilinear form]]s that may be defined from the [[tangent vector]]s of a [[differentiable manifold]] onto a scalar. A metric tensor allows distances along curves to be determined through integration, and thus determines a metric. However, not every metric comes from a metric tensor in this way.

==Definition==

A '''metric''' on a set {{mvar|X}} is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] (called the ''distance function'' or simply '''distance''')
:&lt;math&gt;d : X \times X \to [0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;[0,\infty)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of non-negative [[real number]]s and for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in X&lt;/math&gt;, the following conditions are satisfied:

:{|
|-
|style="width:20px"| 1.
|style="width:250px"|&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt; 
|| [[Non-negative|non-negativity]] or separation axiom
|-
| 2. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = y&lt;/math&gt; || [[identity of indiscernibles]]
|-
| 3. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)  = d(y,x) &lt;/math&gt; || [[Symmetric function|symmetry]]
|-
| 4. || &lt;math&gt;d(x,z) \le d(x,y) + d(y, z)&lt;/math&gt;  || [[subadditivity]] or [[triangle inequality]]
|}

Conditions 1 and 2 together define a ''[[positive-definite function]]''. 
The first condition is implied by the others.

A metric is called an [[ultrametric space|ultrametric]] if it satisfies the following stronger version of the ''triangle inequality'' where points can never fall 'between' other points:
: &lt;math&gt;d(x, z) \leq \max(d(x, y), d(y, z))&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;x,y,z \in X&lt;/math&gt;

A metric {{mvar|d}} on {{mvar|X}} is called [[intrinsic metric|intrinsic]] if any two points {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|X}} can be joined by a [[curve]] with [[Curve#Lengths of curves|length]] arbitrarily close to {{math|''d''(''x'', ''y'')}}.

For sets on which an addition + : {{math|''X'' &amp;times; ''X'' → ''X''}} is defined,
{{mvar|d}} is called a '''[[Translational invariance|translation invariant metric]]''' if
: &lt;math&gt;d(x, y) = d(x + a, y + a)&lt;/math&gt;
for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|X}}.

== Notes ==

These conditions express intuitive notions about the concept of [[distance]]. For example, that the distance between distinct points is positive and the distance from ''x'' to ''y'' is the same as the distance from ''y'' to ''x''. The triangle inequality means that the distance from ''x'' to ''z'' via ''y'' is at least as great as from ''x'' to ''z'' directly. [[Euclid]] in his [[Euclidean geometry|work]] stated that the shortest distance between two points is a line; that was the triangle inequality for his geometry.

If a modification of the triangle inequality
:4*.  ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''z'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''x'')
is used in the definition then property 1 follows straight from property 4*. Properties 2 and 4* give property 3 which in turn gives property 4.

== Examples ==

{{Main|Metric space#Examples of metric spaces}}
* The [[discrete space|discrete metric]]: if ''x'' = ''y'' then ''d''(''x'',''y'') = 0.  Otherwise, ''d''(''x'',''y'') = 1.
* The [[Euclidean metric]] is translation and rotation invariant.
* The [[Taxicab geometry|taxicab metric]] is translation invariant.
* More generally, any metric induced by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is translation invariant.
* If &lt;math&gt;(p_n)_{n\in N}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[sequence]] of [[seminorm]]s defining a ([[locally convex]]) [[topological vector space]] ''E'', then
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n} \frac{p_n(x-y)}{1+p_n(x-y)}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a metric defining the same [[topology]].  (One can replace &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2^n}&lt;/math&gt; by any [[absolute convergence|summable sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; of strictly [[positive number]]s.)
* [[Graph metric]], a metric defined in terms of distances in a certain graph.
* The [[Hamming distance]] in coding theory.
* [[Riemannian metric]], a type of metric function that is appropriate to impose on any [[differentiable manifold]]. For any such [[manifold]], one chooses at each point p a symmetric, positive definite, bilinear form L: T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; × T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; → ℝ on the [[tangent space]] T&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; at p, doing so in a smooth manner. This form determines the length of any tangent vector '''v''' on the manifold, via the definition ||v||  =  {{radic|L('''v''', '''v''')}}. Then for any differentiable path on the manifold, its length is defined as the integral of the length of the tangent vector to the path at any point, where the integration is done with respect to the path parameter.  Finally, to get a metric defined on any pair {x, y} of points of the manifold, one takes the infimum, over all paths from x to y, of the set of path lengths. A smooth manifold equipped with a Riemannian metric is called a [[Riemannian manifold]].
* The [[Fubini–Study metric]] on [[complex projective space]]. This is an example of a Riemannian metric.
* [[String metric]]s, such as [[Levenshtein distance]] and other [[Edit distance|string edit distances]], define a metric over [[String (computer science)|strings]].
* [[Graph edit distance]] defines a distance function between [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]].
* The [[Wasserstein metric]] is a distance function defined between two [[probability distribution]]s.

== Equivalence of metrics ==

For a given set ''X'', two metrics ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''topologically equivalent''' ('''uniformly equivalent''') if the identity mapping
:id: (''X'',''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''X'',''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
is a [[homeomorphism]] ([[uniform isomorphism]]).

For example, if &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is a metric, then &lt;math&gt;\min (d, 1)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{d \over 1+d}&lt;/math&gt; are metrics equivalent to &lt;math&gt;d.&lt;/math&gt;

See also [[Metric space#Notions of metric space equivalence|notions of metric space equivalence]].

== Metrics on vector spaces ==
&lt;!-- linked from [[Relation of norms and metrics]] --&gt;
Norms on vector spaces are equivalent to certain metrics, namely homogeneous, translation-invariant ones. In other words, every norm determines a metric, and some metrics determine a norm.

Given a [[normed vector space]] &lt;math&gt;(X, \|\cdot\|)&lt;/math&gt; we can define a metric on ''X'' by
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) := \| x-y\|&lt;/math&gt;.
The metric ''d'' is said to be '''induced by''' the norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely if a metric ''d'' on a [[vector space]] ''X'' satisfies the properties
*&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = d(x+a,y+a)&lt;/math&gt; (''translation invariance'')
*&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha x, \alpha y) = |\alpha| d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; (''homogeneity'')
then we can define a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] on ''X'' by
:&lt;math&gt;\|x\| := d(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, a [[seminorm]] induces a pseudometric (see below), and a homogeneous, translation invariant pseudometric induces a seminorm.

==Metrics on multisets==
We can generalize the notion of a metric from a distance between two elements to a distance between two nonempty finite multisets of elements. A [[multiset]] is a generalization of the notion of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] such that an element can occur more than once.  Define &lt;math&gt;Z=XY&lt;/math&gt; if
&lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; is the multiset consisting of the elements of the multisets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, that is, if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; occurs once in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and once in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; then it occurs twice in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;. 
A distance function
&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; on the set of nonempty finite multisets is a metric&lt;ref name="Vi11"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/TIT.2011.2110130|title=Information Distance in Multiples|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=57|issue=4|pages=2451|year=2011|last1=Vitanyi|first1=Paul M. B.|arxiv=0905.3347}}&lt;/ref&gt; if
#  &lt;math&gt;d(X)=0&lt;/math&gt; if all elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; are equal and &lt;math&gt;d(X) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; otherwise ([[positive definiteness]]), that is, ([[Non-negative|non-negativity]] plus [[identity of indiscernibles]])
# &lt;math&gt;d(X)&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under all permutations of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ([[symmetry]])
# &lt;math&gt;d(XY) \leq d(XZ)+d(ZY)&lt;/math&gt; ([[triangle inequality]])
Note that the familiar metric between two elements results if the multiset &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; has two elements in 1 and 2 and the multisets &lt;math&gt;X,Y,Z&lt;/math&gt; have one element each in 3. For instance if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; consists of two occurrences of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;d(X)=0&lt;/math&gt; according to 1.

A simple example is the set of all nonempty finite multisets &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;  of integers with &lt;math&gt;d(X)=\max\{x: x \in X\}- \min\{x:x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt;. More complex examples are [[information distance]] in multisets;&lt;ref name="Vi11"/&gt; and [[normalized compression distance]] (NCD) in multisets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1212.5711|last1= Cohen|first1= Andrew R.|title= Normalized Compression Distance of Multisets with Applications|journal= IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence|volume= 37|issue= 8|pages= 1602–1614|last2=  Vitanyi|first2= Paul M. B.|year= 2012|doi= 10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2375175}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalized metrics ==
There are numerous ways of relaxing the axioms of metrics, giving rise to various notions of generalized metric spaces. These generalizations can also be combined. The terminology used to describe them is not completely standardized. Most notably, in [[functional analysis]] pseudometrics often come from [[seminorm]]s on vector spaces, and so it is natural to call them "semimetrics". This conflicts with the use of the term in [[topology]].

=== Extended metrics ===
Some authors allow the distance function ''d'' to attain the value ∞, i.e. distances are non-negative numbers on the [[extended real number line]]. 
Such a function is called an ''extended metric'' or "∞-metric". 
Every extended metric can be transformed to a finite metric such that the metric spaces are equivalent as far as notions of [[topology]] (such as [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]] or [[limit (mathematics)|convergence]]) are concerned. This can be done using a [[Subadditive function|subadditive]] monotonically increasing bounded function which is zero at zero, e.g. ''d''&amp;prime;(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''x'', ''y'') / (1 + ''d''(''x'', ''y'')) or ''d''&amp;prime;&amp;prime;(''x'', ''y'') = min(1, ''d''(''x'', ''y'')).

The requirement that the metric take values in &lt;nowiki&gt;[0,∞)&lt;/nowiki&gt; can even be relaxed to consider metrics with values in other [[directed set]]s.  The reformulation of the axioms in this case leads to the construction of [[uniform space]]s: topological spaces with an abstract structure enabling one to compare the local topologies of different points.

===Pseudometrics===
{{Main|Pseudometric space}}
A '''pseudometric''' on ''X'' is a function ''d'' : ''X'' × ''X'' → '''R''' which satisfies the axioms for a metric, except that instead of the second (identity of indiscernibles) only ''d''(''x'',''x'')=0 for all ''x'' is required. In other words, the axioms for a pseudometric are:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
&lt;!--# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y''--&gt;
# '''''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0''' (but possibly ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 for some distinct values ''x'' ≠ ''y''.)
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'').

In some contexts, pseudometrics are referred to as ''semimetrics'' because of their relation to [[seminorm]]s.

===Quasimetrics===
Occasionally, a '''quasimetric''' is defined as a function that satisfies all axioms for a metric with the possible exception of symmetry:&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Steen &amp;amp; Seebach (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Quasi uniformities: reconciling domains with metric spaces | last=Smyth | first=M. | year=1987 | pages=236–253 | conference=3rd Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Language Semantics | editor=M.Main |editor2=A.Melton |editor3=M.Mislove |editor4=D.Schmidt | publisher=Springer-Verlag, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 298}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The name of this generalisation is not entirely standardized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Functional Analysis and Control Theory: Linear Systems | last=Rolewicz | first=Stefan | year=1987 | isbn=90-277-2186-6 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | oclc=13064804 }} This book calls them "semimetrics". That same term is also frequently used for two other generalizations of metrics.&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0 ('''positivity''')
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y'' ('''positive definiteness''')
# &lt;del&gt;''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')&lt;/del&gt; ('''symmetry''', dropped)
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'') ('''triangle inequality''')

Quasimetrics are common in real life. For example, given a set ''X'' of mountain villages, the typical walking times between elements of ''X'' form a quasimetric because travel up hill takes longer than travel down hill. Another example is a [[taxicab geometry]] topology having one-way streets, where a path from point ''A'' to point ''B'' comprises a different set of streets than a path from ''B'' to ''A''. 

A quasimetric on the reals can be defined by setting
:''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x'' − ''y'' if ''x'' ≥ ''y'', and
:''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 1 otherwise. The 1 may be replaced by infinity or by &lt;math&gt;1+10^{(y-x)}&lt;/math&gt;.
The topological space underlying this quasimetric space is the [[Sorgenfrey line]]. This space describes the process of [[Filing (metalworking)|filing down]] a metal stick: it is easy to reduce its size, but it is difficult or impossible to grow it.

If ''d'' is a quasimetric on ''X'', a metric ''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' on ''X'' can be formed by taking
:''d&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''(''x'', ''y'') = {{frac|2}}(''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''x'')).

===Metametrics===

In a ''metametric'', all the axioms of a metric are satisfied except that the distance between identical points is not necessarily zero. In other words, the axioms for a metametric are:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 implies ''x'' = ''y'' (but not vice versa.)
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')
# ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'').

Metametrics appear in the study of [[Δ-hyperbolic space|Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces]] and their boundaries. The ''visual metametric'' on such a space satisfies ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = 0 for points ''x'' on the boundary, but otherwise ''d''(''x'', ''x'') is approximately the distance from ''x'' to the boundary. Metametrics were first defined by Jussi Väisälä.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Semimetrics===
A '''semimetric''' on ''X'' is a function ''d'' : ''X'' × ''X'' → '''R''' that satisfies the first three axioms, but not necessarily the triangle inequality:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = 0 &amp;nbsp; if and only if &amp;nbsp; ''x'' = ''y''
# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') = ''d''(''y'', ''x'')

Some authors work with a weaker form of the triangle inequality, such as:
: ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ρ (''d''(''x'', ''y'') + ''d''(''y'', ''z'')) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ρ-relaxed triangle inequality)
: ''d''(''x'', ''z'') ≤ ρ max(''d''(''x'', ''y''), ''d''(''y'', ''z'')) &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (ρ-inframetric inequality).
The ρ-inframetric inequality implies the ρ-relaxed triangle inequality (assuming the first axiom), and the ρ-relaxed triangle inequality implies the 2ρ-inframetric inequality. Semimetrics satisfying these equivalent conditions have sometimes been referred to as "quasimetrics",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The ρ-inframetric inequalities were introduced to model [[round-trip delay time]]s in the [[internet]].&lt;ref name=inframetrics /&gt; The triangle inequality implies the 2-inframetric inequality, and the [[ultrametric inequality]] is exactly the 1-inframetric inequality.

===Premetrics===
Relaxing the last three axioms leads to the notion of a '''premetric''', i.e. a function satisfying the following conditions:

# ''d''(''x'', ''y'') ≥ 0
# ''d''(''x'', ''x'') = ''0''

This is not a standard term. Sometimes it is used to refer to other generalizations of metrics such as pseudosemimetrics&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 | title =  Lectures and exercises on functional analysis
 | year = 2006
 | author = Khelemskiĭ
}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in translations of Russian books it sometimes appears as "prametric".&lt;ref&gt;Arkhangel'skii &amp;amp; Pontryagin (1990). {{citation

 | year = 1995
 | last1 = Aldrovandi	 | first1 =  R.
 | last2 =  Pereira	 | first2 =  J.G.
}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Any premetric gives rise to a topology as follows. For a positive real ''r'', the ''r''-ball centered at a point ''p'' is defined as
:''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'') = { ''x'' | ''d''(''x'', ''p'') &lt; r }.
A set is called ''open'' if for any point ''p'' in the set there is an ''r''-ball centered at ''p'' which is contained in the set. Every premetric space is a topological space, and in fact a [[sequential space]].&lt;!--I copied this claim from [[premetric space]] without checking--&gt;
In general, the ''r''-balls themselves need not be open sets with respect to this topology. 
As for metrics, the distance between two sets ''A'' and ''B'', is defined as
:''d''(''A'', ''B'') = inf&lt;sub&gt;''x''∊''A'', ''y''∊''B''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''x'', ''y'').
This defines a premetric on the [[power set]] of a premetric space. If we start with a (pseudosemi-)metric space, we get a pseudosemimetric, i.e. a symmetric premetric.
Any premetric gives rise to a [[preclosure operator]] ''cl'' as follows:
:''cl''(''A'') = { ''x'' | ''d''(''x'', ''A'') = 0 }.

===Pseudoquasimetrics===
The prefixes ''pseudo-'', ''quasi-'' and ''semi-'' can also be combined, e.g., a '''pseudoquasimetric''' (sometimes called '''hemimetric''') relaxes both the indiscernibility axiom and the symmetry axiom and is simply a premetric satisfying the triangle inequality. For pseudoquasimetric spaces the open ''r''-balls form a basis of open sets. A very basic example of a pseudoquasimetric space is the set {0,1} with the premetric given by ''d''(0,1) = 1 and ''d''(1,0) = 0. The associated topological space is the [[Sierpiński space]].

Sets equipped with an extended pseudoquasimetric were studied by [[William Lawvere]] as "generalized metric spaces".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Lawvere | first=F.W. | title=Metric spaces, generalised logic, and closed categories | series=Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories | volume=1 | year=2002 | origyear=1973 | pages=1–37 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Vickers | first=Steven | title=Localic completion of generalized metric spaces I | journal=Theory and Applications of Categories | volume=14 | year=2005 | pages=328–356 | url=http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/14/15/14-15abs.html }}
&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Category theory|categorical]] point of view, the extended pseudometric spaces and the extended pseudoquasimetric spaces, along with their corresponding nonexpansive maps, are the best behaved of the metric space categories. One can take arbitrary products and coproducts and form quotient objects within the given category. If one drops "extended", one can only take finite products and coproducts. If one drops "pseudo", one cannot take quotients. [[Approach space]]s are a generalization of metric spaces that maintains these good categorical properties.

=== Important cases of generalized metrics ===
In [[differential geometry]], one considers a [[metric tensor]], which can be thought of as an "infinitesimal" quadratic metric function. This is defined as a [[nondegenerate]] symmetric [[bilinear form]] on the [[tangent space]] of a [[manifold]] with an appropriate [[differentiability]] requirement.  While these are not metric functions as defined in this article, they induce what is called a pseudo-semimetric function by [[Antiderivative|integration]] of its square root along a path through the manifold. If one imposes the positive-definiteness requirement of an [[inner product]] on the metric tensor, this restricts to the case of a [[Riemannian manifold]], and the path integration yields a metric.

In [[general relativity]] the related concept is a [[metric tensor (general relativity)]] which expresses the structure of a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]. Though the term "metric" is used in cosmology, the fundamental idea is different because there are non-zero [[null vector]]s in the tangent space of these manifolds. This generalized view of "metrics", in which zero distance does ''not'' imply identity, has crept into some mathematical writing too:&lt;ref&gt;S. Parrott (1987) ''Relativistic Electrodynamics and Differential Geometry'', page 4, Springer-Verlag {{isbn|0-387-96435-5}} : "This bilinear form is variously called the ''Lorentz metric'', or ''Minkowski metric'' or ''metric tensor''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Cecil (1992) ''Lie Sphere Geometry'', page 9, Springer-Verlag {{isbn|0-387-97747-3}} : "We call this scalar product the ''Lorentz metric''"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Molecular nanotechnology''' ('''MNT''') is a technology based on the ability to build structures to complex, atomic specifications by means of [[mechanosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/glossary/glossary_n.html#Nanotechnology |title=Nanosystems Glossary |publisher=E-drexler.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from [[Nanomaterials|nanoscale materials]].  Based on [[Richard Feynman]]'s vision of miniature factories using nanomachines to build complex products ([[self-replicating machine|including additional nanomachines]]), this advanced form of [[nanotechnology]] (or ''molecular manufacturing''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051108122214/http://wise-nano.org/w/Doing_MM |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-11-08 |title=Doing MM |publisher=Wise Nano |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) would make use of positionally-controlled mechanosynthesis guided by [[molecular machine]] systems. MNT would involve combining physical principles demonstrated by [[biophysics]], [[chemistry]], other nanotechnologies, and the [[Biological machine|molecular machinery of life]] with the systems engineering principles found in modern macroscale factories.

==Introduction==

While conventional chemistry uses inexact processes obtaining inexact results, and biology exploits inexact processes to obtain definitive results, molecular nanotechnology would employ original definitive processes to obtain definitive results. The desire in molecular nanotechnology would be to balance molecular reactions in positionally-controlled locations and orientations to obtain desired chemical reactions, and then to build systems by further assembling the products of these reactions.

A roadmap for the development of MNT is an objective of a broadly based technology project led by [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] (the manager of several U.S. National Laboratories) and the [[Foresight Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |title=Foresight Institute press release |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2008-01-29 |accessdate=2010-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923024525/http://foresight.org/cms/press_center/282 |archivedate=2010-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The roadmap was originally scheduled for completion by late 2006, but was released in January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Christine |url=http://www.foresight.org/nanodot/?p=2478#more-2478 |title=Nanodot: Nanotechnology News and Discussion » Blog Archive » Nanotechnology Roadmap launch: Productive Nanosystems Conference, Oct 9-10 |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2007-05-08 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nanofactory Collaboration&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a more focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Challenges.htm |title=Nanofactory Technical Challenges |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. In August 2005, a task force consisting of 50+ international experts from various fields was organized by the [http://www.crnano.org/ Center for Responsible Nanotechnology] to study the societal implications of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org|title=Global Task Force on Implications and Policy |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projected applications and capabilities==

===Smart materials and nanosensors===
One proposed application of MNT is so-called [[smart material]]s.  This term refers to any sort of material designed and engineered at the [[nanometer]] scale for a specific task. It encompasses a wide variety of possible commercial applications.  One example would be materials designed to respond differently to various molecules; such a capability could lead, for example, to artificial drugs which would recognize and render inert specific [[viruses]].  Another is the idea of [[Self-healing material|self-healing structures]], which would [[Regeneration (biology)|repair]] small tears in a surface naturally in the same way as self-sealing tires or human skin.

A MNT nanosensor would resemble a smart material, involving a small component within a larger machine that would react to its environment and change in some fundamental, intentional way.  A very simple example: a photosensor might passively measure the incident light and discharge its absorbed energy as electricity when the light passes above or below a specified threshold, sending a signal to a larger machine.  Such a sensor would supposedly cost less and use less power than a conventional sensor, and yet function usefully in all the same applications &amp;mdash; for example, turning on parking lot lights when it gets dark.

While smart materials and nanosensors both exemplify useful applications of MNT, they pale in comparison with the complexity of the technology most popularly associated with the term: the replicating [[nanorobot]].

===Replicating nanorobots===

MNT nanofacturing is popularly linked with the idea of [[swarm intelligence|swarm]]s of coordinated nanoscale robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by [[K. Eric Drexler]] in his [[Engines of Creation|1986 discussions of MNT]], but [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html superseded in 1992]. In this early proposal, sufficiently capable nanorobots would construct more nanorobots in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.

Critics have doubted both the feasibility of self-replicating [[nanorobot]]s and the feasibility of control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of [[mutation]]s removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations.  Advocates address the first doubt by pointing out that the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of [[Lego blocks]], was built and operated experimentally in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm |title=3.23.4 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap;  similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts.  Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that [[bacterium|bacteria]] are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while nanorobot mutation could be actively prevented by common [[Error-correction|error-correcting]] techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/index.html |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm |title=5.1.9 |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date=2005-08-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.

However, the concept of suppressing mutation raises the question: How can design evolution occur at the nanoscale without a process of random mutation and deterministic selection? Critics argue that MNT advocates have not provided a substitute for such a process of evolution in this nanoscale arena where conventional sensory-based selection processes are lacking.  The limits of the sensorium available at the nanoscale could make it difficult or impossible to winnow successes from failures.  Advocates argue that design evolution should occur deterministically and strictly under human control, using the conventional engineering paradigm of modeling, design, prototyping, testing, analysis, and redesign.

In any event, since 1992 [http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html technical proposals for MNT] do not include self-replicating nanorobots, and recent ethical guidelines put forth by MNT advocates prohibit unconstrained self-replication.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/MMDangerous.pdf |title=N04FR06-p.15.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical nanorobots===

One of the most important applications of MNT would be medical [[nanorobotics]] or [[nanomedicine]], an area pioneered by [[Robert Freitas]] in numerous books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanomedicine.com |title=NanomedicineBookSite |publisher=Nanomedicine.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/NanoPubls.htm |title=NanoPubls |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical nanorobots would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma.  Medical nanorobots might also make possible the convenient correction of genetic defects, and help to ensure a greatly expanded lifespan.  More controversially, medical nanorobots might be used to [[Human enhancement|augment natural human capabilities]]. One study has reported on the conditions like tumors, [[arteriosclerosis]], [[blood clots]] leading to stroke, accumulation of scar tissue and localized pockets of infection can be possibly be addressed by employing medical nanorobots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT8/Papers/Rubinstein/|title=NanoRobot for Treatment of Various Medical Problems|website=www.foresight.org|access-date=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saadeh|first=Yamaan|last2=Vyas|first2=Dinesh|date=June 2014|title=Nanorobotic Applications in Medicine: Current Proposals and Designs|journal=American journal of robotic surgery|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1166/ajrs.2014.1010|issn=2374-0612|pmc=4562685|pmid=26361635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility fog===

[[Image:Foglet.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a 100 micrometer foglet]]
Another proposed application of molecular nanotechnology is "[[utility fog]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discuss.foresight.org/~josh/Ufog.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111094117/http://discuss.foresight.org/%7Ejosh/Ufog.html |archivedate=2006-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; in which a cloud of networked microscopic robots (simpler than [[Molecular assembler|assembler]]s) would change its shape and properties to form macroscopic objects and tools in accordance with software commands.  Rather than modify the current practices of consuming material goods in different forms, utility fog would simply replace many physical objects.

===Phased-array optics===

Yet another proposed application of MNT would be [[phased-array optics]] (PAO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this appears to be a problem addressable by ordinary nanoscale technology. PAO would use the principle of phased-array millimeter technology but at optical wavelengths.  This would permit the duplication of any sort of optical effect but virtually.  Users could request holograms, sunrises and sunsets, or floating lasers as the mood strikes.  PAO systems were described in BC Crandall's ''Nanotechnology:  Molecular Speculations on Global Abundance'' in the [[Brian Wowk]] article "Phased-Array Optics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phased-array.com/1996-Book-Chapter.html |title=Phased Array Optics |publisher=Phased-array.com |date=1991-10-03 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential social impacts==

[[Molecular manufacturing]] is a potential future subfield of nanotechnology that would make it possible to  build complex structures at atomic precision.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426045511/http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|archivedate=26 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories weighing a kilogram or more.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

The products of molecular manufacturing could range from cheaper, mass-produced versions of known high-tech products to novel products with added capabilities in many areas of application. Some applications that have been suggested are advanced [[smart materials]], nanosensors, medical nanorobots and space travel.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt; Additionally, molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce highly advanced, durable weapons, which is an area of special concern regarding the impact of nanotechnology.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Phoenix|author2=Mike Treder|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global catastrophic risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-857050-9|chapter=Chapter 21: Nanotechnology as global catastrophic risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

According to Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder from the [[Center for Responsible Nanotechnology]] as well as Anders Sandberg from the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] molecular manufacturing is the application of nanotechnology that poses the most significant [[global catastrophic risk]].&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Sandberg xrisk"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sandberg |first1=Anders |title=The five biggest threats to human existence |url=http://theconversation.com/the-five-biggest-threats-to-human-existence-27053|website=http://theconversation.com/ |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several nanotechnology researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandberg xrisk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=A Dialog on Dangers |url=http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background3.html#DangerDialog|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races): (1) A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (2) the ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; (3) therefore lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes;&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION  (Chapter 11)|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html|website=http://e-drexler.com/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (4) molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade,&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; a potential peace-promoting factor;&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Democracy_trade_and_social_stability|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (5) [[wars of aggression]] may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Since self-regulation by all state and non-state actors seems hard to achieve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been proposed in the area of [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]].&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Need for International Control|url=http://www.crnano.org/int_control.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control.&lt;ref name="Tomasik co-op vs arms race"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=International Cooperation vs. AI Arms Race|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race/#Nanotech_arms_races|website=foundational-research.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency [[IAEA]]) or general arms control may also be designed.&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"/&gt; One may also jointly make [[Differential technological development|differential technological progress]] on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour.&lt;ref name="GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggest some technical restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Restrictions May Make Nanotechnology Safer|url=http://www.crnano.org/restrictions.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.&lt;ref name="Tomasik promote compr 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tomasik|first1=Brian|title=Possible Ways to Promote Compromise|url=http://foundational-research.org/publications/possible-ways-to-promote-compromise/#Transparency_social_capital_and_karma|website=http://foundational-research.org/|accessdate=22 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[grey goo]] is another catastrophic scenario, which was proposed by [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been analyzed by Freitas in "Some Limits to Global Ecophagy by Biovorous Nanoreplicators, with Public Policy Recommendations" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.foresight.org/nano/Ecophagy.html&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |date=November 1986 |title=Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life |url=http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf |journal=Omni |accessdate=19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario involves tiny self-replicating robots that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks.  Nanotech experts including Drexler now discredit the scenario. According to  [[Chris Phoenix (nanotechnologist)|Chris Phoenix]] a "So-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective|url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of nano-biotech, a different scenario called [[green goo]] has been forwarded. Here, the malignant substance is not nanobots but rather self-replicating biological [[organism]]s engineered through nanotechnology.

===Benefits===

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nanotechnology (or molecular nanotechnology to refer more specifically to the goals discussed here) will let us continue the historical trends in manufacturing right up to the fundamental limits imposed by physical law. It will let us make remarkably powerful molecular computers. It will let us make materials over fifty times lighter than steel or aluminium alloy but with the same strength. We'll be able to make jets, rockets, cars or even chairs that, by today's standards, would be remarkably light, strong, and inexpensive. Molecular surgical tools, guided by molecular computers and injected into the blood stream could find and destroy cancer cells or invading bacteria, unclog arteries, or provide oxygen when the circulation is impaired.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nanotechnology will replace our entire manufacturing base with a new, radically more precise, radically less expensive, and radically more flexible way of making products. The aim is not simply to replace today's computer chip making plants, but also to replace the assembly lines for cars, televisions, telephones, books, surgical tools, missiles, bookcases, airplanes, tractors, and all the rest. The objective is a pervasive change in manufacturing, a change that will leave virtually no product untouched. Economic progress and military readiness in the 21st Century will depend fundamentally on maintaining a competitive position in nanotechnology.

   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the current early developmental status of nanotechnology and molecular nanotechnology,  much concern surrounds MNT's anticipated impact on [[economics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/NoninflationaryPN.pdf |title=N20FR06-p._.pmd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lifeboat.com/ex/corporate.cornucopia&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[law]]. Whatever the exact effects, MNT, if achieved, would tend to reduce the [[scarcity]] of manufactured goods and make many more goods (such as food and health aids) manufacturable.

MNT should make possible [[Nanomedicine|nanomedical]] capabilities able to cure any medical condition not already cured by advances in other areas. Good health would be common, and poor health of any form would be as rare as [[smallpox]] and [[scurvy]] are today. Even [[cryonics]] would be feasible, as [[cryopreserved]] tissue could be fully repaired.

===Risks===
Molecular nanotechnology is one of the technologies that some analysts believe could lead to a [[technological singularity]].
Some feel that molecular nanotechnology would have daunting risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing |publisher=Crnano.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It conceivably could enable cheaper and more destructive conventional [[weapon]]s.  Also, molecular nanotechnology might permit [[weapons of mass destruction]] that could self-replicate, as [[virus (biology)|virus]]es and [[cancer]] cells do when attacking the human body. Commentators generally agree that, in the event molecular nanotechnology were developed, its [[self-replication]] should be permitted only under very controlled or "inherently safe" conditions.

A fear exists that nanomechanical robots, if achieved, and if designed to self-replicate using naturally occurring materials (a difficult task), could consume the entire planet in their hunger for raw materials,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Ecophagy.htm |title=Some Limits to Global Ecophagy |publisher=Rfreitas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply crowd out natural life, out-competing it for energy (as happened historically when [[blue-green algae]] appeared and outcompeted earlier life forms).  Some commentators have referred to this situation as the "[[grey goo]]" or "[[ecophagy]]" scenario.  [[K. Eric Drexler]] considers an accidental "grey goo" scenario extremely unlikely and says so in later editions of ''Engines of Creation''.

In light of this perception of potential danger, the [[Foresight Institute]], founded by Drexler, has prepared a set of guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html |title=Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology |publisher=Foresight.org |date=2006-04-06 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the ethical development of nanotechnology.  These include the banning of free-foraging self-replicating pseudo-organisms on the Earth's surface, at least, and possibly in other places.

==Technical issues and criticism==
The feasibility of the basic technologies analyzed in ''Nanosystems'' has been the subject of a formal scientific review by U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and has also been the focus of extensive debate on the internet and in the popular press.

===Study and recommendations by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences===

In 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref name="nanotechnology1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11752.html |title=A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative |publisher=Nap.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study committee reviewed the technical content of ''Nanosystems'', and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area:

:"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal."

===Assemblers versus nanofactories===
A section heading in Drexler's ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' reads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Cover.html |title=Engines of Creation - K. Eric Drexler : Cover |publisher=E-drexler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Universal Assemblers", and the following text speaks of multiple types of [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] which, collectively, could hypothetically "build almost anything that the laws of nature allow to exist." Drexler's colleague [[Ralph Merkle]] has noted that, contrary to widespread legend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/impact/impossible.html#Fear |title=How good scientists reach bad conclusions |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler never claimed that assembler systems could build absolutely any molecular structure. The endnotes in Drexler's book explain the qualification "almost": "For example, a delicate structure might be designed that, like a stone arch, would self-destruct unless all its pieces were already in place. If there were no room in the design for the placement and removal of a scaffolding, then the structure might be impossible to build. Few structures of practical interest seem likely to exhibit such a problem, however."

In 1992, Drexler published ''Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems TOC |publisher=E-drexler.com |date=2002-11-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; a detailed proposal for synthesizing stiff covalent structures using a table-top factory. [[Diamondoid]] structures and other stiff covalent structures, if achieved, would have a wide range of possible applications, going far beyond current [[Microelectromechanical systems|MEMS]] technology. An outline of a path was put forward in 1992 for building a table-top factory in the absence of an assembler. Other researchers have begun advancing tentative, alternative proposed paths &lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt; for this in the years since Nanosystems was published.

===Hard versus soft nanotechnology===
In 2004 [http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/ Richard Jones] wrote Soft Machines (nanotechnology and life), a book for lay audiences published by [[Oxford University]]. In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered  machines that does not take into account the nanoscale challenges such as [[wetness]], [[Adhesion|stickiness]], [[Brownian motion]], and high [[viscosity]]. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly [[biomimetic]] nanotechnology which is the way forward, if not the best way, to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.

===The Smalley-Drexler debate===
{{main|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

Several researchers, including Nobel Prize winner [[Richard Smalley|Dr. Richard Smalley]] (1943–2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciamdigital.com/index.cfm?fa=Products.ViewIssuePreview&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=F90C4210-C153-4B2F-83A1-28F2012B637|date=September 2001| journal=Scientific American| title=Of Chemistry, Love and Nanobots| first= Richard E.| last= Smalley|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0901-76| volume=285| pages=76–77| bibcode=2001SciAm.285c..76S}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the notion of universal assemblers, leading to a rebuttal from Drexler and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imm.org/SciAmDebate2/smalley.php |title=Debate About Assemblers — Smalley Rebuttal |publisher=Imm.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually to an exchange of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html |title=C&amp;En: Cover Story - Nanotechnology |publisher=Pubs.acs.org |date=2003-12-01 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smalley argued that chemistry is extremely complicated, reactions are hard to control, and that a universal assembler is science fiction. Drexler and colleagues, however, noted that Drexler never proposed universal assemblers able to make absolutely anything, but instead proposed more limited assemblers able to make a very wide variety of things. They challenged the relevance of Smalley's arguments to the more specific proposals advanced in ''Nanosystems''.  Also, Smalley argued that nearly all of modern chemistry involves reactions that take place in a [[solvent]] (usually [[water]]), because the [[small molecules]] of a solvent contribute many things, such as lowering [[binding energies]] for transition states.  Since nearly all known chemistry requires a solvent, Smalley felt that Drexler's proposal to use a high vacuum environment was not feasible.  However, Drexler addresses this in Nanosystems by showing mathematically that well designed [[catalysts]] can provide the effects of a solvent and can fundamentally be made even more efficient than a solvent/[[enzyme]] reaction could ever be. It is noteworthy that, contrary to Smalley's opinion that enzymes require water, "Not only do enzymes work vigorously in anhydrous organic media, but in this unnatural milieu they acquire remarkable properties such as greatly enhanced stability, radically altered substrate and [[enantiomeric]] specificities, molecular memory, and the ability to catalyse unusual reactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents.|date=April 1989 | pmid=2658221 | doi=10.1016/0968-0004(89)90146-1|volume=14|journal=Trends Biochem Sci|pages=141–4 | last1 = Klibanov | first1 = AM}}"{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC397741/pdf/pnas00350-0138.pdf|title=Enzymatic catalysis in anhydrous organic solvents|date=April 1989 | pmc=397741|pmid=3858815|volume=82|journal=Proc.

===Redefining of the word "nanotechnology"===
For the future, some means have to be found for MNT design evolution at the nanoscale which mimics the process of biological evolution at the molecular scale. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation in ensemble averages of organisms combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants, and macroscale engineering design also proceeds by a process of design evolution from simplicity to complexity as set forth somewhat satirically by [[John Gall (author)|John Gall]]: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.  . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works." &lt;ref name="JohGall"&gt;
Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A breakthrough in MNT is needed which proceeds from the simple atomic ensembles which can be built with, e.g., an STM to complex MNT systems via a process of design evolution. A handicap in this process is the difficulty of seeing and manipulation at the nanoscale compared to the macroscale which makes deterministic selection of successful trials difficult; in contrast biological evolution proceeds via action of what Richard Dawkins has called the "blind watchmaker"
&lt;ref name = "Dawkins"&gt;
Richard Dawkins, The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design, W. W. Norton; Reissue edition (September 19, 1996)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
comprising random molecular variation and deterministic reproduction/extinction.

At present in 2007 the practice of nanotechnology embraces both stochastic approaches (in which, for example, [[supramolecular chemistry]] creates waterproof pants) and deterministic approaches wherein single molecules (created by stochastic chemistry) are manipulated on substrate surfaces (created by stochastic deposition methods) by deterministic methods comprising nudging them with [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] or [[Atomic force microscope|AFM]] probes and causing simple binding or cleavage reactions to occur. The dream of a complex, deterministic molecular nanotechnology remains elusive.  Since the mid-1990s, thousands of surface scientists and thin film technocrats have latched on to the nanotechnology bandwagon and redefined their disciplines as nanotechnology.  This has caused much confusion in the field and has spawned thousands of "nano"-papers on the peer reviewed literature.  Most of these reports are extensions of the more ordinary research done in the parent fields.

===The feasibility of the proposals in ''Nanosystems''===
{{Multiple image

|footer = Top, a molecular propellor. Bottom, a molecular [[planetary gear]] system. The feasibility of devices like these has been questioned.}}

The feasibility of Drexler's proposals largely depends, therefore, on whether designs like those in ''Nanosystems'' could be built in the absence of a universal assembler to build them and would work as described. Supporters of molecular nanotechnology frequently claim that no significant errors have been discovered in ''Nanosystems'' since 1992. Even some critics concede&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=50#comment-523 |title=Blog Archive » Is mechanosynthesis feasible? The debate moves up a gear |publisher=Soft Machines |date=2004-12-16 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "Drexler has carefully considered a number of physical principles underlying the 'high level' aspects of the nanosystems he proposes and, indeed, has thought in some detail" about some issues.

Other critics claim, however, that ''Nanosystems'' omits important chemical details about the low-level 'machine language' of molecular nanotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/drexler.html |title=Smalley |publisher=Wired.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanotech-now.com/Atkinson-Phoenix-Nanotech-Debate.htm |title=Atkinson |publisher=Nanotech-now.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/index.php?p=70 |title=Moriarty |publisher=Softmachines.org |date=2005-01-26 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=175 |title=Jones |publisher=Softmachines.org |date=2005-12-18 |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that much of the other low-level chemistry in ''Nanosystems'' requires extensive further work, and that Drexler's higher-level designs therefore rest on speculative foundations.  Recent such further work by Freitas and Merkle &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/Publications.htm |title=Nanofactory Collaboration Publications |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is aimed at strengthening these foundations by filling the existing gaps in the low-level chemistry.

Drexler argues that we may need to wait until our conventional [[nanotechnology]] improves before solving these issues: "Molecular manufacturing will result from a series of advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel [[rocket]] systems. We are now in a position like that of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softmachines.org/PDFs/Moriarty_Phoenix_1.pdf |title=Moriarity Correspondence |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Freitas and Merkle argue &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm#NeedFund |title=Nanofactory Collaboration |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".

To summarize the arguments against feasibility:  First, critics argue that a primary barrier to achieving molecular nanotechnology is the lack of an efficient way to create machines on a molecular/atomic scale, especially in the absence of a well-defined path toward a self-replicating assembler or diamondoid nanofactory. Advocates respond that a preliminary research path leading to a diamondoid nanofactory is being developed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

A second difficulty in reaching molecular nanotechnology is design.  Hand design of a gear or bearing at the level of atoms might take a few to several weeks. While Drexler, Merkle and others have created designs of simple parts, no comprehensive design effort for anything approaching the complexity of a Model T Ford has been attempted.  Advocates respond that it is difficult to undertake a comprehensive design effort in the absence of significant funding for such efforts, and that despite this handicap much useful design-ahead has nevertheless been accomplished with new software tools that have been developed, e.g., at Nanorex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nanoengineer-1.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=40&amp;Itemid=50 |title=Nanorex, Inc. - Molecular Machinery Gallery |publisher=Nanoengineer-1.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latest report ''A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative''&lt;ref name="nanotechnology1"/&gt; put out by the National Academies Press in December 2006 (roughly twenty years after Engines of Creation was published), no clear way forward toward molecular nanotechnology could yet be seen, as per the conclusion on page 108 of that report: "Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable
range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic
efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably
predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of
manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted
with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems
which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of
biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that
is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations
that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to
achieve this goal." This call for research leading to demonstrations is welcomed by groups such as the Nanofactory Collaboration who are specifically seeking experimental successes in diamond mechanosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/DMS.htm |title=Diamond Mechanosynthesis |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Technology Roadmap for [[Productive nanosystems|Productive Nanosystems]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresight.org/roadmaps |title=Technology Roadmap for Productive Nanosystems |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to offer additional constructive insights.

It is perhaps interesting to ask whether or not most structures consistent with physical law can in fact be manufactured.  Advocates assert that to achieve most of the vision of molecular manufacturing it is not necessary to be able to build "any structure that is compatible with natural law." Rather, it is necessary to be able to build only a sufficient (possibly modest) subset of such structures—as is true, in fact, of any practical manufacturing process used in the world today, and is true even in biology. In any event, as [[Richard Feynman]] once said, "It is scientific only to say what's more likely or less likely, and not to be proving all the time what's possible or impossible."&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiquote:Richard Feynman]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existing work on diamond mechanosynthesis===

There is a growing body of peer-reviewed theoretical work on synthesizing diamond by mechanically removing/adding hydrogen atoms &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/TemelsoHAbst.pdf High-level Ab Initio Studies of Hydrogen Abstraction from Prototype Hydrocarbon Systems].

Freitas, Allis and Merkle. ''J. Comput. Theor. Nanosci.'' Vol. 4, 2007, in press.&lt;/ref&gt; (a process known as [[mechanosynthesis]]). This work is slowly permeating the broader nanoscience community and is being critiqued.  For instance, Peng et al. (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Papers/JCTNPengFeb06.pdf |title=03CTN01-003 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in the continuing research effort by Freitas, Merkle and their collaborators) reports that the most-studied mechanosynthesis tooltip motif (DCB6Ge) successfully places a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carbon [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]] on a C(110) [[diamond]] surface at both 300&amp;nbsp;K (room temperature) and 80&amp;nbsp;K ([[liquid nitrogen]] temperature), and that the silicon variant (DCB6Si) also works at 80&amp;nbsp;K but not at 300&amp;nbsp;K. Over 100,000 CPU hours were invested in this latest study.  The DCB6 tooltip motif, initially described by Merkle and Freitas at a Foresight Conference in 2002, was the first complete tooltip ever proposed for diamond mechanosynthesis and remains the only tooltip motif that has been successfully simulated for its intended function on a full 200-atom diamond surface.

The tooltips modeled in this work are intended to be used only in carefully controlled environments (e.&amp;nbsp;g., vacuum). Maximum acceptable limits for tooltip translational and rotational misplacement errors are reported in Peng et al. (2006) -- tooltips must be positioned with great accuracy to avoid bonding the dimer incorrectly.  Peng et al. (2006) reports that increasing the handle thickness from 4 support planes of C atoms above the tooltip to 5 planes decreases the resonance frequency of the entire structure from 2.0&amp;nbsp;THz to 1.8&amp;nbsp;THz.  More importantly, the vibrational footprints of a DCB6Ge tooltip mounted on a 384-atom handle and of the same tooltip mounted on a similarly constrained but much larger 636-atom "crossbar" handle are virtually identical in the non-crossbar directions. Additional computational studies modeling still bigger handle structures are welcome, but the ability to precisely position SPM tips to the requisite atomic accuracy has been repeatedly demonstrated experimentally at low temperature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.uci.edu/~wilsonho/stm-iets.html |title=Wilson Ho |publisher=Physics.uci.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=90|issue=|page=176102|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.176102|bibcode=2003PhRvL..90q6102O|title=Mechanical Vertical Manipulation of Selected Single Atoms by Soft Nanoindentation Using Near Contact Atomic Force Microscopy|pmid=12786084 | last1 = Oyabu | first1 = N | last2 = Custance | first2 = O | last3 = Yi | first3 = I | last4 = Sugawara | first4 = Y | last5 = Morita | first5 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even at room temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.

Further research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/Nanofactory/AnnBibDMS.htm |title=DMS Bibliography |publisher=Molecularassembler.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to consider additional tooltips will require time-consuming [[computational chemistry]] and difficult laboratory work.

A working [[nanofactory]] would require a variety of well-designed tips for different reactions, and detailed analyses of placing atoms on more complicated surfaces. Although this appears a challenging problem given current resources, many tools will be available to help future researchers: [[Moore's law]] predicts further increases in computer power, [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor fabrication]] techniques continue to approach the nanoscale, and researchers grow ever more skilled at using [[protein]]s, [[ribosome]]s and [[DNA]] to perform novel chemistry.

*In the novel ''Tomorrow'' by Andrew Saltzman ({{ISBN|1-4243-1027-X}}), a scientist uses [[nanorobotics]] to create a liquid that when inserted into the [[bloodstream]], renders one nearly [[wikt:invincible|invincible]] given that the microscopic machines repair tissue almost instantaneously after it is damaged.
*In the [[roleplaying game]] ''[[Splicers]]'' by [[Palladium Books]], humanity has succumbed to a "nanobot plague" that causes any object made of a non-[[precious metal]] to twist and change shape (sometimes into a type of [[robot]]) moments after being touched by a human.  The object will then proceed to attack the human.  This has forced humanity to develop "biotechnological" devices to replace those previously made of metal.

(They are similar to the creatures in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Evolution (TNG episode)|Evolution]]", which featured "nanites" taking over the ''Enterprise''.) The Nanites made their first appearance in season 8. Based on the concept of [[nanotechnology]], their comical ''[[deus ex machina]]'' activities included such diverse tasks as instant repair and construction, hairstyling, performing a Nanite variation of a [[flea circus]], conducting a microscopic war, and even destroying the Observers' planet after a dangerously vague request from Mike to "take care of [a] little problem". They also ran a [[microbrewery]].

The institute also houses the Laura Bush Library and Resource Center and was funded by a $5 million grant from the [[Task Force for Business and Stability Operations|U.S. Department of Defense Task Force for Business and Stability Operations]].&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Wie|first=Sara |title=Laura Bush Resource Center and Library Opens in Kabul |date=5 June 2013|url=http://www.bushcenter.org/blog/2013/06/05/laura-bush-resource-center-and-library-opens-kabul |accessdate=2 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902140735/http://www.bushcenter.org/blog/2013/06/05/laura-bush-resource-center-and-library-opens-kabul |archivedate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the center focuses on providing the tools and resources necessary to promote women's rights and opportunities in business and government in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="mwa"&gt;{{cite web|title=November luncheon features Afghan women's rights activists |url=http://mwawashingtondc.org/november-luncheon-welcomes-afghan-womens-rights-activists/ |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time with ICAWED she has met with several dignitaries, including United States [[Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] &lt;ref name="kerry"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan Women Help Drive Resurgent Economy |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/afghan-women-help-drive-recurrent-economy/1628696.html |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has focused largely on advocating at the national and international level for improvements in public policies involving the rights of women and peaceful economic and political transition.

Speaking of the future of women's rights in a [[Voice of America]] interview Sakhi noted that the next generation of women have strong role models in current Afghan society,&lt;blockquote&gt;“Looking at women talking about their political rights in parliament, looking at women entering into business and having trade in Malaysia and Dubai, and looking at women who are successful personalities internationally of raising Afghanistan voices. This gives an image.”&lt;ref name="voa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Afghan Fashion Designer Creates Dresses, Jobs |date=9 June 2013 |url=http://m.learningenglish.voanews.com/a/afghan-fashion-designer/1677486.html |accessdate=2 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902135140/http://m.learningenglish.voanews.com/a/afghan-fashion-designer/1677486.html |archivedate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''nuisance fee''' is a [[fee]], [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], or [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]] which is [[Security interest|charged]] to deter an action, rather than to compensate for the costs of that action.  For example, a five-dollar penalty for submitting an application late does not compensate for costs associated with processing late submissions, but rather encourages people to submit on time.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is domestic violence? ==

Domestic violence can be described as all of the following:

* [[Violence]] – use of physical force to apply a state to others contrary to their wishes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/violence ''Violence.''], Merriam-Webster Dictionary Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/violence?view=uk ''Violence.''], Oxford English Dictionary Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/0/V0110000.html ''Violence.''], American Heritage Dictionary, Violence, Retrieved January 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and may include some combination of [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[psychological abuse|emotional]], [[economic abuse|economic]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]].
* [[Abusive power and control|Control]] – Braiker identified the following ways that [[Psychological manipulation|manipulators]] control their victims:&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;Braiker, Harriet B. (2004) ''Who's Pulling Your Strings? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation'' {{ISBN|0-07-144672-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Positive reinforcement]]: [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], superficial [[sympathy]] ([[crocodile tears]]), excessive apologizing; money, approval, gifts; attention, facial expressions such as a forced laugh or smile; public recognition.
** [[Negative reinforcement]]: removing one from a negative situation as a reward. For example: "You won't have to walk home if you allow me to do this to you."
** [[Reinforcement#Schedules|Intermittent or partial reinforcement]]: partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt. Partial or intermittent positive reinforcement can encourage the victim to persist.
** [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]]: berating, yelling, refusing to speak to partner, intimidation, threats, [[profanity|swearing]], [[emotional blackmail]], the [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] trap, sulking, crying, and [[playing the victim]].
** Traumatic one-trial learning: verbal abuse, explosive anger, or other intimidating behavior to establish dominance or superiority; even one incident of such behavior can [[classical conditioning|condition]] or train victims to avoid upsetting, confronting or contradicting the manipulator.
* [[Oppression]] – exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/oppression ''Oppression.''] Merriam Webster Online.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as an act or instance of oppressing, the state of being oppressed, and the feeling of being heavily burdened, mentally or physically, by troubles, adverse conditions, and anxiety.

== Prevalence ==
[[Epidemiology of domestic violence]] – [[Domestic violence]] occurs across the world, in various cultures,&lt;ref name="watts2002"&gt;Watts C.; Zimmerman C. (April 2002) "Violence against women: global scope and magnitude." ''Lancet.'' '''359'''(9313):1232–7. {{PMID|11955557}}. {{doi|10.1016/S0140-6736(02)08221-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and affects people across society, irrespective of economic status&lt;ref name="waits1985"&gt;Waits, Kathleen. (1984–1985). "The Criminal Justice System's Response to Battering: Understanding the Problem, Forging the Solutions." ''Washington Law Review.'' '''60''':267–330.&lt;/ref&gt; or gender.

== Forms ==

The following table includes the forms of violence typically defined as part of [[Intimate partner violence]], which is domestic violence in an intimate relationship by one's spouse or lover. It also includes a column for other family members or partners.

The rate of occurrence varies considerably based upon one's country, socio-economic class, culture, religion, family history and other factors.

===Men and LGBT===

* [[LGBT]] [[Domestic violence]] – an under-researched area with a very wide range of estimates of prevalence. Lesbians often have fewer resources available for shelter and counselling.&lt;ref name="10 women"&gt;[http://www.glma.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.viewPage&amp;pageID=691 ''Ten Things Lesbians Should Discuss with their Health Care Providers.''] Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.

Fiebert, shows that women are as likely to be abusive to men, but the men are less likely to be hurt. However, he noted, men are seriously injured in 38% of the cases in which "extreme aggression" is used. Fiebert additionally noted that his work was not meant to minimize the serious effects of men who abuse women.{{#tag:ref|Martin S.

This bibliography examines 275 scholarly investigations: 214 empirical studies and 61 reviews and/or analyses appear to demonstrate that women are as physically aggressive, or more aggressive, than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners.

:The [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ) contends that a national survey, supported by NIJ, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] that examined more serious assaults, does not support the conclusion of similar rates of male and female spousal assaults. This survey was conducted within a safety or crime context and clearly found more partner abuse by men against women.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"&gt;[http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij/topics/crime/intimate-partner-violence/measuring.htm Measuring Intimate Partner (Domestic) Violence] National Institute of Justice.

This survey tool was developed in the 1970s and may not be appropriate for intimate partner violence research because it does not measure control, coercion, or the motives for conflict tactics; it also leaves out sexual assault and violence by ex-spouses or partners and does not determine who initiated the violence.&lt;ref name="ojp.usdoj.gov"/&gt;|group=nb}}

Another study published in the [[Violence &amp; Victims|Violence &amp; Victims Journal Vol. 1]] concluded that a feminist analysis of Domestic Abuse was necessary to combat common misconceptions. The study found that 92% of women who used violence against their male partners were in self-defense, and that violence reciprocated by victims may be an integral part of abuse [[victimology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jacobson | first1 = Neil | last2 = Gottman | first2 = John | title = When men batter women: new insights into ending abusive relationships | url = http://www.gottman.com/shop/when-men-batter-women/ | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York, NY | year = 2007 | isbn = 9781416551331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributing factors==
* [[Conflict tactics scale]] – research method for identifying intimate partner violence by measuring the conflict tactic behaviors.
* [[Cycle of abuse]] – [[social cycle theory]] to explain patterns of behavior of a violent intimate relationship: Tension building phase, acting-out phase, reconciliation / honeymoon phase, and calm phase, which leads back to the tension building phase.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, Lenore E. (1979) ''The Battered Woman''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cycle of violence]]
** Within a relationship – repeated acts of [[violence]] as a cyclical pattern, associated with high emotions and doctrines of [[Retributive justice|retribution]] or [[revenge]]. The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship. Each phase may last a different length of time and over time the level of violence may increase.
** Intergenerational cycle of violence – violence that is passed from father to son or daughter, parent to child, or sibling to sibling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abusivelove.com/abuse_types_1_11.htm Intergenerational Cycle Of Abuse] AbusiveLove.com. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamics between partners==

* Situational couple violence – arises infrequently out of conflicts that escalate to arguments and then to violence, rather than a general pattern of control. It is likely the most common type of intimate partner violence. Women are "almost as likely" as men to be abusers, however, women are more likely to be physically injured, require police intervention and become fearful of their mates.&lt;ref name=CLASP3&gt;[http://www.clasp.org/admin/site/publications_states/files/0314.pdf ''A Sociologist’s Perspective on Domestic Violence,''] ''A Conversation with Michael Johnson, Ph.D.'' Theodora Ooms, interviewer.

* Intimate terrorism (IT) – pattern of ongoing control using emotional, physical and other forms of domestic violence. It is what was traditionally the definition of domestic violence depicted in the "Power and Control Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdsv.org/images/PowerControlwheelNOSHADING.pdf ''Power and Control Wheel,''] National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence.

==Impacts==
The incidence of abuse may result in the following:
* [[Effects of domestic violence on children]] – dysfunctions in the physical, behavioral, emotional, and social areas of life which affect their [[quality of life|well-being]], [[child development]], [[teen dating violence|teen dating experiences]], future domestic situations and mortality.
* [[Mental illness]] &lt;ref name=Shipway&gt;Shipway, Lynn. (2004). ''Domestic violence: a handbook for health professionals.'' New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-28220-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayhew&gt;Mayhew, P.; Mirlees-Black, C.; Percy, A. (1996) ''The 1996 British Crime Survey England &amp; Wales.'' Home Office.&lt;/ref&gt; – [[psychological]] or [[behavioral]] pattern generally associated with subjective [[suffering|distress]] or [[disability]] that occurs in an individual, and which is not a part of [[normality (behavior)|normal]] [[developmental psychology|development]] or [[culture]]. Such a disorder may consist of a combination of [[affective]], [[behavior]]al, [[cognitive]] and [[perceptual]] components.
** [[Battered person syndrome]] – physical and [[psychology|psychological condition]] victims of domestic abuse, which may be manifested as a type of [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), from an ongoing [[Cycle of abuse]].
** [[Self-harm]] – intentional, direct injuring of body tissue most often done without [[suicide|suicidal]] intentions.&lt;ref name=Shipway/&gt;
* [[Suicide]],&lt;ref name=Shipway/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayhew/&gt; – act of intentionally causing one's own [[death]]. Suicide is often committed out of [[Despair (emotion)|despair]] or attributed to some underlying [[mental disorder]], such as [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], [[alcoholism]], or [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref name="Hawton, van Heeringen 2009"&gt;Hawton K.; van Heeringen, K.

** [[Self-immolation]] – setting oneself on [[fire]], often as a form of protest or for the purposes of [[martyrdom]] or [[suicide]].

==Legal==

===Remedies===
* [[Evidence-based prosecution#Context within domestic violence prosecution|Evidence-based prosecution of domestic violence]] – prosecutors aggressively trying domestic violence cases, basing their cases on evidence rather than victim cooperation, resulting in higher conviction rates.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Jeffrey. (1996).[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/crimdom.pdf ''The Criminalization of Domestic Violence: Promises and Limits''] National Institute of Justice. Retrieved November 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Injunction]] – [[equitable remedy]] in the form of a [[court order]] that requires a party to do or refrain from doing certain acts. A party that fails to comply with an injunction faces criminal or [[civil penalty|civil penalties]] and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. In some cases, breaches of injunctions are considered serious criminal offenses that merit arrest and possible prison sentences.
** [[Restraining order]] – requires a party to do, or to refrain from doing, certain acts. A party that refuses to comply with an order faces criminal or civil penalties and may have to pay damages or accept sanctions. Breaches of restraining orders can be considered serious criminal offences that merit arrest and possible prison sentences. The term is most commonly used in reference to [[domestic violence]], [[harassment]], [[stalking]] or [[sexual assault]].

===Topics===
* [[Battered woman defense]] – a self-defense measure used in court that the person accused of an [[assault]] / [[murder]] was suffering from ''[[battered person syndrome]]''.
* [[Domestic violence court]] – specialized courts designed to improve victim safety and enhance defendant accountability, created in response to frustration among victim advocates, judges and attorneys who saw the same litigants cycling through the justice system repeatedly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3802">'''Part–whole theory''' is the name of a loose collection of historical theories, all informal and nearly all unwitting, relating wholes to their parts via inclusion. Part–whole theory has been overtaken by [[mereology]].

[[Metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]], has invoked part–whole concepts ever since [[Aristotle]] founded the subject.

[[Husserl]] (1970) (German original first published in 1901) was the first to consciously elaborate a part–whole theory (on which see Tieszen 1995). However he employed no [[symbolic logic|symbolism]] or logic, even though his doctorate was in mathematics and [[Georg Cantor]] was his friend and colleague; Husserl wrote only for his fellow philosophers.

19th century mathematicians became dimly aware that they were invoking a part–whole theory of sorts only after Cantor and [[Peano]] first articulated [[set theory]]. Before then, mathematicians often confused [[subset|inclusion]] and membership. Grattan-Guinness (2000) appears to have been the first to draw attention to this unwitting part–whole theory.

[[Peano]] was among the first to articulate clearly the distinction between membership in a given set, and being a subset of that set. A subset of a set is usually not also a member of that set. However, the members of a subset are all members of the set. In set theory, a [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] cannot be identified with its member. In part–whole theory and mereology, this identification necessarily holds.

The Cantor–[[Peano]] concept of [[set theory|set]] did not become canonical until about 1910, when the first volume of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' appeared, and right after [[Ernst Zermelo]] proposed the first [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatization of set theory]] in 1908. 

Starting in 1916, and culminating in his 1929 ''[[Process and Reality]]'', [[A. N. Whitehead]] published several books invoking part–whole concepts of varying degrees of formality; see [[Whitehead's point-free geometry]].

Part–whole theory has been superseded by a collection of fully formal theories called [[mereology]], [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]]'s term for a formal part–whole theory he began expositing in 1912. Over the course of the 20th century, a number of Polish logicians and mathematicians contributed to this "Polish mereology." Even though Polish mereology is now only of historical interest, the word "mereology" endures as the name of a collection of [[first order theory|first order theories]] relating parts to their respective wholes. These theories, unlike set theory, can be proved [[sound]] and [[complete (complexity)|complete]].

Nearly all work that has appeared since 1970 under the heading of [[mereology]] descends from the 1940 calculus of individuals of [[Henry Leonard (philosopher)|Henry Leonard]] and [[Nelson Goodman]]. Simons (1987) is a survey of mereology aimed at philosophers.

In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], a '''phase''' is a region of space (a [[thermodynamic system]]), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modell|first=Michael|author2=Robert C. Reid|title=Thermodynamics and Its Applications |publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-13-914861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Enrico Fermi|title=Thermodynamics|date=25 April 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13485-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name="Adkins1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clement John Adkins|title=Equilibrium Thermodynamics|date=14 July 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27456-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Examples of physical properties include [[density]], [[refractive index|index of refraction]], [[magnetization]] and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water. The glass of the jar is another separate phase. (See {{section link|state of matter|Glass}})

The term ''phase'' is sometimes used as a synonym for [[state of matter]], but there can be several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term ''phase'' is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a [[phase boundary]] on a [[phase diagram]]. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of "phase" as a synonym for state of matter. However, the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not [[wikt:commensurate|commensurate]] with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used.

== Types of phases ==
[[File:Steel pd.svg|thumb|left|350px|Iron-carbon [[phase diagram]], showing the conditions necessary to form different phases]]

Distinct phases may be described as different [[state of matter|states of matter]] such as [[gas]], [[liquid]], [[solid]], [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Useful [[mesophase]]s between solid and liquid form other states of matter.

Distinct phases may also exist within a given state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be differentiated based on [[solubility]] as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low [[solubility]] (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form [[solid solution]]s or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form [[alloy]]s, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.

As many as [[multiphasic liquid|eight immiscible liquid phases]] have been observed.{{efn|One such system is, from the top: [[mineral oil]], [[silicone oil]], [[water]], [[aniline]], [[perfluoro(dimethylcyclohexane)]], [[white phosphorus]], [[gallium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The system remains indefinitely separated at {{val|45|u=°C}}, where gallium and phosphorus are in the molten state. From {{cite book

}}}} Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons ([[organofluorine chemistry#Fluorous phases|fluorous phase]]), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of [[ethylene glycol]] and [[toluene]] may separate into two distinct organic phases.{{efn|This phenomenon can be used to help with catalyst recycling in [[Heck reaction|Heck vinylation]].

Phases do not need to macroscopically separate spontaneously. [[Emulsion]]s and [[colloid]]s are examples of immiscible phase pair combinations that do not physically separate.
{{clear}}

==Phase equilibrium==
Left to equilibration, many compositions will form a uniform single phase, but depending on the temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases. Within each phase, the properties are uniform but between the two phases properties differ.

Water in a closed jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual attraction of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once in a while, a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy to break away from the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every once in a while a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.

At room temperature and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium when the air over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100&amp;nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water. If the liquid is heated a little over 100&amp;nbsp;°C, the transition from liquid to gas will occur not only at the surface, but throughout the liquid volume: the water boils.

==Number of phases==
{{see also|Multiphasic liquid}}
[[Image:phase-diag2.svg|thumb|right|280px|A typical phase diagram for a single-component material, exhibiting solid, liquid and gaseous phases. The solid green line shows the usual shape of the liquid–solid phase line. The dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water when the pressure increases. The [[triple point]] and the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] are shown as red dots.]]

For a given composition, only certain phases are possible at a given [[temperature]] and pressure. The number and type of phases that will form is hard to predict and is usually determined by experiment. The results of such experiments can be plotted in [[phase diagram]]s.

The phase diagram shown here is for a single component system. In this simple system, which phases that are possible depends only on [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The markings show points where two or more phases can co-exist in equilibrium. At temperatures and pressures away from the markings, there will be only one phase at equilibrium.

In the diagram, the blue line marking the boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. As the temperature and pressure approach the critical point, the properties of the liquid and gas become progressively more similar. At the critical point, the liquid and gas become indistinguishable. Above the critical point, there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases: there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a [[supercritical fluid]]. In water, the critical point occurs at around 647 [[Kelvin|K]] (374&amp;nbsp;°C or 705&amp;nbsp;°F) and 22.064 [[Pascal (pressure)|MPa]].

An unusual feature of the water phase diagram is that the solid–liquid phase line (illustrated by the dotted green line) has a negative slope. For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase, which causes melting.

Another interesting though not unusual feature of the phase diagram is the point where the solid–liquid phase line meets the liquid–gas phase line. The intersection is referred to as the [[triple point]]. At the triple point, all three phases can coexist.

Experimentally, the phase lines are relatively easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See [[Gibbs' phase rule]]. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging the right amount of water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.

==Interfacial phenomena==
{{further|Surface science}}
Between two phases in equilibrium there is a narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, it can have significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit [[surface tension]]. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding the behavior of a particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase.

==Crystal phases==

A single material may have several distinct solid states capable of forming separate phases. Water is a well-known example of such a material. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|ice I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]], the [[rhombohedral crystal system|rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms. [[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]], [[graphite]], and [[fullerene]]s are different allotropes of [[carbon]].

==Phase transitions==
{{main|Phase transition}}
When a substance undergoes a phase transition (changes from one [[state of matter]] to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See [[Enthalpy of vaporization]]. The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the [[enthalpy of fusion]] and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the [[enthalpy of sublimation]].

&lt;br /&gt;

== Phases out of equilibrium ==
While phases of matter are traditionally defined for systems in thermal equilibrium, work on quantum [[Many body localization|many-body localized]] (MBL) systems has provided a framework for defining phases out of equilibrium. MBL phases never reach thermal equilibrium, and can allow for new forms of order disallowed in equilibrium via a phenomenon known as [[localization protected quantum order.]] The transitions between different MBL phases and between MBL and thermalizing phases are novel dynamical phase transitions whose properties are active areas of research.

A '''pressure–volume diagram''' (or '''PV diagram''', or '''volume–pressure loop''')&lt;ref&gt;{{GeorgiaPhysiology|3/3ch5/s3ch5_16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used to describe corresponding changes in [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] and [[pressure]] in a system.  They are commonly used in [[thermodynamics]], [[cardiovascular physiology]], and [[respiratory physiology]].

PV diagrams, originally called '''indicator diagrams''', were developed in the 18th century as tools for understanding the efficiency of [[steam engine]]s.

==Description==
A PV diagram plots the change in pressure ''P'' with respect to volume ''V'' for some [[thermodynamic process|process]] or processes.  Typically in thermodynamics, the set of processes forms a [[thermodynamic cycle|cycle]], so that upon completion of the cycle there has been no net change in [[thermodynamic state|state]] of the system; i.e. the device returns to the starting pressure and volume.

The figure shows the features of a typical PV diagram.  A series of numbered states (1 through 4) are noted.  The path between each state consists of some process (A through D) which alters the pressure or volume of the system (or both).
[[File:P-v diagram of a simple cycle.svg|none|230px|Generalized PV diagram]]
A key feature of the diagram is that the amount of energy expended or received by the system as [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] can be estimated as the area under the curve on the chart.  For a cyclic diagram, the net work is that ''enclosed'' by the curve.  In the example given in the figure, the processes 1-2-3 produce a work output, but processes from 3-4-1 require a smaller energy input to return to the starting position / state;  thus the net work is the difference between the two.

Note that this figure is highly idealized, and a diagram showing the processes in a real device would tend to depict a more complex shape of the PV curve.  (See section Applications, below).

==History==
[[Image:Indicator diagram.png|thumb|right|Watt's indicator diagram]]
[[Image:Steam indicator (Steam and the Steam Engine - Land and Marine, 1875).jpg|thumb|right|Richard's indicator instrument of 1875]]
The PV diagram, then called an indicator diagram, was developed by [[James Watt]] and his employee [[John Southern (engineer)|John Southern]] (1758–1815) to improve the [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]] of engines.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Hunt (2010) ''Pursuing Power and Light'', page 13, [[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8018-9359-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796, Southern developed the simple, but critical, technique to generate the diagram by fixing a board so as to move with the piston, thereby tracing the "volume" axis, while a [[pencil]], attached to a [[pressure gauge]], moved at right angles to the piston, tracing "pressure".

The gauge enabled Watt to calculate the work done by the steam while ensuring that its pressure had dropped to zero by the end of the stroke, thereby ensuring that all useful [[energy]] had been extracted. The total work could be calculated from the area between the "volume" axis and the traced line. The latter fact had been realised by [[Davies Gilbert]] as early as 1792 and used by [[Jonathan Hornblower]] in [[litigation]] against Watt over [[patent]]s on various designs. [[Daniel Bernoulli]] had also had the insight about how to calculate work.

Watt used the diagram to make radical improvements to steam engine performance and long kept it a trade secret. Though it was made public in a letter to the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Science]]'' in 1822,&lt;ref&gt;(Anonymous), "Account of a steam-engine indicator," ''Quarterly Journal of Science'', vol. 13, page 95 (1822).&lt;/ref&gt; it remained somewhat obscure. [[John Farey, Jr.]] only learned of it on seeing it used, probably by Watt's men, when he visited Russia in 1826.

In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] used a diagram of pressure against volume to illustrate and elucidate the [[Carnot cycle]], elevating it to a central position in the study of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clapeyron, E. (1834) "Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur" (Memoir on the motive power of heat), ''Journal de l'École Royale Polytechnique'', vol. 14, no. 23, pages 153–190, 160–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later instruments (''illus.'') used paper wrapped around a cylindrical barrel with a pressure piston inside it, the rotation of the barrel coupled to the piston crosshead by a weight- or spring-tensioned wire.

In 1869 the British marine engineer [[Nicholas Procter Burgh]] wrote a full book on the indicator diagram explaining the device step by step. He had noticed that "a very large proportion of the young members of the engineering profession look at an indicator diagram as a mysterious production."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Procter Burgh]]. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qSdWAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 The Indicator Diagram Practically Considered].'' E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 1869. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Thermodynamics===
PV diagrams can be used to estimate the net work performed by a [[thermodynamic cycle]].  The net work is the area enclosed by the PV curve in the diagram.  This usage derived from the development of indicator diagrams which were used to estimate the performance of a [[steam engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the diagram records the [[pressure]] of steam versus the volume of steam in a [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder]], throughout a [[piston]]'s cycle of motion in a steam engine.  The diagram enables calculation of the [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] performed and thus can provide a measure of the power produced by the engine.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Hills and A. J. Pacey (January 1972) "The measurement of power in early steam-driven textile mills," ''Technology and Culture'', vol. 13, no. 1, pages 25–43.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Indicator diagram steam admission.svg|none|450px||Indicator diagram for steam locomotive]]

To exactly calculate the work done by the system it is necessary to calculate the integral of the pressure with respect to volume.  One can often quickly calculate this using the PV diagram as it is simply the area enclosed by the cycle.

Note that in some cases [[specific volume]] will be plotted on the x-axis instead of volume, in which case the area under the curve represents work per unit mass of the working fluid (i.e. J/kg).

{{main|Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology}}
In [[cardiovascular physiology]], the diagram is often applied to the [[left ventricle]], and it can be mapped to specific events of the [[cardiac cycle]]. [[Pressure-volume loop analysis in cardiology|PV loop studies]] are widely used in basic research and [[Biomedical research|preclinical testing]], to [[Pressure-Volume Loop Analysis in Cardiology|characterize the intact heart's performance under various situations]] (effect of drugs, disease, characterization of mouse [[Strain (biology)|strains]]),

The sequence of events occurring in every heart cycle is as follows. The left figure shows a PV loop from a real experiment; letters refer to points.

* '''A''' is the end-[[Diastole|diastolic]] point; this is the point where contraction begins. Pressure starts to increase, becomes rapidly higher than the atrial pressure, and the mitral valve closes. Since pressure is also lower than the aortic pressure, the aortic valve is closed as well.
* Segment '''AB''' is the contraction phase. Since both the mitral and aortic valves are closed, volume is constant. For this reason, this phase is called isovolumic contraction.
* At point '''B''', pressure becomes higher than the aortic pressure and the aortic valve opens, initiating ejection.
* '''BC''' is the ejection phase, volume decreases. At the end of this phase, pressure lowers again and falls below aortic pressure. The aortic valve closes.
* Point '''C''' is the end-[[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] point.
* Segment '''CD''' is the isovolumic relaxation. During this phase, pressure continues to fall. The mitral valve and aortic valve are both closed again so volume is constant.
* At point '''D''' pressure falls below the atrial pressure and the mitral valve opens, initiating ventricular filling.
* '''DA''' is the [[Diastole|diastolic]] filling period. Blood flows from the left atrium to the left ventricle. Atrial contraction completes ventricular filling.

As it can be seen, the PV loop forms a roughly rectangular shape and each loop is formed in an anti-clockwise direction.

Very useful information can be derived by examination and analysis of individual loops or series of loops, for example: 
* the horizontal distance between the top-left corner and the bottom-right corner of each loop is the [[stroke volume]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.uc.edu/kranias/cardiac_function.htm Diagram at uc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;
* the line joining the top-left corner of several loops is the contractile or [[inotropic state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cvphysiology.com/Heart%20Failure/HF005.htm Systolic dysfunction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''QAGS''' (''Quick Ass Game System'') is a [[generic role-playing game system]] for use in [[freeform role-playing game]]s.  QAGS is not tied to any particular genre or setting, and has been used to run everything from paranormal teenagers to post-apocalyptic super-heroes to fantasy sailing adventure to gun-toting monster hunters to "hard-core" luchadore action to Regency romance to 80’s cartoons to Shakespeare meets Tarantino.&lt;ref&gt;“FAQ: Can you really play anything with QAGS" [http://www.hexgames.com/main/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;task=cat&amp;catid=24&amp;Itemid=97]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} broken link&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, three gamers (Steve Johnson, Leighton Connor, and Dale French) published the First Edition of the game after a year of development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hexgames.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1&amp;Itemid=15 “About Hex Games”]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Since then, QAGS (pronounced "kwags") has  been updated with a Second Edition, and the publisher, Hex Games, has continued to release games.

To date, Hex Games has used the core system for ''M-Force: Monster Hunting In The 21st Century'', ''Rasslin’'', ''Qerth'', ''The Adventures Of Sindbad'', ''Rocket Jocks'', ''Weird Times At Charles Fort High'', 
''Funkadelic Frankenstein on the Mean Streets of Monstertown'', "Hobomancer", "Edison Force", and "The Pytheas Club", as well as several stand alone adventures such as ''Deep Space Rescue'' and ''The Dungeon Of Moderate Annoyance (Not Nearly So Bad As The Dungeon Of Infinite Pain)''.

In 2001, Hex Games was the Gaming Guest of Honor at Marcon 36. In 2006, Hex was the "Gaming Guest" of Honor at Archon 30.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archonstl.org/30/index2.html  "Archon 30"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230060043/http://www.archonstl.org/30/index2.html |date=December 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Game mechanics ==
In QAGS, player characters are defined by six Words.  Body, Brain, and Nerve represent the character’s physical, "intellectual" and mental (willpower and social skills, for example) abilities.  Job, Gimmick and Weakness represent what the character does, what makes him unique in the world, and what limits him in a grand Shakespearean way.  These last three Words are qualified.  For example, a character’s Job might be “Animal Control Officer”, his Gimmick “Hide In Plain Sight”, and his Weakness “Dies if touches peanut butter”.  Each of these six Words is assigned a Number ranging from 6 to 16.  Skills, areas of knowledge that round out the character, with Numbers ranging from +1 to +5 are also assigned, and they will be used to modify target numbers when rolls are called for.  Numbers are generated by using either the Qik Start system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hexgames.com/qags2e/index.php/hikashop-menu-for-categories-listing/product/102-qags-qik-start-rules-pdf|title=QAGS Qik-Start Rules|website=www.hexgames.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; that relies on dice-rolling, or the Point Built system in which the player is given a certain number of points with which to create the character.

Player characters are further fleshed out by assigning them a Tag Line (something that the character routinely says, such as “Jinkies, a Clue!”), WWPHITM (Who Will Play Him/Her In The Movie), and any number of Dumb Facts.

When the Game Master determines that a character’s action goes beyond what would be considered normal or everyday, she decides what Word is applicable and use that Word’s Number as the target number.  If no Word is applicable, the GM will use half the player’s Body, Brain or Nerve Number rounded down as a default target number.   Any Skill modifiers are added to determine the modified target number.  Then she asks the player to roll a 20-sided die; no other dice are required to play QAGS.  The number rolled on the die is then compared to the modified target "number" assigned to the appropriate Word.  If the roll is under the modified target number, the action succeeds; over the modified target number, a failure.  If two characters are in opposition, hand-to-hand combat for example, then the higher successful role is the one that actually succeeds.

In an example of play, Our Hero, Rollo the Superspy, wants to impress Isvestia, a beautiful Ruritanian counterintelligence agent, at the casino in Monte Carlo.  He adds his +2 skill in “Tango Dancing” to the 12 of his “Superspy” Job, which she will oppose with her 15 Nerve.  He rolls a 13 while she rolls a 4.  Both are "successful", but his roll, being higher, is the one that succeeds.  The result should be that he has her eating out of his hand, but Rollo also has “Overplays His Hand” for a Weakness with a Number of 13.  He rolls a 9, and the Weakness wins and takes effect, thus releasing Isvestia from her fascination.

Simple dice-rolling is augmented by the use of Yum Yums. Yum Yums&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hexgames.com/main/index.php?option=com_easyfaq&amp;task=cat&amp;catid=24&amp;Itemid=97#faq3 “FAQ: Yum Yums? Really? Yum Yums?”]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; are anything compact and edible, anything from hard candies to potato chips. Yum Yums may be used to buy automatic successes, chances to re-roll failed rolls, and to modify things like damage given and taken. They also give players a chance to take control of a game and determine details about the game world. Additional Yum Yums are handed out for advancing the plot, role-playing well, or making the GM snort lemonade out her nose.

In the play example of Rollo the Superspy (eyeballing Isvestia across the ballroom floor), he can throw the GM a Yum Yum instead of rolling dice, granting him an automatic success in his attempt to impress Isvestia. The GM again invokes his weakness, but Rollo can throw another Yum Yum to avoid having his Weakness take effect.  Now Isvestia's ready to tell him "anything".

== Complexity ==
QAGS can be as complex or as simple as the GM and players want it to be, and the rules can be easily adapted to include whatever mechanic a new setting might require.  For example, ''Rasslin’'' needed to add a mechanic for resolving the showy combat of professional wrestling; ''Rocket Jocks'' needed rules for spaceship combat; and ''Weird Times at Charles Fort High'' needed an alternative point-build character generation system to balance the different paranormal characters.

The '''red-eared slider''' (''Trachemys scripta elegans''), also known as the '''red-eared [[terrapin]]''', is a semiaquatic [[turtle]] belonging to the family [[Emydidae]]. It is a subspecies of the [[Trachemys scripta|pond slider]]. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="principal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorial.selfip.com/inicio/productos/aquaguia/aqua_2003/jul_agos_03/pags/tortugas.htm|title=Las Tortugas|accessdate=20 July 2007|author=Boylan Sánchez Efrén|publisher=Ed.

The red-eared slider is included in the [[list of globally invasive species|list of the world's 100 most invasive species]]&lt;ref&gt;Lowe S., Browne M., Boudjelas S. (2000). 100 of the World’s Worst Invasive Alien Species. A Selection From the Global Invasive Species Database.

== Name ==
[[File:lakiandloki.jpg|thumb|left|Red-eared sliders are popular pets around the world.]] 
The red-eared slider get its name from the small red stripe around its ears and from its ability to slide quickly off rocks and logs into the water. This species was previously known as Troost's turtle in honor of an American herpetologist [[Gerard Troost]]. ''Trachemys scripta troostii'' is now the scientific name for another subspecies, the [[Cumberland slider]].

== Taxonomy ==
The red-eared slider belongs to the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Testudines]] which contains about 250 turtle species. It is a subspecies of ''[[Trachemys scripta]]''. It was previously classified under the name ''Chrysemys scripta elegans''.

The species ''Trachemys scripta'' contains three subspecies: ''T. s. elegans'' (red-eared slider), ''T. s. scripta'' (yellow-bellied slider), and ''T. s. troostii'' (Cumberland slider).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Win Kirkpatrick, Amanda Page  |author2=Marion Massam  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Pond Slider (Trachemys scripta) risk assessments for Australia. |date= November 2007 |publisher=Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia. |format=PDF |url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/reference_files/ausriskassessments/trascr.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Sheldonbasking.JPG|thumb|left|Red-eared slider basking on a floating platform under a [[sunlamp]]]]
[[File:RedEaredSliderShellyPlastron.jpg|thumb|left|Plastron of a young red-eared slider turtle]]
The [[carapace]] of this species can reach more than {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, but the average length ranges from {{convert|15|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belonweb.com/tortugas/tortuga.htm |title=Tortugas: La Tortuga de Florida |accessdate=21 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The females of the species are usually larger than the males. They typically live between 20 and 30 years, although some individuals have lived for more than 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mascotasenlinea.cl/MascExot/PME_PrincipTORTUGA.htm |title=Tortuga de orejas rojas |accessdate=21 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027233222/http://www.mascotasenlinea.cl/MascExot/PME_PrincipTORTUGA.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their life expectancy is shorter when they are kept in [[Captivity (animal)|captivity]].&lt;ref name="mancha" /&gt; The quality of their living environment has a strong influence on their lifespans and [[quality of life|well being]].

[[File:Pata Tortuga.JPG|thumb|Female turtle’s foot: Note the short claws.]]

These turtles are [[poikilotherm]]s, meaning they are unable to regulate their body temperatures independently; they are completely dependent on the temperature of their environment.&lt;ref name="principal" /&gt; For this reason, they need to sunbathe frequently to warm themselves and maintain their body temperatures.

The shell is divided into two sections: the upper or dorsal [[carapace]], and the lower, ventral carapace or [[plastron]].&lt;ref name="principal" /&gt; The upper carapace consists of the vertebral [[scutes]], which form the central, elevated portion; pleural scutes that are located around the vertebral scutes; and then the marginal scutes around the edge of the carapace. The rear marginal scutes are notched. The scutes are bony [[keratin]]ous elements. The carapace is oval and flattened (especially in the male) and has a weak [[keel]] that is more pronounced in the young.&lt;ref name="hibernar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.elestanque.com/articulos/tortugas_en_estanques.html|title=Tortugas en Estanques de jardín |accessdate=21 July 2007 |author=Rodríguez Garrido  María del Carmen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color of the carapace changes depending on the age of the turtle. The carapace usually has a dark green background with light and dark, highly variable markings. In young or recently hatched turtles, it is leaf [[green]] and gets slightly darker as a turtle gets older, until it is a very dark green, and then turns a shade between [[brown]] and [[Olive (color)|olive green]]. The plastron is always a light yellow with dark, paired, irregular markings in the centre of most scutes. The plastron is highly variable in pattern. The head, legs, and tail are green with fine, irregular, yellow lines. The whole shell is covered in these stripes and markings that aid in [[Mimicry|camouflaging]] an individual.

[[File:Tortue floride france.JPG|thumb|left|The turtle can retract its head and extremities inside its shell if it feels threatened.]]

Turtles also have a complete [[Skeleton|skeletal system]], with partially webbed feet that help them to swim and that can be withdrawn inside the carapace along with the head and tail. The red stripe on each side of the head distinguishes the red-eared slider from all other North American species and gives this species its name, as the stripe is located behind the [[eye]]s where their (external) ears would be. These stripes may lose their color over time.&lt;ref name="mancha"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://es.vivapets.com/breed/tortuga_de_orejas_rojas/123|title=Tortuga de Orejas Rojas|accessdate=21 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711215013/http://es.vivapets.com/breed/tortuga_de_orejas_rojas/123|archivedate=11 July 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals can also have a small mark of the same color on the top of their heads. The red-eared slider does not have a visible [[outer ear]] or an external auditory canal; instead, it relies on a [[middle ear]] entirely covered by a cartilaginous tympanic disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Jakob Christensen-Dalsgaard, Christian Brandt, Katie L. Willis, Christian Bech Christensen, Darlene Ketten, Peggy Edds-Walton, Richard R. Fay, Peter T. Madsen and Catherine E. Carr|title= Specialization for underwater hearing by the tympanic middle ear of the turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans |url= http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/03/16/rspb.2012.0290.full |publisher= The Royal Society |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2012.0290 |pmid= 22438494 |pmc= 3367789 |volume=279 |issue= 1739 |pages=2816–2824|year= 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main internal organs of these reptiles are the [[lungs]], [[heart]], [[stomach]], [[liver]],  [[intestine]]s, and the [[urinary bladder]]. A [[cloaca]] serves both excretory and reproductive functions.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
[[File:Turle124.jpg|thumb|right|Male red-eared slider: Note the large claws on the front foot]]

Some [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphism]] exists between males and females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Trachemys_scripta.html |title=Animal Diversity Web: '&amp;#39;Tachemys scripta'&amp;#39; |publisher=Animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red-eared slider young look practically identical regardless of their sex, making it difficult to determine their sex. However, there is another method to determine their sex, by inspecting the markings under their carapace. These markings will fade as the turtles age. It is much easier to distinguish the sex of adults, as the shells of mature males are smaller than those of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= J Whitfield Gibbons |author2= Jeffery E Lovich |lastauthoramp= yes |title= Sexual Dimorphism in Turtles with Emphasis on the Slider Turtle (Trachemys scripta) |url= http://www.cnah.org/pdf_files/105.pdf |publisher= The Herpetological League |journal= Herpetological Monographs |year= 1990 |volume= 4 |doi= 10.2307/1466966 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131105184800/http://www.cnah.org/pdf_files/105.pdf |archivedate= 2013-11-05 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Male red-eared sliders reach sexual maturity when their carapaces' diameters measure {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} and females reach maturity when their carapaces measure 15&amp;nbsp;cm. Both male and females reach sexual maturity at five to six years.
The male is normally smaller than the female, although this parameter is sometimes difficult to apply as individuals being compared could be of different ages.

Males have longer [[claw]]s on their front feet than the females; this helps them to hold on to a female during [[mating]] and is used during [[courtship display]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=H Mohan-Gibbons  |author2=T Norton  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Behaviour of Exotic Pets |editor= V V Tynes |chapter= Turtles, tortoises and terrapins  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Dj4RbHOBztQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Blackwell Publishing |year= 2010 |isbn= 978 0 8138 0078 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The male's tail is thicker and longer. Typically, the cloacal opening of the female is at or under the rear edge of the carapace, while the male's opening occurs beyond the edge of the carapace. The male's plastron is slightly [[Concave polygon|concave]], while that of the female is completely flat. The male's concave plastron also helps to stabilize the male on the female's carapace during mating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= DP O’Rourke and J Schumacher |title= Laboratory Animal Medicine |editor1=James G. Fox |editor2=Lynn C. Anderson |editor3=Franklin M. Loew |editor4=Fred W. Quimby |chapter= Biology and Diseases of Reptiles  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=m2ftfPMJnMMC&amp;pg=PA843&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Academic Press |year= 2002 |isbn= 978 0 12 263951 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older males can sometimes have a dark greyish-olive green [[melanistic]] coloration, with very subdued markings. The red stripe on the sides of the head may be difficult to see or be absent. The female's appearance is substantially the same throughout her life.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The red-eared slider originated from the area around the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]], in warm climates in the southeastern United States. Their native areas range from the southeast of [[Colorado]] to [[Virginia]] and [[Florida]]. In nature, they inhabit areas with a source of still, warm water, such as [[pond]]s, [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s, [[Creek (stream)|creeks]], [[stream]]s, or slow-flowing [[river]]s. They live in areas of calm water where they are able to leave the water easily by climbing onto rocks or tree trunks so they can warm up in the sun. Individuals are often found sunbathing in a group or even on top of each other. They also require abundant aquatic plants, as these are

== Behavior ==
Red-eared sliders are almost entirely aquatic, but as they are cold-blooded, they leave the water to sunbathe to regulate their temperature. 

[[File:RES flipping over.ogv|thumb|Flipping over procedure extending the neck]]

=== Hibernation ===

Red-eared sliders do not [[Hibernation|hibernate]], but actually [[Brumation|brumate]]; while they become less active, they do occasionally rise to the surface for food or air. Brumation can occur to varying degrees. In the wild, red-eared sliders brumate over the winter at the bottoms of ponds or shallow lakes. They generally become inactive in October, when temperatures fall below {{convert|10|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="hibernar" /&gt; During this time, the turtles enter a state of [[sopor (sleep)|sopor]], during which they do not eat or defecate, they remain nearly motionless, and the frequency of their breathing falls.
Individuals usually brumate underwater, but they have also been found under banks and rocks, and in hollow stumps. In warmer winter climates, they can become active and come to the surface for basking. When the temperature begins to drop again, however, they quickly return to a brumation state. Sliders generally come up for food in early March to as late as the end of April.

During brumation, ''T. s. elegans'' can survive anaerobically for weeks, producing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] from [[glycolysis]]. The turtle's metabolic rate drops dramatically, with heart rate and cardiac output dropping by 80% to minimise energy requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Egg-tooth2.jpg|thumb|Hatching turtle with its egg tooth]]
[[File:Red Eared Slider laying egg.jpg|right|thumb|Female laying eggs in a nest she dug out with her hind legs]]
[[Courtship]] and [[mating]] activities for red-eared sliders usually occur between March and July, and take place under water. During courtship, the male swims around the female and flutters or vibrates the back side of his long claws on and around her face and head, possibly to direct [[pheromone]]s towards her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=J Chitty  |author2=A Raftery  |lastauthoramp=yes |title= Essentials of Tortoise Medicine and Surgery |chapter= Biology |page= 38 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=waYRAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= Wiley Blackwell |year= 2013 |isbn= 978 1 4051 9544 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The female swims toward the male and, if she is receptive, sinks to the bottom for mating. If the female is not receptive, she may become aggressive towards the male. Courtship can last 45 minutes, but mating takes only 10 minutes.&lt;ref name=NOBANIS /&gt;
 
[[File:Turtles Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of red-eared sliders.]]

On occasion, a male may appear to be courting another male, and when kept in captivity may also show this behaviour towards other household pets. Between male turtles, it could be a sign of dominance and may preclude a fight. Young turtles may carry out the courtship dance before they reach sexual maturity at five years of age, but they are unable to mate.&lt;ref name="reprod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reslider.free.fr/es/index.html |title=Reproducción |accessdate=21 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121225041548/http://reslider.free.fr/es/index.html |archivedate=25 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After mating, the female spends extra time basking to keep her eggs warm.&lt;ref name="reprod" /&gt; She may also have a change of diet, eating only certain foods, or not eating as much as she normally would. A female can lay between two and 30 eggs depending on body size and other factors.&lt;ref name=daisie /&gt; One female can lay up to five clutches in the same year, and clutches are usually spaced 12 to 36 days apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nlbif.eti.uva.nl/bis/turtles.php?selected=beschrijving&amp;menuentry=soorten&amp;record=Trachemys%20scripta |title=Trachemys scripta; Turtles of the World by Ernst, et al |publisher=Nlbif.eti.uva.nl |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66BiakPPJ?url=http://wbd.etibioinformatics.nl/bis/turtles.php?selected=beschrijving |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The time between mating and egg-laying can be days or weeks. The actual egg fertilization takes place during the egg-laying. This process also permits the laying of fertile eggs the following season, as the sperm can remain viable and available in the female's body in the absence of mating. During the last weeks of gestation, the female spends less time in the water and smells and scratches at the ground, indicating she is searching for a suitable place to lay her eggs. The female excavates a hole, using her hind legs, and lays her eggs in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlas.drpez.org/Trachemys_scripta_elegans |title=Trachemys scripta elegans (Tortuga de orejas rojas) |accessdate=21 July 2007 |author=Loza V.

Incubation takes 59 to 112 days.&lt;ref name="daisie"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.europe-aliens.org/pdf/Trachemys_scripta.pdf |title= Trachemys scripta |last= Scalera |first= Riccardo |website= Delivering Alien Invasive Species Inventories for Europe |publisher= Europe Aliens |accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late-season hatchlings may spend the winter in the nest and emerge when the weather warms in the spring. Just prior to hatching, the egg contains 50% turtle and 50% egg sac. A new hatchling breaks open its egg with its [[egg tooth]], which falls out about an hour after hatching. This egg tooth never grows back. Hatchlings may stay inside their eggshells after hatching for the first day or two. If they are forced to leave the eggshell before they are ready, they will return if possible. When a hatchling decides to leave the shell, it still has a small sac protruding from its plastron. The yolk sac is vital and provides nourishment while visible, and several days later it will have been absorbed into the turtle's belly. The sac must be absorbed, and does not fall off. The split must heal on its own before the turtle is able to swim. The time between the egg hatching and water entry is 21 days.

Damage to or inordinate motion of the protruding egg yolk, enough to allow air into the turtle's body, results in death. This is the main reason for marking the top of turtle eggs if their relocation is required for any reason. An egg turned upside down will eventually terminate the embryo's growth by the sac smothering the embryo. If it manages to reach term, the turtle will try to flip over with the yolk sac, which would allow air into the body cavity and cause death. The other fatal danger is water getting into the body cavity before the sac is absorbed completely and while the opening has not completely healed yet.

The sex of red-eared sliders is determined by the [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|incubation temperature]] during critical phases of the embryos' development. Only males are produced when eggs are incubated at temperatures of {{convert|22|-|27|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, whereas females develop at warmer temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://naturemappingfoundation.org/natmap/facts/red-eared_slider_712.html Washington NatureMapping Program, Animal Facts: Red-eared Slider.] Retrieved: 2012-11-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Colder temperatures result in the death of the embryos.

===Infection risks and United States federal regulations on commercial distribution===
[[File:Red-eared sliders and Mallard in Golden Gate Park 1.jpg|thumb|right| A line of basking red-eared sliders faces an inquisitive mallard.]]

Reptiles are asymptomatic (meaning they suffer no adverse side effects) [[Asymptomatic carrier|carriers]] of bacteria of the genus ''[[Salmonella]]''.&lt;ref name="salmonella"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiendanimal.es/articulo.php?id=59&amp;languages_id=3&amp;categoria=20 |title= Tortuga de orejas rojas |accessdate=21 July 2007 |author=Iglesias  Isabel}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has given rise to justifiable concerns given the many instances of infection of humans caused by the handling of turtles,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm?s_cid=mm5703a3_e Multistate Outbreak of Human Salmonella Infections Associated with Exposure to Turtles]&lt;/ref&gt; which has led to restrictions in the sale of red-eared sliders in the USA. A 1975 [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulation bans the sale (for general commercial and public use) of both turtle eggs and turtles with a carapace length of less than {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}}. This regulation comes under the Public Health Service Act, and is enforced by the FDA in cooperation with state and local health jurisdictions. The ban was enacted because of the public health impact of turtle-associated [[salmonellosis]]. Turtles and turtle eggs found to be offered for sale in violation of this provision are subject to destruction in accordance with FDA procedures. A fine of up to $1,001 and/or imprisonment for up to one year is the penalty for those who refuse to comply with a valid final demand for destruction of such turtles or their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gctts.org/node/31 GCTTS FAQ: "4 Inch Law"], actually an FDA regulation&lt;/ref&gt; Many stores and flea markets still sell small turtles due to an exception in the FDA regulation which allows turtles under {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} to be sold "for ''[[bona fide]]'' scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes, other than use as pets."&lt;ref&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/12feb20041500/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/21cfr1240.62.htm Turtles intrastate and interstate requirements]; FDA Regulation, Sec. 1240.62, page 678 part d1.&lt;/ref&gt; As with many other animals and inanimate objects, the risk of ''Salmonella'' exposure can be reduced by following basic rules of cleanliness. Small children must be taught to wash their hands immediately after they finish playing with the turtle, feeding it, or changing its water.

===US state law===
Some states have other laws and regulations regarding possession of red-eared sliders because they can be an invasive species where they are not native and have been introduced through the pet trade. Now, it is illegal in Florida to sell any wild-type red-eared slider, as they interbreed with the local [[yellow-bellied slider]] population — ''Trachemys scripta scripta'' is another subspecies of [[pond slider]]s, and hybrids typically combine the markings of the two subspecies. However, unusual color varieties such as albino and pastel red-eared sliders, which are derived from captive breeding, are still allowed for sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newszap.com/articles/2007/06/30/fl/lake_okeechobee/aok02.txt Turtle ban begins today; New state law], ''newszap.com'', 2007-07-01.

==An invasive species in Australia==
In Australia, breeding populations have been found in New South Wales and Queensland, and individual turtles have been found in the wild in Victoria, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia.&lt;ref name="daf.qld.gov.au"&gt;Csurhes S, Hankamer C. (2012, updated 2016). "Red-eared slider turtle" Invasive animal risk assessment; Biosecurity Queensland, Queensland Government, https://www.daf.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/76836/IPA-Red-Eared-Slider-Turtle-Risk-Assessment.pdf; retrieved 2017-05-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Red-eared slider turtles are considered a significant threat to native turtle species – they mature more quickly, grow larger, produce more offspring and are more aggressive.&lt;ref name="daf.qld.gov.au"/&gt; Numerous studies provide evidence that red-eared slider turtles can out-compete native turtles for food and nesting and basking sites.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see Polo-Cavia, N, López, P and Martín, J (2010). "Competitive interactions during basking between native and invasive freshwater turtle species" ''Biological Invasions'' 12(7):2141–2152.&lt;/ref&gt; Because red-eared slider turtles eat plants as well as animals, they could also have a negative impact on a range of native aquatic species, including rare frogs.&lt;ref&gt;O’Keefe, S. (2005). "Investing in conjecture: Eradicating the red-eared slider in Queensland" 13th Australasian Vertebrate Pest Conference, Wellington, New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a significant risk that red-eared slider turtles will transfer diseases and parasites to native reptile species.  There is evidence that a malaria-like parasite was spread to two wild turtle populations in Lane Cove River, Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Agriculture and Food (2009). "Red-eared slider animal pest alert no. 6/2009" Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia.Social and economic impacts&lt;/ref&gt;

Social and economic costs are also likely to be substantial. The Queensland government has invested close to $1 million AUD in eradication programs to date.&lt;ref name="daf.qld.gov.au"/&gt; As outlined in the foregoing section, the turtle may also have significant public health costs due to the impacts of turtle-associated salmonella on human health. Outbreaks in multiple states and fatalities in children, associated with handling salmonella-infected turtles, have been recorded in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Disease Control (2007).  "Turtle associated salmonellosis in humans—United States 2006–2007, Center for Disease Control" ''MMWR Weekly'' 56(26):649–652.&lt;/ref&gt; Salmonella can also spread to humans when turtles contaminate drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford, M (2008). "Risk assessment models for establishment of exotic vertebrates in Australia and New Zealand" Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre, Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been varying degrees of action by state governments to date, ranging from ongoing eradication efforts by the Queensland government to very little action by the government of New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Invasive Species Council (2014). "Biosecurity Failures in Australia: Red-eared slider turtles" https://invasives.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Biosecurity-failures-red-eared-slider-turtles.pdf. Retrieved 2017-05-29&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have ranked the species as high priority for management in Australia and are calling for a national prevention and eradication strategy, including a concerted education and compliance program to stop the illegal trade, possession and release of slider turtles.&lt;ref&gt;For example see, Massam, M, Kirkpatrick, W &amp; Page, A (2010). "Assessment and prioritisation of risk for forty introduced animal species" Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre, Canberra; and Invasive Species Council; 2014; Biosecurity Failures in Australia: Red-eared slider turtles; https://invasives.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Biosecurity-failures-red-eared-slider-turtles.pdf. Retrieved 2017-05-29).&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Within the second volume of the ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', the popular comic book heroes were revealed as specimens of the red-eared slider. The popularity of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|Turtles]] led to a craze for keeping them as pets in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], and subsequent ecological havoc as turtles were accidentally or deliberately released into the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1660334.stm |title=ENGLAND &amp;#124; 'Hero Turtle' craze leads to duck deaths |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-11-16 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RedToL''', or Red Algal Tree of Life, is part of the collaborative [[National Science Foundation]] Assembling the Tree of Life activity (AToL), funded through the Division of [[Environmental Biology]], Directorate for [[Biological Sciences]]. The overall goal of AToL is to resolve [[evolutionary]] relationships for large groups of organisms throughout the history of life, with the research often involving large teams working across institutions and disciplines.  Investigators are typically supported for projects in data acquisition, analysis, algorithm development and dissemination in [[computational phylogenetics]] and phyloinformatics.

The Phylogenetic and Genomic Approaches to Reconstructing the Red Algal Tree of Life focus on the [[Rhodophyta]] ([[Rhodophyta|red algae]]), one of the most ancient [[eukaryotic]] [[phylum|phyla]] with [[fossil]] evidence for Bangiales stretching back 1.2 billion years. Red algae are not only key members of [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] and [[freshwater]] [[Aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]] environments but they are sources for important human foods such as [[dulse]] and [[sushi]] wrap, and have a multitude of pharmaceutical and industrial uses (e.g., [[agarose]] and [[carrageenans]]). Perhaps most important is the role red algae played in [[symbiogenesis]]. A red alga was the ancient (&gt;1 billion years ago) donor of the [[plastid]] in [[chlorophyll c1|chlorophyll c]]-containing algae ([[heterokonta]] or stramenophiles) that rose to prominence in marine ecosystems after the end of [[Permian]] with groups such as [[diatoms]] currently providing ca. 20% of global fixed [[carbon]].

==Aims==
The aims of RedToL are: 1) reconstruct a robust [[phylogeny]] of 471 red algal species using a [[concatenated]] dataset of 2 [[cell nucleus|nuclear]], 4 [[plastid]], and 2 [[mitochondrial]] encoded gene markers; 2) sequence plastid [[genome]]s and generate [[transcriptome]] databases for 16 key taxa that represent the phylogenetic (e.g., class- and order-level) breadth of the red algae, 3) make freely available red algal multi-gene and genome data via release to [[GenBank]] and a project-specific web site.  The outreach and student mentoring program is an important component of the RedToL initiative.

The 471 chosen [[species]] from 294 [[genera]] represent the diversity of ca. 6,000 red algal species (i.e., ca. 35% of all red algal genera will be included, which represent all extant orders). The robust phylogenetic framework resulting from this study is the basis for a comprehensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revision of the red algae and provides the basis for interpreting key innovations during red algal [[evolution]]. Because the chosen marker genes are shared across different Assembling the Tree of Life (AToL) projects, it will provide a common framework for a future comprehensive [[eukaryotic]] tree. Complete plastid genome and transcriptome data from 16 major red algal taxa will provide a genome inventory to facilitate understanding of red algal evolution, as well as provide the basis for phylogenetic analyses using a rich set (i.e., 100s) of vertically inherited genes. The genome data will specifically test the relationships among the major classes and orders of red algae. The RedToL team members come from eight institutions including two foreign collaborators and fifteen advisory board members and represent the most prominent active national and international red algal specialists from different generations who use different methods (from [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] to [[phylogenomics]]) to enhance understanding of red algal biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">{{italic title}}'''''Relaxado en persona''''' is a Spanish phrase, literally meaning "relaxed in person", but a euphemism for "[[Death by burning|burnt at the stake]]" in the records of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The majority of those "relaxed in person" from 1484 onwards were ''relapsos'' (relapsed Jews) or ''herejes'' (heretics, but also often Jews). Use of the term in source material continues until 1659 or later.

Examples:
* ''Alvaro de Segovia.. hereje judio relaxado en persona á 13 Setiembre 1485''.&lt;ref&gt;[[José Amador de los Ríos]] ''Historia social, política y religiosa de los judíos de España y Portugal'' (3 vols., Madrid, 1875-76) Volume 3 1876 p616&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Violante de Calatayud, muger de Francisco Clemente, heretico Judio, relaxado en persona en 18. de Março 1486''.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Böhm. ''Judíos en Chile colonial''. Editorial Universitaria  Santiago, Chile   1963 p111&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''herege Judaizante Relapso Relaxado en Persona año de 1659.''&lt;ref&gt;Luis González Obregón ''Época colonial: México viejo, noticias históricas, tradiciones, leyendas y costumbres del periodo de 1521 á 1821''. Oficina de la Secretaría de fomento, México. 1896 p710&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun form is ''Relajación en persona'' (literally "relaxation in person"), but the noun form is primarily used by historians rather than contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;For example in María del Camino Fernández Giménez, ''La sentencia inquisitorial''. Editorial Complutense, Colegio Universitario Domingo de Soto de Segovia, Madrid, 2001 p120&lt;/ref&gt; Historians may also use the term anachronistically, for example as in the case of the last burning in Peru, that of Mariana de Castro, Lima, 1732.&lt;ref&gt;René Millar Carvacho ''La Inquisición de Lima: signos de su decadencia, 1726-1750'', Santiago, [[LOM Ediciones]] 2004 p78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary Becker]]'s '''rotten kid theorem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in [[economics]]. It posits that family members, even if they are selfish, will act to help one another if their personal incentives are properly aligned. The theorem is one of the most famous theorems within [[family economics]],{{cn|date=May 2017}} and applied [[mechanism design]].

In his original work, Becker paints a hypothetical situation in which children will receive gifts of money income from a wealthy, [[altruism|altruistic]] parent to make them [[utilitarianism|happy]]. One of the children is a selfish, "rotten", child who would take pleasure in harming his sibling. However, if he chose to actually hurt his sibling, the altruistic parent would help the victim, and curtail help to the wrongdoer. That way, the altruist would function as a means of transferring utility between the rotten kid and his sibling. In the process the parent would also bring about an incentive not to wrong the sibling in the first place, because any [[utility]] robbed of the sibling would be automatically taken away from the rotten kid.

The theorem relies on multiple assumptions. First, the altruistic parent has to be wealthy enough to compensate for any wrongdoing by the rotten kid. Secondly, he has to be a pure, rational altruist, with full knowledge of the personal utility of both the rotten kid and his sibling. Thirdly, the altruist would have to be fixed in his own income. And so on.

The theorem has proven widely influential in the economic analysis of family life,{{cn|date=May 2017}} and beyond that, other regarding economic institutions in general. It has done so especially in the economical analysis of unconventional and nonmonetary economic institutions, traditionally and especially in the popular sphere regarded as being outside the ambit of the economic science. Thus today it is a standard example of the novel contribution to economic literature that the so-called [[nonstandard economics]] has brought about.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

== Further applications ==

The theorem can be applied to inheritance as well, in expectation. There it suggests that a parent who plans to bequeath his estate in accordance to his children's needs and equity, might want to delay until the children are older, or possibly until after his demise. This is because if parents plan to will their children money in accordance with their needs, the real outcome of their behavior over their lifetime cannot be measured beforehand. Thus, the perfect incentive for the child to behave well towards his siblings can only be realized at the very end of the altruistic parent's life. In this application, the independent earnings of the various siblings can also be taken into account, without breaking the grounding logic of the theorem.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

[[File:Three-act structure.svg|thumb|500px|A visual representation of the three-act structure]]

The '''three-act structure''' is a model used in [[narrative]] fiction that divides a story into three parts ([[act (drama)|acts]]), often called the Setup, the Confrontation and the Resolution.

== Structure ==
'''The first act''' is usually used for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], to establish the main characters, their relationships and the world they live in. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident occurs, known as the ''[[inciting incident]]'', or ''catalyst'', that confronts the main character (the [[protagonist]]), and whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first plot point, which (a) signals the end of the first act, (b) ensures life will never be the same again for the protagonist and (c) raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the film. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, (Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?).&lt;ref name="trottier"&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pp. 5–7. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The second act''', also referred to as "rising action", typically depicts the protagonist's attempt to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to find themselves in ever worsening situations. Part of the reason protagonists seem unable to resolve their problems is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with the forces of [[Antagonist|antagonism]] that confront them. They must not only learn new skills but arrive at a higher sense of awareness of who they are and what they are capable of, in order to deal with their predicament, which in turn changes who they are. This is referred to as ''character development'' or a ''[[character arc]]''. This cannot be achieved alone and they are usually aided and abetted by mentors and co-protagonists.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

'''The third act''' features the resolution of the story and its subplots. The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] is the [[Scene (drama)|scene]] or sequence in which the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question answered, leaving the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2249">A '''type scene''' is a literary convention employed by a narrator across a set of scenes, or related to scenes (place, action) already familiar to the audience. The similarities with, and differences from, the established type are used to illuminate developments in plot and character. As [[Robert Louis Fowler]] wrote, "The technique of the type-scene offers the poet a basic scaffolding, but it also allows the poet to adapt each scene for specific purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fowler | first=Robert Louis | title=The Cambridge companion to Homer | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-521-01246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}}

Much of the foundational work for such analysis was by Walter Arend in his 1933 ''Die typischen Scenen bei Homer'' book on the ''[[Iliad]]'' of [[Homer]].  Later work by [[Robert Alter]] employed similar examination to parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]], in particular to the betrothal type-scene at the well in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bach | first=Alice | title=Women in the Hebrew Bible | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-415-91561-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|45}} Another type scene that Alter identifies is the annunciation of the birth of the hero to a barren woman, such as the birth of [[Samson]] to the [[wife of Manoah]], or the birth of [[Samuel]] to [[Hannah (Bible)|Hannah]]. Other scholars have suggested other type scenes in the Hebrew Bible, such as the [[Divine Council|heavenly council]], [[theophany]], prophetic concealment and the dying monarch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Benjamin J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9923">'''Undoing''' is a [[defense mechanism]] in which a person tries to cancel out or remove an unhealthy, destructive or otherwise threatening thought or action by engaging in contrary behavior. For example, after thinking about being violent with someone, one would then be overly nice or accommodating to them. It is one of several defense mechanisms proposed by the founder of [[psychoanalysis]] [[Sigmund Freud]] during his career, many of which were later developed further by his daughter [[Anna Freud]]. The German term "''Ungeschehenmachen''" was first used to describe this defense mechanism. When translated, it literally means ''"making un-happen"'', which is essentially the core of "undoing". Undoing refers to the phenomenon whereby a person tries to alter the past in some way to avoid or feign disappearance of an adversity or mishap.&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, J. and Pontalis, J-B. (1973), ''The language of psycho-analysis'' (D. Nicholson-Smith, Trans). New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud's development of the concept==
Freud first described the practice of undoing in his 1909 "Notes upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis".  Here he recounted how his patient (the "Rat Man") first removed a stone from the road in case his lady's carriage should overturn upon it, and thereafter 'felt ''obliged'' to go back and replace the stone in its original position in the middle of the road'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (London 1991) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud argued that his 'undoing this deed of love by replacing the stone where...her carriage might come to grief against it...was determined by a motive contrary to that which produced the first part'&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Studies'' p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; by hate, not love.

It was two decades later in 1926 that he formalised the ego defense as' ''undoing what has been done''....it is, as it were, negative magic, and endeavours, by means of motor symbolism, to ''blow away'' not merely the ''consequences'' of some event (or experience or impression) but the event itself'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (Middlesex 1987) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;  Freud then went on to use '"undoing" what has been done...[as] good enough grounds for re-introducing the old concept of ''defence'', which can cover all these processes that have the same purpose—namely the protection of the ego against instinctual demands'&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Psychopathology'' p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;—one of the major technical advances of his later years.

==In psychoanalysis after Freud==
The first psychoanalytic half-century saw several writers exploring the concept of undoing in Freud's wake.  [[Anna Freud]] listed it among the ego mechanisms; [[Ernest Jones]] and [[Ella Freeman Sharpe]] both wrote articles linking it with 'actions and attitudes aimed at the undoing of imaginative destructions.  Strivings for reparation may...be the main motive'.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London 1946) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Otto Fenichel]] devoted a substantial section of his "mechanism of defense" to summarizing past work in his encyclopedic ''Theory of Neurosis'': he was especially interested in how 'the undoing sometimes does not consist in a compulsion to do the opposite of what has been done previously but in a compulsion to repeat the very same act...with the opposite unconscious meaning'.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'' pp. 153–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The second half of the twentieth century saw little new theoretical or creative work around the concept.  [[Jean Laplanche]] and [[Jean-Bertrand Pontalis|J. B. Pontalis]] laid stress on how 'Undoing in the pathological sense is directed at the act's very reality, and the aim is to suppress it absolutely, as though time were reversed'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche and J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (London 1988) p. 478&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Freud encyclopedia'' highlighted how 'Acts of expiation can be seen as forms of ''undoing''{{'}};&lt;ref&gt;Edward Erwin, ''The Freud encyclopedia'' (2002) p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Eman Vaillant]] placed undoing among the neurotic defenses in his hierarchy of [[defense mechanisms]].

Melanie Klein in her early work had written of undoing in terms of a kind of magical reparation: 'a tendency to ''undo harm'' and put objects to right magically'.&lt;ref&gt;Melanie Klein, ''Developments in Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1989) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, however, she would use it in terms of a kind of ego disintegration—'a process of undoing, or what she called "a falling into bits"'&lt;ref&gt;Meira Likierman, ''Melanie Klein: Her Work in Context'' (2002) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;—and it was in this latter, rather different sense of the term that later Kleinians would tend to use it: 'an invitation to dissolution and undoing...leaving the mental field open for enactment and horror'.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Sohn, in H. S. Klein/J. Symington eds., ''Imprisoned Pain and its transformation'' (London 2000) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automaticity==
There is a proposal that speaks specifically about the [[automaticity]] of this counter factual thinking. This theory, as stipulated by Medvec, Madey and Gilovich (1995) states that Undoing can occur as an automatic response to a situation. Their findings involved Olympic Silver Medalists who were less happy about their achievement than the bronze medalists, even though it is known that Silver medalists have a higher honor. To the individuals, the Silver Medal represented how close they were to winning which is worse than being awarded bronze, which signified how close they were to not having a placement at all. This suggests that the [[counterfactual thinking]] was a sort of implicit way of control and was not actually deliberately employed as a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Medvec, V.H., Madey, S. F. and Gilouich, T. (1995). When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic Medalists, ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'' '''69''', 603–610&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further uses==
Undoing can be used to 'explain away' habits or behaviors that are not in line with an individual's personality. For example, in the case of a person who is well organised in the workplace, yet always forgets to pay bills on time at home, Freudian psychologists could argue that his tardiness with bills is an undoing of his desire to be orderly, or vice versa. Freud has been criticized regarding examples such as this because his theory is so complicated that most problems can be explained by another part of the theory.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

For some people undoing can be used to reduce [[cognitive dissonance]], the uncomfortable feeling created when an attitude and an action, or two attitudes are in conflict with one another.

In [[criminal profiling]] the term refers to a pattern of behavior by which an offender tries to undo their crime symbolically, e.g. by painting the face of a person killed by the perpetrator, covering up and decorating the corpse with flowers, personal belongings and jewelry, or folding the hands, imitating a laying-out.

==Effects of positive emotions==

Happiness, joy, love, excitement are all positive emotions and there is no arguing that these emotions contribute in large to how we act, how we think, and what we do. In contrast there are also negative feelings such as sadness that can lead us to act in certain ways that may not necessarily be good. Studies have been performed that have shown that positive emotions can be used to "correct" or "undo" the effects of negative emotions. [[Barbara Fredrickson]] and Robert Levenson have come up with the undoing hypothesis. In essence what the hypothesis states is that people might hold in the effects of their positive emotions to counterbalance the effects of their negative emotions.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;Fredrickson, B. L., Mancuso, R. A., Branigan, C. and Tugade, M. M. (2000). The undoing effect of positive emotions. ''Motivation and Emotion'' '''24''', 237–258.&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall positive emotions help lower the potentially health-damaging cardiovascular reactivity that lingers following negative emotions. This effect may be especially important for those most at risk for developing coronary heart disease.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"/&gt;

==Effects of negative emotions==

Negative emotions, including anger and fear, can be seen as the evolution of human adaptation to survival in life-threatening situations. For example, anger shows the sign of attack, fear shows the sign of escape. These emotional reactions interconnect with our mind and body. These negative emotions are influenced by the physiological support mechanisms, such as the physical energy, that relies on the body to mobilize at an optimal level for individual action to react. In the attack or flee situation, it produces heightened cardiovascular re-activity that redistributes blood flow to relevant skeletal muscles. However, in extreme cases, negative emotions will cause damage to people's health in their cardiovascular re-activity.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"/&gt;

{{Hindu philosophy}}

{{Buddhism}}
{{Jainism}}

'''Āstika''' (Sanskrit आस्तिक IAST: āstika) derives from the Sanskrit ''asti'', "there is, there exists", and means “one who believes in the existence (of God, of another world, etc.)” and '''nāstika''' means "an atheist or unbeliever" &lt;ref name="MW" /&gt;. These have been concepts used to classify [[Indian philosophies]] by modern scholars, and some [[Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Jainism|Jaina]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Perrett (2000), Indian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0815336112}}, page 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sushil Mittal &amp; Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415772273}}, pages 729-730&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Flood: "These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism."{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82}}}} ''Āstika'' has been defined in one of three ways; as those who accept the [[Pramana|epistemic]] authority of the [[Vedas]], as those who accept the existence of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]], or as those who accept the existence of ''[[Ishvara]]''.&lt;ref name="andrew"&gt;Andrew J.

&lt;/ref&gt;
The most studied Āstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] schools, are six: [[Nyaya|Nyāyá]], [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]], [[Samkhya|Sāṃkhya]], [[Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]], and [[Vedanta|Vedānta]]. The most studied Nāstika schools of Indian philosophies, sometimes referred to as [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] schools, are four: [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Cārvāka]], and [[Ājīvika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82, 224–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of this method of classification, with detail on the grouping of schools, see: {{harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orthodox-heterodox terminology is a construct of Western languages, and lacks scholarly roots in Sanskrit. Recent scholarly studies&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; state that there have been various [[Heresiology|heresiological]] translations of Āstika and Nāstika in 20th century literature on Indian philosophies, but quite many are unsophisticated and flawed.

Astika and Nāstika do not mean "theism" and "atheism" respectively in ancient or medieval era Sanskrit literature.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; In current Indian languages like [[Hindi]], ''āstika'' and its derivatives usually mean "[[theism|theist]]", while ''nāstika'' and its derivatives denote an "[[atheism|atheist]].”&lt;ref&gt;For [http://www.iheu.org/node/185 instance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070418105244/http://www.iheu.org/node/185 |date=18 April 2007 }}, the "Atheist Society of India" produces a monthly publications ''Nastika Yuga'', which it translates as "The Age of Atheism".&lt;/ref&gt; However, the terms are used differently in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Satischandra |last2=Datta |first2=Dhirendramohan |title=An Introduction to Indian Philosophy |edition=Eighth Reprint |publisher=University of Calcutta |year=1984|pages=5, footnote 1|quote=In modern Indian languages, "āstika" and "nāstika" generally mean "theist" and "atheist,” respectively.  But in Sanskrit philosophical literature, "āstika" means "one who believes in the authority of the Vedas".  ("nāstika" means the opposite of these). The word is used here in the first sense. The six orthodox schools are "āstika", and the Cārvāka is "nāstika" in both the senses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Sāṃkhya'' is both an atheist and ''āstika'' (Vedic) philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;"By {{IAST|Sāṃkhya}} reasoning, the material principle itself simply evolves into complex forms, and there is no need to hold that some spiritual power governs the material principle or its ultimate source."  Francis Clooney, CJ, "''Restoring 'Hindu Theology' as a category in Indian intellectual discourse", in {{cite book|author=Francis Clooney|editor=Gavin Flood|title=The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SKBxa-MNqA8C |year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Academic|isbn=978-0-470-99868-7|pages=451–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Āstika'' is a [[Sanskrit]] adjective (and noun) that is derived from ''asti'' ("there is or exists").&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{harvnb|Monier-Williams|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "knowing that which exists" or "pious";&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apte|1965|pp=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nāstika'' (''na'' (not) + ''{{IAST|āstika}}'') is its negative.

One of the traditional etymologies of the term ''āstika''–based on [[Pāṇini#Aṣṭādhyāyī|Pāṇini's ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'']],
4.4.60 ("astināstidiṣṭam matiḥ") says ‘he whose opinion is that [[Ishvara|Īśvara]] exists’ ("asti īśvara iti matir yasya").&lt;ref name="SquarciniSquarcini2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squarcini|first1=Federico|last2=Squarcini|first2=Federico|title=Traditions against Tradition. Criticism, Dissent and the Struggle for the Semiotic Primacy of Veridiction|year=2012|pages=446|doi=10.7135/UPO9781843313977.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions include "opposite of ''nāstika''" (''nāstika bhinna''); "he whose idea is that Īśvara exists" (''īśvara asti iti vādī''); "he who considers the [[Vedas]] as authorities" (''vedaprāmāṇyavādī''). According to Sanskrit grammarian [[Hemachandra]], ''āstika'' is a synonym for ‘he who believes’.{{refn|name=SquarciniSquarcini2012}}

As used in Hindu philosophy, the differentiation between ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' does not refer to theism or atheism.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; The terms often, but not always, relate to accepting Vedic literature as an authority, particularly on their teachings on Self (Soul). The Veda and Hinduism do not subscribe to or include the concept of an almighty that is separate from oneself i.e. there is no concept of God in the [[Christianity|Christian]] or [[Islam]]ic sense. N. N. Bhattacharya writes:
{{quote|The followers of Tantra were often branded as Nāstika by the political proponents of the Vedic tradition.  The term Nāstika does not denote an atheist since the Veda presents a godless system with no singular almighty being or multiple almighty beings.  It is applied only to those who do not believe in the Vedas.  The {{IAST| Sāṃkhya}}s and {{IAST|Mīmāṃsaka}}s do not believe in God, but they believe in the Vedas and hence they are not Nāstikas. The Buddhists, Jains, and Cārvākas do not believe in the Vedas; hence they are Nāstikas.|{{harvnb|Bhattacharyya|1999|pp=174}}}}

Āstika is also a name, such as that of a Vedic scholar born to the goddess [[Manasa|Mānasā]] ("Mind") and the sage [[Jaratkaru]].&lt;ref&gt;George Williams (2003), Handbook of Hindu Mythology, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195332612}}, page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of schools ==

The terms Āstika and Nāstika have been used to classify various Indian intellectual traditions.

=== Āstika Hindu ===

A list of six systems or ''ṣaḍdarśana''s (also spelled ''Sad Darshan'') consider [[Vedas]] as a reliable source of knowledge and an authoritative source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the [[Nyaya]], [[Vaisheshika]], [[Samkhya]], [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]], [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Vedanta]] schools of Hinduism, and they are classified as the ''āstika'' schools:

# Nyāyá, the school of logic
# Vaiśeṣika, the [[atomism|atomist school]]
# Sāṃkhya, the enumeration school
# Yoga, the school of Patañjali (which assumes the metaphysics of Sāṃkhya)
# Mīmāṃsā, the tradition of Vedic exegesis
# Vedanta or Uttara Mimāṃsā, the [[Upanishad|Upaniṣad]]ic tradition.

These are often coupled into three groups for both historical and conceptual reasons: Nyāyá-Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya-Yoga, and Mimāṃsā-Vedanta.

=== Nāstika Hindu ===

The main schools of Indian philosophy that reject the [[Vedas]] were regarded as heterodox in the Brahmanical tradition:{{sfn|Flood|1996|pp=82}}

# [[Buddhism]]
# [[Jainism]]
# [[Cārvāka]]
# [[Ājīvika]]
# [[Ajñana]]

The use of the term ''nāstika'' to describe Buddhism and Jainism in India is explained by Gavin Flood as follows:

{{quote|At an early period, during the formation of the Upaniṣads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions.... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox (''nāstika'') by orthodox (''āstika'') Brahmanism.|Gavin Flood&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flood|1996|pp=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Tantra|Tantric traditions]] in Hinduism have both ''āstika'' and ''nāstika'' lines; as Banerji writes in "''Tantra in Bengal''":

{{quote|Tantras are ... also divided as ''āstika'' or Vedic and ''nāstika'' or non-Vedic.  In accordance with the predominance of the deity the ''āstika'' works are again divided as {{IAST|Śākta, Śaiva, Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava}}.|Banerji&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Banerji|1992|pp= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Discussion ==

=== Hinduism ===

Manusmriti, in verse 2.11, defines Nāstika as those who revile "Vedic literature based on two roots of science of reasoning ([[Śruti]] and Smriti)".&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt; The 9th century Indian scholar Medhatithi analyzed this definition and stated that Nāstika does not mean someone who says "Vedic literature are untrue", but rather one who says "Vedic literature are immoral". Medhatithi further noted verse 8.309 of Manusmriti, to provide another aspect of the definition of Nāstika as one who believes, "there is no other world, there is no purpose in giving [[Dāna|charity]], there is no purpose in rituals and the teachings in the Vedic literature."&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;

Manusmriti does not define, or imply a definition for Astika. It is also silent or contradictory on specific rituals such as animal sacrifices, asserting [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence, non-injury) is [[dharma]] in its verses such as verse 10.63 based on Upanishadic layer of Vedic literature, even though the older layer of Vedic literature mention such sacrifices unlike the later layer of Vedic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: [https://archive.org/stream/manusmriti/manusmriti_six_commentaries#page/n1333/mode/2up Manusmriti with six scholar commentaries] VN Mandlik, page 1310&lt;br&gt;English: [http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/manu-smriti-10-63 Manusmriti 10.63] Berkeley Center for World Religion, Peace and World Affairs, Georgetown University&lt;/ref&gt; Indian scholars, such as those from Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya and Vedanta schools, accepted Astika to be those that include ''Śabda'' (शब्द, ''Aptavacana'', testimony of Vedic literature and reliable experts) as a reliable means of [[epistemology]], but they accepted the later ancient layer of the Vedic literature to be superseding the earlier ancient layer.&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;

==== Definition without reference to Vedas ====

In contrast to Manusmiriti, the 6th century CE Jain scholar and doxographer [[Haribhadra]], provided a different perspective in his writings on Astika and Nāstika. Haribhadra did not consider "reverence for Vedas" as a marker for an Astika. He and other 1st millennium CE Jaina scholars defined Astika as one who "affirms there exists another world, transmigration exists, virtue (''punya'') exists, vice (''paap'') exists".&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;&lt;ref name=wendy/&gt;

The 7th century scholars Jayaditya and Vamana, in ''[[Kāśikāvṛttī|Kasikavrtti]]'' of Pāṇini tradition, were silent on the role of or authority of Vedic literature in defining Astika and Nāstika. They state, "Astika is the one who believes there exists another world. The opposite of him is the Nāstika."&lt;ref name=andrew/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Haag and V. Vergiani (Eds., 2009), Studies in the Kāśikāvṛtti, Firenze : Società Editrice Fiorentina, {{ISBN|978-8860321145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly the widely studied 2nd-3rd century CE Buddhist philosopher [[Nagarjuna]], in Chapter 1 verses 60-61 of Ratnāvalī, wrote [[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]] and [[Samkhya|Sāṃkhya]] schools of Hinduism were Nāstika, along with Jainism, his own school of Buddhism and Pudgalavadins (Vātsīputrīya) school of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Markus Dressler and Arvind Mandair (2011), Secularism and Religion-Making, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199782949}}, page 59 note 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Steinkellner (1991), Studies in the Buddhist Epistemological Tradition: Proceedings of the Second International Dharmakīrti Conference, Vienna, Volume 222, Austrian Academy of Sciences Press, {{ISBN|978-3700119159}}, pages 230-238&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Definition based on belief in Atman ====

Astika, in some texts, is defined as those who believe in the existence of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]'' (Soul, Self, Spirit), while Nastika being those who deny there is any "soul, self" in human beings and other living beings.&lt;ref name=gsghurye/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C Sharma (2013), A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803657}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; All six schools of Hinduism classified as Astika philosophies hold the premise, "Atman exists". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 63, Quote: "The Buddhist schools reject any Ātman concept. As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt; Asanga Tilakaratna translates Astika as "positivism" and Nastika as "negativism", with Astika illustrated by Brahmanic traditions who accepted "soul and God exists", while Nastika as those traditions, such as Buddhism, who denied "soul and God exists".&lt;ref&gt;Asanga Tilakaratna (2003, Editors: Anne Blackburn and Jeffrey Samuels), Approaching the Dhamma: Buddhist Texts and Practices in South and Southeast Asia, Pariyatti, {{ISBN|978-1928706199}}, pages 128-129;&lt;br&gt;God, states Tilakaratna, in Brahmanic traditions is ''Parama-atma'' (universal soul, [[Ishvara]], Brahman)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jainism ===

According to [[G. S. Ghurye]], the Jain texts define "na+astika" as one "denying what exists" or any school of philosophy that denies the existence of the soul.&lt;ref name=pillai353&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Devadas Pillai|title=Indian Sociology Through Ghurye, a Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P3uD22Ghqs4C&amp;pg=PA354|year=1997|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7154-807-1|pages=353–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedanta sub-traditions of Hinduism are "astika" because they accept the existence of soul, while Buddhist traditions denying this are referred to as "nastika".&lt;ref name=pillai353/&gt;

One of the earliest mentions of ''astika'' concept in Jain texts is by [[Manibhadra]], who states that an ''astika'' is one who "accepts there exist another world (''paraloka''), transmigration of soul, virtue and vice that affect how a soul journeys through time".&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|pages=172–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th–6th century Jainism scholar [[Haribhadra]], states Andrew Nicholson, does not mention anything about accepting or rejecting the Vedas or god as a criterion for being an ''astika'' or ''nastika''. Instead, Haribhadra explains ''nastika'' in the manner of the more ancient Jain scholar Manibhadra, by stating a nastika to be one "who says there is no other worlds, there is no purpose in charity, there is no purpose in offerings".&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"/&gt; An ''astika'', to Haribhadra, is one who believes that there is a purpose and merit in an ethical life such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and ritual actions.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p172"/&gt; This exposition of the word ''astika'' and ''nastika'' by Haribhadra is similar to one by the Sanskrit grammarian and Hindu scholar Pāṇini in section 4.4.60 of the ''Astadhyayi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th century Jaina scholar [[Hemachandra]] similarly states, in his text ''Abhidhana Cintamani'', that a ''nastika'' is any philosophy that presumes or argues there is "no virtue and vice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramkrishna Bhattacharya|title=Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59eygxzQTWQC&amp;pg=PA164|year=2011|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-0-85728-433-4|pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Buddhism ===

[[Nagarjuna]], according to Chandradhar Sharma, equates ''Nastikya'' to "nihilism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chandradhar Sharma|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC|year=2000|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0365-7|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th century Buddhist scholar [[Asanga]], in ''Bodhisattva Bhumi'', calls ''nastika Buddhists'' as ''sarvavai nasika'', describing them as who are complete deniers. To Asanga, ''nastika'' are those who say "nothing whatsoever exists", and the worst kind of ''nastika'' are those who deny all designation and reality.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew J. Nicholson|title=Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVusAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14987-7|pages=174–176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astika are those who accept merit in and practice a religious life.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt; According to Andrew Nicholson, later Buddhists understood Asanga to be targeting [[Madhyamaka]] Buddhism as ''nastika'', while considering his own Yogacara Buddhist tradition to be ''astika''.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt; Initial interpretations of the Buddhist texts with the term ''astika'' and ''nastika'', such as those composed by Nagarjuna and Asvaghosa, were interpreted as being directed at the Hindu traditions. But, states John Kelly, most later scholarship considers this as incorrect, and that the ''astika'' and ''nastika'' terms were directed towards the competing Buddhist traditions and the intended audience of the texts were Buddhist monks debating an array of ideas across various Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John D Kelly|editor=Jan E. M. Houben|title=Ideology and Status of Sanskrit: Contributions to the History of the Sanskrit Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_eqr833q9qYC&amp;pg=PA88|year=1996|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=90-04-10613-8|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charges of being a ''nastika'' were serious threat to the social standing of a Buddhist, and could lead to expulsion from Buddhist monastic community. Thus, states Nicholson, the colonial era Indologist definition of astika and nastika schools of Indian philosophy, was based on a narrow study of literature such as a version of ''[[Manusmriti]]'', while in truth these terms are more complex and contextually apply within the diverse schools of Indian philosophies.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt;

The most common meaning of astika and nastika, in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism was the acceptance and adherence to ethical premises, and not textual validity or doctrinal premises, states Nicholson. It is likely that astika was translated as orthodox, and nastika as heterodox, because the early European Indologists carried the baggage of Christian theological traditions and extrapolated their own concepts to Asia, thereby distorting the complexity of Indian traditions and thought.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2013p174"/&gt;
