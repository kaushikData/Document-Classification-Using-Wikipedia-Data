The '''5.9-kiloyear event''' was one of the most intense [[aridification]] events during the [[Holocene]]. It occurred around [[39th century BC|3900 BC]] (5900 years [[Before Present]]), ending the [[Neolithic Subpluvial]]. 

It is associated with the last round of the [[Sahara pump theory]], and probably initiated the most recent [[desiccation]] of the [[Sahara]], as well as a five century period of colder climate in more northerly latitudes. It triggered [[human migration]] to the [[Nile]], which eventually led to the emergence of the [[cradle of civilization|first]] [[social complexity|complex]], highly [[institution|organized]], [[state (polity)|state]]-level [[society|societies]] in the [[4th millennium BC]].&lt;ref name="Brooks2006"/&gt; It may have contributed to the decline of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] and the first [[Indo-European migrations]] into the Balkans from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]].

==Cause==
A model by Claussen ''et al.'' (1999) suggested rapid desertification, associated with vegetation-atmosphere interactions following a cooling event, [[Bond event]] 4.&lt;ref name="Claussen1999"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Claussen | first = Martin | year = 1999 | title = Simulation of an Abrupt Change in Saharan Vegetation in the Mid-Holocene | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 26| issue = 14 | pages = 2037–40 | doi = 10.1029/1999GL900494| url = http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1999/1999GL900494.shtml | bibcode=1999GeoRL..26.2037C | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Kubatzki | first2 = Claudia | last3 = Brovkin | first3 = Victor | last4 = Ganopolski | first4 = Andrey | last5 = Hoelzmann | first5 = Philipp | last6 = Pachur | first6 = Hans‐Joachim}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bond ''et al.'' (1997) identified a North Atlantic cooling episode 5,900 years ago from ice-rafted debris as well as other such events, now called Bond events, which indicate the existence of a quasiperiodic cycle of Atlantic cooling events approximately every 1500 years ± 500 years.&lt;ref name="Bond1997"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bond, G. | url=http://www.acrim.com/Reference%20Files/A%20Pervasive%20Millennial-Scale%20Cycle%20in%20North%20Atlantic%20Holocene%20and%20Glacial%20Climates_1997.pdf | year = 1997 | title = A Pervasive Millennial-Scale Cycle in North Atlantic Holocene and Glacial Climates | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 278 | issue = 5341 | pages = 1257–66 | doi = 10.1126/science.278.5341.1257| display-authors = 1| author2 = &lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; |bibcode = 1997Sci...278.1257B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Obrochta2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Obrochta|first=Stephen P.|last2=Miyahara|first2=Hiroko|last3=Yokoyama|first3=Yusuke|last4=Crowley|first4=Thomas J.|date=2012-11-08|title=A re-examination of evidence for the North Atlantic “1500-year cycle” at Site 609|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379112003095|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=55|pages=23–33|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2012.08.008|bibcode=2012QSRv...55...23O}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some reason, all the earlier arid events (including the [[8.2 kiloyear event|8.2-kiloyear event]]) were followed by recovery, as is attested by the wealth of evidence of humid conditions in the Sahara between 10,000 and 6,000 BP.&lt;ref name="Petit-Maire"&gt;{{cite book |title=Third Millennium BC Climate Change and Old World Collapse |chapter=Holocene climate change and man in the present day Sahara desert |last=Petit-Maire |first=N. |author2= Beufort, L.|author3= Page, N. |editor=Nüzhet Dalfes, H. |editor2=Kukla, G. |editor3=Weiss, H. |year=1997 |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |isbn=978-3-540-61892-8 |pages=297–308 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that the 5.9-kiloyear event was followed by a partial recovery at best, with accelerated desiccation in the millennium that followed.

For example, Cremaschi (1998) describes evidence of rapid [[aridification]] in [[Acacus Mountains|Tadrart Acacus]] of southwestern [[Libya]], in the form of increased [[Aeolian processes|aeolian erosion]], sand incursions and the collapse of the roofs of rock shelters.&lt;ref name="Cremaschi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Wadi Teshuinat: Palaeoenvironment and prehistory in south-western Fezzan (Libyan Sahara) |chapter=Late Quaternary geological evidence for environmental changes in south-western Fezzan (Libyan Sahara) |last=Cremaschi |first=M. |editor=Cremaschi, M. |editor2=Di Lernia, S. |year=1998 |publisher=Ed.

==Effects==
In the eastern [[Arabian Peninsula]], the 5.9-kiloyear event may have contributed to an increase in relatively greater social complexity and have corresponded to an end of the local [[Ubaid period]]&lt;ref name=Parker2006&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parker|first1=Adrian G.|last2=Goudie|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Stokes|first3=Stephen|last4=White|first4=Kevin|last5=Hodson|first5=Martin J.|last6=Manning|first6=Michelle|last7=Kennet|first7=Derek|title=A record of Holocene climate change from lake geochemical analyses in southeastern Arabia|journal=Quaternary Research|date=2006|volume=66|issue=3|pages=465–476|url=http://www.gulfnexus.org/articles/geo/2006a%20Parker%20et%20al.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.yqres.2006.07.001|accessdate=3 June 2014|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|format=pdf|bibcode=2006QuRes..66..465P|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910214744/http://www.gulfnexus.org/articles/geo/2006a%20Parker%20et%20al.pdf|archivedate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the emergence of the first state societies at the lower end of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in southern Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian. 2004. ''People of the Earth: An Introduction to World Prehistory''. Upper Saddle River NJ: Pearson/Prentice Hall. Page 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

In central [[North Africa]] it triggered [[human migration]] to the [[Nile]], which eventually led to the emergence of the second complex, highly [[institution|organized]], [[state (polity)|state]]-level [[society|societies]] in the [[4th millennium BC]].&lt;ref name="Brooks2006"&gt;{{ cite journal | last = Brooks | first = Nick | year = 2006 | title = Cultural responses to aridity in the Middle Holocene and increased social complexity | journal = Quaternary International | volume = 151 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–49 | doi = 10.1016/j.quaint.2006.01.013 |bibcode = 2006QuInt.151...29B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By causing a period of cooling in Europe, it may have contributed to the decline of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] and the first [[Indo-European migrations]] into the [[Balkans]] from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]]. Around 4200–4100 BCE a climate change occurred, manifesting in colder winters in Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=227}} Between 4200–3900 BCE many tell settlements in the lower [[Danube]] Valley were burned and abandoned,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=227}} while the [[Cucuteni–Trypillia culture]] showed an increase in fortifications,{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=230}} meanwhile moving eastwards towards the Dniepr.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=232}} Steppe herders, archaic Proto-Indo-European speakers, spread into the lower Danube valley about 4200–4000 BCE, either causing or taking advantage of the collapse of Old Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=133}}

'''Avraham Hermoni''' (May 10, 1926- June 24, 2006) was an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[chemist]], government official, scientific counselor in the [[Israeli embassy in Washington, DC|Israeli embassy in Washington]], and a senior technical director at [[RAFAEL]], Israel’s national center for weapons development.

==Biography==
Hermoni’s involvement in the [[Israeli nuclear program]] was instrumental to its ultimate success. Between 1959 and 1969 he served as technical director (equivalent to vice president) at RAFAEL. His main duties included overseeing and planning RAFAEL’s work on Israel’s nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wilsoncenter.org/avraham-hermoni#hermonibio&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''azeotrope''' (UK {{nobr|/əˈziːəˌtrəʊp/}}, US {{nobr|/əˈziəˌtroʊp/}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/azeotrope|title=Azeotrope definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|author=|date=|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a '''constant boiling point mixture''' is a [[mixture]] of two or more liquids whose proportions cannot be altered or changed by simple [[distillation]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Moore, Walter J. ''Physical Chemistry'', 3rd e Prentice-Hall 1962, pp. 140–142&lt;/ref&gt; This happens because when an azeotrope is boiled, the vapour has the same proportions of constituents as the unboiled mixture. Because their composition is unchanged by distillation, azeotropes are also called (especially in older texts) constant [[boiling point]] mixtures.

Many azeotropic mixtures of pairs of compounds are known,&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt; and many azeotropes of three or more compounds are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Department of Chemical Engineering University of Alicante |title= Numerical Determination of Distillation Boundaries for Multicomponent Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Azeotropic Systems |url= http://www.aidic.it/escape20/webpapers/134Reyes-Labarta.pdf |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111001030036/http://www.aidic.it/escape20/webpapers/134Reyes-Labarta.pdf |archivedate= 1 October 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a case it is not possible to separate the components by fractional distillation. There are two types of azeotropes: minimum boiling azeotrope and maximum boiling azeotrope. A [[solution]] that shows greater positive deviation from [[Raoult's law]] forms a minimum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. For example, an [[ethanol]]-[[water]] mixture (obtained by [[fermentation]] of sugars) on [[fractional distillation]] yields a solution containing approximately 95% by volume of ethanol. Once this composition has been achieved, the liquid and vapour have the same composition, and no further separation occurs. 
A solution that shows large negative deviation from [[Raoult's law]] forms a maximum boiling azeotrope at a specific composition. [[Nitric acid]] and [[water]] is an example of this class of azeotrope. This azeotrope has an approximate composition of 68% [[nitric acid]] and 32% [[water]] [[mass percent|by mass]], with a [[boiling point]] of {{convert|393.5|K|C}}.

==Etymology==
The term ''azeotrope'' is derived from the Greek words ζέειν (boil) and τρόπος (turning) with the prefix α- (no) to give the overall meaning, "no change on boiling".  The term was coined in 1911 by English chemist [[John Wade (chemist)|John Wade]] (1864–1912)&lt;ref&gt;[[F. Gowland Hopkins]] (1913) [https://archive.org/stream/p1journal103chemuoft#page/766/mode/2up "Obituary Notices: John Wade,"] ''Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions'', '''103''' :  767-774.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard William Merriman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wade|first1=John|last2=Merriman|first2=Richard William|title=Influence of water on the boiling point of ethyl alcohol at pressures above and below the atmospheric pressure|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions|date=1911|volume=99|pages=997–1011|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015026338742;view=1up;seq=1001}}  [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015026338742;view=1up;seq=1008 From p. 1004:]  " … it is proposed, in order to avoid the cumbrous periphrase "mixtures having a minimum (or maximum) boiling point," to designate them as ''azeotropic mixtures'' (α, privative; ζέω, to boil)."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

=== Positive and negative azeotropes ===
[[File:Positive Azeotrope.png|thumb|300px|Positive azeotrope – mixture of [[chloroform]] and [[methanol]]]]
[[File:Negative Azeotrope.png|thumb|300px|Negative azeotrope – mixture of [[formic acid]] and [[water]]]]

Each azeotrope has a characteristic [[boiling point]]. The boiling point of an azeotrope is either less than the boiling point temperatures of any of its constituents (a positive azeotrope), or greater than the boiling point of any of its constituents (a negative azeotrope).

A well-known example of a positive azeotrope is 95.63% [[ethanol]] and 4.37% [[water]] (by mass) boils at 78.2&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web|last=National Institute of Standards and Technology |title=Standard Reference Material 1828: Ethanol-Water Solutions |url=http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/ReferenceMaterials/upload/1828.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608142735/http://ts.nist.gov/MeasurementServices/ReferenceMaterials/upload/1828.pdf |archivedate=8 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethanol boils at 78.4&amp;nbsp;°C, water boils at 100&amp;nbsp;°C, but the azeotrope boils at 78.2&amp;nbsp;°C, which is lower than either of its constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Rousseau |first= Ronald W. |author2=James R. Fair |title= Handbook of separation process technology |publisher= Wiley-IEEE |year= 1987 |pages= 261–262 |isbn= 978-0-471-89558-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, 78.2&amp;nbsp;°C is the minimum temperature at which any ethanol/water solution can boil at atmospheric pressure. In general, a positive azeotrope boils at a lower temperature than any other ratio of its constituents. Positive azeotropes are also called ''minimum boiling mixtures'' or ''pressure maximum'' azeotropes.

In general, a negative azeotrope boils at a higher temperature than any other ratio of its constituents. Negative azeotropes are also called ''maximum boiling mixtures'' or ''pressure minimum'' azeotropes. An example of a negative azeotrope is [[hydrochloric acid]] at a concentration of 20.2% and 79.8% water (by mass). Hydrogen chloride boils at −84&amp;nbsp;°C and water at 100&amp;nbsp;°C, but the azeotrope boils at 110&amp;nbsp;°C, which is higher than either of its constituents. The maximum temperature at which any hydrochloric acid solution can boil is 110&amp;nbsp;°C. Other examples:
* [[sulfuric acid]] (98.3%) / water, boils at 338&amp;nbsp;°C
* [[nitric acid]] (68%) / [[water (molecule)|water]], boils at 120.2&amp;nbsp;°C at 1 atm 
* [[perchloric acid]] (71.6%) / water, boils at 203&amp;nbsp;°C 
* [[hydrofluoric acid]] (35.6%) / water, boils at 111.35&amp;nbsp;°C

===Homogeneous and heterogeneous azeotropes===
If the constituents of a mixture  are completely [[miscible]] in all proportions with each other, the type of azeotrope is called a ''homogeneous azeotrope''. For example, any amount of ethanol can be mixed with any amount of water to form a homogeneous solution.

[[File:heteroazeotropePhaseDiagram.png|thumb|300px|right|'''Phase diagram of a heteroazeotrope.''' Vertical axis is temperature, horizontal axis is composition. The dotted vertical line indicates the composition of the combined layers of the distillate whenever both layers are present in the original mixture.]]
If the constituents are not completely miscible, an azeotrope can be found inside the [[miscibility gap]]. This type of azeotrope is called ''heterogeneous azeotrope'' or [[heteroazeotrope]].  A heteroazeotropic distillation will have two liquid phases. For example,  [[acetone]] / [[methanol]] / [[chloroform]] form an intermediate boiling (saddle) azeotrope.

For example, if equal volumes of [[chloroform]] (water solubility 0.8 g/100 ml at 20&amp;nbsp;°C) and water are shaken together and then left to stand, the liquid will separate into two layers. Analysis of the layers shows that the top layer is mostly water with a small amount of chloroform dissolved in it, and the bottom layer is mostly chloroform with a small amount of water dissolved in it. If the two layers are heated together, the system of layers will boil at 53.3&amp;nbsp;°C, which is lower than either the boiling point of chloroform (61.2&amp;nbsp;°C) or the boiling point of water (100&amp;nbsp;°C). The vapor will consist of 97.0% chloroform and 3.0% water regardless of how much of each liquid layer is present provided both layers are indeed present. If the vapor is re-condensed, the layers will reform in the condensate, and will do so in a fixed ratio, which in this case is 4.4% of the volume in the top layer and 95.6% in the bottom layer.&lt;ref&gt;''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 44th ed., p. 2156.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system of solvents is known as a [[heteroazeotrope]]. Heteroazeotropes are always minimum boiling mixtures.

The diagram illustrates how the various phases of a heteroazeotrope are related.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hilmen"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.chemeng.ntnu.no/thesis/download/2000/hilmen/Thesis_Hilmen.pdf |format= PDF |title= Separation of Azeotropic Mixtures: Tools for Analysis and Studies on Batch Distillation Operation |accessdate= 24 March 2007 |last= Hilmen |first= Eva-Katrine |date= November 2000 |publisher= Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Dept. of Chemical Engineering |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070615185910/http://www.chemeng.ntnu.no/thesis/download/2000/hilmen/Thesis_Hilmen.pdf |archivedate= 15 June 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of constituents===
Azeotropes consisting of two constituents are called ''binary'' azeotropes such as [[diethyl ether]] (33%) / [[halothane]] (66%) a mixture once commonly used in [[anaesthesia]]. For example,  [[benzene]] and [[hexafluorobenzene]] form a double binary azeotrope.
[[File:Benzene+Hexafluorobenzene (Double Azeotrope).png|300px|thumb|Double azeotrope of benzene and hexafluorobenzene.
Proportions are by weight.]]

Azeotropes consisting of three constituents are called ''ternary'' azeotropes, e.g. acetone / methanol / chloroform. Azeotropes of more than three constituents are also known.

===Zeotropy===
Combinations of solvents that do not form an azeotrope when mixed in any proportion are said to be [[Zeotropic mixture|zeotropic]]. Azeotropes are useful in separating zeotropic mixtures. An example is [[acetic acid]] and water, which do not form an azeotrope. Despite this it is very difficult to separate pure acetic acid (boiling point: 118.1&amp;nbsp;°C) from a solution of acetic acid and water by distillation alone. As progressive distillations produce solutions with less and less water, each further distillation becomes less effective at removing the remaining water. Distilling the solution to dry acetic acid is therefore economically impractical. But [[ethyl acetate]] forms an azeotrope with water that boils at 70.4&amp;nbsp;°C. By adding ethyl acetate as an entrainer, it is possible to distill away the azeotrope and leave nearly pure acetic acid as the residue.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt;

==Mechanism==

===Condition of existence===
The condition relates [[activity coefficient]]s in [[liquid phase]] to total pressure and the vapour pressures of pure components.
[[Image:RaoultDeviationPressureDiagram.png|thumb|300px|right|Total vapor pressure of mixtures as a function of composition at a chosen constant temperature]]

Azeotropes can form only when a mixture deviates from [[Raoult's law]], the equality of compositions in liquid phase and [[vapor phase]]s,  in [[vapour-liquid equilibrium]]  and [[Dalton's law]] the equality of pressures for total pressure being equal to the sum of the partial pressures in real mixtures.

In other words: Raoult's law predicts the vapor pressures of [[ideal solution|ideal mixture]]s as a function of composition ratio.  More simply: per Raoult's law molecules of the constituents stick to each other to the same degree as they do to themselves. For example, if the constituents are X and Y, then X sticks to Y with roughly equal energy as X does with X and Y does with Y. A so-called ''positive deviation'' from Raoult's law results when the constituents have a [[affinity (chemistry)|disaffinity]] for each other – that is X sticks to X and Y to Y better than X sticks to Y. Because this results in the mixture having less total affinity of the molecules than the pure constituents, they more readily escape from the stuck-together phase, which is to say the liquid phase, and into the vapor phase. When X sticks to Y more aggressively than X does to X and Y does to Y, the result is a ''negative deviation'' from Raoult's law. In this case because the molecules in the mixture are sticking together more than in the pure constituents, they are more reluctant to escape the stuck-together liquid phase.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt;

When the deviation is great enough to cause a maximum or minimum in the vapor pressure versus [[composition function]], it is a mathematical consequence that at that point, the vapor will have the same composition as the liquid, resulting in an azeotrope.

The adjacent diagram illustrates total vapor pressure of three hypothetical mixtures of constituents, X, and Y. The temperature throughout the plot is assumed to be constant.

The center trace is a straight line, which is what Raoult's law predicts for an ideal mixture. In general solely mixtures of chemically similar solvents, such as [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] with [[heptane|''n''-heptane]], form nearly [[ideal mixture]]s that come close to obeying Raoult's law. 
The top trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a positive deviation from Raoult's law, where the total combined vapor pressure of constituents, X and Y, is greater than what is predicted by Raoult's law. The top trace deviates sufficiently that there is a point on the curve where its [[tangent]] is horizontal. Whenever a mixture has a positive deviation and has a point at which the tangent is horizontal, the composition at that point is a positive azeotrope.&lt;ref name="chemguide"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/phaseeqia/nonideal.html|title=Nonideal Mixtures of Liquids|accessdate=2008-03-05|author=Jim Clark|publisher=Chemguide.co.uk| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080220181004/http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/phaseeqia/nonideal.html| archivedate= 20 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point the total vapor pressure is at a maximum. Likewise the bottom trace illustrates a nonideal mixture that has a negative deviation from Raoult's law, and at the composition where tangent to the trace is horizontal there is a negative azeotrope. This is also the point where total vapor pressure is minimum.&lt;ref name="chemguide"/&gt;

===''Minimum-boiling'' or ''Positive'' azeotrope===
[[File:positiveAzeotropePhaseDiagram.png|thumb|300px|right|'''Phase diagram of a positive azeotrope.''' Vertical axis is temperature, horizontal axis is composition.]]
The boiling and recondensation of a mixture of two solvents are changes of [[chemical state]]; as such, they are best illustrated with a [[phase diagram]]. If the pressure is held constant, the two variable parameters are the temperature and the composition.

The phase diagram on the right shows a ''positive'' azeotrope of hypothetical constituents, X and Y. The bottom trace illustrates the boiling temperature of various compositions. Below the bottom trace, only the liquid phase is in equilibrium. The top trace illustrates the vapor composition above the liquid at a given temperature. Above the top trace, only the vapor is in equilibrium. Between the two traces, liquid and vapor phases exist simultaneously in equilibrium: for example, heating a 25% X : 75% Y mixture to temperature AB would generate vapor of composition B over liquid of composition A. The azeotrope is the point on the diagram where the two curves touch. The horizontal and vertical steps show the path of repeated distillations. Point A is the boiling point of a nonazeotropic mixture. The vapor that separates at that temperature has composition B. The shape of the curves requires that the vapor at B be richer in constituent X than the liquid at point A.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt; The vapor is physically separated from the VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) system and is cooled to point C, where it condenses. The resulting liquid (point C) is now richer in X than it was at point A. If the collected liquid is boiled again, it progresses to point D, and so on. The stepwise progression shows how repeated distillation can never produce a distillate that is richer in constituent X than the azeotrope. Note that starting to the right of the azeotrope point results in the same stepwise process closing in on the azeotrope point from the other direction.

===''Maximum-boiling'' or ''Negative'' azeotrope===
[[File:negativeAzeotropePhaseDiagram.png|thumb|300px|right|'''Phase diagram of a negative azeotrope.''' Vertical axis is temperature, horizontal axis is composition.]]

The phase diagram on the right shows a ''negative'' azeotrope of ideal constituents, X and Y. Again the bottom trace illustrates the boiling temperature at various compositions, and again, below the bottom trace the mixture must be entirely liquid phase. The top trace again illustrates the condensation temperature of various compositions, and again, above the top trace the mixture must be entirely vapor phase. The point, A, shown here is a boiling point with a composition chosen very near to the azeotrope. The vapor is collected at the same temperature at point B. That vapor is cooled, condensed, and collected at point C. Because this example is a negative azeotrope rather than a positive one, the distillate is ''farther'' from the azeotrope than the original liquid mixture at point A was. So the distillate is poorer in constituent X and richer in constituent Y than the original mixture. Because this process has removed a greater fraction of Y from the liquid than it had originally, the residue must be poorer in Y and richer in X after distillation than before.

If the point, A had been chosen to the right of the azeotrope rather than to the left, the distillate at point C would be farther to the right than A, which is to say that the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the distillate moves away from the azeotrope and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes. No amount of distillation, however, can make either the distillate or the residue arrive on the opposite side of the azeotrope from the original mixture. This is characteristic of ''all'' azeotropes.{{Clear}}

===Traces===
The traces in the phase diagrams separate whenever the composition of the vapor differs from the composition of the liquid at the same temperature. Suppose the total composition were 50/50%. You could make this composition using 50% of 50/50% vapor and 50% of 50/50% liquid, but you could also make it from 83.33% of 45/55% vapor and 16.67% of 75%/25% liquid, as well as from many other combinations. The separation of the two traces represents the range of combinations of liquid and vapor that can make each total composition.

===Temperature-pressure dependence===
For both the top and bottom traces, the temperature point of the azeotrope is the constant temperature chosen for the graph. If the ambient pressure is controlled to be equal to the total vapor pressure at the azeotropic mixture, then the mixture will boil at this fixed temperature.

Vapor pressure of both pure liquids as well as mixtures is a sensitive function of temperature. As a rule, vapor pressure of a liquid increases nearly exponentially as a function of temperature. If the graph were replotted for a different fixed temperature, then the total vapor pressure at the azeotropic composition will certainly change, but it is also possible that the composition at which the azeotrope occurs will change. This implies that the composition of an azeotrope is affected by the pressure chosen at which to boil the mixture. Ordinarily distillation is done at [[atmospheric pressure]], but with proper equipment it is possible to carry out distillation at a wide variety of pressures, both above and below atmospheric pressure.

==Separation of constituents==

If two solvents can form a negative azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents will result in the [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] being away from the composition at the azeotrope than the original mixture. 
For example, if a [[hydrochloric acid]] solution contains less than 20.2% [[hydrogen chloride]], boiling the mixture will leave behind a solution that is richer in hydrogen chloride than the original. If the solution initially contains more than 20.2% hydrogen chloride, then boiling will leave behind a solution that is poorer in hydrogen chloride than the original. Boiling of any hydrochloric acid solution long enough will cause the solution left behind to approach the azeotropic ratio.&lt;ref&gt;''Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs'', 9th ed., monograph 4667&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand, if two solvents can form a positive azeotrope, then distillation of any mixture of those constituents will result in the [[residue (chemistry)|residue]] closer to the composition at the azeotrope than the original mixture.  For example, if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once, the distillate will be 80% ethanol and 20% water, which is closer to the azeotropic mixture than the original, which  means the solution left behind will be poorer in ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/physical/phaseeqia/nonideal.html Physical phases] chemguide.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Distilling the 80/20% mixture produces a distillate that is 87% ethanol and 13% water. Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the azeotropic ratio of 95.5/4.5%. No numbers of distillations will ever result in a distillate that exceeds the azeotropic ratio. Likewise, when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the azeotrope, the distillate (contrary to intuition) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but still richer than the azeotrope.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Robert Thornton; Boyd, Robert Neilson, ''Organic Chemistry'', 2nd ed., Allyn and Bacon, 1972, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

Distillation is one of the primary tools that chemists and chemical engineers use to separate mixtures into their constituents. Because distillation cannot separate the constituents of an azeotrope, the separation of azeotropic mixtures (also called ''azeotrope breaking'') is a topic of considerable interest.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt; Indeed, this difficulty led some early investigators to believe that azeotropes were actually compounds of their constituents.&lt;ref name="moore"/&gt; But there are two reasons for believing that this is not the case. One is that the [[Mole (unit)|molar]] ratio of the constituents of an azeotrope is not generally the ratio of small integers. For example, the azeotrope formed by water and [[acetonitrile]] contains 2.253 moles ( or 9/4 with a relative error of just 2% ) of acetonitrile for each mole of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eweb.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/chem_eng/azeotrope_bank.html|title=Azeotrope Databank|last=Ponton|first=Jack|date=September 2001|website=|publisher=The Edinburgh Collection of Open Software for Simulation and Education, University of Edinburgh|format=Queriable database|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424062750/http://eweb.chemeng.ed.ac.uk/chem_eng/azeotrope_bank.html|archivedate=24 April 2007|deadurl=yes|accessdate=14 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more compelling reason for believing that azeotropes are not compounds is, as discussed in the last section, that the composition of an azeotrope can be affected by pressure. Contrast that with a true compound, carbon dioxide for example, which is two moles of oxygen for each mole of carbon no matter what pressure the gas is observed at. That azeotropic composition can be affected by pressure suggests a means by which such a mixture can be separated.

===Pressure swing distillation===
[[File:HiLoPressureAzeotrope.png|thumb|300px|right|'''Azeotrope composition shift due to pressure swing.''']]
A hypothetical azeotrope of constituents X and Y is shown in the adjacent diagram. Two sets of curves on a phase diagram one at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the high-pressure system. The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point '''A'''. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point, '''B''', which is on the same side of the azeotrope as '''A'''. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature. If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure, it boils at point '''C'''. From '''C''', by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point '''D''', which is on the same side of the high-pressure azeotrope as '''C'''. If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure, it boils at point '''E''', which is on the ''opposite'' side of the low-pressure azeotrope to '''A'''. So, by means of the pressure swing, it is possible to cross over the low-pressure azeotrope.

When the solution is boiled at point '''E''', the distillate is poorer in X than the residue at point '''E'''. This means that the residue is richer in X than the distillate at point '''E'''. Indeed, progressive distillation can produce a residue as rich in X as is required.

In summary:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-4}}
1. Low-pressure rectification ('''A''' to '''B''')&lt;br /&gt;
2. High-pressure rectification ('''C''' to '''D''')&lt;br /&gt;
3. Low-pressure stripping ('''E''' to target purity)&lt;br /&gt;
{{col-2}}
* Rectification: the distillate, or "tops", is retained and exhibits an increasingly lower boiling point.
* Stripping: the residue, or "bottoms", is retained and exhibits an increasingly higher boiling point.
{{col-end}}

Note that both azeotropes above are of the ''positive'', or ''minimum boiling'' type; care must be taken to ensure that the correct component of the separation step is retained, i.e. the binary phase-envelope diagram ([[Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium#Boiling point diagrams|boiling-point curve]]) must be correctly read.

A mixture of 5% water with 95% [[tetrahydrofuran]] is an example of an azeotrope that can be economically separated using a pressure swing – a swing in this case between 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] and 8 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]. By contrast the composition of the water to ethanol azeotrope discussed earlier is not affected enough by pressure to be easily separated using pressure swings&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt; and instead, an entrainer may be added that ''either'' modifies the azeotropic composition and exhibits [[Miscibility|immiscibility]] with one of the components, ''or'' [[extractive distillation]] may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook – 7th Ed. 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azeotropic distillation===
{{Main article|Azeotropic distillation}}

Other methods of separation involve introducing an additional agent, called an ''entrainer'', that will affect the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of one of the azeotrope constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary azeotrope to form a ternary azeotrope, and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called azeotropic distillation. The best known example is adding [[benzene]] or [[cyclohexane]] to the water/ethanol azeotrope. With cyclohexane as the entrainer, the ternary azeotrope is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;''CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics'', 44th ed., p. 2181&lt;/ref&gt; Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol azeotrope to engage all of the water into the ternary azeotrope. When the mixture is then boiled, the azeotrope vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt;

===Chemical action separation===
Another type of entrainer is one that has a strong chemical affinity for one of the constituents. Using again the example of the water/ethanol azeotrope, the liquid can be shaken with [[calcium oxide]], which reacts strongly with water to form the [[Volatility (chemistry)|nonvolatile]] compound, [[calcium hydroxide]]. Nearly all of the calcium hydroxide can be separated by [[filtration]] and the [[filtrate]] redistilled to obtain 100% pure ethanol.

A more extreme example is the azeotrope of 1.2% water with 98.8% [[diethyl ether]]. Ether holds the last bit of water so tenaciously that only a very powerful [[desiccant]] such as [[sodium]] metal added to the liquid phase can result in completely dry ether.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;Cohen, Julius B. ''Practical Organic Chemistry'' MacMillan 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anhydrous]] [[calcium chloride]] is used as a desiccant for drying a wide variety of solvents since it is inexpensive and does not react with most [[nonaqueous]] solvents. [[Chloroform]] is an example of a solvent that can be effectively dried using calcium chloride.&lt;ref name="cohen"/&gt;

===Distillation using a dissolved salt===
{{Main article|Salt-effect distillation}}

When a [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]] is dissolved in a solvent, it always has the effect of raising the boiling point of that solvent – that is it decreases the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of the solvent. When the salt is readily soluble in one constituent of a mixture but not in another, the volatility of the constituent in which it is soluble is decreased and the other constituent is unaffected. In this way, for example, it is possible to break the water/ethanol azeotrope by dissolving [[potassium acetate]] in it and distilling the result.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt;

===Extractive distillation===
[[Extractive distillation]] is similar to azeotropic distillation, except in this case the entrainer is less volatile than any of the azeotrope's constituents. For example, the azeotrope of 20% [[acetone]] with 80% [[chloroform]] can be broken by adding water and distilling the result. The water forms a separate layer in which the acetone preferentially dissolves. The result is that the distillate is richer in chloroform than the original azeotrope.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt;

===Pervaporation and other membrane methods===
The [[pervaporation]] method uses a membrane that is more permeable to the one constituent than to another to separate the constituents of an azeotrope as it passes from liquid to vapor phase. The membrane is rigged to lie between the liquid and vapor phases. Another membrane method is [[vapor permeation]], where the constituents pass through the membrane entirely in the vapor phase. In all membrane methods, the membrane separates the fluid passing through it into a [[permeate]] (that which passes through) and a [[retentate]] (that which is left behind). When the membrane is chosen so that is it more permeable to one constituent than another, then the permeate will be richer in that first constituent than the retentate.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt;

==Complex systems==
[[File:Saddle Azeotrope.png|250px|thumb| Saddle azeotropic system Methanol/Acetone/Chloroform calculated with mod. [[UNIFAC]]]]
The rules for positive and negative azeotropes apply to all the examples discussed so far. But there are some examples that don't fit into the categories of positive or negative azeotropes. The best known of these is the ternary azeotrope formed by 30% [[acetone]], 47% [[chloroform]], and 23% [[methanol]], which boils at 57.5&amp;nbsp;°C. Each pair of these constituents forms a binary azeotrope, but chloroform/methanol and acetone/methanol both form positive azeotropes while chloroform/acetone forms a negative azeotrope. The resulting ternary azeotrope is neither positive nor negative. Its boiling point falls ''between'' the boiling points of acetone and chloroform, so it is neither a maximum nor a minimum boiling point. This type of system is called a [[Saddle surface|saddle]] azeotrope.&lt;ref name="hilmen"/&gt; Only systems of three or more constituents can form saddle azeotropes.

A rare type of complex binary azeotrope is one where the boiling point and condensation point curves touch at two points in the phase diagram. Such a system is called a double azeotrope, and will have two azeotropic compositions and boiling points. An example is water and ''N''-methylethylenediamine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.symp14.nist.gov/bin/AQU01OLS.PDF|format=PDF|title=Thermodynamics of Hydrogen Bonding Mixtures 4.|author=Olson, John D.|accessdate=27 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916084546/http://www.symp14.nist.gov/bin/AQU01OLS.PDF|archivedate=16 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4574">'''Bone wax''' is a [[wax]]y substance used to help mechanically control bleeding from [[bone]] surfaces during [[surgery|surgical]] procedures.

It is generally made of [[beeswax]] with a softening agent such as [[paraffin wax|paraffin]] or [[petroleum jelly]] and is smeared across the bleeding edge of the bone, blocking the holes and causing immediate [[bone hemostasis]] through a [[tamponade]] effect. Bone wax is most commonly supplied in sterile sticks, and usually requires softening before it can be applied.

==History==
A note by Victor Horsley published in the British Medical Journal in 1892 described a formulation of “antiseptic wax” having seven parts beeswax, one part [[almond]] oils, and 1% [[salicylic acid]]. The material was useful for controlling bleeding when pressed into the pores and channels of cut or damaged bone. The wax was sterilized by boiling and kept in [http://lh6.ggpht.com/_reQrNGIqN_8/TS9_gJPO_aI/AAAAAAAACW8/H8JU9kHF7ok/bone%20wax%20old.jpg stoppered bottles].  This material soon became the standard of care for bleeding control in bone for general orthopedics, [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|craniomaxillofacial surgery]], and [[cardiothoracic surgery]], where the sternum is often split longitudinally to provide access to the heart.

==Action==
Ordinary bone wax is effective by virtue of its tamponade action, but is considered to have no active hemostatic properties (i.e. does not activate the [[coagulation|blood clotting cascade]]). In addition, bone wax is not soluble in the bodily fluids and thus remains at the site of implantation for long periods of time, if not indefinitely. The portion of traditional bone wax that departs the implant site is most likely carried away through the action of the foreign body response and is associated with a low-grade inflammatory response at and near the implant site. The residual product can also potentially serve as a nidus for post-operative infection.

==Modern formulations==
Modern day bone wax is commercially available in substantially non-absorbable formulations similar to Horsley’s original composition, as well as in absorbable/resorbable formats. Most are available as a firm wax in stick form that must be softened by kneading prior to use. 

More recent advances have led to the introduction of a bone hemostat in putty format. Hemostatic putties act via tamponade in the same way as the stick waxes, but are ready to use and eliminate the requirement to soften the product prior to use.

===Absorbable bone wax ===
{{advert|section|date=May 2013}}

Hemasorb Resorbable Hemostatic Bone Putty is a sterile, soft, moldable, biocompatible, absorbable material of putty-like consistency. The material is a mixture of [[calcium stearate]], [[Vitamin E acetate]], and liquid surfactant. It is virtually odorless, off-white in color and can be spread easily with minimal adhesion to surgical gloves.  The bone putty requires no kneading prior to application and does not soften appreciably at body temperature.

The FDA has recently approved a new water-soluble bone hemostasis material called Ostene, which is designed to look and feel like bone wax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/pdf7/K070093.pdf|title=FDA|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-09-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material comprises a sterile mixture of water-soluble [[alkylene oxide copolymer]]s, derived from [[ethylene oxide]] and [[propylene oxide]]. These copolymers have a long history in the medical and pharmaceutical fields, and they are considered [[Inert ingredient|inert]]. These compounds are not [[metabolized]], but eliminated from the body unchanged.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10639">[[File:Waveboard in Fahrt 1.JPG|thumb|Casterboarding]]
[[Image:waveboardbottom.jpg|right|thumb|The bottom of a typical casterboard]]
A '''caster board''' or '''vigorboard''' is a two-wheeled, [[human-powered land vehicle]]. It is somewhat like a [[snakeboard]]. Other names are '''waveboard'''  "J-board" and '''RipStik''' (sometimes written "rip stick"), both of which are derived from commercial brands.

A caster board has two narrow platforms known as "decks" that are joined by a "torsion bar", which consists of a metal beam, usually coated by rubber, that houses a strong spring.  One [[polyurethane]] [[wheel]] is mounted to each deck with a [[caster]] so that each wheel can steer independently, and each caster has a steering axis that is tilted about 30° back from the vertical.

==Movement==


The motion requires that the board be twisted back and forth so as to move either just the back foot or both the front and back feet side to side, essentially pushing the board forward at the outside of the movement, before the foot is brought back in the other direction. In principle, the act is similar to what is required to propel one who is riding [[inline skates]] forward, as opposed to how skateboarders push with their feet on the ground. Riding a caster board requires using a twisting motion of hips and legs.

A rider or "caster boarder" gains speed because each wheel is mounted on a 30° slant on the bottom of each deck. When each deck is pushed to the side, it causes the board to be pushed upward by the wheels' rotation against the gradient of the mounts. This creates potential energy that is then released moves back down under the rider's weight and its own combined. The weight pushing the board back down causes the wheels to turn to face straight again. While riding on a caster board, the increase in height is barely noticeable unless the rider twists the board along the vertical axis too hard, causing stability to be momentarily reduced. 
[[File:Scootering video.webm|thumb|Demonstration of usage]]
Caster boarding has been introduced into many school curricula as a means of teaching the basic movement principles that govern board-sports. The success in its ability to engage with pupils not interested in sport was assessed in a 12-week, 6 secondary school case study in the UK carried out by Curriculum Ex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculum-ex.com/what-we-offer/case-studies/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330221339/http://www.curriculum-ex.com/what-we-offer/case-studies/ |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foot placement==
[[File:Werne-160-Skaten.JPG|thumb|As in skateboarding, riding with the left foot leading is called "[[Footedness|Regular stance]]". Riding with the right foot leading is called "Goofy stance".]]
Foot placement is critical on a caster board because one wheel rests under each foot while in use. In order to start with proper foot placement, it is necessary to have the front foot above the center of the front caster and to allow the back foot to give a good push of speed that will allow the board to keep proper balance. Attempting to place the back foot too quickly will make it even more difficult to achieve a desirable foot placement, so it is best to give that foot a maximum of two seconds for it to properly set itself on the board. More experienced riders will be able to place their back feet more quickly. A manual is performed by putting the rear foot on the back end of the rear deck without letting it come off and gently lifting the front foot.

If the user is already riding the board and the user recognizes that the foot placement is slightly undesirable, he/she could replace both feet simultaneously without interrupting his/her ride that is already taking place. This is done by the rider's first making sure that he/she is riding at a normal speed and that the riding surface ahead is stable for riding on and then jumping with both feet at a minimal height that allows both shoes to separate their treads from the grips of the caster board. The rider may continue to "hop around" the board until a most desirable foot placement is achieved and for as long as a proper speed is maintained. Hopping around may even more easily produce better results than getting off the board and getting back on again. A much more difficult means of replacing the feet while riding is attempting to correct only one foot at a time, increasing the risk of shifting his/her weight too far forward or backward and falling to the ground.

==Steering==
In order to steer properly on a caster board, the front foot must lean into the curve while the back foot leans out of the curve. By leaning the front foot in and the back foot out, the front wheel, which will have its front facing inward, is forced to form an arc with the back wheel, which will have its front facing outward. This arcing allows for very sharp turning, but can be exercised for making wide turns as well. While attempting to turn on the board at a higher speed and/or using a tighter arc, the rider leans his/her center of gravity into the turn to keep from falling from the board. However, like all vehicles, there is a limit to the combined sharpness and speed of turning on a caster board without it becoming overturned. It is possible to propel the board while turning by making weaving motions that are typically smaller than those of a relatively straight trajectory.

The wrong way to turn on a caster board is to lean both decks in the direction of the turn, which will cause the board to move away from the leaning direction in a parallel-sliding fashion.

==Safety==
A helmet, elbow pads, knee pads, gloves, and shin guards are recommended when using a caster board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripstik.com/us/support/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715185805/http://www.ripstik.com/us/support/ |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling is common for inexperienced riders.

==Tricks==
A variety of tricks can be done on a caster board. They are coping and ledge&lt;ref&gt;RipStik USA Trictionary - Coping and Ledge Tricks https://www.youtube.com/user/ripstikusa?blend=1&amp;ob=4#p/u/7/4b38n-cAHCY&lt;/ref&gt; tricks, manuals&lt;ref&gt;RipStik USA Tricktionary - Manual Tricks https://www.youtube.com/user/ripstikusa?blend=1&amp;ob=4#p/u/6/NBQpd4dmnqQ&lt;/ref&gt;, Carves and flips.&lt;ref&gt;RipStik USA Trictionary - Flips https://www.youtube.com/user/ripstikusa?blend=1&amp;ob=4#p/u/9/1PV4FCZs4vE&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skatepark ==

Casterboarders can ride in [[skatepark]]s as with other types of skateboards. However, some skateparks have prohibited caster boards. Planet Park ([[Hachioji]] city) skatepark in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]] allows only skateboards with four wheels and a single deck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tobuki-sp.jp/pdf/skatepark-selfcheck.pdf Skatepark self check sheet]{{ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japan Skatepark Association]] claims that if a caster board rider falls, it can be difficult to predict which direction the board will travel, constituting an unpredictable element of danger that may interfere with other skateboarders, inline-skaters and BMX riders in the park.

==Exercise==

The Vigorboard's ability to combine fun with a full cardio-vascular workout has prompted St Helens council to promote the boards in all of its high schools and some of its primary schools, seeing it as a method of inspiring children who wouldn't normally take part in traditional exercise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasports4kids.org/campaigns-2009/st-helens-council-new-skateboard-project.html St Helens Council Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008003003/http://www.lasports4kids.org/campaigns-2009/st-helens-council-new-skateboard-project.html |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vigorboard is proving a valuable weapon in the fight against childhood obesity, with some teachers at the schools currently trialing the boards also reporting drops in [[truancy]], with pupils not wishing to miss school should they miss their Vigorboard session.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/newsarticle.do?articleid=5235 New Skateboard Project Esclates]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent study conducted by the [[University of Salford]] found that vigorboarding resulted in an average increase in heart rate of 227% and a 535% increase in energy expenditure. The study also concluded that vigorboarding results in a 233% greater energy expenditure (407kcal/hr) than walking at 3&amp;nbsp;mph (174.5kcal/hr).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasports4kids.org/independent-reports/vigorboard-report.html Salford University Study Results Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008003032/http://www.lasports4kids.org/independent-reports/vigorboard-report.html |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its conclusion, the authors of the university study went on to say, 'Vigorboarding may be a useful alternative to increasing physical activity levels and energy expenditure, especially for individuals that do not wish to participate in the usual sports or activities performed by adolescents.'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasports4kids.org/includes/spaw2/uploads/files/Energy%20Expenditure%20and%20Heart%20Rate%20Response%20During%20Vigorboarding.pdf Full Salford University Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008003037/http://www.lasports4kids.org/includes/spaw2/uploads/files/Energy%20Expenditure%20and%20Heart%20Rate%20Response%20During%20Vigorboarding.pdf |date=2011-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11220">A '''cermet''' is a [[composite material]] composed of [[ceramic]] (cer) and metal (met) materials.

A cermet is ideally designed to have the optimal properties of both a [[ceramic]], such as high temperature resistance and hardness, and those of a metal, such as the ability to undergo [[plastic deformation]]. The metal is used as a binder for an [[oxide]], [[boride]], or [[carbide]]. Generally, the metallic elements used are [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], and [[cobalt]]. Depending on the physical structure of the material, cermets can also be [[metal matrix composite]]s, but cermets are usually less than 20% metal by volume.

Cermets are used in the manufacture of [[resistor]]s (especially [[potentiometer]]s), [[capacitor]]s, and other [[electronics|electronic]] components which may experience high temperature.

Cermets are used instead of tungsten carbide in saws and other brazed tools due to their superior wear and corrosion properties.  [[Titanium nitride]] (TiN), [[titanium carbonitride]] (TiCN), [[titanium carbide]] (TiC) and similar  can be brazed like [[tungsten carbide]] if properly prepared however they require special handling during grinding.

Composites of [[MAX phases]], an emerging class of ternary [[carbides]] or [[nitrides]] with [[aluminium]] or [[titanium]] [[alloys]] have been studied since 2006 as high-value materials exhibiting favourable properties of ceramics in terms of hardness and compressive strength alongside ductility and fracture toughness typically associated with metals. Such cermet materials, including aluminium-MAX phase composites,&lt;ref name="maxcom"&gt;{{cite journal| |title=  Compressive performance and crack propagation in Al alloy/Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AlC composites | journal= Materials Science and Engineering A  | year= 2016 |  volume=672  | pages=247–256| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921509316307419| doi= 10.1016/j.msea.2016.06.073}}&lt;/ref&gt; have potential applications in automotive and aerospace applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bingchu, M., | last2=Ming, Y. | last3=Jiaoqun, Z., &amp; Weibing, Z. | title=Preparation of TiAl/Ti2AlC composites with Ti/Al/C powders by in-situ hot pressing. | journal= Journal of Wuhan University of Technology-Mater. Sci | year=2006 | volume= 21|issue=2 | pages= 14–16. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maxcom" /&gt;

Some types of cermets are also being considered for use as spacecraft shielding as they resist the high velocity impacts of [[micrometeoroid]]s and [[orbital debris]] much more effectively than more traditional spacecraft materials such as aluminum and other metals.

==History&lt;ref name = "JRT"&gt;Tinklepaugh, James R.: "Cermets.", Reinhold Publishing Corporation, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;==
After [[World War II]], the need to develop high temperature and high stress-resistant materials became clear.  During the war, German scientists developed oxide base cermets as substitutes for alloys.  They saw a use for this for the high-temperature sections of new [[jet engines]] as well as high temperature turbine blades.  Today ceramics are routinely implemented in the combuster part of jet engines because it provides a heat-resistant chamber.  Ceramic turbine blades have also been developed.  These blades are lighter than steel and allow for greater acceleration of the blade assemblies.
 
The United States Air Force saw potential in the material technology and became one of the principal sponsors for various research programs in the US.  Some of the first universities to research were [[Ohio State University]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], and [[Rutgers University]].

The word cermet was actually coined by the [[United States Air Force]], the idea being that they are a combination of two materials, a [[metal]] and a [[ceramic]].  Basic physical properties of metals include [[ductility]], high strength, and high [[thermal conductivity]].  Ceramics possess basic physical properties such as a high [[melting point]], chemical stability, and especially [[redox|oxidation resistance]].

The first ceramic metal material developed used [[magnesium oxide]] (MgO), [[beryllium oxide]] (BeO), and [[aluminum oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) for the ceramic part.  Emphasis on high stress rupture strengths was around 980&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Metallurgical Concepts, "Creep and Stress Rupture". {{cite web |url=http://www.materialsengineer.com/CA-Creep-Stress-Rupture.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105090643/http://www.materialsengineer.com/CA-Creep-Stress-Rupture.htm |archivedate=2007-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio State University was the first to develop Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; based cermets with high stress rupture strengths around 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.  [[Kennametal]], a metal-working and tool company based in [[Latrobe, PA]], developed the first titanium carbide cermet with a 2800&amp;nbsp;psi and 100-hour stress-to-rupture strength at 980&amp;nbsp;°C.  Jet engines operate at this temperature and further research was invested on using these materials for components.

Quality control in manufacturing these ceramic metal composites was hard to standardize.  Production had to be kept to small batches and within these batches, the properties varied greatly.  Failure of the material was usually a result of undetected flaws usually nucleated during processing.

The existing technology in the 1950s reached a limit for jet engines where little more could be improved.  Subsequently, engine manufactures were reluctant to develop ceramic metal engines.

Interest was renewed in the 1960s when silicon nitride and silicon carbide were looked at more closely.  Both materials possessed better thermal shock resistance, high strength, and moderate thermal conductivity.

==Applications==
===Ceramic-to-metal joints and seals===
Cermets were first used extensively in ceramic-to-metal joint applications.  Construction of vacuum tubes was one of the first critical systems, with the electronics industry employing and developing such seals. German scientists recognized that vacuum tubes with improved performance and reliability could be produced by substituting ceramics for glass. Ceramic tubes can be outgassed at higher temperatures.  Because of the high-temperature seal, ceramic tubes withstand higher temperatures than glass tubes.  Ceramic tubes are also mechanically stronger and less sensitive to thermal shock than glass tubes.&lt;ref name="joining"/&gt;  Today, cermet vacuum tube coatings have proved to be key to solar hot water systems.

Ceramic-to-metal [[mechanical seal]]s have also been used.  Traditionally they have been used in [[fuel cells]] and other devices that convert chemical, nuclear, or thermionic energy to electricity.  The ceramic-to-metal seal is required to isolate the electrical sections of turbine-driven generators designed to operate in corrosive liquid-metal vapors.&lt;ref name="joining"&gt;Pattee, H.E. "Joining Ceramics and Graphite to Other Materials, A Report." Office of Technology Utilization National Aeronautics and Space Administration,  Washington D.C., 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bioceramics===
[[Image:Hip prosthesis.jpg|right|250px]]
[[Bioceramics]] play an extensive role in biomedical materials.  The development of these materials and diversity of manufacturing techniques has broadened the applications that can be used in the human body.  They can be in the form of thin layers on metallic implants, composites with a polymer component, or even just porous networks.  These materials work well within the human body for several reasons.  They are inert, and because they are resorbable and active, the materials can remain in the body unchanged.  They can also dissolve and actively take part in physiological processes, for example, when [[hydroxylapatite]], a material chemically similar to bone structure, can integrate and help bone grow into it.  Common materials used for bioceramics include alumina, zirconia, calcium phosphate, glass ceramics, and pyrolytic carbons.

One important use of bioceramics is in [[hip replacement surgery]]. The materials used for the replacement [[hip joint]]s were usually metals such as [[titanium]], with the hip socket usually lined with plastic.  The multiaxial ball was tough metal ball but was eventually replaced with a longer-lasting ceramic ball.  This reduced the roughening associated with the metal wall against the plastic lining of the artificial hip socket.  The use of ceramic implants extended the life of the hip replacement parts.&lt;ref&gt;Design Fax Online, "Hybrid Hip Joint". {{cite web|url=http://www.manufacturingcenter.com/dfx/archives/0503/0503app_ideas.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025813/http://www.manufacturingcenter.com/dfx/archives/0503/0503app_ideas.asp |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cermets are also used in [[dentistry]] as a material for fillings and prostheses.

===Transportation===

Ceramic parts have been used in conjunction with metal parts as friction materials for [[brakes]] and [[clutch]]es.&lt;ref name="joining"/&gt;

===Other applications===
The [[United States Army]] and [[British Army]] have had extensive research in the development of cermets.  These include the development of lightweight ceramic projectile-proof armor for soldiers and also [[Chobham armor]].

Cermets are also used in [[machining]] on [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]].

Cermets are also used as the ring material in high-quality line guides for fishing rods.

A cermet of depleted fissiable material (e.g. [[uranium]], [[plutonium]]) and [[sodalite]] has been researched for its benefits in the storage of nuclear waste.&lt;ref&gt;http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APCPCS000532000001000089000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar composites have also been researched for use as a fuel source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-archive.library.okstate.edu/mech_researchweek/2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126102205/http://e-archive.library.okstate.edu/mech_researchweek/2/ |archivedate=2007-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As nanostructured cermet, this material is used in the optical field, such as solar absorbers/[[selective surface]]. Thanks to the size of the particles (~5&amp;nbsp;nm), surface plasmons on the metallic particles are generated and enable the heat transmission.

For reasons regarding luxury, cermet is sometimes found to be case materials for some watches, including [[Jaeger-LeCoultre]]'s Deep Sea Chronograph Vintage Cermet watch.

The '''cosmos''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|k|ɒ|z|m|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|m|oʊ|s}}) is the [[universe]]. Using the word ''cosmos'' rather than the word ''universe'' implies viewing the universe as a complex and orderly [[system]] or entity; the opposite of [[Chaos (cosmogony)| chaos]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The cosmos, and our understanding of the reasons for its existence and significance, are studied in [[cosmology]] - a very broad discipline covering any scientific, religious, or philosophical contemplation of the cosmos and its nature, or reasons for existing. Religious and philosophical approaches may include in their concepts of the cosmos various spiritual entities or other matters deemed to exist outside our physical universe.

== Etymology ==
The [[philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]] first used the term ''cosmos'' ({{lang-grc|κόσμος}}) for the order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iamblichus]], ''Pyth.'', β 59; [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] ΙΙ 1.1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaxagoras]] further introduced the concept of a Cosmic Mind (''[[Nous]]'') ordering all things (Aetius Ι 3.5).&lt;/ref&gt; The term became part of modern language in the 19th century when geographer–polymath [[Alexander von Humboldt]] resurrected the use of the word from the ancient Greek, assigned it to his five-volume treatise, ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', which influenced modern and somewhat [[holism|holistic]] perception of the universe as one interacting [[entity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MfgpAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe|last=Humboldt|first=Alexander von|last2=Paul|first2=Benjamin Horatio|last3=von)|first3=Wilhelm Humboldt (Freiherr|last4=Dallas|first4=William Sweetland|date=1860|publisher=Harper &amp; brothers|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.humansandnature.org/introducing-humboldt-s-cosmos-article-26.php|title=Introducing Humboldt's Cosmos {{!}} Center for Humans &amp; Nature|website=Center for Humans &amp; Nature|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmology ==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|thumb|right|The Ancient and [[Medieval]] cosmos as depicted in [[Peter Apian]]'s ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539).]]
[[Cosmology]] is the study of the cosmos, and in its broadest sense covers a variety of very different approaches: scientific, religious and philosophical. All cosmologies have in common an attempt to understand the implicit order within the whole of being. In this way, most religions and [[philosophy|philosophical]] systems have a cosmology.

When ''cosmology'' is used without a qualifier, it often signifies physical cosmology, unless the context makes clear that a different meaning is intended.

=== Physical cosmology ===
{{main|Cosmology}}
Physical cosmology (often simply described as 'cosmology') is the scientific study of the universe, from the beginning of its physical existence. It includes speculative concepts such as a multiverse, when these are being discussed. In [[physical cosmology]], the term ''cosmos'' is often used in a technical way, referring to a particular [[spacetime]] continuum within a (postulated) [[multiverse]]. Our particular cosmos, the [[observable universe]], is generally capitalized as ''the Cosmos''. 

In physical cosmology, the uncapitalized term '''cosmic''' signifies a subject with a relationship to the universe, such as 'cosmic time' (time since the [[Big Bang]]), '[[cosmic rays]]' (high energy particles or radiation detected from [[outer space|space]]), and '[[cosmic microwave background]]' (microwave radiation detectable from all directions in space).

According to [[wikisource:Author:Charles Peter Mason|Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|Sir William Smith]] ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'' (1870, see book screenshot for full quote), [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] described the universe.&lt;ref name=CPM&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William Smith|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology|year=1870|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofgree03smituoft#page/304/|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philolaus-and-Philomelus-Pythagorean-Book.jpg|thumb|upright|Excerpt from [[Philolaus]] Pythagoras book, (Charles Peter Mason, 1870)]]
{{quote|
It appears, in fact, from this, as well as from the extant fragments, that the first book (from [[Philolaus]]) of the work contained a general account of the origin and arrangement of the universe. The second book appears to have been an exposition of the nature of numbers, which in the Pythagorean theory are the essence and source of all things. (p. 305)}}

=== Philosophical cosmology ===
{{main|Philosophical cosmology}}
Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] that deals with the nature of the universe, a theory or doctrine describing the natural order of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology|title=Definition of "Cosmology"|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic definition of Cosmology is the science of the origin and development of the universe. In modern astronomy the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] is the dominant postulation.

=== Religious cosmology ===
{{see also|Religious cosmology|Hellenistic philosophy and Christianity|Orphism (religion)}}

In [[theology]], the cosmos is the [[Creation myth|created]] heavenly bodies (sun, moon, planets, and [[fixed stars]]). In [[Christian theology]], the word is also used synonymously with ''[[aeon|aion]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concerning Aion and Aionios|url=http://www.saviourofall.org/Writings/aion.html|publisher=Saviour of All Fellowship|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to "worldly life" or "this world" or "this age" as opposed to the [[afterlife]] or [[world to come]].

The 1870 book ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' noted&lt;ref name=CPM /&gt;
:[[Thales]] dogma that water is the origin of things, that is, that it is that out of which every thing arises, and into which every thing resolves itself, Thales may have followed Orphic cosmogonies, while, unlike them, he sought to establish the truth of the assertion. Hence, Aristotle, immediately after he has called him the originator of philosophy brings forward the reasons which Thales was believed to have adduced in confirmation of that assertion; for that no written development of it, or indeed any book by ''Thales'', was extant, is proved by the expressions which Aristotle uses when he brings forward the doctrines and proofs of the [[Miletus|Milesian]]. (p. 1016)

:[[Plato]], describes the idea of the good, or the Godhead, sometimes ''teleologically'', as the ultimate purpose of all conditioned existence; sometimes ''cosmologically'', as the ultimate operative cause; and has begun to develop the ''cosmological'', as also the physico-theological proof for the being of God; but has referred both back to the idea of the Good, as the necessary presupposition to all other ideas, and our cognition of them. (p. 402)

The book ''The Works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 ''Fragments'') mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The Works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, W. D. (William David), 1877|author3=Smith, J. A. (John Alexander), 1863-1939|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Aristotle says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (see [[Cercops]]).

[[Bertrand Russell]] (1947) noted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1947|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The Orphics were an ascetic sect; wine, to them, was only a symbol, as, later, in the Christian sacrament. The intoxication that they sought was that of "enthusiasm," of union with the god. They believed themselves, in this way, to acquire mystic knowledge not obtainable by ordinary means. This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism as Orpheus was a reformer of the religion of Dionysus. From Pythagoras Orphic elements entered into the philosophy of Plato, and from Plato into most later philosophy that was in any degree religious.

Cryoconite typically settles and concentrates at the bottom of these holes creating a noticeable dark mass.

Soot decreases the reflectivity, or [[albedo]] of ice, increasing absorption of heat. Cryoconite is constantly being added to snow and ice formations along with snow. It is buried within the snow or ice, but as the snow or ice melts increasing amounts of dark material is exposed on the surface, accelerating melting.&lt;ref name = "Nat. Geo" /&gt;

A '''deaerating feed tank''' (DFT), often found in steam plants that propel ships, is located after the main condensate pump and before the main feed booster pump. It has these three purposes:

# Remove dissolved oxygen (“air”) from the condensate
# Pre-heat the feedwater
# Provide a storage/surge volume

Based on the relevant theoretical [[Rankine cycle]] diagram, there are four main processes, or steps:
: 1 to 2 Water pressure is raised from low to high (pump work in) ([[feedwater pump]])
: 2 to 3 Water is heated to boiling                             (heat input) ([[Boiler (steam generator)|steam generator]])
: 3 to 4 [[Steam]] is expanded in the turbine                         (work out) ([[turbine]])
: 4 to 1 Wet [[vapor]] is condensed                                 (condensing) ([[surface condenser]])

In the practical implementation of a Rankine cycle, it is common to break the single pump (process 1 to 2) into three pumps: (in water flow order:  [[condensate pump]], feed booster pump and then [[feedwater pump]]). 

== Details ==
# Dissolved oxygen is removed by injecting auxiliary exhaust steam into the upper portion of the tank (above the feed water level) at roughly the same location (elevation) that the condensate enters the tank.  The two are put in close physical contact over a large surface area to maximize heat transfer.  As the condensate is heated, the steam drives off any dissolved gasses.  Since the steam is injected above the feed water level a steam blanket forms above the water to keep the non-condensable gasses from re-entering the feed water.  There is a connection to the gland exhaust system on the upper portion of the DFT that withdraws the oxygen and other non-condensable gasses as they are driven from the condensate.  Removing oxygen minimizes [[corrosion]] and improves the vacuum quality.
# The [[steam]] heats the water in the tank
# The water in the tank serves as a surge volume within the steam plant.

A surge volume allows the plant to change bells (power output level) without running the feed pump dry or flooding the turbines.  Consider the plant running in a steady state condition.

The bell is increased, more power output demanded, the rate of feed is increased.  This draws more water from the condenser, perhaps to the point of being dry and starving the boiler resulting in a loss of propulsion.  This is until the water, converted to steam, provides its energy to the turbine and then is condensed in the condenser.

The bell is decreased, less power output demanded, the rate of feed is decreased.  Since less water is drawn from the condenser the condensate level rises, covering more condenser tubes, reducing the ability of the condenser to maintain vacuum and, if the level is allowed to go high enough, vacuum could be lost and/or water could impinge (and damage) the turbine blades as the turbine normally sits directly above the condenser.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5059">In [[condensed matter physics]] and [[electrochemistry]], '''drift current''' is the [[electric current]], or movement of [[charge carrier]]s, which is due to the applied [[electric field]], often stated as the [[electromotive force]] over a given distance. When an electric field is applied across a semiconductor material, a current is produced due to the flow of charge carriers.

The ''[[drift velocity]]'' is the average velocity of the charge carriers in the drift current. The drift velocity, and resulting current, is characterized by the ''mobility''; for details, see [[electron mobility]] (for solids) or [[electrical mobility]] (for a more general discussion).

See [[drift–diffusion equation]] for the way that the drift current, [[diffusion current]], and [[carrier generation and recombination]] are combined into a single equation.

==Overview==

Drift current is the [[electric current]] caused by particles getting pulled by an electric field. The term is most commonly used in the context of electrons and [[electron hole|holes]] in [[semiconductor]]s, although the same concept also applies to metals, [[electrolyte]]s, and so on.

Drift current is caused by the [[electric force]]: Charged particles get pushed by an electric field. Electrons, being negatively charged, get pushed in the opposite direction to the electric field, while holes get pushed in the same direction as the electric field, but the resulting [[conventional current]] points in the same direction as the electric field in both cases.

If an electric field is applied to an electron in a vacuum, the electron will accelerate faster and faster, in approximately a straight line. A drift current looks very different than that up close. Typically, electrons are moving randomly in all directions ([[Brownian motion]]), frequently changing direction when they collide with grain boundaries or other disturbances. Between collisions, the electric field subtly accelerates them in one direction. So over time, they move at the [[drift velocity]] on average, but at any instant the electrons are moving at the (typically much faster) [[thermal velocity]].

The amount of drift current depends on the concentration of charge carriers and their [[electrical mobility|mobility]] in the material or medium.

===Drift current versus diffusion current===
{{further|Diffusion current}}
Drift current frequently occurs at the same time as [[diffusion current]]; the following table compares the two forms of current:

|}

==Drift current in a p-n junction diode==

In a [[p-n junction]] diode, electrons and holes are the minority charge carriers in the p-region and the n-region, respectively. In an unbiased junction, due to the diffusion of charge carriers, the diffusion current, which flows from the p to n region, is exactly balanced by the equal and opposite drift current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Halliday|title=Physics, Volume 2, 5Th Ed|publisher=Wiley-India, 2007|isbn=978-81-265-1089-4|pages=1115|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a biased p-n junction, the drift current is independent of the biasing, as the number of minority carriers is independent of the biasing voltages. But as minority charge carriers can be thermally generated, drift current is temperature dependent. 

When an electric field is applied across the semiconductor material, the charge carriers attain a certain drift velocity . This combined effect of movement of the charge carriers constitutes a current known as  "drift current". Drift current density due to the charge carriers such as free electrons and holes is the current passing through a square centimeter area perpendicular to the direction of flow.

(i) Drift current density J&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, due to free electrons is given by:

&lt;math&gt;J_n=qn\mu_nE\quad(A/cm^2)&lt;/math&gt;

(ii) Drift current density J&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, due to holes is given by:

&lt;math&gt;J_p=qp\mu_pE\quad(A/cm^2)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
n - Number of free electrons per cubic centimeter.

p - Number of holes per cubic centimeter

&lt;math&gt;\mu_n&lt;/math&gt; – Mobility of electrons in &lt;math&gt;cm^2/Vs&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mu_p&lt;/math&gt; – Mobility of holes in &lt;math&gt;cm^2/Vs&lt;/math&gt;

E – Applied Electric Field Intensity in V /cm

Domestic [[housing in the United Kingdom]] presents a possible opportunity for achieving the 20% overall cut in UK [[carbon dioxide]] emissions targeted by the Government for 2010. However, the process of achieving that drop is proving problematic given the very wide range of age and condition of the UK housing stock.

==Carbon emissions==
Although carbon emissions from housing have remained fairly stable since 1990 (due to the increase in household energy use having been compensated for by the 'dash for gas'), housing accounted for around 30% of all the UK's [[carbon dioxide]] emissions in 2004 (40 million tonnes of carbon)&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmenvaud/135/13507.htm#a23 House of Commons - Environmental Audit - First Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; up from 26.42% in 1990 as a proportion of the UK's total emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D7280.xls |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215071804/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Expodata/Spreadsheets/D7280.xls |archivedate=15 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 42mt/159mt x 100 --&gt; The [[Select Committee on Environmental Audit]] noted that emissions from housing could constitute over 55% of the UK's target for carbon emissions in 2050.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A 2006 report commissioned by [[Centrica|British Gas]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishgasnews.co.uk/managed_content/files/pdf/greenCity.pdf Domestic Carbon Dioxide Emissions for Selected Cities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626020736/http://www.britishgasnews.co.uk/managed_content/files/pdf/greenCity.pdf |date=26 June 2008 }}, ''[[Centrica|British Gas]]'', published 20 February 2006. Retrieved 9 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated the average carbon emissions for housing in each of the local authorities in [[Great Britain]], the first time that this had been done. This indicated that housing in [[Uttlesford]] ([[Essex]]) produced the highest emissions (8,092&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling). This was 250% higher than housing in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] ([[London]]) which produced the least (averaging 3,255&amp;nbsp;kg). Among the 23 towns included, [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] had the highest emissions (6,189&amp;nbsp;kg), with [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] the lowest (4,395&amp;nbsp;kg). The variations are due to a number of factors, including the age, size and type of the housing stock, together with the efficiency of heating systems, the mix of fuels used, the ownership of appliances, occupancy levels and the habits of the occupants.

===Zero carbon ambition===
In the December 2006 [[Pre-Budget Report]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pre_budget_report/prebud_pbr06/prebud_pbr06_index.cfm Pre-Budget Report 2006: Index&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201075130/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/pre_budget_report/prebud_pbr06/prebud_pbr06_index.cfm |date=1 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Government announced their 'ambition' that all new homes will be 'zero-carbon' by 2016 (i.e. built to [[zero-carbon building]] standards). To encourage this, an exemption from [[Stamp duty land tax]] is to be granted, lasting until 2012, for all new zero-carbon homes up to £500,000 in value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_07/bud_bud07_speech.cfm Budget 2007: Speech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328235201/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/budget_07/bud_bud07_speech.cfm |date=28 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst some organisations applauded the initial announcement of the scheme, in the pre-budget statement from the then UK Chancellor, Gordon Brown, others are concerned about the government's ability to deliver on the promise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/newsletter/december_06.asp Green Building&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307015759/http://www.newbuilder.co.uk/newsletter/december_06.asp |date=7 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6214434.stm | work=BBC News | title=New homes to be 'zero emission' | date=6 December 2006 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic energy use==
The housing stock in the United Kingdom is amongst the least energy efficient in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/postpn249.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211121017/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/postpn249.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, housing (including space heating, hot water, lighting, cooking, and appliances) accounted for 30.23% of all energy use in the UK (up from 27.70% in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf DTI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209070902/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10738.pdf |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure for [[London]] is higher at approximately 37%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeanlambertmep.org.uk/ Jean Lambert Green MEP for London&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the progressive tightening of the [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]]' requirements for energy efficiency since the 1970s (see the history section below), it might be expected that a significant cut in domestic energy use would have occurred, however this has not yet been the case.

Although [[Building insulation|insulation]] standards have been increasing, so has the standard of home heating. In 1970, only 31% of homes had [[central heating]]. By 2003 it had been installed in 92% of British homes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file17832.xls DTI] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060716051816/http%3A//www.dti.gov.uk/files/file17832.xls |date=16 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; leading in turn to a rise in the average temperature within them (from 12.1&amp;nbsp;°C to 18.20&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file17841.xls DTI] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060716051837/http%3A//www.dti.gov.uk/files/file17841.xls |date=16 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in homes with central heating, average temperatures rose 4.55&amp;nbsp;°C during this period.

At the same time, the increase in the number of households, increasing numbers of domestic electrical appliances, an increase in the number of light fittings, reduction in the average number of occupants per household, plus other factors, had led to an increase in total national [[domestic energy consumption]] from around 25% in 1970 to about 30% in 2001, and remained on an upward trend ([[Building Research Establishment|BRE]] figures).

The figures for energy consumed by end use for 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file17822.xls DTI] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20060716051831/http%3A//www.dti.gov.uk/files/file17822.xls |date=16 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Space heating]] - 60.51% (57.61% in 1990)
*Water heating - 23.60% (25.23% in 1990)
*Appliances and [[lighting]] - 13.15% (13.4% in 1990)
*[[stove|Cooking]] - 2.74% (3.76%)

==The Green Deal==
{{main|The Green Deal}}
The Green Deal provided low interest loans for [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements to the energy bills of the properties the upgrades are performed on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15529036 |title=BBC News - UK government's Green Deal to cut fuel bills |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These debts are passed onto new occupiers when they take over the payment of energy bills. The costs of the loan repayments should be less than the savings on the bills from the upgrades, however this will be a guideline and not legally enforceable guarantee. It is believed that tying repayment to energy bills will give investors a secure return.
The Green Deal for the domestic property market was launched in October 2012. The Commercial Green Deal was launched in January 2012 and released in a series of stages to help with the varying needs and requirements of commercial properties.

==Building regulations==
[[Image:UKHomePerformanceRatingChartsVertical.png|thumb|right|180px|Home energy performance rating charts]]
The 1965 Building Regulations introduced the first limits on the amount of energy that could be lost through certain elements of the fabric of new houses. This was expressed as a [[Thermal conductivity#related terms|u-value]]—the amount of heat lost per square metre, for each degree Celsius of temperature difference between inside and outside.

In effect, the Target Insulation is a ratio of 1.33&amp;nbsp;W/m²·K of wall area (Document L 2006). So to keep your square metre warm, you are limited as to how much power you can use. This is slightly regressive in that richer people live in bigger houses which tend to have a lower surface area/floor area, although this is partially offset by them being detached, as opposed to, say, terraced.

These limits were tightened following the [[1973 oil crisis]], and on several subsequent occasions (see [[Energy efficiency in British housing#Historic building regulations energy efficiency requirements|below]]). Despite this, UK insulation levels have remained low compared to the [[European Union|EU]] average.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locosoc.info/download/projects_management/interim%20report/Annex5%20-%20WP3.doc]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in 2006===
The [[energy policy of the United Kingdom]] through the 2003 Energy White Paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf BERR - Redirect&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925194653/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf |date=25 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; articulated directions for more energy efficient building construction. Hence, the year 2006 saw a significant tightening of [[energy efficient use|energy efficiency]] requirements within the Building Regulations (for earlier regulations, see separate section [[Energy efficiency in British housing#Historic building regulations energy efficiency requirements|below]]).

With the long term aim of cutting overall emissions by 60% by 2050, and by 80% by 2100, the intention of the 2006 changes was to cut energy use in new housing by 20% compared to a similar building constructed to the 2002 standards. The changes were the first to the regulations brought about by the desire to reduce emissions, though some have raised doubts about whether they will actually achieve the 20% cut (see criticisms section).

In the 2006 regulations, the u-value was replaced as the primary measure of energy efficiency by the Dwelling Carbon Dioxide Emission Rate (DER),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breeam.org/pdf/EH2006EnergyCredits_v1.pdf Dwelling Carbon Dioxide Emission Rate]&lt;/ref&gt; an estimate of carbon dioxide emissions per m² of floor area. This is calculated using the Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP 2005).&lt;ref&gt;[http://projects.bre.co.uk/sap2005/ Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings 2005], ''[[Building Research Establishment]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the levels of insulation provide by the structure of the building, the DER also takes into account the airtightness of the building, the efficiency of space and water heating, the efficiency of lighting, and any savings from [[solar power]] or other energy generation technologies employed, and other factors. For the first time, it also became compulsory to upgrade the energy efficiency in existing houses when extensions or certain other works are carried out.

Some organisations have raised doubts over the claim that the changes will result in a 20% saving. Issues cited have included alleged problems with the calculation methods, the limitations of the modelling software, and the specification of the reference building used in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aecb.net/PDFs/NewHomesCO2Savings25May06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006100215/http://www.aecb.net/PDFs/NewHomesCO2Savings25May06.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 2005 study sponsored by the Pilkington Energy Efficiency Trust&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilkington.com/europe/uk+and+ireland/english/building+products/pilkington4architects/peet.htm Pilkington Energy Efficiency Trust]&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that the savings would only be in the region of 9%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nher.co.uk/pages/insight/The%20Impact%20of%20proposed%20changes%20to%20Part%20L1A.pdf Microsoft Word - Report A.doc&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925230634/http://www.nher.co.uk/pages/insight/The%20Impact%20of%20proposed%20changes%20to%20Part%20L1A.pdf |date=25 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home energy labelling==
Originally, from June 2007, all homes (and other buildings) in the UK would have to undergo [[Energy performance certificate|Energy Performance Certification]] (also commonly known as an EPC Certificate) before they are sold or let,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1002882&amp;PressNoticeID=2174 Communities and Local Government&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620142121/http://www.odpm.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1002882&amp;PressNoticeID=2174 |date=20 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to meet the requirements of the [[Directive on the energy performance of buildings|European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2002/91/EC)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV%3Al27042 European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (Directive 2002/91/EC)] Official Journal of the European Communities, published 02-12-16. Retrieved 21 July 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme provides the owner or landlord with an '[[European Union energy label|energy label]]' so that they can demonstrate the energy efficiency of the property, and is also included in the new [[Home Information Pack]]s. The scheme has been criticized for its methodology and superficial approach, especially for old buildings. For example, it ignores thick walls with their low heat transmission, and its recommendations for [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s, which can damage sensitive [[textile]]s and [[paintings]].

It is hoped that energy labelling will raise awareness of energy efficiency, and encourage upgrading to make properties more marketable. Incentives may be available for carrying out energy conservation measures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?ReleaseID=228873&amp;NewsAreaID=2 Cooper calls for incentives to improve home energy ratings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165422/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?ReleaseID=228873&amp;NewsAreaID=2 |date=30 September 2007 }}, Government News Network, published 06-09-21. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For new building, SAP 2005 calculations are to form the basis for the certification, while RDSAP (Reduced Data SAP) will be used to assess existing properties. It is estimated that only 10% of the nation's housing will score above 60 on the scale, although most will score above 40.&lt;ref&gt;'' New Scientist, November 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rating schemes==
Another rating scheme of note is the Government sponsored [[EcoHomes]] rating, mostly used in [[public housing|public sector housing]], and only applicable to new properties or major refurbishments. This actually measures a range of sustainability issues, of which energy efficiency is only one. EcoHomes is to be replaced by the Government's [[Code for Sustainable Homes]] in 2007.

The [[Energy Saving Trust]] set requirements for 'good practice' and 'advanced practice' for achieving lower energy buildings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.est.org.uk/housingbuildings/professionals/standards/goodandadvanced/ About Good and Advanced practice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925015650/http://www.est.org.uk/housingbuildings/professionals/standards/goodandadvanced/ |date=25 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Association for Environment Conscious Building|Association for Environment Conscious Building's]] ''CarbonLite'' programme specifies Silver and Gold standards, the latter approaching a [[zero energy building]].

In Wales where 'zero-carbon homes' are the aspiration for 2011 (although 2012 is more likely) the requirements are for Code for Sustainable Homes or equivalent. This has opened the doors for standards like Passiv Haus and the CarbonLite programme. Another lesser known building type that does not rely on airtightness in order to get its energy rating is Bio-Solar-Haus. This is not a well known type of house, but it has a range of positive advantages like it is built out of renewable resources and it is a breathable structure thus making it much healthier to live in.

==Grants==
[[Image:Urbine221dc.jpg|thumb|100px|Rooftop turbine]]
The Government's [[low carbon buildings programme]] was launched in 2006 to replace the earlier ''Clear Skies'' and ''Solar PV'' programmes. It offers grants towards the costs of [[Active solar|solar thermal heating]], [[Wind power#Small scale|small wind turbine]], [[micro hydro]], [[ground source heat pump]], and [[biofuel|biomass]] installations. As of January 2007 funding for grants is proving insufficient to meet demand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070216063010/http://www.r-p-a.org.uk/article_default_view.fcm?articleid=2322&amp;subsite=1 Renewable Energy Association - News Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar scheme, the [[Scottish Community and Household Renewables Initiative]] operates in [[Scotland]], which also offers grants towards the cost of [[air source heat pumps]].

==Local government==
Under the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150217213557/http://www.greendealcentral.com/docs/ukpga.pdf Home Energy Conservation Act 1995], [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local authorities]] are required to consider measures to improve the energy efficiency of all residential accommodation in their areas, although they are not required to implement any measures. Most local authorities provide free advice on energy conservation and some also provide home visits, often targeting those in social housing and the [[Fuel poverty|fuel poor]]. Some also demand minimum levels of energy efficiency in newly constructed buildings. It was expected that the Act would result in a 30% cut in energy usage between 1996 and 2010. An overall cumulative improvement of 14.7% was reported to DEFRA for the year ending March 2004, but a large part of this would have happened without HECA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1155821 |accessdate=21 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920173159/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1155821 |archivedate=20 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the South,{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} most local authority housing was sold off in the 1980s-90s under RTB ([[Right to buy scheme]]), so the remaining stock is small. Much social housing has also been transferred to [[housing association]]s.

==Demonstration and pioneering projects==

One of the most important energy efficiency demonstration projects was the 1986 [[Energy World]] exhibition in [[Milton Keynes]], which attracted international interest. Fifty-one houses were built, designed to be at least 30% more efficient than the Building Regulations then in force. This was calculated using the Milton Keynes Energy Cost Index (MKECI), a test-bed for the subsequent SAP rating system and the [[National Home Energy Rating]] scheme. Energy World was preceded by the earlier [[Salford low-energy house]]s, built in the early 1980s, which continue to be 40% more efficient than the 2010 Building Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.building4change.com/page.jsp?id=850 Thirty year old Salford homes make case for passive design] Building4Change, published 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beddington Zero Energy Development ([[BedZED]]), a non-traditional housing scheme of 82 dwellings near [[Beddington]], London included zero fossil energy usage as one of its key design features. The project was completed in 2002 and is the UK's largest eco-development. As designed, the energy used is generated from [[renewable energy|renewables]] on site. In use, BedZED has yielded considerable useful feedback, not least that energy efficiency and passive design features delivery more reliable reduced carbon emissions than active systems. Due to their [[superinsulation]], the properties use 88% less energy (measured) for space heating compared to those built to the 2002 Building Regulations, while the reduction for water heating is 57%. Measured electrical use for cooking, appliances and occupant's plug loads ('unregulated energy' consumption) are some 55% lower than UK norms ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110717055409/http://www.bioregional.com/news-views/publications/bedzed-seven-years-on/ bedzed-seven-years-on]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==International comparisons==
International comparisons of particular note include:
*The 1977 [[Denmark|Danish]] ''BR77'' standard (the first to set demanding energy efficiency requirements).
*The SBN-80 (Svensk Bygg Norm) 1980 [[Sweden|Swedish]] Building Standards, which in 1983 was in advance of the UK 2002 standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkitektur.lth.se/?document=EBD/Utbil/TNA265/TNA265-F2_nul%C3%A4ge%20o%20historisk%20%C3%A5terblick.pdf Arkitektur och byggd miljö: Institutionen för arkitektur och byggd miljö&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The voluntary [[Canada|Canadian]] [[R-2000 program|R-2000]] standard, to which around 14,000 houses had been built in the 10 years to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201700/http://www.bpa.gov/Energy/n/reports/Results_Center/pdf/26.pdf R-2000 Energy Efficiency Home Program], [[Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources (Canada)|Energy, Mines and Resources, Canada]], published 1992. Retrieved 2 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then many more have been built in Canada, in [[Japan]], and in various other countries including a number in the UK. Currently energy savings of 30% to 40% are typically achieved in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://r2000.chba.ca/Why_buy_an_R2000_home/energy_efficiency.php Welcome to R-2000&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526003454/http://r2000.chba.ca/Why_buy_an_R2000_home/energy_efficiency.php |date=26 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The voluntary [[Germany|German]] [[Passivhaus]] standard. Properties built to the standards use approximately 85% less energy and produce 95% less carbon dioxide compared to properties built to the UK's 2002 standards. Over 6,000 such houses have been built across several [[Europe]]an countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.passivhaustagung.de/elfte/english/01_start_home.html www.passivhaustagung.de&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203214952/http://www.passivhaustagung.de/elfte/english/01_start_home.html |date=3 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The voluntary [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Minergie]] standard which requires that general energy consumption must not to be higher than 75% of that of average buildings and that fossil-fuel consumption must not be higher than 50% of the consumption of such buildings, and the [[Minergie|Minergie-P]] standard, requiring virtually zero energy consumption.

==Research==
In 2005, the Select Committee on Environmental Audit expressed their concern that there was a lack of significant funding for research and development of sustainable construction methods,&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmenvaud/135/13507.htm#n118 House of Commons - Environmental Audit - First Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; with funding for the [[Building Research Establishment]] having been "drastically" cut in the previous 4 years. As a result, many of the sustainable building materials used in the UK are imported from [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]—some of the countries that have been prominent in research.

==Existing housing stock==
Even if all new housing does become zero carbon by 2016, the energy efficiency of the remainder of the housing stock would need to be addressed.

The 2006 ''Review of the Sustainability of Existing Buildings'' revealed that 6.1 million homes lacked an adequate thickness of loft insulation, 8.5 million homes had uninsulated cavity walls, and that there is a potential to insulate 7.5 million homes that have solid external walls. These three measures alone have the potential to save 8.5 million tonnes of carbon emissions each year. Despite this, 95% of home owners think that the heating of their own home is currently effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1504372] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101090422/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1504372 |date=1 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the 2006 changes, it was predicted that the introduction of these limits would result in a 20% reduction in energy use for heating. A survey by [[Liverpool John Moores University]] predicted that the actual figure would be 6% ''(Johnson, JA “Building Regulations Research Project”)''.

In the '''1995''' Building Regulations, insulation standards were cut to the following U-values:
*0.45 for exposed walls, floors and ground floors
*0.6 for semi-exposed walls and floors
*0.25 for roofs
*the limit on window area was raised to 22.5%

The '''2002''' regulations reduced the U-values, and made additional elements of the building fabric subject to control. Although there was in practice considerable flexibility and the ability to 'trade off' reductions in one area for increases in another, the 'target' limits became:
*0.35 for walls
*0.25 for floors
*0.20 or 0.25 for pitched roofs (depending on the construction)
*0.16 for flat roofs
*2.2 for metal framed doors and windows
*2.0 for other doors and windows
*the limit on window area was raised again to 25%

Similar limits were introduced into [[Scotland]] in 2002 &amp; 2006, though with a lower limit of 0.3 or 0.27 for walls, and some other variations.

It was claimed by Government that these measures should cut the heating requirement by 25%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/save/save2002.pdf DTI: Energy efficiency in the UK 1990-2000, pdf file] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217030805/http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/inform/save/save2002.pdf |date=17 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the 1995 Regulations. It was subsequently also claimed that they had achieved a 50% cut compared to the 1990 Regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf 2003 Energy White Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925194653/http://www.dti.gov.uk/files/file10719.pdf |date=25 September 2006 }}, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

While the u-value ceased being the sole consideration in '''2006''', u-value limits similar to those in the 2002 regulations still apply, but are no longer sufficient by themselves. The DER, and TER (Target Emission rate) calculated through either the UK Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP rating), 2005 edition, or the newer SBEM (*Simplified Building Energy Model) which is aimed at non-dwellings, became the only acceptable calculation methods. Several commercial energy modeling software packages have now also been verified as producing acceptable evidence by the BRE Global &amp; UK Government. Calculations using previous versions of SAP had been an optional way of demonstrating compliance since 1991(?). They are now a statutory requirement (B. Reg.17C et al.) for all building regulations applications, involving new dwelling/buildings and large extensions to existing non-domestic buildings.

'''Exotic hadrons''' are a [[subatomic particles]] composed of [[quarks]] and [[gluons]], but which - unlike "well-known" hadrons such as [[proton]]s , [[neutron]]s and [[meson]]s - consist of more than three [[valence quark]]s.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with ordinary hadrons, exotic hadrons are classified as being either [[fermion]]s, like ordinary baryons, or [[boson]]s, like ordinary mesons. According to this classification scheme, [[pentaquark]]s, containing five valence quarks, are exotic baryons, while [[tetraquark]]s (four valence quarks) and [[hexaquark]]s (six quarks, consisting of either a dibaryon or three quark-antiquark pairs) would be considered [[exotic meson]]s. Tetraquark and pentaquark particles are believed to have been observed and are being investigated; [[Hexaquark]]s have not yet been confirmed as observed.

Exotic hadrons can be searched for by looking for [[S-matrix]] poles with [[quantum numbers]] forbidden to ordinary hadrons. Experimental signatures for such exotic hadrons have been seen by at least 2003&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tetraquark]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/reviews/nonqqbar_mxxx050.pdf "note on non-q qbar mesons" in PDG 2006, Journal of Physics, G 33 (2006) 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; but remain a topic of controversy in [[particle physics]].

Jaffe and Low&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Jaffe|R. L. Jaffe]] and [[Francis E. Low|F. E. Low]], Phys. Rev. D 19, 2105 (1979). {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevD.19.2105}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that the exotic hadrons manifest themselves as poles of the P matrix, and not of the S matrix. Experimental [[P-matrix]] poles are determined reliably in both the [[meson-meson channels]] and [[nucleon-nucleon channels]].

==History==
When the quark model was first postulated by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and others in the 1960s, it was to organize the states known then to be in existence in a meaningful way. As [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) developed over the next decade, it became apparent that there was no reason why only three-quark and quark-antiquark combinations could exist. Indeed, Gell-Mann's original 1964 paper alludes to the possibility of exotic hadrons and classifies hadrons into baryons and mesons depending upon whether they have an odd (baryon) or even (meson) number of valence quarks.&lt;ref name="Gell-Man1964"&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1016/S0031-9163(64)92001-3
|bibcode = 1964PhL.....8..214G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it seemed that gluons, the mediator particles of the strong interaction, could also form bound states by themselves ([[glueball]]s) and with quarks ([[hybrid hadrons]]). Several decades have passed without conclusive evidence of an exotic hadron that could be associated with the S-matrix pole.

In April 2014, the [[LHCb]] collaboration confirmed the existence of the Z(4430)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, discovered by [[Belle experiment|Belle]], and demonstrated that it must have a minimal quark content of ''c{{overline|c}}d{{overline|u}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1404.1903|title=Observation of the resonant character of the Z(4430)&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state|date=7 April 2014|author=[[LHCb collaboration]]|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.222002|pmid=24949760|volume=112|issue=22|pages=222002|journal=Physical Review Letters|bibcode=2014PhRvL.112v2002A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, [[LHCb]] announced the discovery of two particles, named {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}(4380)}} and {{nowrap|P{{su|p=+|b=c}}(4450)}}, which must have minimal quark content ''c{{overline|c}}uud'', making them pentaquarks.&lt;ref name="LHCbpentaquarks"&gt;

The term is used in analogy to [[ferromagnetism]], in which a material exhibits a permanent [[magnetic moment]]. Ferromagnetism was already known when ferroelectricity was discovered in 1920 in [[Rochelle salt]] by Valasek.&lt;ref name=Valasek&gt;See {{Cite journal|author= J. Valasek |title= Piezoelectric and allied phenomena in Rochelle salt |journal=Physical Review |volume=15 |issue= 6 |page=537 |year=1920|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.15.505|bibcode = 1920PhRv...15..505. }} and {{Cite journal|author= J.

==Polarization==
[[Image:Dielectric polarisation.svg|right|frame|Dielectric polarization]]
[[Image:Paraelectric polarisation.svg|right|frame|Paraelectric polarization]]
[[Image:Ferroelectric polarisation.svg|right|frame|Ferroelectric polarization]]
When most materials are polarized, the polarization induced, ''P'', is almost exactly proportional to the applied external electric field ''E''; so the polarization is a linear function.  This is called dielectric polarization (see figure). Some materials, known as [[Paraelectricity|paraelectric]] materials,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chiang, Y. et al.]]: Physical Ceramics, ''[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]'' 1997, New York&lt;/ref&gt; show a more enhanced nonlinear polarization (see figure). The electric [[permittivity]], corresponding to the slope of the polarization curve, is not constant as in dielectrics but is a function of the external electric field.

In addition to being nonlinear, ferroelectric materials demonstrate a spontaneous nonzero polarization (after entrainment, see figure) even when the applied field ''E'' is zero. The distinguishing feature of ferroelectrics is that the spontaneous polarization can be ''reversed'' by a suitably strong applied electric field in the opposite direction; the polarization is therefore dependent not only on the current electric field but also on its history, yielding a [[hysteresis]] loop.  They are called ferroelectrics by analogy to [[ferromagnetic]] materials, which have spontaneous [[magnetization]] and exhibit similar hysteresis loops.

Typically, materials demonstrate ferroelectricity only below a certain phase transition temperature, called the [[Curie temperature#Curie temperature in ferroelectric materials|Curie temperature]] (''T''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) and are paraelectric above this temperature: the spontaneous polarization vanishes, and the ferroelectric crystal transforms into the paraelectric state. Many ferroelectrics lose their piezoelectric properties above Tc completely, because their paraelectric phase has a centrosymmetric crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Safari|first1=Ahmad|title=Piezoelectric and acoustic materials for transducer applications|date=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0387765402|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The nonlinear nature of ferroelectric materials can be used to make capacitors with tunable capacitance. Typically, a [[ferroelectric capacitor]] simply consists of a pair of electrodes sandwiching a layer of ferroelectric material. The permittivity of ferroelectrics is not only tunable but commonly also very high in absolute value, especially when close to the phase transition temperature. Because of this, ferroelectric capacitors are small in physical size compared to dielectric (non-tunable) capacitors of similar capacitance.

The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric materials implies a [[hysteresis]] effect which can be used as a memory function, and ferroelectric capacitors are indeed used to make [[ferroelectric RAM]]&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;{{Cite book|author=J.F. Scott |title= Ferroelectric Memories |publisher=Springer |year=2000|isbn=978-3-540-66387-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; for computers and [[RFID]] cards. In these applications thin films of ferroelectric materials are typically used, as this allows the field required to switch the polarization to be achieved with a moderate voltage. However, when using thin films a great deal of attention needs to be paid to the interfaces, electrodes and sample quality for devices to work reliably.&lt;ref name=Dawber&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=M. Dawber |author2=K.M. Rabe |author3=J.F. Scott |title= Physics of thin-film ferroelectric oxides |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=77 |page= 1083 |year=2005|arxiv = cond-mat/0503372 |bibcode = 2005RvMP...77.1083D |doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.77.1083|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferroelectric materials are required by symmetry considerations to be also piezoelectric and pyroelectric. The combined properties of memory, [[piezoelectricity]], and [[pyroelectricity]] make ferroelectric capacitors very useful, e.g. for sensor applications. Ferroelectric capacitors are used in medical ultrasound machines (the capacitors generate and then listen for the ultrasound ping used to image the internal organs of a body), high quality infrared cameras (the infrared image is projected onto a two dimensional array of ferroelectric capacitors capable of detecting temperature differences as small as millionths of a degree Celsius), fire sensors, sonar, vibration sensors, and even fuel injectors on diesel engines.

Another idea of recent interest is the ''ferroelectric tunnel junction'' (''FTJ'') in which a contact is made up by nanometer-thick ferroelectric film placed between metal electrodes.&lt;ref name=ftj&gt;{{Cite journal
|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.246802

|issue=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of the ferroelectric layer is small enough to allow tunneling of electrons. The piezoelectric and interface effects as well as the depolarization field may lead to a giant electroresistance (GER) switching effect.

Yet another hot topic is [[multiferroics]], where researchers are looking for ways to couple magnetic and ferroelectric ordering within a material or heterostructure; there are several recent reviews on this topic.&lt;ref name=ferroics&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=R.|last1=Ramesh|first2=N.A|last2=Spaldin|author2-link=Nicola Spaldin|journal= Nature Materials |volume= 6 |year=2007|bibcode = 2007NatMa...6...21R |doi = 10.1038/nmat1805 |pmid=17199122|issue=1|pages=21–9|title=Multiferroics: Progress and prospects in thin films}}{{Cite journal|author1=W.

==Materials==
The internal electric dipoles of a ferroelectric material are coupled to the material lattice so anything that changes the lattice will change the strength of the dipoles (in other words, a change in the spontaneous polarization).  The change in the spontaneous polarization results in a change in the surface charge.  This can cause current flow in the case of a ferroelectric capacitor even without the presence of an external voltage across the capacitor. Two stimuli that will change the lattice dimensions of a material are force and temperature. The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called [[piezoelectricity]]. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called [[pyroelectricity]].

Generally, there are 230 [[space group]]s among which 32 [[Crystal system#Crystal classes|crystalline classes]] can be found in crystals. There are 21 non-centrosymmetric classes, within which 20 are [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]]. Among the piezoelectric classes, 10 have a spontaneous electric polarization, that varies with the temperature, therefore they are [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]]. Among pyroelectric materials, some of them are ferroelectric.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Ferroelectric phase transitions are often characterized as either displacive (such as BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or order-disorder (such as NaNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), though often phase transitions will demonstrate elements of both behaviors. In [[barium titanate]], a typical ferroelectric of the displacive type, the transition can be understood in terms of a [[polarization catastrophe]], in which, if an ion is displaced from equilibrium slightly, the force from the local [[electric field]]s due to the ions in the crystal increases faster than the elastic-restoring [[force (physics)|force]]s. This leads to an asymmetrical shift in the equilibrium ion positions and hence to a permanent dipole moment. The ionic displacement in barium titanate concerns the relative position of the titanium ion within the oxygen octahedral cage.  In [[lead titanate]], another key ferroelectric material, although the structure is rather similar to barium titanate the driving force for ferroelectricity is more complex with interactions between the lead and oxygen ions also playing an important role. In an order-disorder ferroelectric, there is a dipole moment in each unit cell, but at high temperatures they are pointing in random directions. Upon lowering the temperature and going through the phase transition, the dipoles order, all pointing in the same direction within a domain.

An important ferroelectric material for applications is [[lead zirconate titanate]] (PZT), which is part of the solid solution formed between ferroelectric lead titanate and [[anti-ferroelectric]] lead zirconate. Different compositions are used for different applications; for memory applications, PZT closer in composition to lead titanate is preferred, whereas piezoelectric applications make use of the diverging piezoelectric coefficients associated with the morphotropic phase boundary that is found close to the 50/50 composition.

Ferroelectric [[crystals]] often show several [[transition temperature]]s and [[Hysteresis#Electrical hysteresis|domain structure hysteresis]], much as do [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] crystals. The nature of the [[phase transition]] in some ferroelectric crystals is still not well understood.

In 1974 [[R.B. Meyer]] used symmetry arguments to predict ferroelectric [[liquid crystals]],&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Noel A. Clark |author2=Sven Torbjörn Lagerwall |title=Submicrosecond Bistable Electro-Optic Switching in Liquid Crystals |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume= 36 |page=899 |year=1980|bibcode = 1980ApPhL..36..899C |doi = 10.1063/1.91359|issue=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prediction could immediately be verified by several observations of behavior connected to ferroelectricity in smectic liquid-crystal phases that are chiral and tilted. The technology allows the building of flat-screen monitors. Mass production between 1994 and 1999 was carried out by Canon. Ferroelectric liquid crystals are used in production of reflective [[LCoS]].

In 2010 [[David Field (astrophysicist)|David Field]] found that [[prosaic film]]s of chemicals such as nitrous oxide or propane exhibited ferroelectric properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} This new class of ferroelectric materials exhibit "[[spontelectrics|spontelectric]]" properties, and may have wide-ranging applications in device and nano-technology and also influence the electrical nature of dust in the interstellar medium.

===Two-Dimensional Ferroelectric Materials: Electric Conductors===
It should be possible to produce materials which combine both ferroelectric and metallic properties simultaneously, at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.rutgers.edu/rutgers-physicists-create-new-class-2d-artificial-materials/20180610#.Wx-H9EiFOzc&lt;/ref&gt;. According to research published in 2018 in ''Nature Communications''&lt;ref&gt;'Artificial two dimensional polar metal at room temperature' https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03964-9&lt;/ref&gt;, scientists were able to produce a "two-dimensional" sheet of material which was both "ferroelectric" (had a polar crystal structure) and which conducted electricity.

==Theory==
An introduction to Landau theory can be found here.&lt;ref name="P. Chandra"&gt;{{Cite arxiv|author1=P. Chandra |author2=P.B. Littlewood |title=A Landau Primer for Ferroelectrics|eprint=cond-mat/0609347 |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], the free energy of a ferroelectric material, in the absence of an electric field and applied stress may be written as a [[Taylor series|Taylor expansion]] in terms of the order parameter, ''P''.  If a sixth order expansion is used (i.e. 8th order and higher terms truncated), the free energy is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{array} {ll}
\Delta E= &amp; \frac{1}{2}\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)\left(P_x^2+P_y^2+P_z^2\right)+
\frac{1}{4}\alpha_{11}\left(P_x^4+P_y^4+P_z^4\right)\\
&amp; +\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{12}\left(P_x^2 P_y^2+P_y^2 P_z^2+P_z^2P_x^2\right)\\
&amp; +\frac{1}{6}\alpha_{111}\left(P_x^6+P_y^6+P_z^6\right)\\
&amp; +\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{112}\left[P_x^4\left(P_y^2+P_z^2\right)
+P_y^4\left(P_x^2+P_z^2\right)+P_z^4\left(P_x^2+P_y^2\right)\right]\\
&amp; +\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{123}P_x^2P_y^2P_z^2
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, and P&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; are the components of the polarization vector in the x, y, and z directions respectively, and the coefficients, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i, \alpha_{ij}, \alpha_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; must be consistent with the crystal symmetry.  To investigate domain formation and other phenomena in ferroelectrics, these equations are often used in the context of a [[Phase field models|phase field model]].  Typically, this involves adding a gradient term, an electrostatic term and an elastic term to the free energy.  The equations are then discretized onto a grid using the [[finite difference method]] and solved subject to the constraints of [[Gauss's law]] and [[Linear elasticity]].

In all known ferroelectrics, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{111} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.  These coefficients may be obtained experimentally or from ab-initio simulations.  For ferroelectrics with a first order phase transition, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{11} &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,  whereas &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{11} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for a second order phase transition.

The spontaneous polarization, ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' of a ferroelectric for a cubic to tetragonal phase transition may be obtained by considering the 1D expression of the free energy which is:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E=\frac{1}{2}\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)P_x^2+\frac{1}{4}\alpha_{11}P_x^4+\frac{1}{6}\alpha_{111}P_x^6
&lt;/math&gt;

This free energy has the shape of a double well potential with two free energy minima at &lt;math&gt;P = \pm P_s&lt;/math&gt;, where  ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the spontaneous polarization.  At these two minima, the derivative of the free energy is zero, i.e.:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \Delta E}{\partial P_x}=\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)P_x+\alpha_{11}P_x^3+\alpha_{111}P_x^5=0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
P_x \left[ \alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)+\alpha_{11}P_x^2+\alpha_{111}P_x^4\right]=0
&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = 0'' corresponds to a free energy maxima in the ferroelectric phase, the spontaneous polarization, ''P&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', is obtained from the solution of the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)+\alpha_{11}P_x^2+\alpha_{111}P_x^4=0
&lt;/math&gt;

which is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_s^2=\frac{1}{2\alpha_{111}}\left[-\alpha_{11}\pm\sqrt{\alpha_{11}^2-4\alpha_0\alpha_{111}\left(T-T_0\right)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

and elimination of solutions yielding a negative square root (for either the first or second order phase transitions) gives:

:&lt;math&gt;P_s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\alpha_{111}}\left[-\alpha_{11}+\sqrt{\alpha_{11}^2-4\alpha_0\alpha_{111}\left(T-T_0\right)}\right]}&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{11}=0&lt;/math&gt;, using the same approach as above, the spontaneous polarization may be obtained as:

:&lt;math&gt;P_s=\sqrt{-\frac{\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)}{\alpha_{111}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The hysteresis loop (P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; versus E&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) may be obtained from the free energy expansion by adding another electrostatic term, E&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta E=\frac{1}{2}\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)P_x^2+\frac{1}{4}\alpha_{11}P_x^4+\frac{1}{6}\alpha_{111}P_x^6 - E_x P_x
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial \Delta E}{\partial P_x}=\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)P_x+\alpha_{11}P_x^3+\alpha_{111}P_x^5 - E_x = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
E_x=\alpha_0\left(T-T_0\right)P_x+\alpha_{11}P_x^3+\alpha_{111}P_x^5
&lt;/math&gt;

Plotting E&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and reflecting the graph about the 45 degree line gives an 'S' shaped curve.  The central part of the 'S' corresponds to a free energy [[Second derivative test|local maximum]] (since &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 \Delta E}{\partial P_x^2}&lt;0&lt;/math&gt; ).  Elimination of this region, and connection of the top and bottom portions of the 'S' curve by vertical lines at the discontinuities gives the hysteresis loop.

[[Image:CrystalGrain.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a [[Crystallite|polycrystalline]] metal; grain boundaries evidenced by acid etching.]]

[[Image:Crystallite.jpg|thumb|Differently oriented [[crystallite]]s in a polycrystalline material]]

A '''grain boundary''' is the interface between two grains, or [[crystallite]]s, in a polycrystalline material. Grain boundaries are 2D [[crystallographic defect|defects]] in the [[crystal]] structure, and tend to decrease the [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of the material. Most grain boundaries are preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid. They are also important to many of the mechanisms of [[Creep (deformation)|creep]]. On the other hand, grain boundaries disrupt the motion of [[dislocation]]s through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve mechanical strength, as described by the [[Hall–Petch]] relationship. The study of grain boundaries and their effects on the mechanical, electronic and other properties of materials forms an important topic in [[materials science]].

== High and low angle boundaries ==
{{more sources|section|date=August 2018}}
It is convenient to categorize grain boundaries according to the extent of [[misorientation]] between the two grains. ''Low-angle grain boundaries'' or ''subgrain boundaries'' are those with a misorientation less than about 15 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Physical Foundations of Materials Science; Gottstein, Günter; 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-662-09291-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking they are composed of an array of [[dislocation]]s and their properties and structure are a function of the misorientation. In contrast the properties of ''high-angle grain boundaries'', whose misorientation is greater than about 15 degrees (the transition angle varies from 10–15 degrees depending on the material), are normally found to be independent of the misorientation. However, there are 'special boundaries' at particular orientations whose interfacial energies are markedly lower than those of general high-angle grain boundaries.
[[Image:TiltAndTwistBoundaries remade.svg|thumb|Schematic representations of a tilt boundary (top) and a twist boundary between two idealised grains.]]

The simplest boundary is that of a tilt boundary where the rotation axis is parallel to the boundary plane. This boundary can be conceived as forming from a single, contiguous [[crystallite]] or grain which is gradually bent by some external force. The energy associated with the elastic bending of the lattice can be reduced by inserting a dislocation, which is essentially a half-plane of atoms that act like a wedge, that creates a permanent misorientation between the two sides. As the grain is bent further, more and more dislocations must be introduced to accommodate the deformation resulting in a growing wall of dislocations – a low-angle boundary. The grain can now be considered to have split into two sub-grains of related crystallography but notably different orientations.

An alternative is a twist boundary where the misorientation occurs around an axis that is perpendicular to the boundary plane. This type of boundary incorporates two sets of [[dislocation|screw dislocations]]. If the [[Burgers vector]]s of the dislocations are orthogonal, then the dislocations do not strongly interact and form a square network. In other cases, the dislocations may interact to form a more complex hexagonal structure.

These concepts of tilt and twist boundaries represent somewhat idealized cases. The majority of boundaries are of a mixed type, containing dislocations of different types and Burgers vectors, in order to create the best fit between the neighboring grains.

If the dislocations in the boundary remain isolated and distinct, the boundary can be considered to be low-angle. If deformation continues, the density of dislocations will increase and so reduce the spacing between neighboring dislocations. Eventually, the cores of the dislocations will begin to overlap and the ordered nature of the boundary will begin to break down. At this point the boundary can be considered to be high-angle and the original grain to have separated into two entirely separate grains.

In comparison to low-angle grain boundaries, high-angle boundaries are considerably more disordered, with large areas of poor fit and a comparatively open structure. Indeed, they were originally thought to be some form of amorphous or even liquid layer between the grains. However, this model could not explain the observed strength of grain boundaries and, after the invention of [[electron microscopy]], direct evidence of the grain structure meant the hypothesis had to be discarded. It is now accepted that a boundary consists of structural units which depend on both the misorientation of the two grains and the plane of the interface. The types of structural unit that exist can be related to the concept of the ''coincidence site lattice'', in which repeated units are formed from points where the two misoriented lattices happen to coincide.

In coincident site lattice (CSL) theory, the degree of fit (Σ) between the structures of the two grains is described by the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the ratio of coincidence sites to the total number of sites. In this framework, it is possible to draw the lattice for the 2 grains and count the number of atoms that are shared (coincidence sites), and the total number of atoms on the boundary (total number of site). For example, when Σ=3 there will be one atom of each three that will be shared between the two lattices. Thus a boundary with high Σ might be expected to have a higher energy than one with low Σ. Low-angle boundaries, where the distortion is entirely accommodated by dislocations, are Σ1. Some other low-Σ boundaries have special properties, especially when the boundary plane is one that contains a high density of coincident sites. Examples include coherent [[Crystal twinning|twin]] boundaries (e.g., Σ3) and high-mobility boundaries in FCC materials (e.g., Σ7). Deviations from the ideal CSL orientation may be accommodated by local atomic relaxation or the inclusion of dislocations at the boundary.

== Describing a boundary ==

A boundary can be described by the orientation of the boundary to the two grains and the 3-D rotation required to bring the grains into coincidence. Thus a boundary has 5 macroscopic [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. However, it is common to describe a boundary only as the orientation relationship of the neighbouring grains. Generally, the convenience of ignoring the boundary plane orientation, which is very difficult to determine, outweighs the reduced information.
The relative orientation of the two grains is described using the [[rotation matrix]]:

[[Image:GrainBoundaryOrientationDistribution.png|thumb|The characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations in a completely randomly oriented set of grains for cubic symmetry materials.]]

:&lt;math&gt; R = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} 
                         \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23}
                         \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

Using this system the rotation angle θ is:

: &lt;math&gt; 2\cos\;\theta\;+1 = a_{11} + a_{22} + a_{33} \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

while the direction [uvw] of the rotation axis is:

: &lt;math&gt; [(a_{32}-a_{23}),(a_{13}-a_{31}),(a_{21}-a_{12})] \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

The nature of the [[crystallography]] involved limits the misorientation of the boundary. A completely random polycrystal, with no texture, thus has a characteristic distribution of boundary misorientations (see figure). However, such cases are rare and most materials will deviate from this ideal to a greater or lesser degree.

== Boundary energy ==

[[Image:GrainBoundaryEnergy.png|thumb|The energy of a tilt boundary and the energy per dislocation as the misorientation of the boundary increases]]

The energy of a low-angle boundary is dependent on the degree of misorientation between the neighbouring grains up to the transition to high-angle status. In the case of simple ''tilt boundaries'' the energy of a boundary made up of dislocations with Burgers vector ''b'' and spacing ''h'' is predicted by the '''Read-Shockley equation''':

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma _s = \gamma _0 \theta (A - \ln \theta) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta = b / h \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma_0 = Gb/4\pi(1-\nu) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;A = 1 + \ln(b/2\pi r_0) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear modulus]], &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is [[Poisson's ratio]], and &lt;math&gt;r_0&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the dislocation core. It can be seen that as the energy of the boundary increases the energy per dislocation decreases. Thus there is a driving force to produce fewer, more misoriented boundaries (i.e., [[grain growth]]).

The situation in high-angle boundaries is more complex. Although theory predicts that the energy will be a minimum for ideal CSL configurations, with deviations requiring dislocations and other energetic features, empirical measurements suggest the relationship is more complicated. Some predicted troughs in energy are found as expected while others missing or substantially reduced. 
Surveys of the available experimental data have indicated that simple relationships such as low &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; are misleading:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy can be enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding of the variations of interfacial energy must take account of the atomic structure and the details of the bonding at the interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Excess volume ==

The excess volume is another important property in the characterization of grain boundaries. Excess volume was first proposed by Bishop in a private communication to Aaron and Bolling in 1972 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaron |first1=H. B. |last2=Bolling |first2=G. F. |year=1972 |title=Free volume as a criterion for grain boundary models |journal=Surface Science |volume=31 |issue=C |pages=27–49 |doi=10.1016/0039-6028(72)90252-X|bibcode=1972SurSc..31...27A }}&lt;/ref&gt;. It describes how much expansion is induced by the presence of a GB and is thought that the degree and susceptibility of segregation is directly proportional to this. Despite the name the excess volume is actually a change in length, this is because of the 2D nature of GBs the length of interest is the expansion normal to the GB plane. The excess volume (&lt;math&gt;\delta V&lt;/math&gt;) is defined in the following way,

: &lt;math&gt;\delta V = \left ( \frac{\partial V} {\partial A} \right)_{T,p,n_i}, &lt;/math&gt;

at constant temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and number of atoms &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;. Although a rough linear relationship between GB energy and excess volume exists the orientations where this relationship is violated can behave significantly differently affecting mechanical and electrical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wolf |first = D. | year = 1989 | title = Correlation between energy and volume expansion for grain boundaries in FCC metals | url = | journal = Scripta Metallurgica | volume = 23 | issue = 11| pages = 1913–1918 | doi = 10.1016/0036-9748(89)90482-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental techniques have been developed which directly probe the excess volume and have been used to explore the properties of nanocrystalline copper and nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=E.

A key observation is that there is an inverse relationship with the bulk modulus meaning that the larger the bulk modulus (the ability to compress a material) the smaller the excess volume will be, there is also direct relationship with the lattice constant, this provides methodology to find materials with a desirable excess volume for a specific application.

== Boundary migration ==

The movement of grain boundaries (HAGB) has implications for [[recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] and [[grain growth]] while subgrain boundary (LAGB) movement strongly influences [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and the nucleation of recrystallization.

A boundary moves due to a pressure acting on it. It is generally assumed that the velocity is directly proportional to the pressure with the constant of proportionality being the mobility of the boundary. The mobility is strongly temperature dependent and often follows an [[Arrhenius equation|Arrhenius type relationship]]:

: &lt;math&gt; M = M_0 \exp \left (- \frac{Q}{RT} \right ) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

The apparent activation energy (Q) may be related to the thermally activated atomistic processes that occur during boundary movement. However, there are several proposed mechanisms where the mobility will depend on the driving pressure and the assumed proportionality may break down.

It is generally accepted that the mobility of low-angle boundaries is much lower than that of high-angle boundaries. The following observations appear to hold true over a range of conditions:
* The mobility of low-angle boundaries is proportional to the pressure acting on it.
* The [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] controlling process is that of bulk [[diffusion]]
* The boundary mobility increases with misorientation.

Since low-angle boundaries are composed of arrays of dislocations and their movement may be related to dislocation theory. The most likely mechanism, given the experimental data, is that of dislocation climb, rate limited by the diffusion of solute in the bulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement of high-angle boundaries occurs by the transfer of atoms between the neighbouring grains. The ease with which this can occur will depend on the structure of the boundary, itself dependent on the crystallography of the grains involved, impurity atoms and the temperature. It is possible that some form of diffusionless mechanism (akin to diffusionless phase transformations such as [[martensite]]) may operate in certain conditions. Some defects in the boundary, such as steps and ledges, may also offer alternative mechanisms for atomic transfer.

[[Image:Grain growth inhibition.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Grain growth can be inhibited by second phase particles via [[Zener pinning]].]]

Since a high-angle boundary is imperfectly packed compared to the normal lattice it has some amount of ''free space'' or ''free volume'' where solute atoms may possess a lower energy. As a result, a boundary may be associated with a ''solute atmosphere'' that will retard its movement. Only at higher velocities will the boundary be able to break free of its atmosphere and resume normal motion.

Both low- and high-angle boundaries are retarded by the presence of particles via the so-called [[Zener pinning]] effect. This effect is often exploited in commercial alloys to minimise or prevent recrystallization or [[grain growth]] during [[Annealing (metallurgy)|heat-treatment]].

== Complexion ==
Grain boundaries are the preferential site for segregation of impurities, which may form a thin layer with a different composition from the bulk. For example, a thin layer of silica, which also contains impurity cations, is often present in silicon nitride. These grain boundary phases are thermodynamically stable and can be considered as quasi-two-dimensional phase, which may undergo to transition, similar to those of bulk phases. In this case structure and chemistry abrupt changes are possible at a critical value of a thermodynamic parameter like temperature or pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton AP, Balluffi RW. (1995) Interfaces in crystalline materials. Oxford: Oxford Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; This may strongly affect the macroscopic properties of the material, for example the electrical resistance or creep rates.&lt;ref&gt;Hart EW (1972). The nature and behavior of grain boundaries. New York: Plenum; p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Grain boundaries can be analyzed using equilibrium thermodynamics but cannot be considered as phases, because they do not satisfy Gibbs'definition: they are inhomogeneous, may have a gradient of structure, composition or properties. For this reasons they are defined as complexion: an interfacial material or stata that is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its abutting phases, with a finite and stable thickness (that is typically 2–20 Å). A complexion need the abutting phase to exist and its composition and structure need to be different from the abutting phase. Contrary to bulk phases, complexions also depend on the abutting phase. For example, silica rich amorphous layer present in Si&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is about 10 Å thick, but for special boundaries this equilibrium thickness is zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cantwell |first1=P. R. |display-authors=etal |year=2014 |title=Grain boundary complexions |journal=Acta Materialia |volume=62 |pages=1–48 |doi=10.1016/j.actamat.2013.07.037|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA601364 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complexion can be grouped in 6 categories, according to their thickness: monolayer, bilayer, trilayer, nanolayer (with equilibrium thickness between 1 and 2&amp;nbsp;nm) and wetting. In the first cases the thickness of the layer will be constant; if extra material is present it will segregate at multiple grain junction, while in the last case there is no equilibrium thickness and this is determined by the amount of secondary phase present in the material. One example of grain boundary complexion transition is the passage from dry boundary to biltilayer in Au-doped Si, which is produced by the increase of Au.&lt;ref&gt;Ma S. et al. Scripta Mater (2012) n66, p203.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect to the electronic structure ==

Grain boundaries can cause failure mechanically by embrittlement through solute segregation (see [[Hinkley Point A nuclear power station]]) but they also can detrimentally affect the electronic properties. In metal oxides it has been shown theoretically that at the grain boundaries in Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and MgO the insulating properties can be significantly diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Guhl, H., Lee, H.-S., Tangney, P., Foulkes, W.

Acta Materialia, 99, 16–28. {{doi|10.1016/j.actamat.2015.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using [[density functional theory]] computer simulations of grain boundaries have shown that the band gap can be reduced by up to 45%.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, J.

The '''Great Bakersfield Dust Storm of 1977''' (also known as the '''Southern San Joaquin Valley Dust Storm''') was a severe [[dust storm]] in the Southern [[San Joaquin Valley]], [[California]]. It started in the late evening on December 19, 1977 and ended in the afternoon of December 21. It resulted in 3 deaths and $40 million in damages (does not include subsequent agricultural losses).

==Background==
December 19 started like most cold winter days. At 11:00 pm, temperature was {{convert|44|F|C}} with a light northwestern wind. By 11:30 pm, the weather had started to change. The temperature began to warm up and the wind had shifted direction. It also started to grow in strength and dust started to restrict visibility. In the very early morning, the next day, power was sporadic throughout the city.&lt;ref name=BAKERSFIELD_CALIFORNIAN&gt;Boyd, Sean. [http://people.bakersfield.com/home/ViewPost/40970 1977 Dust Storm: Indelible in my memory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725204636/http://people.bakersfield.com/home/ViewPost/40970 |date=2011-07-25 }}. The Bakersfield Californian. December 12, 2007. Accessed: 05-19-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The wind was stronger, but people went to work and school was still in session. However, by 9:00 am, school was cancelled. Parents were requested to pick up their children because of the concern that high-profile buses could blow over.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, John. ''Bakersfield: A Centennial Portrait''. Cherbo Publishing Group. Encino, California: 1997. {{ISBN|1-882933-19-2}}. Pages 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late morning, the wind was blowing hard, and sounded like a loud roar. Enough dust was in the air that it blocked out the sun. Roads into and out of the southern valley were closed. Only one TV station and two or three AM radio stations continued to have power and were able to broadcast. Also, since Bakersfield did not have a direct feed to national news broadcast, no one outside of the area knew the severity of the situation.&lt;ref name=BAKERSFIELD_CALIFORNIAN /&gt;

Wind continued to blow throughout the afternoon and evening. [[Swamp cooler]]s were blown off the roofs of buildings. Windows were shattering and store signs were blowing in the wind. It was described as if a twister was unrolled and blew up the valley in a sheet. Farther north in the valley, [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] was having a typical December rain. When the dust reached the rain, it turned into mud. It fell in sheets from the sky.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, John. ''Bakersfield: A Centennial Portrait''. Cherbo Publishing Group. Encino, California: 1997. {{ISBN|1-882933-19-2}}. Pages 90-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

People awoke the next morning to a dark sky. The wind had blown throughout the night and was continuing in the morning. Schools remained closed that day. By the afternoon, the wind began to subside, and the air started to clear.&lt;ref name=BAKERSFIELD_CALIFORNIAN /&gt;

==Aftermath==
By the afternoon of December 21, people began to see the damage from the dust storm. The result was devastating. Trees, fences, and swamp coolers had blown down throughout the region. Below grade [[freeway]]s, canals, and creeks were buried. Dirt had piled up on the south side of the buildings. Dust had seeped into cracks and crevices of buildings, filling the interior with a layer of dust.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, John. ''Bakersfield: A Centennial Portrait''. Cherbo Publishing Group. Encino, California: 1997. {{ISBN|1-882933-19-2}}. Pages 90-93.&lt;/ref&gt; After several days, the roads were reopened and news reports started leaving the valley. People also started digging out and cleaning up. By spring, not all of the canals and creeks were cleared. As a result, the rain caused them to flood.&lt;ref name=BAKERSFIELD_CALIFORNIAN /&gt;

The storm resulted in three deaths and $40 million in damage. Over 25 million cubic feet of topsoil from grazing land alone was moved. Wind was measured at {{convert|192|mph}} in [[Arvin, California|Arvin]] (southeast of Bakersfield).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/pqr/paststorms/california10.php#December%201977%20Southern%20San%20Joaquin%20Valley%20Wind/Dust%20Storm California's Top 15 Weather Events of 1900s]. National Weather Service. Accessed: 05-19-2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the foothills, the wind was measured at {{convert|189|mph}}. In the mountain passes, it was {{convert|199|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard, John. ''Bakersfield: A Centennial Portrait''. Cherbo Publishing Group. Encino, California: 1997. {{ISBN|1-882933-19-2}}. Page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
The great dust storm was caused by many different events. There had been a drought in the region for several years, which caused the ground to be dry. Cotton had recently been plowed under (end of the season) but the winter crop had not taken root yet. This caused the soil to be loose.&lt;ref name=BAKERSFIELD_CALIFORNIAN /&gt;

The high winds were also caused by a series of events. Over the [[Great Basin]], which is located in [[Nevada]] and [[Idaho]], was very cold and heavy air (high pressure). A very strong low pressure system was approaching the northwest coast of [[California]]. A mercury reading of 0.10&amp;nbsp;inches of pressure gradient force (difference of pressure between two points) is typically needed for a 10 to 12 miles per hour (16 to 19&amp;nbsp;km/h) northwestern wind. That day, the reading was 0.60&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name=BAKERSFIELD_CALIFORNIAN /&gt;

'''Greigite''' is an [[iron]] [[sulfide]] mineral with formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Iron(II,III) sulfide]]). It is the sulfur equivalent of the iron oxide [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). It was first described in 1964 for an occurrence in [[San Bernardino County, California]], and named after the mineralogist and physical chemist [[Joseph W. Greig]] (1895–1977).&lt;ref name=Webmin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url =  http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/AM49/AM49_543.pdf | title = Greigite, the thio-spinel of iron; a new mineral | journal = American Mineralogist |first1 = Brian J. | last1 = Skinner | first2 = Richard C. | last2= Erd | first3 = Frank S. | last3 = Grimaldi | pages = 543–55 | volume = 49 | year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence and composition==
It occurs in [[Lake|lacustrine]] sediments with [[Clay mineral|clays]], [[silt]]s and [[Arkose|arkosic sand]] often in [[varve]]d [[sulfide]] rich clays. It is also found in [[hydrothermal]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]].  Greigite is formed by [[magnetotactic bacteria]] and sulfate-reducing bacteria.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt; Greigite has also been identified in the sclerites of [[scaly-foot gastropod]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/11/1107_031107_snailarmor.html|title=Armor-Plated Snail Discovered in Deep Sea|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The mineral typically appears as microscopic (&lt; 0.03&amp;nbsp;mm) isometric hexoctahedral crystals and as minute sooty masses. Association minerals include [[montmorillonite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[calcite]], [[colemanite]], [[veatchite]], [[sphalerite]], [[pyrite]], [[marcasite]], [[galena]] and [[dolomite]].&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt;

Common impurities include Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, Cr, Sb and As.&lt;ref name=Mindat/&gt; Ni impurities are of particular interest because the structural similarity between Ni-doped greigite and the (Fe, Ni)S clusters present in biological enzymes has led to suggestions that greigite minerals could have acted as catalysts for the [[origin of life]].&lt;ref name="RussellMartin2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Michael J.|last2=Martin|first2=William|title=The rocky roots of the acetyl-CoA pathway|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=29|issue=7|year=2004|pages=358–363|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/j.tibs.2004.05.007|pmid=15236743}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the cubic Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; unit of greigite is found in the Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; thiocubane units of proteins of relevance to the [[acetyl-CoA]] pathway.

==Crystal structure==
Greigite has the [[spinel]] structure. The crystallographic unit cell is cubic, with [[space group]] Fd3m. The S anions form a cubic close-packed lattice, and the Fe cations occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites.&lt;ref name=Handbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;Vaughan, D. J.; Craig, J. R. “Mineral Chemistry of Metal Sulfides" Cambridge University Press, Cambridge: 1978. {{ISBN|0-521-21489-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic and electronic properties==
Like the related oxide [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), greigite is [[ferrimagnetic]], with the spin magnetic moments of the Fe cations in the tetrahedral sites oriented in the opposite direction as those in the octahedral sites, and a net magnetization.  It is a [[mixed-valence compound]], featuring both Fe(II) and Fe(III) centers in a 1:2 ratio. Both metal sites have high [[spin quantum number]]s. The electronic structure of greigite is that of a [[half metal]].&lt;ref name=devey09&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Devey|first1=A.J.|last2=Grau-Crespo|first2=R.|last3=Leeuw|first3=N.H.|title=Electronic and magnetic structure of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;: GGA+U investigation|journal=Physical Review B|year=2009|volume=79|pages=195126| doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.79.195126|issue=19|bibcode = 2009PhRvB..79s5126D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=The Curie temperature and magnetic exchange energy in half-metallic greigite Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/83/04/045702|year=2011|volume=83|pages=045702| last1=Wang| first1=Jun| last2=Cao| first2=Shi-He| last3=Wu| first3=Wei| last4=Zhao| first4=Guo-Meng| journal=Physica Scripta| issue=4|bibcode = 2011PhyS...83d5702W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2540">'''Hankinson's equation''' (also called '''Hankinson's formula''' or '''Hankinson's criterion''')&lt;ref&gt;Hankinson, R. L., 1921, ''Investigation of crushing strength of spruce at varying angles of grain'', '''Air Force Information Circular No. 259''', U. S. Air Service.&lt;/ref&gt; is a mathematical relationship for predicting the off-axis uniaxial compressive strength of wood.  The formula can also be used to compute the fiber [[stress (physics)|stress]] or the [[Stress (physics)|stress]] wave velocity at the elastic limit as a function of [[Wood grain|grain]] angle in [[wood]].   For a wood that has uniaxial compressive strengths of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; parallel to the grain and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{90}&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular to the grain, Hankinson's equation predicts that the uniaxial compressive strength of the wood in a direction at an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to the grain is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_\alpha = \cfrac{\sigma_0~\sigma_{90}}{\sigma_0~\sin^2\alpha + \sigma_{90}~\cos^2\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;

Even though the original relation was based on studies of [[spruce]], Hankinson's equation has been found to be remarkably accurate for many other types of wood.  A generalized form of the Hankinson formula has also been used for predicting the uniaxial tensile strength of wood at an angle to the grain.  This formula has the form&lt;ref&gt;Clouston, P., 1995, '''[http://hdl.handle.net/2429/4154 The Tsai-Wu strength theory for Douglas fir laminated veneer]''', M. S. Thesis, The University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \sigma_\alpha = \cfrac{\sigma_0~\sigma_{90}}{\sigma_0~\sin^n\alpha + \sigma_{90}~\cos^n\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the exponent &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; can take values between 1.5 and 2.

The stress wave velocity at angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; to the grain at the elastic limit can similarly be obtained from the Hankinson formula
:&lt;math&gt; 
  V(\alpha) = \frac{V_0 V_{90}}{V_0 \sin^2\alpha + V_{90} \cos^2\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V_0&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity parallel to the grain, &lt;math&gt;V_{90}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity perpendicular to the grain and &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the grain angle.

{{Sustainable energy}}

A '''hybrid vehicle''' uses two or more distinct types of power, such as internal combustion engine to drive an [[electric generator]] that powers an [[electric motor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://what-is-what.com/what_is/hybrid_vehicle.html |title=What is a Hybrid Vehicle? |publisher=What-is-what.com |accessdate=2013-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. in [[diesel-electric train]]s using diesel engines to drive an electric generator that powers an electric motor, and submarines that use diesels when surfaced and batteries when submerged. Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in [[hydraulic hybrid]]s.

The basic principle with hybrid vehicles is that the different motors work better at different speeds; the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque, or turning power, and the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed (better than typical electric motor). Switching from one to the other at the proper time while speeding up yields a [[win-win]] in terms of [[Energy efficiency in transportation|energy efficiency]], as such that translates into greater [[fuel efficiency]], for example.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Vehicle type==
[[File:Montreal hybrid bus.PNG|thumb|right|A [[biodiesel]] hybrid bus in Montreal, Canada]]

===Two-wheeled and cycle-type vehicles===
[[Moped]]s, [[Motorized bicycles|electric bicycles]], and even [[electric kick scooter]]s are a simple form of a hybrid, powered by an [[internal combustion|internal combustion engine]] or [[electric motor]] and the rider's muscles. Early prototype motorcycles in the late 19th century used the same principle.

* In a '''parallel hybrid bicycle''' human and motor torques are mechanically coupled at the pedal or one of the wheels, e.g. using a hub motor, a roller pressing onto a tire, or a connection to a wheel using a transmission element. Most [[motorized bicycles]], [[moped]]s are of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Das Power bike |language=German |isbn=3-89595-123-4 | url= http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/SET=1/TTL=1/SHW?FRST=1&amp;PRS=HOL&amp;HILN=888#888 | accessdate=2007-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a '''series hybrid bicycle''' ('''SHB''') (a kind of [[chainless bicycle]]) the user pedals a generator, charging a battery or feeding the motor, which delivers all of the torque required. They are commercially available, being simple in theory and manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Velomobile Seminar |year=1999 |isbn=3-9520694-1-8 | url=http://www.futurebike.ch/page.asp?DH=2305 | accessdate=2006-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published prototype of an SHB is by Augustus Kinzel (US Patent 3'884'317) in 1975. In 1994 Bernie Macdonalds conceived the Electrilite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcn.org/a/Omni/ELiteBro95.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110024215/http://www.mcn.org/a/Omni/ELiteBro95.htm |title=Greetings Ecological Transportation Futurist |publisher=MCN.org |archivedate=2005-11-10 |accessdate=2013-04-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SHB with power electronics allowing [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] and pedaling while stationary. In 1995 Thomas Muller designed and built a "Fahrrad mit elektromagnetischem Antrieb" for his 1995 diploma thesis. In 1996 Jürg Blatter and Andreas Fuchs of Berne University of Applied Sciences built an SHB and in 1998 modified a [[Leitra]] tricycle (European patent EP 1165188). Until 2005 they built several prototype SH [[tricycle]]s and [[quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadricycle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.bluewin.ch/andreasfuchs/ |publisher=bluewin.ch |title=Welcome to the electronic cycle site |date=2015-05-06 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016213458/http://homepage.bluewin.ch/andreasfuchs/ |archive-date=2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 Harald Kutzke described an "active bicycle": the aim is to approach the ideal bicycle weighing nothing and having no drag by electronic compensation.

* A '''series hybrid electric-petroleum bicycle''' ('''SHEPB''') is powered by pedals,        batteries, a petrol generator, or plug-in charger - providing flexibility and range enhancements over electric-only bicycles.

A SHEPB prototype made by David Kitson in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150821-australian-man-builds-the-first-ever-hybrid-petrol-electric-bicycle-using-up-mini-3d-printer.html |title=Australian man builds the first ever hybrid petrol/electric bicycle using UP Mini 3D printer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822130227/http://www.3ders.org/articles/20150821-australian-man-builds-the-first-ever-hybrid-petrol-electric-bicycle-using-up-mini-3d-printer.html |archivedate=2015-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014 used a lightweight [[brushless DC electric motor]] from an aerial drone and small hand-tool sized [[internal combustion engine]], and a [[3D printing|3D printed]] drive system and lightweight housing, altogether weighing less than 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg. Active cooling keeps plastic parts from softening. The prototype uses a regular electric bicycle charge port.

===Heavy vehicle===
[[File:Mettis BRT Metz.jpg|thumb|[[Bus Rapid Transit]] of [[Metz]], a diesel-electric hybrid driving system by [[Van Hool]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/highlights/vanhoolpresentst.html |title=Van Hool presents the ExquiCity Design Mettis |accessdate=2012-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605074801/http://www.vanhool.be/ENG/highlights/vanhoolpresentst.html |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Hybrid [[power train]]s use [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] or [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] to power railway locomotives, buses, heavy goods vehicles, mobile [[hydraulic machinery]], and ships. A [[diesel engine|diesel]]/[[turbine engine]] drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump, which powers electric/hydraulic motor(s) - strictly an electric/hydraulic transmission (not a hybrid), unless it can accept power from outside. With large vehicles conversion losses decrease, and the advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements become more prominent, especially when powering multiple drives — e.g. driven wheels or propellers. Until recently most heavy vehicles had little secondary energy storage, e.g. batteries/[[hydraulic accumulator]]s — excepting non-nuclear [[submarines]], one of the oldest production hybrids, running on diesels while surfaced and batteries when submerged. Both series and parallel setups were used in WW2 submarines.

====Rail transport====
{{Main|Hybrid train}}
[[File:HB-E300kei-2.JPG|thumb|[[East Japan Railway Company]] [[HB-E300 series]]]]
'''Europe'''&lt;br&gt;
The new [[Autorail à grande capacité]] (AGC or high-capacity railcar) built by the Canadian company [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] for service in France is diesel/electric motors, using 1500 or 25000 V on different rail systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/sci-tech/article/24048 |title=The World's First Hybrid Train Officially Enters Commercial Service |date=2007-10-24|publisher=ENN.com |accessdate=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was tested in Rotterdam, the Netherlands with [[Railfeeding]], a Genesse and Wyoming company.

'''China'''&lt;br&gt;
The First Hybrid Evaluating locomotive was designed by rail research center [[MATRAI]] in 1999 and built in 2000. It was a G12 locomotive upgraded with batteries, a 200&amp;nbsp;kW diesel generator and 4 AC motors.

'''Japan'''&lt;br&gt;
Japan's first hybrid train with significant energy storage is the [[KiHa E200]], with roof-mounted [[lithium ion batteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Japan-to-launch-first-hybrid-trains/2007/07/29/1185647720628.html |title=Japan to launch first hybrid trains |date=2007-07-29 |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |agency=AP digital |accessdate=2013-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''India'''&lt;br&gt;
Indian railway launched one of its kind [[CNG]]-Diesel hybrid trains in January 2015. The train has a 1400&amp;nbsp;hp engine which uses fumigation technology.The first of these train is set to run on the 81&amp;nbsp;km long Rewari-Rohtak route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Railways-starts-first-train-that-chugs-on-CNG/articleshow/45892086.cms |title= CNG-Diesel train launch in India|date=2015-01-15 |newspaper=[[Times of India]] |accessdate=2015-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CNG is less-polluting alternative for diesel and petrol and is popular as an alternative fuel in India. Already many transport vehicles such as auto-rickshaws and buses run on CNG fuel.

'''North America'''&lt;br&gt;
In the US, [[General Electric]] made a locomotive with [[Sodium-Nickel-Chloride battery|sodium - nickel chloride]] (Na-NiCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) battery storage. They expect ≥10% fuel economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecotality.com/life/2007/10/25/around-the-world-on-brakes-chug-a-chug-a-chugga/ |last=Shabna |first=John |title=GE's Hybrid Locomotive: Around The World on Brakes |publisher=Ecotality Life |date=2007-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228202600/http://ecotality.com/life/2007/10/25/around-the-world-on-brakes-chug-a-chug-a-chugga/ |archive-date=2009-02-28}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variant [[diesel electric locomotive]] include the [[Green Goat]] (GG) and [[Green Kid]] (GK) [[Switcher|switching/yard engines]] built by Canada's [[Railpower Technologies]], with [[Lead–acid battery|lead acid]] (Pba) batteries and 1000 to 2000&amp;nbsp;hp electric motors, and a new clean burning ~160&amp;nbsp;hp diesel generator. No fuel is wasted for idling — ~60–85% of the time for these type locomotives. It is unclear if regenerative braking is used; but in principle it is easily utilized.

Since these engines typically need extra weight for traction purposes anyway the battery pack's weight is a negligible penalty.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The diesel generator and batteries are normally built on an existing "retired" "yard" locomotive's frame. The existing motors and running gear are all rebuilt and reused. Fuel savings of 40–60% and up to 80% pollution reductions are claimed over a "typical" older switching/yard engine. The advantages hybrid cars have for frequent starts and stops and idle periods apply to typical switching yard use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railpower.com/dl/GGSeries.pdf |title=GG Series: Hybrid Yard Switcher |author=RailPower Technologies |date=2006-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320113617/http://www.railpower.com/dl/GGSeries.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Green Goat" locomotives have been purchased by [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Kansas City Southern Railway]], and [[Union Pacific Railroad]] among others.

====[[Container crane|Crane]]s====
Railpower Technologies engineers working with TSI Terminal Systems are testing a hybrid diesel electric power unit with battery storage for use in [[Rubber Tyred Gantry]] (RTG) cranes. RTG cranes are typically used for loading and unloading shipping containers onto trains or trucks in ports and container storage yards. The energy used to lift the containers can be partially regained when they are lowered. Diesel fuel and emission reductions of 50–70% are predicted by Railpower engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=2006-10-10 |title=RailPower To Supply TSI Terminal Systems Inc. with hybrid power plants for rubber tyred gantry cranes |url=http://www.railpower.com/dl/news/news_2006_10_10_e.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228210255/http://www.railpower.com/dl/news/news_2006_10_10_e.pdf |archivedate=2008-02-28 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First systems are expected to be operational in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://tmx.quotemedia.com/article.php?newsid=4405535&amp;qm_symbol=P | title = Railpower to supply TSI Terminal Systems Inc. with hybrid power plants for rubber tyred gantry cranes | date=2006-10-10 | publisher = RailPower Technologies Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978 students at Minneapolis, Minnesota's Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a [[VW Beetle|Volkswagen Beetle]] to a petro-hydraulic hybrid with off-the shelf components. A car rated at 32&amp;nbsp;mpg was returning 75&amp;nbsp;mpg with the 60&amp;nbsp;hp engine replaced by a 16&amp;nbsp;hp engine, and reached 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref name="Mother Earth News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1978-03-01/This-Car-Travels-75-Miles-on-a-Single-Gallon-of-Gasoline.aspx |title=Try a Hydraulic Drive Train: This Car of the Future Gets 75 MPG |publisher=Mother Earth News |date=March–April 1978 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025114832/http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1978-03-01/This-Car-Travels-75-Miles-on-a-Single-Gallon-of-Gasoline.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1990s, engineers at EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory developed a petro-hydraulic powertrain for a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9 liter diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the cost.&lt;ref name="demo-veh"/&gt; Under EPA testing, a hydraulic hybrid [[Ford Expedition]] returned 32 mpg (7.4&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) City, and 22 mpg (11&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km) highway.&lt;ref name="demo-veh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epa.gov/otaq/technology/research/demonstration-vehicles.htm#suv|title=Demonstration Vehicles |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Capturing the power of hydraulics"&gt;[http://www.autobloggreen.com/2006/06/15/capturing-the-power-of-hydraulics Capturing the power of hydraulics].

====Military off-road vehicles====
Since 1985, the US military has been testing [[serial hybrid]] [[Humvee]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2006-02-13-humvee_x.htm | first = Steven | last = Komarow | date=2006-02-13 | publisher = USA Today | title = Military hybrid vehicles could boost safety, mobility}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/hmmwv-he.htm |accessdate=2008-11-17 | publisher = GlobalSecurity.Org | title = Hybrid Electric HMMWV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have found them to deliver faster acceleration, a [[Stealth technology|stealth]] mode with low [[Infrared homing|thermal signature]]/ near silent operation, and greater fuel economy.

====Ships====
Ships with both mast-mounted [[sail]]s and [[steam engine]]s were an early form of hybrid vehicle. Another example is the [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[submarine]]. This runs on batteries when submerged and the batteries can be re-charged by the [[diesel engine]] when the craft is on the surface.

Newer hybrid ship-propulsion schemes include large [[power kite|towing kites]] manufactured by companies such as [[SkySails]]. Towing kites can fly at heights several times higher than the tallest ship masts, capturing stronger and steadier winds.

====Aircraft====

The Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator Airplane has a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell/lithium-ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor, which is coupled to a conventional propeller. The fuel cell provides all power for the cruise phase of flight. During takeoff and climb, the flight segment that requires the most power, the system draws on lightweight lithium-ion batteries.

The demonstrator aircraft is a Dimona motor glider, built by Diamond Aircraft Industries of Austria, which also carried out structural modifications to the aircraft. With a wing span of {{convert|16.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the airplane will be able to cruise at about {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} on power from the fuel cell.&lt;ref&gt;"Manned airplane powered by fuel cell makes flight tests.

{{Main|Hybrid electric vehicle}}

When the term ''hybrid vehicle'' is used, it most often refers to a [[Hybrid electric vehicle]]. These encompass such vehicles as the [[Saturn Vue]], [[Toyota Prius]], [[Toyota Yaris]], [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]], [[Ford Escape Hybrid]], [[Toyota Kluger#Hybrid|Toyota Highlander Hybrid]], [[Honda Insight]], [[Honda Civic Hybrid]], [[Lexus RX 400h]] and [[Lexus RX 450h|450h]], [[Hyundai Ioniq]] and others. A petroleum-electric hybrid most commonly uses [[internal combustion]] engines (using a variety of fuels, generally gasoline or [[Diesel engine]]s) and [[electric motors]] to power the vehicle. The energy is stored in the fuel of the internal combustion engine and an [[electric battery|electric battery set]]. There are many [[Hybrid Vehicle Drivetrains|types of petroleum-electric hybrid drivetrains]], from '''Full hybrid''' to [[Mild hybrid]], which offer varying advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://automobiles.honda.com/tools/calculators/mileage_calculator.asp?ModelNa,e=Civic%20Hybrid# Fuel Saving Calculator] {{dead link|date=March 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Patton filed a patent application for a gasoline-electric hybrid rail-car propulsion system in early 1889, and for a similar hybrid boat propulsion system in mid 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |url=https://www.google.com/patents/US409116 |inventor=Patton, W.

In 1899, [[Pieper|Henri Pieper]] developed the world's first petro-electric [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain|hybrid]] automobile. In 1900, [[Ferdinand Porsche]] developed a [[Series hybrid|series-hybrid]] using two [[wheel hub motor|motor-in-wheel-hub arrangements]] with an internal combustion generator set providing the electric power; Porsche's hybrid set two speed records.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
While liquid fuel/electric hybrids date back to the late 19th century, the braking regenerative hybrid was invented by David Arthurs, an electrical engineer from Springdale, Arkansas in 1978–79. His home-converted Opel GT was reported to return as much as 75 mpg with plans still sold to this original design, and the "Mother Earth News" modified version on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Transportation/1979-07-01/An-Amazing-75-MPG-Hybrid-Electic-Car.aspx An amazin 75 – MPG hybrid electric car].

The plug-in-electric-vehicle (PEV) is becoming more and more common. It has the range needed in locations where there are wide gaps with no services. The batteries can be plugged into house (mains) electricity for charging, as well being charged while the engine is running.

===Continuously outboard recharged electric vehicle (COREV)===
Some [[battery electric vehicle|battery electric vehicles (BEVs)]] can be recharged while the user drives. Such a vehicle establishes contact with an electrified rail, plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanism  (see [[Conduit current collection]]). The BEV's batteries are recharged by this process—on the highway—and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged. For example, some of the battery-electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the London Underground are capable of this mode of operation.

Developing a BEV infrastructure would provide the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range. Since many destinations are within 100&amp;nbsp;km of a major highway, BEV technology could reduce the need for expensive battery systems. Unfortunately, private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited. Besides, the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and, outside some cities, not widely distributed (see [[Conduit current collection]], [[trams]], [[electric (rail)|electric rail]], [[Tram|trolleys]], [[third rail]]). Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs could perhaps be funded by toll revenue or by dedicated transportation taxes.

===Hybrid fuel (dual mode)===
[[File:Ford Escape E85 Flex Plug-in Hybrid views and badging WAS 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid]] with a [[flexible fuel]] capability to run on [[E85]] ([[ethanol]]) ]]
In addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for [[Ground propulsion|propulsion]], some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types ("[[fuel]]s") using the same engine to be hybrids, although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms, these are perhaps more correctly described as [[dual mode]] vehicles:
* Some [[electric trolleybus]]es can switch between an on-board [[diesel engine]] and overhead electrical power depending on conditions (see [[dual mode bus]]). In principle, this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug-in hybrid trolleybus, although {{As of|2006|lc=on}}, no such design seems to have been announced.
* [[Flexible-fuel vehicle]]s can use a mixture of input fuels mixed in one tank — typically [[gasoline]] and [[ethanol]], [[methanol]], or [[biobutanol]].
* [[Bi-fuel vehicle]]: [[Liquified petroleum gas]] and [[natural gas]] are very different from petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks, so it would be impossible to build an (LPG or NG) flexible fuel system. Instead vehicles are built with two, parallel, fuel systems feeding one engine. For example, some Chevrolet [http://www.chevrolet.com/culture/article/bi-fuel-silverado-natural-gas.html Silverado 2500 HDs] can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas, offering a range of over 1000&amp;nbsp;km (650&amp;nbsp;miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bi-Fuel Silverado 2500HD Can Switch Between Gasoline And Natural Gas|url=http://www.chevrolet.com/culture/article/bi-fuel-silverado-natural-gas.html|accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications, the increased range, decreased cost of fuel, and flexibility where [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] or [[CNG]] infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase. While the US Natural gas infrastructure is partially incomplete, it is increasing at a fast pace, and already has 2600 [[CNG]] stations in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/stations_counts.html|accessdate=2013-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With a growing fueling station infrastructure, a large scale adoption of these bi-fuel vehicles could be seen in the near future. Rising gas prices may also push consumers to purchase these vehicles. When gas prices trade around $4.00, the price per [[MMBTU]] of gasoline is $28.00, compared to natural gas's $4.00 per MMBTU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halber |first=Deborah |title=What is the energy of gasoline compared to the same cost of other fuels in BTUs per dollar? |url=http://engineering.mit.edu/live/news/39-what-is-the-energy-of-gasoline-compared-to-the |accessdate=2013-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406211227/http://engineering.mit.edu/live/news/39-what-is-the-energy-of-gasoline-compared-to-the |archivedate=2013-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On a per unit of energy comparative basis, this makes natural gas much cheaper than gasoline. All of these factors are making CNG-Gasoline bi-fuel vehicles very attractive.
* Some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is available, such as cars modified to run on [[Autogas|autogas (LPG)]] and diesels modified to run on [[waste vegetable oil]] that has not been processed into biodiesel.
* Power-assist mechanisms for [[bicycle]]s and other [[Human-powered transport|human-powered vehicles]] are also included (see [[Motorized bicycle]]).

[[Hydraulic hybrid]] and [[pneumatic hybrid vehicle]]s use an engine to charge a pressure accumulator to drive the wheels via [[hydraulic]] (liquid) or [[pneumatic]] (compressed air) drive units. In most cases the engine is detached from the drivetrain, serving solely to charge the energy accumulator. The transmission is seamless. Regenerative braking can be used to recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator.

====Petro-air hybrid====
A French company, [[Motor Development International|MDI]], has designed and has running models of a petro-air hybrid engine car. The system does not use air motors to drive the vehicle, being directly driven by a hybrid engine. The engine uses a mixture of compressed air and gasoline injected into the cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aircars.tk/ |title=Learn everything about the compressed air cars! |publisher=Aircars.tk |accessdate=2013-04-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520152900/http://aircars.tk/ |archive-date=2013-05-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A key aspect of the hybrid engine is the "active chamber", which is a compartment heating air via fuel doubling the energy output.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefuture.net.nz/mdi_tech.htm |title=MDI's active chamber |publisher=Thefuture.net.nz |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507151344/http://www.thefuture.net.nz/mdi_tech.htm |archivedate=2011-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tata Motors]] of India assessed the design phase towards full production for the Indian market and moved into "completing detailed development of the compressed air engine into specific vehicle and stationary applications".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.tatamotors.com/media/press-releases.php?id=750 |title=MDI's air engine technology tested on Tata Motors vehicles |publisher=Tata Motors |date=2012-05-07 |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509064540/http://www.tatamotors.com/media/press-releases.php?id=750 |archivedate=2013-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/tata-motors-air-car-mdi/22447/ |title=Tata Motors enters second phase of air-car development |publisher=Gizmag.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petro-hydraulic configurations have been common in trains and heavy vehicles for decades. The auto industry recently focused on this hybrid configuration as it now shows promise for introduction into smaller vehicles.

In petro-hydraulic hybrids, the [[energy recovery]] rate is high and therefore the system is more efficient than electric battery charged hybrids using the current electric battery technology, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in [[energy economy]] in US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) testing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/otaq/technology/420f05006.htm EPA Announces Partnership to Demonstrate World's First Full Hydraulic Hybrid Urban Delivery Vehicle | Modeling, Testing, and Research | US EPA]. Epa.gov. Retrieved on 2012-04-18. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809043402/http://www.epa.gov/otaq/technology/420f05006.htm |date=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The charging engine needs only to be sized for average usage with acceleration bursts using the stored energy in the hydraulic accumulator, which is charged when in low energy demanding vehicle operation. The charging engine runs at optimum speed and load for efficiency and longevity. Under tests undertaken by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a hydraulic hybrid [[Ford Expedition]] returned {{convert|32|mpgus}} City, and {{convert|22|mpgus}} highway.&lt;ref name="demo-veh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Capturing the power of hydraulics"/&gt; [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] currently has two trucks in service using this technology.&lt;ref name="autoblog.com"/&gt;

Although petro-hydraulic hybrid technology has been known for decades, and used in trains and very large construction vehicles, high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars. In the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro-hydraulic hybrid road vehicles in 1978. A group of students at Minneapolis, Minnesota's Hennepin Vocational Technical Center, converted a [[VW Beetle|Volkswagen Beetle]] car to run as a petro-hydraulic hybrid using off-the shelf components. A car rated at {{convert|32|mpgus|abbr=on}} was returning {{convert|75|mpgus|abbr=on}} with the 60&amp;nbsp;hp engine replaced by a 16&amp;nbsp;hp engine. The experimental car reached {{convert|70|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Mother Earth News"/&gt;

In the 1990s, a team of engineers working at EPA’s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory succeeded in developing a revolutionary type of petro-hydraulic hybrid powertrain that would propel a typical American sedan car. The test car achieved over 80 mpg on combined EPA city/highway driving cycles. Acceleration was 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in 8 seconds, using a 1.9 liter diesel engine. No lightweight materials were used. The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only $700 to the base cost of the vehicle.&lt;ref name="demo-veh"/&gt;

The petro-hydraulic hybrid system has faster and more efficient charge/discharge cycling than petro-electric hybrids and is also cheaper to build. The accumulator vessel size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set. Any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of accumulator vessel may be offset by the need for a smaller sized charging engine, in HP and physical size.

Research is underway in large corporations and small companies. Focus has now switched to smaller vehicles. The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. A drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load. A British company (Artemis Intelligent Power) made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump, the Digital Displacement® motor/pump. The pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads, giving feasibility to small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artemisip.com/our-technology |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017071459/http://www.artemisip.com/our-technology |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company converted a BMW car as a test bed to prove viability. The BMW 530i, gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car. This test was using the standard 3,000&amp;nbsp;cc engine, with a smaller engine the figures would have been more impressive. The design of petro-hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator. A smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road|title=On-road|publisher=|accessdate=2015-05-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525063540/http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road|archive-date=2015-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing engine/transmission setups. It is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro-hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups. One research project's goal is to create a blank paper design new car, to maximize the packaging of petro-hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle. All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car. One design has claimed to return 130 mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car. The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw-back kinetic braking energy. The hub motors eliminates the need for friction brakes, mechanical transmissions, drive shafts and U joints, reducing costs and weight. Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes are used in industrial vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=mmh.com |url=http://www.mmh.com/article/lift_trucks_15_ways_the_lift_truck_is_evolving/D2/ |title=Lift Trucks: 15 ways the lift truck is evolving - Article from Modern Materials Handling |publisher=Modern Materials Handling |date=2011-08-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions. Energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator. A small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator. The accumulator is sized at running the car for 15 minutes when fully charged. The aim is a fully charged accumulator which will produce a 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph acceleration speed of under 5 seconds using four wheel drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/hybrid-hydraulic-drive-vehicle-promises-170-mpg/ |first=Philip |last=Proefrock |title=Hybrid Hydraulic Drive Vehicle Promises 170 MPG |publisher=Inhabitat |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torquenews.com/1080/ingocar-valentin-tech-shatters-way-we-think-about-cars |first=Aaron |last=Turpen |title=INGOCAR from Valentin Tech shatters the way we think about cars |publisher=Torquenews.com |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valentintechnologies.com/default.asp |title=Welcome |publisher=Valentintechnologies.com |accessdate=2013-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421115904/http://www.valentintechnologies.com/default.asp |archivedate=2013-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel hybrid===

[[File:2016 Toyota Prius (ZVW30R) Hybrid liftback (2016-04-02) 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Toyota Prius]], [[series-parallel hybrid]]]]
[[File:2nd Ford Escape Hybrid -- 04-29-2011 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ford Escape Hybrid]], a series-parallel drivetrain]]
In a parallel hybrid vehicle an electric motor and an internal combustion engine are coupled such that they can power the vehicle either individually or together. Most commonly the internal combustion engine, the electric motor and gear box are coupled by automatically controlled clutches. For electric driving the clutch between the internal combustion engine is open while the clutch to the gear box is engaged. While in combustion mode the engine and motor run at the same speed.

The first mass production parallel hybrid sold outside Japan was the 1st generation [[Honda Insight]].

===Mild parallel hybrid===
These types use a generally compact electric motor (usually &lt;20&amp;nbsp;kW) to provide auto-stop/start features and to provide extra power assist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://world.honda.com/automobile-technology/IMA/detail/ |title=Honda IMA technology |accessdate=2009-05-01 |publisher=Honda Motor}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the acceleration, and to generate on the deceleration phase (aka [[regenerative braking]]).

On-road examples include [[Honda Civic Hybrid]], [[Honda Insight]] 2nd generation, [[Honda CR-Z]], [[Honda Accord Hybrid]], Mercedes Benz [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class#S-Class hybrids|S400 BlueHYBRID]], BMW 7 Series hybrids, [[General Motors]] [[BAS Hybrid]]s, [[Suzuki S-Cross]], [[Suzuki Wagon R]] and [[Smart fortwo]] with micro hybrid drive.

===Power-split or series-parallel hybrid===
In a power-split hybrid electric drive train there are two motors: a traction electric motor and an internal combustion engine. The power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power split device, which is a simple [[epicyclic gearing|planetary gear]] set. The ratio can be from 100% for the combustion engine to 100% for the traction electric motor, or anything in between, such as 40% for the electric motor and 60% for the combustion engine. The combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries.

Modern versions such as the Toyota [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]] have a second electric motor/generator connected to the planetary gear. In cooperation with the traction motor/generator and the power-split device this provides a continuously variable transmission.

On the open road, the primary power source is the internal combustion engine. When maximum power is required, for example to overtake, the traction electric motor is used to assist. This increases the available power for a short period, giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed. In most applications, the combustion engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary thereby reducing curbside emissions.

Passenger car installations include [[Toyota Prius]], Ford Escape and Fusion, as well as [[Lexus RX]]400h, RX450h, GS450h, LS600h, and CT200h.

===Series hybrid===
[[File:Chevrolet Volt charging WAS 2011 833.jpg|thumb|[[Chevrolet Volt]], a [[series hybrid]] [[plug-in hybrid]], also called extended range electric vehicle (EREV).]]
A '''series- or serial-hybrid vehicle''' is driven by an electric motor, functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient, with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient. There is typically no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels, and the primary purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery. Series-hybrids have also been referred to as [[Range extender (vehicle)|extended range electric vehicle]], range-extended electric vehicle, or electric vehicle-extended range (EREV/REEV/EVER).

The [[BMW i3]] with Range Extender is a production series-hybrid. It operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low, and then activates an engine-powered generator to maintain power, and is also available without the range extender. The [[Fisker Karma]] was the first series-hybrid production vehicle.

When describing cars, the battery of a series-hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in - but a series-hybrid may also allow for a battery to only act as a buffer (and for regeneration purposes), and for the electric motor's power to be supplied constantly by a supporting engine. Series arrangements have been common in [[diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s and ships. [[Ferdinand Porsche]] effectively invented this arrangement in speed-record-setting racing cars in the early 20th century, such as the [[Lohner-Porsche|Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid]]. Porsche named his arrangement "System Mixt" and it was a [[wheel hub motor]] design, where each of the two front wheels was powered by a separate motor. This arrangement was sometimes referred to as an ''electric transmission'', as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission. The vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running.

In 1997 Toyota released the first series-hybrid bus sold in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn19970822a8.html |title=Toyota debuts power-hybrid bus &amp;#124; The Japan Times Online |publisher=Search.japantimes.co.jp |date=1997-08-22 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Motors|GM]] introduced the [[Chevy Volt]] series plug-in hybrid in 2010, aiming for an [[all-electric range]] of {{convert|40|mi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stossel|first=Sage |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200807/general-motors |title=Electro-Shock Therapy – The Atlantic (July/August 2008) |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this car also has a mechanical connection between the engine and drivetrain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/10/11/shocker-chevy-says-volts-gas-engine-can-power-the-wheels-its|title=Shocker|date=2010-10-11|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Supercapacitors]] combined with a [[lithium ion]] battery bank have been used by [[AFS Trinity]] in a converted Saturn Vue SUV vehicle. Using [[supercapacitors]] they claim up to 150 mpg in a series-hybrid arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afstrinity.com/press-release-9-24-08.html Afstrinity.com]{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229035802/http://afstrinity.com/press-release-9-24-08.html |date=2008-12-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)===

{{See also|Plug-in electric vehicle}}

Another subtype of hybrid vehicles is the [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]] (PHEV). The plug-in hybrid is usually a general fuel-electric (parallel or serial) hybrid with increased energy storage capacity, usually through a [[lithium-ion battery]], which allows the vehicle to drive on [[all-electric mode]] a distance that depends on the battery size and its mechanical layout (series or parallel). It may be connected to mains electricity supply at the end of the journey to avoid charging using the on-board internal combustion engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = All About Plug-In Hybrids (PHEVs) | url = http://www.calcars.org/vehicles.html | author = California Cars Initiative | publisher =  International Humanities Center | accessdate=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.eaa-phev.org/wiki/Prius_PHEV#Kits_and_Conversions | title = Prius PHEV | publisher = Electric Auto Association – Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle | accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept is attractive to those seeking to minimize on-road emissions by avoiding – or at least minimizing – the use of ICE during daily driving. As with pure electric vehicles, the total emissions saving, for example in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; terms, is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company.

For some users, this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petrol/diesel that they would have otherwise used. Current tax systems in many European countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source. This is generally not the case for electricity, which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer, however that person uses it. Some electricity suppliers also offer price benefits for off-peak night users, which may further increase the attractiveness of the plug-in option for commuters and urban motorists.

===Road safety for cyclists, pedestrians===
[[File:2017 Nissan LEAF (ZE0 MY17) hatchback (2018-11-02) 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Nissan Leaf]] was the first [[plug-in electric car]] equipped with [[Nissan]]'s Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians.]]{{Main|Electric vehicle warning sounds}}
A 2009 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report examined [[hybrid electric vehicle]] accidents that involved pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles (ICEV). The findings showed that, in certain road situations, HEVs are more dangerous for those on foot or bicycle. For accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping, backing up, entering or leaving a parking space (when the sound difference between HEVs and ICEVs is most pronounced), HEVs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than ICEVs. For crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians, there was a higher incident rate for HEVs than ICEVs when a vehicle was turning a corner. But there was no statistically significant difference between the types of vehicles when they were driving straight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Incidence of Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crashes by Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles at Journalist's Resource.org | url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/economics/commerce/bicyclist-crashes-hybrid-electric-vehicles/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several automakers developed [[electric vehicle warning sounds]] designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of [[electric drive vehicle]]s such as hybrid electric vehicle, [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s and [[all-electric vehicle]]s (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Their purpose is to make pedestrians, cyclists, the blind, and others aware of the vehicle's presence while operating in [[all-electric mode]].&lt;ref name=TMC0810&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/news/10/08/0824.html|title=TMC to Sell Approaching Vehicle Audible System for 'Prius'|publisher=[[Toyota Motor Company]] News Release|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2010-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ACB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/critical-pedestrian-safety-legislation-moves-to-white-house-for-presidents-signature-112016879.html|title=Critical Pedestrian Safety Legislation Moves to White House for President's Signature|publisher=PR Newswire|author=[[American Council of the Blind]] Press Release|date=2010-12-16|accessdate=2010-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=S841&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/111/2/s841 |title=S. 841 Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010 |publisher=Legislative Digest |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222013237/http://www.gop.gov/bill/111/2/s841 |archivedate=2010-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/smart-takes/hybrid-electric-vehicles-to-become-louder-for-pedestrian-safety/13077/ |title=Hybrid, electric vehicles to become louder for pedestrian safety |publisher=SmartPlanet.com |author=Larry Dignan |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2010-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219073150/http://www.smartplanet.com/business/blog/smart-takes/hybrid-electric-vehicles-to-become-louder-for-pedestrian-safety/13077/ |archivedate=2010-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental issues==

===Fuel consumption and emissions reductions===
The hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional [[internal combustion engine vehicle]]s (ICEVs), resulting in fewer emissions being generated. These savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design:
# Relying on both the engine and the electric motors for peak power needs, resulting in a smaller engine size more for average usage rather than peak power usage. A smaller engine can have less internal losses and lower weight.
# Having significant battery storage capacity to store and reuse recaptured energy, especially in stop-and-go traffic typical of the city [[driving cycle]].
# Recapturing significant amounts of energy during braking that are normally wasted as heat. This [[regenerative braking]] reduces vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into electricity, depending upon the power rating of the motor/generator;
Other techniques that are not necessarily 'hybrid' features, but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include:
# Using [[Atkinson cycle]] engines instead of [[Otto cycle]] engines for improved fuel economy.
# Shutting down the engine during traffic stops or while coasting or during other idle periods.
# Improving [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamics]]; (part of the reason that SUVs get such bad fuel economy is the drag on the car. A box shaped car or truck has to exert more force to move through the air causing more stress on the engine making it work harder). Improving the shape and aerodynamics of a car is a good way to help better the fuel economy and also improve [[vehicle handling]] at the same time.
# Using low [[rolling resistance]] [[tires]] (tires were often made to give a quiet, smooth ride, high grip, etc., but efficiency was a lower priority). Tires cause mechanical [[drag (physics)|drag]], once again making the engine work harder, consuming more fuel. Hybrid cars may use special tires that are more inflated than regular tires and stiffer or by choice of [[tire#Components|carcass]] structure and rubber compound have lower rolling resistance while retaining acceptable grip, and so improving fuel economy whatever the power source.
# Powering the a/c, power steering, and other auxiliary pumps electrically as and when needed; this reduces mechanical losses when compared with driving them continuously with traditional engine belts.

These features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops, coasting and idling periods. In addition [[roadway noise|noise emissions]] are reduced, particularly at idling and low operating speeds, in comparison to conventional engine vehicles. For continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions.

===Hybrid vehicle emissions===
Hybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to 5.5 metric tons of {{CO2}}. The three most popular hybrid vehicles, [[Honda Civic]], [[Honda Insight]] and [[Toyota Prius]], set the standards even higher by producing 4.1, 3.5, and 3.5 tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions.
Hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog-forming pollutants by up to 90% and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, J. (2008). Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. Retrieved November 22, 2009 from Air Quality: Vehicle Emissions and Air Quality: [http://www.deq.state.id.us/air/prog_issues/pollutants/vehicles.cfm#low Deq.state.id.us]{{Failed verification|date=January 2012}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117133254/http://www.deq.state.id.us/air/prog_issues/pollutants/vehicles.cfm#low |date=2010-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More fossil fuel is needed to build hybrid vehicles than conventional cars but reduced emissions when running the vehicle more than outweigh this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm|title=Does hybrid car production waste offset hybrid benefits?|date=2010-12-06|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impact of hybrid car battery===
{{Main|Electric vehicle battery}}
{{More citations needed|date=July 2008|section}}

Though hybrid cars consume less fuel than conventional cars, there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid car battery. Today most hybrid car batteries are one of two types: 1) nickel metal hydride, or 2) [[Lithium-ion|lithium ion]]; both are regarded as more environmentally friendly than [[lead–acid battery|lead-based batteries]] which constitute the bulk of petrol car starter batteries today. There are many types of batteries. Some are far more toxic than others. Lithium ion is the least toxic of the two mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental impact of hybrid car battery. (2008).

The lithium-ion battery has attracted attention due to its potential for use in hybrid electric vehicles. Hitachi is a leader in its development.  In addition to its smaller size and lighter weight, lithium-ion batteries deliver performance that helps to protect the environment with features such as improved charge efficiency without [[memory effect]].
The lithium-ion batteries are appealing because they have the highest energy density of any rechargeable batteries and can produce a voltage more than three times that of nickel–metal hydride battery cell while simultaneously storing large quantities of electricity as well. The batteries also produce higher output (boosting vehicle power), higher efficiency (avoiding wasteful use of electricity), and provides excellent durability, compared with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle.
Additionally, use of lithium-ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and also achieves improved fuel economy of 30% better than petro-powered vehicles with a consequent reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions helping to prevent global warming.

===Charging===
There is two different levels of charging. Level one charging is the slower method as it uses a 120 V/15 A single-phase grounded outlet. Level two is a faster method; existing Level 2 equipment offers charging from 208 V or 240 V (at up to 80 A, 19.2&amp;nbsp;kW). It may require dedicated equipment and a connection installation for home or public units, although vehicles such as the Tesla have the power electronics on board and need only the outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yilmaz|first=M.|last2=Krein|first2=P.

Recharging with a 120 volt household outlet takes several hours, a 240 volt charger takes 1–4 hours, and a quick charge takes approximately 30 minutes to achieve 80% charge. Three important factors—distance on charge, cost of charging, and time to charge &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/phevtech.shtml|title=Plug-in Hybrids|publisher=|accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for the hybrid to run on electrical power, the car must perform the action of braking in order to generate some electricity. The electricity then gets discharged most effectively when the car accelerates or climbs up an incline.
In 2014, hybrid electric car batteries can run on solely electricity for 70–130 miles (110–210&amp;nbsp;km) on a single charge. Hybrid battery capacity currently ranges from 4.4 kWh to 85 kWh on a fully electric car. On a hybrid car, the battery packs currently range from 0.6 kWh to 2.4 kWh representing a large difference in use of electricity in hybrid cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1094057_electric-car-battery-use-already-higher-than-hybrids-total|title=Electric-Car Battery Use: Already Higher Than Hybrids' Total?|author=John Voelcker|work=Green Car Reports|accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How hybrid-electric vehicles work ==
Hybrids-Electric vehicles (HEVs) combine the advantage of gasoline ''engines'' and electric ''motors''. The key areas for efficiency or performance gains are regenerative braking, dual power sources, and less idling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hybrid Cars Technology Overviews|url = http://www.green-vehicles.com/technology/technology.html|website = www.green-vehicles.com|accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regenerate Braking.''' {{explain|date=November 2017}}The drivetrain can be used to convert kinetic energy (from the moving car) into stored electrical energy (batteries).  The same electric motor that powers the drivetrain is used to resist the motion of the drivetrain.  This applied resistance from the electric motor causes the wheel to slow down and simultaneously recharge the batteries.
* '''Dual Power.'''  Power can come from either the engine, motor or both depending on driving circumstances. Additional power to assist the engine in accelerating or climbing might be provided by the electric motor. Or more commonly, a smaller electric motor provides all of the power for low-speed driving conditions and is augmented by the engine at higher speeds.
* '''Automatic Start/Shutoff.''' It automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts it when the accelerator is pressed down. This automation is much simpler with an electric motor.  Also see dual power above.

==Alternative green vehicles==
{{Main|Green vehicle#Types}}
Other types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than [[fossil fuel]]. Another option is to use alternative fuel composition (i.e. [[biofuel]]s) in conventional fossil fuel-based vehicles, making them go partly on renewable energy sources.

Other approaches include [[personal rapid transit]], a [[public transport]]ation concept that offers automated on-demand non-stop transportation, on a network of specially built guideways.

==Peugeot/Citroën Hybrid Vehicle==
Peugeot and Citroën have announced that they too are building a car that uses compressed air as an energy source. However, the car they are designing uses a hybrid system which also uses a gasoline engine (which is used for propelling the car over 70&amp;nbsp;km/h, or when the compressed air tank has been depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/peugeot-announces-plans-to-release-a-hybrid-car-that-runs-on-compressed-air-by-2016/|title=Peugeot Announces Plans to Release a Hybrid Car That Runs on Compressed Air by 2016|author=Marc Carter|publisher=|accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
Automakers spend around $US8 million in marketing Hybrid vehicles each year. With combined effort from many car companies, the Hybrid industry has sold millions of Hybrids.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Hybrid car companies like Toyota, Honda, Ford and BMW have pulled together to create a movement of  Hybrid vehicle sales pushed by Washington lobbyist to lower the worlds emissions and become less reliant on our petroleum consumption.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} In 2005, sales went beyond 200,000 Hybrids, but in retrospect that only reduced the global use for gasoline consumption by 200,000 gallons per day — a tiny fraction of the 360 million gallons used per day.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} According to Bradley Berman author of Driving Change—One Hybrid at a time, "Cold economics shows that in real dollars, except for a brief spike in the 1970s, gas prices have remained remarkably steady and cheap. Fuel continues to represent a small part of the overall cost of owning and operating a personal vehicle".&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Bradley. "Driving change--one hybrid at a time." Business Perspectives Spring 2005: 30+. Academic OneFile. Web. 25 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Other marketing tactics include [[greenwashing]] which is the "unjustified appropriation of environmental virtue."&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenfeld, Temma. "Green, or Greenwash? Newsweek 14 July 2008: 56. Academic OneFile. Web. 25 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Temma  Ehrenfeld explained in an article by Newsweek. Hybrids may be more efficient than many other gasoline motors as far as gasoline consumption is concerned but as far as being green and good for the environment is completely inaccurate. Hybrid car companies have a long time to go if they expect to really go green. According to Harvard business professor Theodore Levitt states "managing products" and "meeting customers' needs", "you must adapt to consumer expectations and anticipation of future desires."&lt;ref&gt;Ottman, Jacquelyn A., Edwin R. Stafford, and Cathy L. Hartman. "Avoiding Green Marketing Myopia." Environment 48.5 (2006): 22,36,2. ProQuest. Web. 25 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This means people buy what they want, if they want a fuel efficient car they buy a Hybrid without thinking about the actual efficiency of the product. This "Green Myopia" as Ottman calls it, fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness. Researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology, as well as the convenience of fewer fill ups. Secondly, people find it rewarding to own the better, newer, flashier, and so called greener car. In the beginning of the Hybrid movement car companies reached out to the young people, by using top celebrities, astronauts, and popular TV shows to market Hybrids. This made the new technology of Hybrids a status to obtain for many people and a must to be cool or even the practical choice for the time. With the many benefits and status of owning a Hybrid it is easy to think it's the right thing to do, but in fact may not be as green as it appears.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Adoption rate==
While the adoption rate for hybrids in the US is small today (2.2% of new car sales in 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Friday, Stephen On. (2012-04-06) [http://integrityexports.com/2012/04/06/prius-tops-japan-car-sales-in-2011-hybrids-now-16-percent-of-market/ IntegrityExports.com]. IntegrityExports.com.

Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has the potential to be very large over time as more models are offered and incremental costs decline due to learning and scale benefits. However, forecasts vary widely. For instance, [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]], a long-time skeptic of hybrids, indicated he expects hybrids "will never comprise more than 10% of the US auto market."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gm-exechybrids-unlikely-to-take-more-than-10-of-us-market-2010-02-13 Marketwatch.com]. Marketwatch.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources also expect hybrid penetration rates in the US will remain under 10% for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, Dale. (2010-09-12) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703632304575451720343127244 WSJ.com]. Online.wsj.com.

More optimistic views as of 2006 include predictions that hybrids would dominate new car sales in the US and elsewhere over the next 10 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;AllianceBernstein, "The Emergence of Hybrid Vehicles: Ending Oil's Stranglehold on Transportation and the Economy," June 2006. [http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/493.html Calcars.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach, taken by Saurin Shah, examines the penetration rates (or S-curves) of four analogs (historical and current) to hybrid and electrical vehicles in an attempt to gauge how quickly the vehicle stock could be hybridized and/or electrified in the United States. The analogs are (1) the electric motors in US factories in the early 20th century, (2) diesel electric locomotives on US railways in the 1920–1945 period, (3) a range of new automotive features/technologies introduced in the US over the past fifty years, and 4) e-bike purchases in China over the past few years. These analogs collectively suggest it would take at least 30 years for hybrid and electric vehicles to capture 80% of the US passenger vehicle stock.

==European Union 2020 Regulation Standards==
The European Parliament, Council and European Commission has reached an agreement which is aimed at reducing the average CO2 passenger car emissions to 95 g/km by 2020, according to a European Commission press release.

According to the release, the key details of the agreement are as follows:

Emissions target: The agreement will reduce average CO2 emissions from new cars to 95 g/km from 2020, as proposed by the Commission. This is a 40% reduction from the mandatory 2015 target of 130 g/km. The target is an average for each manufacturer's new car fleet; it allows OEMs to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more.
2025 target: The Commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by end-2015 to take effect in 2025. This target will be in line with the EU's long-term climate goals.
Supercredits for low-emission vehicles: The Regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with CO2 emissions of 50 g/km or less (which will be electric or plug-in hybrid cars). Each of these vehicles will be counted as two vehicles in 2020, 1.67 in 2021, 1.33 in 2022 and then as one vehicle from 2023 onwards. These supercredits will help manufacturers further reduce the average emissions of their new car fleet.  However, to prevent the scheme from undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation, there will be a 2.5 g/km cap per manufacturer on the contribution that supercredits can make to their target in any year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/industry-economic-report.aspx?id=1065980565|title=EU agrees deal on 2020 car emissions regulations|publisher=|accessdate=2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Journey to the Safest Place on Earth''''' is a 2013 documentary film written and directed by [[ (filmmaker)|Edgar Hagen]]. It discusses the huge quantity of [[radioactive waste]] and spent [[fuel rod]]s being stored at various locations on the planet.

[[Charles McCombie]] is a Swiss-based nuclear physicist with 35 years of experience in this field, and he accompanies Hagen on a worldwide search for the best location.  One disposal site in Texas is adjacent to a location where oil drilling is in progress. A [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|proposed disposal site in Nevada]] is adjacent to the young volcano [[Yucca Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019011259/http://doxafestival.ca/film/journey|title=Journey to the Safest Place on Earth|last=|first=|date=2014-10-19|website=DOXA Documentary Film Festival|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is an urgent need for a location where the waste can be stored without harm to living things or the environment.  Meanwhile, nuclear waste continues to be produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dokufest.com/2014/movie/journey-to-the-safest-place-on-earth/|title=Journey to the Safest Place on Earth|last=|first=|date=2013|website=DokuFest|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''lamella''''' (plural ''lamellae'') is a small plate or flake, from the Latin, and may also be used to refer to collections of fine sheets of material held adjacent to one another, in a [[gill]]-shaped structure, often with fluid in between though sometimes simply a set of 'welded' plates. The term is used in [[biology|biological]] and [[engineering]] contexts, such as [[filter (chemistry)|filter]]s and [[heat exchanger]]s. The microscopic structures in [[bone]] and [[nacre]] are lamellae in the [[materials science]] sense of the word.

==Uses of the term==
In [[surface chemistry]] (especially [[mineralogy]] and [[materials science]]), [[lamellar structure]]s are fine layers, alternating between different materials.  They can be produced by chemical effects (as in [[eutectic]] solidification), biological means, or a deliberate process of [[lamination]], such as [[pattern welding]]. Lamellae can also describe the layers of atoms in the crystal lattice of a material such as a metal.

The term has been used to describe the construction of [[lamellar armour]], as well as the layered structures that can be described by a [[lamellar vector field]].

In a [[water-treatment]] context, lamellar filters may be referred to as ''plate filters'' or ''tube filters''.

This term is used to describe a certain type of [[ichthyosis]], a congenital skin condition.  Lamellar Ichthyosis often presents with a "colloidal" membrane at birth.  It is characterized by generalized dark scaling.

The term ''lamella(e)'' is used in the flooring industry to describe the finished top-layer of an engineered wooden floor. For example, an engineered walnut floor will have several layers of wood and a top walnut lamella. 

In [[archaeology]] the term is used for a variety of small flat and thin objects, such as [[Amulet MS 5236]], a very thin gold plate with a stamped text from [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BC. 

In [[textiles]], lamella is thin metallic strip used alone or wound around a core thread for [[Goldwork (embroidery)|goldwork embroidery]] and [[tapestry|tapestry weaving]].&lt;ref name="Silk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schoeser|first1=Mary|title=Silk|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300117417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LpVdUddNkGUC&amp;pg=PA248|page=248|accessdate=30 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) announced a [[Product recall|recall]] of two [[medication]]s which contained "extremely thin glass flakes (lamellae) that are barely visible in most cases. The lamellae result from the interaction of the formulation with [[glass vial]]s over the [[shelf life]] of the product."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm227202.htm Amgen Initiates Voluntary Nationwide Recall of Certain Lots Of Epogen And Procrit (Epoetin Alfa)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewiston Lake''' is a [[reservoir]] impounded by [[Lewiston Dam (California)|Lewiston Dam]] on the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]], in [[Trinity County, California]].

==Geography==
Lewiston Lake is near the towns of [[Weaverville, California|Weaverville]] and [[Lewiston, California|Lewiston]] in [[Trinity County, California]].

It is used for [[transbasin diversion]] to the [[Sacramento River]] and [[flood control]], as well as for [[hydroelectric]] generation. It is in the canyon between the [[Trinity Mountains]] and [[Marble Mountains (Siskiyou County)|Marble Mountains]] of the southern [[Klamath Mountains]] System.

==Recreation==
Lewiston reservoir is within the Trinity Unit of the [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area]], in the [[Shasta-Trinity National Forest]]. It is a popular destination for fishing, kayaking, and camping.

The [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]] (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating [https://oehha.ca.gov/advisories/lewiston-lake advisory] for Lewiston Lake based on levels of mercury or [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] found in fish caught from this water body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oehha.ca.gov/advisories/lewiston-lake|title=Lewiston Lake|last=Admin|first=OEHHA|date=2014-12-30|work=OEHHA|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mineral wool''' is any [[fiber|fibrous]] material formed by [[spinning (polymers)#Melt spinning|spinning]] or [[drawing (manufacturing)#Plastic drawing|drawing]] molten [[mineral]] or rock materials such as [[slag]] and [[ceramic material|ceramics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Man-made mineral fibre (MMMF) is a generic name used to describe an inorganic fibrous material manufactured primarily from glass, rock, minerals, slag and processed inorganic. The MMMF produced are non-crystalline (glassy, vitreous, amorphous)." [http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=7722&amp;langId=en] Recommendation from the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for man made-mineral fibres (MMMF) with no indication for carcinogenicity and not specified elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications of mineral wool include [[thermal insulation]] (as both [[building insulation|structural insulation]] and [[pipe insulation]], though it is not as fire-resistant as [[high-temperature insulation wool]]), [[filtration]], [[soundproofing]], and [[hydroponics|hydroponic]] growth medium.

== Naming ==

Mineral wool is also known as  ''mineral fiber'', ''mineral cotton'', ''mineral fibre'', ''man-made mineral fibre'' (MMMF), and ''man-made vitreous fiber'' (MMVF).

The nomenclature of these wool products is simply the parent/raw material name in prefix to "wool". Specific mineral wool products are ''stone wool'' and ''slag wool''. Europe also includes [[glass wool]] which, together with [[ceramic]] fiber, are completely man-made fibers.

== History ==
Slag wool was first made in 1840 in [[Wales]] by Edward Parry, "but no effort appears to have been made to confine the wool after production; consequently it floated about the works with the slightest breeze, and became so injurious to the men that the process had to be abandoned".&lt;ref&gt;Spon, Ernest. [http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015063827573?urlappend=%3Bseq=449 ''Workshop Receipts''] ... London: E. &amp; F. N. Spon, 18831892. Page 439&lt;/ref&gt; A method of making mineral wool was patented in the United States in 1870 by John Player&lt;ref name="Appleton"&gt;"Mineral Wool or Mineral Cotton", ''Appleton's Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year 1891''. New Series vol. 16. New York: 1892. 528. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and first produced commercially in 1871 at [[Georgsmarienhütte]] in [[Osnabrück]] [[Germany]]. The process involved blowing a strong stream of air across a falling flow of liquid iron slag which was similar to the natural occurrence of fine strands of volcanic slag from [[Kilauea]] called [[Pele's hair]] created by strong winds blowing apart the slag during an eruption.&lt;ref name="Appleton" /&gt; 

American chemical engineer [[Charles Corydon Hall]] in 1897 developed a technology to convert molten [[limestone]] into fibers and initiated the rock wool insulation industry in America.

According to a mineral wool manufacturer, the first mineral wool intended for high-temperature applications was invented in the United States in 1942, but was not commercially viable until approximately 1953. More forms of mineral wool become available in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.htiwcoalition.org/producthistory.html|title=HISTORY OF HTIW PRODUCTS|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Copy edit section|date=August 2018}}

[[Image:Industrial furnace equipped with HTIW modules.jpg|thumb|Industrial furnace equipped with HTMW modules]]
[[Image:Industrial furnace.jpg|thumb|upright|Industrial furnace equipped with HTMW in operation]]

High-temperature mineral wool (HTMW) is a type of mineral wool created for use as high-temperature insulation, usually for use in industrial furnaces and foundries, generally defined as being resistant to temperatures above 1,000&amp;nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]].

Due to the costly production and limited availability compared to regular mineral wool, HTMW products are used almost exclusively in high-temperature industrial applications and processes.
=== Definitions ===

The classification temperature is defined as the temperature at which a linear shrinkage of a certain amount (usually 2–4%) is not exceeded after a 24&amp;#x2011;hour heat treatment in the electrically heated [[laboratory oven]] and in a neutral atmosphere. Depending on the type of product, the value may not exceed the following limits: 2% for boards and shaped products, 4% for mats and papers.

The classification temperature is specified in 50&amp;nbsp;°C steps (starting at 850&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 1600&amp;nbsp;°C). The classification temperature does not mean that the product can be used continuously at this temperature. In the field, the continuous application temperature of amorphous HTMW (AES and ASW) is typically 100–150&amp;nbsp;°C below the classification temperature. Products made of polycrystalline wool can generally be used up to classification temperature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== Types ===

There are several types of HTMWs made from different types of mineral, and with different properties and temperatures that they can withstand. Below are some common types:

==== Alkaline earth silicate wool (AES wool) ====

AES Wool consists of amorphous glass fibres, which are produced by melting a combination of CaO−, MgO−, SiO&lt;sub href="glass wool"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; . Products made from AES are generally used in continuously operating equipment and domestic appliances. AES wool has the advantage of being biosoluble; if inhaled it will generally stay in the body only a couple of weeks, reducing the chances of causing [[silicosis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://insulationet.com/en/materials/high-temperature-wool/|title=High temperature insulation wool - Production, Properties, Classification,|work=insulatioNet.com|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alumino silicate wool (ASW) ====

Alumino silicate wool also known as “refractory ceramic fibre” (RCF), are amorphous fibres produced by melting a combination of Al&lt;sub href="Georgsmarienhütte"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub href="Osnabrück"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and SiO&lt;sub href="Germany"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, usually in a weight ratio 50:50 (see also VDI 3469 Parts 1 and 5,&lt;ref name="VDI"&gt;VDI Guideline: VDI 3469 Part 1 - Overview  Part 5 – High-Temperature Insulation Wool&lt;/ref&gt; as well as TRGS 521). Products made of alumino silicate wool are generally used at application temperatures of greater than 900&amp;nbsp;°C and in intermittently operating equipment and critical application conditions (see Technical Rules TRGS 619).

==== Polycrystalline wool (PCW) ====

Polycrystalline wool consists of fibres containing greater than 70 wt.% Al&lt;sub href="Charles Corydon Hall"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub href="limestone"&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; they are produced by a "sol-gel method" from aqueous spinning solutions. The water-soluble green fibres obtained as a precursor are crystallized by means of heat treatment.&lt;ref name="VDI" /&gt; Polycrystalline wool is generally used at application temperatures greater than 1300&amp;nbsp;°C and in critical chemical and physical application conditions, also at lower temperatures.

==== Kaowool ====

Kaowool is a type of HTMW made from the mineral [[kaolin]]. It was one of the first types of HTMW invented and has continued use into the 21st century.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It can withstand temperatures close to 3,000°&amp;nbsp;F (1649°&amp;nbsp;C).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fabricationspecialties.com/pdf/hightemp.pdf|title=Thermal Ceramics|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Stone wool is a furnace product of [[lava|molten rock]] at a temperature of about 1600&amp;nbsp;°C, through which a stream of air or steam is blown. More advanced production techniques are based on spinning molten rock in high-speed spinning heads somewhat like the process used to produce [[cotton candy]]. The final product is a mass of fine, intertwined fibres with a typical diameter of 2 to 6 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometers]]. Mineral wool may contain a [[binder (material)|binder]], often a [[terpolymer]], and an [[mineral oil|oil]] to reduce dusting.

== Use ==
Though the individual fibers [[heat conduction|conduct heat]] very well, when pressed into rolls and sheets, their ability to partition air makes them excellent insulators and [[sound absorption|sound absorbers]].&lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Ethan. Acoustic Treatment and Design for
Recording Studios and Listening Rooms. "Without question, the most effective absorber for midrange and high frequencies is rigid fiberglass."http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html#rigid%20fiberglass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Houghton, Matt. Sound On Sound. "What is the best density for a good, fairly wide-spectrum absorber? . . .try looking for mineral wool in the region of 45-75kg/m3." http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/oct10/articles/qa-1010-2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Though not immune to the effects of a sufficiently hot fire, the fire resistance of [[glass wool|fiberglass]], stone wool, and [[ceramic]] fibers makes them common [[building material]]s when [[passive fire protection]] is required, being used as spray [[fireproofing]], in [[wall stud|stud]] cavities in [[drywall]] assemblies and as [[packing (firestopping)|packing]] materials in [[firestop]]s.

Other uses are in [[resin bonded panel]]s, as filler in compounds for [[gasket]]s, in [[brake pad]]s, in [[plastic]]s in the [[automotive]] industry, as a [[filtration|filtering]] medium, and as a growth medium in [[hydroponics]].

Mineral fibers are produced in the same way, without binder. The fiber as such is used as a raw material for its reinforcing purposes in various applications, such as friction materials, gaskets, plastics, and [[coating]]s.

=== Hydroponics ===
Mineral wool products can be engineered to hold large quantities of water and air that aid root growth and nutrient uptake in [[hydroponics]]; their fibrous nature also provides a good mechanical structure to hold the plant stable. The naturally high [[pH]] of mineral wool makes them initially unsuitable to plant growth and requires "conditioning" to produce a wool with an appropriate, stable pH.&lt;ref name="Alexander 1994"&gt;{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cHT3bMm3njsC&amp;dq=rockwool&amp;hl=id&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title = The Best of Growing Edge |author = Tom Alexander |author2=Don Parker |date = 1994 |publisher = New Moon Publishing, Inc. |isbn = 978-0-944557-01-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

=== High-temperature mineral wool ===
High-temperature mineral wool is used primarily for insulation and lining of industrial furnaces and foundries to improve efficiency and safety. It is also used to prevent the spread of fire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of HTMW enables a more lightweight construction of [[industrial furnaces]] and other technical equipment as compared to other methods such as fire bricks, due to its high heat resistance capabilities per weight, but has the disadvantage of being more expensive than other methods.

== Safety of material ==

The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC) has reviewed the [[carcinogenicity]] of man-made mineral fibres in October 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol81/index.php IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 81 (2002), Man-made Vitreous Fibres] (PLEASE NOTE: Some manufacturers of insulation products{{Who|date=December 2011}} have cited this volume while making erroneous claims that "IARC scientists confirm safety of mineral wool insulation". These claims are just false. The findings in this volume are not a determination of non-carcinogenicity or overall safety.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The IARC Monograph's working group concluded only the more [[biopersistent]] materials remain classified by IARC as "possibly carcinogenic to humans" ([[List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens|Group 2B]]). These include refractory ceramic fibres, which are used industrially as insulation in high-temperature environments such as [[blast furnace]]s, and certain special-purpose [[glass wool]]s not used as insulating materials. In contrast, the more commonly used vitreous fibre wools produced since 2000, including insulation glass wool, stone wool, and slag wool, are considered "not classifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans" ([[List of IARC Group 3 carcinogens|Group 3]]).

High biosoluble fibres are produced that do not cause damage to the human cell. These newer materials have been tested for carcinogenicity and most are found to be noncarcinogenic. IARC elected not to make an overall evaluation of the newly developed fibres designed to be less biopersistent such as the alkaline earth silicate or high-alumina, low-silica wools. This decision was made in part because no human data were available, although such fibres that have been tested appear to have low carcinogenic potential in experimental animals, and because the Working Group had difficulty in categorizing these fibres into meaningful groups based on chemical composition."&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol81/mono81.pdf IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, Volume 81 (2002), Man-made Vitreous Fibres], Overall evaluation, p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Regulation (CE) n° 1272/2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures updated by the Regulation (CE) n°790/2009 does not classify mineral wool fibres as a dangerous substance if they fulfil criteria defined in its note Q.

The European Certification Board for mineral wool products, EUCEB, certify mineral wool products made of fibres fulfilling Note Q ensuring that they have a low biopersistence and so that they are fast removed from the lung. The certification is based on independent experts’ advice and regular control of the chemical composition
www.euceb.org

Due to the mechanical effect of fibres, mineral wool products may cause temporary skin itching. To diminish this and to avoid unnecessary exposure to mineral wool dust, information on good practices is available on the packaging of mineral wool products with pictograms or sentences. Safe Use Instruction Sheets similar to Safety data sheet are also available from each producer.

People can be exposed to mineral wool fibers in the workplace by breathing them in, skin contact, and eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for mineral wool fiber exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 5 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 3 fibers per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Mineral wool fiber |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0432.html |website= www.cdc.gov |accessdate= 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) is a European Union regulation of 18 December 2006. REACH addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment. A Substance Information Exchange Forum (SIEF) has been set up for several types of mineral wool. AES, ASW and PCW have been registered before the first deadline of 1 December 2010 and can, therefore, be used on the European market.

*ASW/RCF is classified as carcinogen category 1B
*AES is exempted from carcinogen classification based on short-term in vitro study result
*PCW wools are not classified; self-classification led to the conclusion that PCW are not hazardous

On 13 January 2010, some of the aluminosilicate refractory ceramic fibres and zirconia aluminosilicate refractory ceramic fibres have been included in the candidate list of [[Substances of Very High Concern]]. In response to concerns raised with the definition and the dossier two additional dossiers were posted on the ECHA website for consultation and resulted in two additional entries on the candidate list. This actual (having four entries for one substance/group of substances) situation is contrary to the REACH procedure intended. Aside from this situation, concerns raised during the two consultation periods remain valid.

Regardless of the concerns raised, the inclusion of a substance in the candidate list triggers immediately the following legal obligations of manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles containing that substance in a concentration above 0.1% (w/w):

* Notification to ECHA -REACH Regulation Art. 7
* Provision of Safety Data Sheet- REACH Regulation Art. 31.1
*Duty to communicate safe use information or responding to customer requests -REACH Regulation Art. 33

=== Fibrous dust ===
Based on the total experience with humans and the findings of scientific research (animals, cells), it can be concluded that elongated dust particles of every type have in principle the potential to cause the development of tumours providing they are sufficiently long, thin and biopersistent.  According to scientific findings inorganic fibre dust particles with a length-to-diameter ratio exceeding 3:1, a length longer than 5&amp;nbsp;μm (0.005&amp;nbsp;mm) and a diameter smaller than 3&amp;nbsp;μm (WHO-Fibres) are considered health-critical.

HTMW processed to products contain fibres with different diameters and lengths. During handling of HTMW products, fibrous dusts can be emitted. These can include fibres complying with the WHO definition. The amount depends on how the material is handled. High concentrations are usually found during removal of after-use HTMW and also during mechanical finishing activities and in the assembly of modules. Where fibre products are mechanically abraded by sawing, sanding, routing, or other machining the airborne fibre concentrations will be high if uncontrolled. Dust release is further modified by the intensity of energy applied to the product, the surface area to which the energy is applied, and the type, quantity and dimensions of materials being handled or processed. Dispersion or dilution of dust produced depends on the extent of confinement of the sources and the work area, as well as the presence and effectiveness of exhaust ventilation.

=== Crystalline silica ===
Amorphous HTMW (AES and ASW) are produced from a molten glass stream which is aerosolised by a jet of high-pressure air or by letting the stream impinge onto spinning wheels. The droplets are drawn into fibres; the mass of both fibres and remaining droplets cool very rapidly so that no crystalline phases may form.

When amorphous HTMW are installed and used in high-temperature applications such as industrial furnaces, at least one face may be exposed to conditions causing the fibres to partially devitrify. Depending on the chemical composition of the glassy fibre and the time and temperature to which the materials are exposed, different stable crystalline phases may form.

In after-use HTMW [[crystalline silica]] crystals are embedded in a matrix composed of other crystals and glasses. Experimental results on the biological activity of after-use HTMW have not demonstrated any hazardous activity that could be related to any form of silica they may contain.

'''Oklo''' is a region near the town of [[Franceville]], in the [[Haut-Ogooué]] province of the [[Central Africa]]n state of [[Gabon]]. Several [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]s were discovered in the [[Uranium mining|uranium mines]] in the region during 1972.

==History==
Gabon was a French colony when prospectors from the French [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique|nuclear energy commissariat]] (the industrial parts, which later became the COGEMA and later [[Areva NC]]) discovered uranium in the remote region in 1956. France immediately opened mines operated by Comuf (Compagnie des Mines d'Uranium de Franceville) near [[Mounana]] village in order to exploit the vast mineral resources and the State of Gabon was given a minority share in the company.

For forty years, [[France]] mined for uranium in Gabon. Once extracted, the uranium was used for electricity production in France and much of [[Europe]]. Today, however, the uranium deposits are exhausted, and the mine is no longer worked. Currently, [[mine reclamation]] work is ongoing in the region affected by the mine operations.

There is strong geochemical evidence that the Oklo uranium deposit behaved as a [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] in [[Precambrian]] times: some of the mined uranium was found to have a lower concentration of [[uranium-235]] than expected, as if it had already been in a reactor. Geologists found that it ''had'' been in a reactor before—two billion years ago. At that time the natural uranium had a concentration of about 3% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, and could have reached [[critical mass|criticality]] with natural water as [[neutron moderator]].&lt;ref name="Kean2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kean|first=Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love, and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v_70nQEACAAJ|date=12 July 2010|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=978-0-316-05164-4|pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lederman |first1=Leon |last2=Hill |first2=Christopher |title=Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe |date=2004 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst |isbn=9781591022428 |pages=40-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Palmitic acid''', or '''hexadecanoic acid''' in [[IUPAC nomenclature]], is the most common [[saturated fatty acid]] found in animals, plants and microorganisms.&lt;ref name=lipidhb&gt;Gunstone, F. D., John L. Harwood, and Albert J. Dijkstra. The Lipid Handbook, 3rd ed. Boca Raton: CRC Press, 2007. {{ISBN|0849396883}} | {{ISBN|978-0849396885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The most common fatty acid is the monounsaturated oleic acid.  See: https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/965#section=Top&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[chemical formula]] is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, and its C:D is 16:0. As its name indicates, it is a major component of the oil from the fruit of [[oil palm]]s ([[palm oil]]). Palmitic acid can also be found in meats, cheeses, butter, and dairy products. '''Palmitates''' are the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[ester]]s of palmitic acid. The palmitate anion is the observed form of palmitic acid at physiologic pH (7.4).

Aluminium [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] of palmitic acid and [[naphthenic acid]] were combined during [[World War II]] to produce [[napalm]]. The word "napalm" is derived from the words '''na'''phthenic acid and '''palm'''itic acid.

==Occurrence and production==
Palmitic acid was discovered by [[Edmond Frémy]] in 1840, in [[Saponification|saponified]] palm oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E. |last=Frémy |title=Memoire sur les produits de la saponification de l'huile de palme |journal=Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie |volume=XII  |year=1842 |issue= |pages=757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This remains the primary industrial route for its production, with the [[triglyceride]]s (fats) in [[palm oil]] being [[hydrolysed]] by high temperature water (above {{convert|200|°C|°F|-1|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and the resulting mixture fractionally distilled to give the pure product.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |first=David J. |last=Anneken |first2=Sabine |last2=Both |first3=Ralf |last3=Christoph |first4=Georg |last4=Fieg |first5=Udo |last5=Steinberner |first6=Alfred |last6=Westfechtel |chapter=Fatty Acids |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_245.pub2 |isbn=978-3527306732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmitic acid is naturally produced by a wide range of other plants and organisms, typically at low levels. It is naturally present in [[butter]], [[cheese]], [[milk]], and [[meat]], as well as [[cocoa butter]], [[soybean oil]], and [[sunflower oil]].  [[Karuka]]s contain 44.90% palmitic acid.&lt;ref name="Purwanto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Purwanto |first1=Y. |last2=Munawaroh |first2=Esti |title=Etnobotani Jenis-Jenis Pandanaceae Sebagai Bahan Pangan di Indonesia |journal=Berkala Penelitian Hayati |date=2010 |volume=5A |pages=97–108 |doi=10.5072/FK2/Z6P0OQ |url=https://rin.lipi.go.id/file.xhtml;jsessionid=ccb24f0a337710227d6d5cecae10?fileId=1258&amp;version=RELEASED&amp;version=.1 |accessdate=25 October 2018 |trans-title=Ethnobotany Types of Pandanaceae as Foodstuffs in Indonesia |language=Indonesian |format=PDF |issn=2337-389X |oclc=981032990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[cetyl alcohol|cetyl]] ester of palmitic acid (cetyl palmitate) occurs in [[spermaceti]].

==Biochemistry==
Excess [[carbohydrate]]s in the body are converted to palmitic acid. Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during [[fatty acid synthesis]] and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major body component of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21–30% (molar) of human [[Adipose tissue|depot fat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. J. |last=Kingsbury |first2=S. |last2=Paul |first3=A. |last3=Crossley |first4=D. M. |last4=Morgan |title=The fatty acid composition of human depot fat |journal=[[Biochemical Journal]] |year=1961 |volume=78 |issue= |pages=541–550 |pmc=1205373 |pmid=13756126}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 352132 | volume=31 | issue=6 | title=Lipids of human milk and infant formulas: a review | date=June 1978 | journal=Am. J. Clin. Nutr. | pages=990–1016 | last1 = Jensen | first1 = RG | last2 = Hagerty | first2 = MM | last3 = McMahon | first3 = KE| doi=10.1093/ajcn/31.6.990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmitate negatively feeds back on [[acetyl-CoA carboxylase]] (ACC), which is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which in turn  is used to add to the growing acyl chain, thus preventing further palmitate generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/map/map00061.html Fatty acid biosynthesis - Reference pathway]&lt;/ref&gt; In biology, some [[protein]]s are modified by the addition of a palmitoyl group in a process known as [[palmitoylation]]. Palmitoylation is important for membrane localisation of many proteins.

==Applications==
Palmitic acid is used to produce a [[soap]]s, [[cosmetics]], and industrial mold [[release agent]]s.  These applications use '''sodium palmitate''', which is commonly obtained by [[saponification]] of palm oil.  To this end, palm oil, rendered from palm tree (species ''Elaeis guineensis''), is treated with [[sodium hydroxide]] (in the form of caustic soda or lye), which causes [[hydrolysis]] of the [[ester]] groups, yielding [[glycerol]] and sodium palmitate.

Because it is inexpensive and adds texture and "[[mouth feel]]" to processed foods ([[convenience food]]), palmitic acid and its sodium salt find wide use in foodstuffs. Sodium palmitate is permitted as a natural additive in [[organic certification|organic]] products.&lt;ref&gt;US Soil Association standard 50.5.3&lt;/ref&gt; The [[aluminium]] salt is used as a thickening agent of [[napalm]] used in military actions.

[[Hydrogenation]] of palmitic acid yields [[cetyl alcohol]], which is used to produce detergents and cosmetics.

Recently, a long-acting antipsychotic medication, [[paliperidone]] palmitate (marketed as INVEGA Sustenna), used in the treatment of [[schizophrenia]], has been synthesized using the oily palmitate ester as a long-acting release carrier medium when injected intramuscularly. The underlying method of drug delivery is similar to that used with [[decanoic acid]] to deliver long-acting depot medication, in particular, neuroleptics such as [[haloperidol]] decanoate.

==Health effects==
According to the [[World Health Organization]], evidence is "convincing" that consumption of palmitic acid increases the risk of developing [[cardiovascular disease]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freezepage.com/1348239076FHWAJDADVT?url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/trs/who_trs_916.pdf Diet, Nutrition and the Prevention of Chronic Diseases], WHO Technical Report Series 916, Report of a Joint WHO/FAO Expert Consultation, [[World Health Organization]], Geneva, 2003, p. 88 (Table 10)&lt;/ref&gt; based on studies indicating that it may increase [[LDL]] levels in the blood.  [[Retinyl palmitate]] is a source of [[vitamin A]] added to low fat milk to replace the vitamin content lost through the removal of milk fat.  Palmitate is attached to the alcohol form of vitamin A, [[retinol]], to make vitamin A stable in milk.

[[File:Carbon-film Resistor Construction.svg|thumb|Resistor based on the sheet resistance of carbon film]]
'''Sheet resistance''' is a measure of [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] of thin films that are nominally uniform in thickness. It is commonly used to characterize materials made by semiconductor doping, metal deposition, resistive paste printing, and [[Insulated glazing|glass coating]]. Examples of these processes are: [[Doping (semiconductors)|doped]] [[semiconductor]] regions (e.g., [[silicon]] or [[polysilicon]]), and the resistors that are screen printed onto the substrates of [[Hybrid integrated circuit|thick-film hybrid microcircuits]].

The utility of sheet resistance as opposed to [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] or [[resistivity]] is that it is directly measured using a [[four-terminal sensing]] measurement (also known as a four-point probe measurement) or indirectly by using a non-contact eddy current based testing device. Sheet resistance is invariable under scaling of the film contact and therefore can be used to compare the electrical properties of devices that are significantly different in size.

==Calculations==
[[File:sheet resistance.svg|thumb|right|300px|Geometry for defining resistivity (left) and sheet resistance (right). In both cases, the current is parallel to the direction of the double-arrow near the letter ''L''.]]

Sheet resistance is applicable to two-dimensional systems in which  thin films are considered two-dimensional entities. When the term sheet resistance is used, it is implied that the current is along the plane of the sheet, not perpendicular to it.

In a regular three-dimensional conductor, the [[electrical resistance|resistance]] can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;R = \rho \frac{L}{A} = \rho \frac{L}{W t},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[resistivity]], &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length.  The cross-sectional area can be split into the width &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and the sheet thickness &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;.

Upon combining the resistivity with the thickness, the resistance can then be written as
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\rho}{t} \frac{L}{W} = R_\text{s} \frac{L}{W},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R_\text{s}&lt;/math&gt; is the sheet resistance. If the film thickness is known, the bulk resistivity &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (in [[ohm|Ω]]·cm) can be calculated by multiplying the sheet resistance by the film thickness in cm:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = R_s \cdot t.&lt;/math&gt;

===Units===

Sheet resistance is a special case of resistivity for a uniform sheet thickness.  Commonly, resistivity (also known as bulk resistance, specific electrical resistance, or volume resistivity) is in units of Ω·m, which is more completely stated in units of Ω·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/m (Ω·area/length). When divided by the sheet thickness (m), the units are Ω·m·(m/m)/m = Ω. The term "(m/m)" cancels, but represents a special "square" situation yielding an answer in [[ohm]]s. An alternative, common unit is "ohms square" (denoted "&lt;math&gt;\Omega\Box&lt;/math&gt;") or "ohms per square" (denoted "Ω/sq" or "&lt;math&gt;\Omega/\Box&lt;/math&gt;"), which is dimensionally equal to an ohm, but is exclusively used for sheet resistance. This is an advantage, because sheet resistance of 1&amp;nbsp;Ω could be taken out of context and misinterpreted as bulk resistance of 1&amp;nbsp;ohm, whereas sheet resistance of 1&amp;nbsp;Ω/sq cannot thus be misinterpreted.

The reason for the name "ohms per square" is that a square sheet with sheet resistance 10&amp;nbsp;ohm/square has an actual resistance of 10&amp;nbsp;ohm, regardless of the size of the square. (For a square, &lt;math&gt;L = W&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;R_\text{s} = R&lt;/math&gt;.) The unit can be thought of as, loosely, "ohms · [[aspect ratio]]".  Example:  A 3-unit long by 1-unit wide (aspect ratio = 3) sheet made of material having a sheet resistance of 21&amp;nbsp;Ω/sq would measure 63&amp;nbsp;Ω (since it is composed of three 1-unit by 1-unit squares), if the 1-unit edges were attached to an ohmmeter that made contact entirely over each edge.

===For semiconductors===

For semiconductors doped through diffusion or surface peaked ion implantation we define the sheet resistance using the average resistivity &lt;math&gt;\overline{\rho} = 1 / \overline{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; of the material:

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{s} = \overline{\rho} / x_\text{j} = (\overline{\sigma} x_\text{j})^{-1} = \frac{1}{ \int_0^{x_\text{j}} \sigma(x) \,dx },&lt;/math&gt;

which in materials with majority-carrier properties can be approximated by (neglecting intrinsic charge carriers):

:&lt;math&gt;R_\text{s} = \frac{1}{\int_0^{x_\text{j}} \mu q N(x) \,dx},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_\text{j}&lt;/math&gt; is the junction depth, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the majority-carrier mobility, &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier charge, and &lt;math&gt;N(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the net impurity concentration in terms of depth. Knowing the background carrier concentration &lt;math&gt;N_\text{B}&lt;/math&gt; and the surface impurity concentration, the ''sheet resistance-junction depth'' product &lt;math&gt;R_\text{s} x_\text{j}&lt;/math&gt; can be found using Irvin's curves, which are numerical solutions to the above equation.

==Measurement==
A [[Four-terminal sensing|four-point probe]] is used to avoid contact resistance, which can often have the same magnitude as the sheet resistance.  Typically a constant [[Electric current|current]] is applied to two probes, and the potential on the other two probes is measured with a high-impedance [[voltmeter]].  A geometry factor needs to be applied according to the shape of the four-point array. Two common arrays are square and in-line. For more details see [[Van der Pauw method]].

Measurement may also be made by applying high-conductivity bus bars to opposite edges of a square (or rectangular) sample. Resistance across a square area will be measured in Ω/sq. For a rectangle an appropriate geometric factor is added. Bus bars must make [[ohmic contact]].

Inductive measurement is used as well. This method measures the shielding effect created by [[eddy currents]]. In one version of this technique a conductive sheet under test is placed between two coils. This non-contact sheet resistance measurement method also allows to characterize encapsulated thin-films or films with rough surfaces.&lt;ref name="Sheet Resistance Measurement"&gt;[http://www.sheet-resistance-measurement.com/ Overview on non-contact eddy current sheet resistance measurement techniques and benefits], retrieved 22 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
A very crude two-point probe method is to measure resistance with the probes close together and the resistance with the probes far apart. The difference between these two resistances will be of the order of magnitude of the sheet resistance.

==Typical applications==
Sheet resistance measurements are very common to characterize the uniformity of conductive or semiconductive coatings and materials, e.g. for quality assurance. Typical applications include the inline process control of metal, TCO, conductive nanomaterials or other coatings on architectural glass, wafers, flat panel displays, polymer foils, OLED, ceramics, etc.
The contacting four-point probe is often applied for single-point measurements of hard or coarse materials. Non-contact eddy current systems are applied for sensitive or encapsulated coatings, for inline measurements and for high-resolution mapping.

[[File:Solaroad7.JPG|thumb|SolaRoad]]

The '''SolaRoad''' is the world's first [[bike path]] made from [[solar panels]], and is a prototype project testing the feasibility of various proposals for [[smart highways]]. The {{convert|72|m|ft|adj=on}} path opened in the week of 21 October 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.solaroad.nl/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/PressReleaseSolaRoadOpened_21Oct.pdf|format= PDF |title= SolaRoad opens: The first road in the world that converts sunlight into electricity is ready for use |date= 21 October 2014 |publisher= SolaRoad |first1= Sten |last1= de Wit |first2= Soraya Rosa |last2= Saenz |first3= Jannemieke |last3= van Dieren}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed by a consortium of organizations, which built the pathway in [[Krommenie]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spakovskis|first1=Robert|title=SolaRoad: World's first solar cycle path to open in the Netherlands|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-11-solaroad-world-solar-path-netherlands.html|website=Phys.org|date=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mlot|first1=Stephanie|title=The Netherlands Preps World's First Solar Road|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2471920,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The path was formally opened in November 2014 by the Dutch Minister of Energy [[Henk Kamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solaroad.nl/|title=Unieke innovatie|work=SolaRoad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consortium==
The technology was developed by a consortium consisting of [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]] (TNO), [[Imtech]] (Dynniq) and [[Ooms Civiel]], with a grant of €1.5{{nbsp}}million from the province (county) [[North Holland]] as owner of the path. The total cost of the pilot project was €3.5{{nbsp}}million. In addition to the €1.5{{nbsp}}million from the province North Holland were that contributions from TNO, Ooms Civil, Imtech (Dynniq) and the European PV-Sin project (partly subsidized by the Dutch government).&lt;ref name=TNO&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tno.nl/nl/aandachtsgebieden/energie/sustainable-energy/smart-energy-system-solutions/solaroad-combineert-weg-met-zonnepaneel/|title=SolaRoad combineert weg met zonnepaneel|work=TNO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deorkaan.nl/provincie-stak-ruim-e-15-miljoen-in-solaroad/|title=Provincie stak ruim € 1,5 miljoen in Solaroad|date=15 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
The road surface consists of prefabricated panels with a surface of {{convert|1|cm|in}} thick hardened glass. Beneath the glass solar cells are installed. TNO states that this energy can be used for lighting of the road, traffic lights and road signs. The energy is also delivered to local dwellings. TNO thinks in future electrical vehicles might be driven by the road itself.&lt;ref name=TNO /&gt; This prototype will be studied over the next three years.

In the first month, the path delivered enough energy to sustain one family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cobouw.nl/nieuws/algemeen/2014/12/30/solaroad-stukgevroren|title=Cobouw|website=www.cobouw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems and critics==
On 26 December 2014, a {{convert|1|m2|sqft|adj=on}} section of the top-layer coating detached from the glass layer, and that portion of the bike path had to be repaired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zonnecellen-fietspad SolaRoad beschadigd|url=http://www.biojournaal.nl/artikel/17763/Zonnecellen-fietspad-SolaRoad-beschadigd|language=Dutch|date=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 the top-layer coating was in such poor condition that it was replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deorkaan.nl/solaroad-totaal-gerenoveerd/|title=SolaRoad fietspad niet bestand tegen Hollands weer|date=6 November 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The panels might get dirty, because they are lying flat. Mud, snow, etc. might accumulate on the surface.
*The panels cannot be tilted for highest efficiency, which can be done in a roof installation.
*Cyclists will block the sunlight when passing.
*The costs are considered high (3–4 times solar panels on a roof and a conventional pavement layer; about $1000–1400 per {{convert|1|m2|sqft|adj=on}})($90–125 sq{{nbsp}}ft). This will result in a payback time of over 50 years. 
*With a price of $1,200 per sqm, a yield of 70 kWh per sqm / year and a lifetime of 20 years a kWh price of $0.86 can be calculated. Compared to an offshore windfarm the cost are 4x higher (average kWh price $0.19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritiemnederland.com/techniek-innovatie/windenergie-op-zee-worstelt-met-hoge-kosten/item1513|title=Windenergie op zee worstelt met hoge kosten|first=Insyde|last=Webdesign|website=www.maritiemnederland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;). As comparison conventional electricity costs are around $0.05 per kWh. 
*High costs for grid connection, which has to be (over) dimensioned for peak loads only in the summer.
*Total environmental impact during the lifetime (LCA) is expected to be negative, because of the negative contribution of the reinforced concrete slabs and the epoxy top coating layer in combination with the relatively small amount of produced electricity.
*SolaRoad could put environmental progress in the slow lane, because of the high costs of this invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equities.com/news/france-s-solar-roads-plan-a-costly-inefficient-boondoggle|title=France's Solar Roads Plan a Costly, Inefficient Boondoggle|first=|last=equities.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results of trial==
After a six-month test engineers report results are "better than expected".&lt;ref name=scialert&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencealert.com/solar-roads-in-the-netherlands-are-working-even-better-than-expected | title=Solar roads in the Netherlands are working even better than expected |date=11 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "If we translate this to an annual yield, we expect more than the 70kWh per square metre per year," Sten de Wit, spokesman for SolaRoad, the company that put it in.&lt;ref name=aljaz&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch solar road makes enough energy to power household |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/05/150510092535171.html| date=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[David L. Jones (electronics engineer)|EEVblog]] compared the 6 and 12 months trial results from SolaRoad with data from 3 rooftop solar systems within a few kilometers of the prototype road. The data showed that rooftop solar systems produced twice the output of the SolaRoad per square meter over the same period.&lt;ref name=eevblog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eevblog.com/2015/05/13/eevblog-743-solar-roadways-test-results/ | title=EEVblog #743 – Solar Roadways Test Results |date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eevblog.com/2016/02/14/eevblog-850-french-wattway-solar-roadways-busted/|title=EEVblog #850 – French Wattway Solar Roadways BUSTED|first=|last=EEVblog|website=EEVblog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015 it was announced that the path had produced 9800 kWh of electricity in one year.

In October 2016, the path was expanded with 7 new improved elements. Two elements of the first generation were removed. In total the expanded path consist of 32 elements (83 meters).

In February 2017, a crack appeared in the top coating of one of the improved elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solaroad.nl/faq/#collapse-949|title=FAQ – SolaRoad|website=www.solaroad.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An innovative cycle lane in South Korea has a solar powered roof, providing shelter from sun and rain for cyclists while generating electricity. In this concept the solar panels are directed in the most profitable position for optimal efficiency. 
The 32&amp;nbsp;km (20 mile) path between Daejeon and Sejong runs down the middle of a six-lane motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://road.cc/content/news/148063-south-korean-solar-powered-bike-lane-whizzes-cyclists-along-six-lane-motorway|title=South Korean solar powered bike lane whizzes cyclists along a six lane motorway|date=12 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parking under a solar panel roof is an efficient way to produce electricity in combination with infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvhn.nl/drenthe/Parkeren-onder-zonnepanelen-bij-TT-Circuit-21255430.html|title=Cookiemelding - DVHN.nl|website=www.dvhn.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another economically viable solution for harvesting energy from roads is Road Energy Systems (RES). This system is based on solar water heating and could easily be placed in a road without changing its appearance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.materialedge.co.uk/docs/Energy%20from%20Asphalt%20paper%2020%2011%2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6858">The '''Stevenson Plan''', also known as the '''Stevenson Restriction Scheme''', was an effort by the [[United Kingdom|British]] government to stabilize low rubber prices resulting from a glut of rubber following [[World War I]].

==Background==
In the early 1900s, increased reliance on the automobile and the use of rubber in common products such as boots were driving demand for rubber. At that time [[rubber]] was made from naturally occurring [[latex]] extracted from certain plants. The most important of the plants for latex production is the rubber tree, ''[[Hevea brasiliensis]]'' whose cultivation is restricted to [[tropical climates]]. At this time about 75% of rubber was controlled by British corporations, spurring efforts in [[Russia]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]] to reduce dependence on British rubber. All three countries were trying to develop methods of manufacturing synthetic rubber, and the [[United States Rubber Company]] began producing natural rubber in [[Sumatra]] in 1910. However, synthetic rubber was not yet practical, and natural rubber sources develop rather slowly (rubber trees must grow for six or seven years before they are productive).

Between 1914 and 1922, natural rubber prices fluctuated between $0.115 and $1.02 per pound for several reasons. One reason is a blight that affected rubber trees in [[Brazil]] that reduced productivity and caused British and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rubber producers to start new plantations in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. 

A second reason was that after the 1917 [[October Revolution]], Russia renewed its effort to make synthetic rubber as part of two projects: 1) [[Project Bogatyr]] in which rubber is made from [[ethyl alcohol]], and 2) [[Project Treugolnik]] in which the feedstock is petroleum. These projects succeeded in reducing Russian demand for British rubber.

A third reason is that during [[World War I]] (1914-1918), demand for rubber was high resulting in new sources of rubber being developed. Following the War, demand for rubber diminished, creating a glut of rubber on the market and very low prices. The world became keenly aware of the importance of a stable supply of rubber for containing and initiating a modern war.

== The plan ==
Around 1920 the [[British Rubber Growers Association]] turned to then [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Winston Churchill]], for help. Churchill initiated a [[committee of inquiry]], the Rubber Investigation Committee, consisting primarily of Association members and chaired by [[James Stevenson, 1st Baron Stevenson|Sir James Stevenson]], to come up a plan to stabilize rubber prices. The committee came up with the Stevenson Plan which would stabilize prices by limiting the tonnage of rubber exported.  The plan was enacted by the governments of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] and [[British Malaya]].  The [[Federal Legislative Council]] of the [[Federated Malay States]] passed the ''Export of Rubber (Restriction) Enactment'' in October 1922, to take effect on November 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=An Historical Geography of Pahang
|author=Garth Cant
|year=1972
|quote=the Federated Malay States passed the Export of Rubber (Restriction) Enactment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The outcome==
In 1922, British interests controlled about 75% of rubber production and the  United States consumed about 75% of the rubber produced. The British were still paying [[war debt]] to the United States following [[World War I]], and needed to have a profitable rubber industry. The Dutch refused to go along with the plan out of a philosophical reluctance to regulate their industry and because they would profit from a unilateral action by the British. In the United States tiremaker [[Harvey Firestone]] reacted angrily to the act as did Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]].

By 1925 high prices resulting from the Stevenson Act were beginning to threaten the "American way of life", so Hoover informed the British that if the Stevenson Plan stayed in effect, the United States would try to protect itself in any way it could. [[DuPont]], under the direction of [[Elmer Keiser Bolton]] had been working on synthetic rubber since 1920. Thomas Edison, along with several tire companies, was trying to create American-based rubber production, but with little success. By 1928, the Stevenson Act was repealed, but not after expanding Dutch rubber plantations had successfully captured most of the rubber market in the United States.

==Conclusion==
Tired of regulation, rubber producers returned control of rubber prices to the free market. That worked well until the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s lowered demand for rubber, and again rubber prices plunged. Rubber producers once again turned to regulation to maintain prices.  This time it was done under the auspices of the [[International Rubber Regulation Agreement]] which was signed by all major rubber producing countries. This law succeeded in governing the price of rubber to the satisfaction of producers and most consumers. However, [[Japan]] was a consumer of rubber in the 1930s, using rubber to support its war effort in [[Manchuria]] and [[China]], and its leaders were not happy with the price of rubber. This was one of the provocations said to motivate the Japanese to the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and the United States entry into [[World War II]].

[[File:Linbo3 Unit Cell.png|thumb|Lithium niobate is a famous ternary phase.  It features three elements: Li, Nb, and O.]]
In [[materials chemistry]], a '''ternary phase''' is [[chemical compound]] containing three different elements. Some ternary phases compounds are molecular, e.g. [[chloroform]] (HCCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). More typically ternary phases refer to extended solids.  Famous example are the [[perovskite]]s.&lt;ref name=earnshaw&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary phases with only two elements, have lower degrees of complexity than ternary phases.  With four elements [[quaternary phase]]s are more complex.

'''The Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment''' (RAINEX) is a project to improve [[hurricane]] intensity forecasting via measuring interactions between [[rainband]]s and the [[eyewall]]s of [[tropical cyclone]]s. The experiment was planned for the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]]. This coincidence of RAINEX with the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season led to the study and exploration of infamous hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Ophelia (2017)|Ophelia]], and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]]. Where [[Hurricane Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Houze, R. A., Chen, S. S., Lee, W. C., Rogers, R. F., Moore, J. A., Strossmeister, G. J., … Brodzik, S.

Hurricane Ophelia provided an interesting contrast to these powerful cyclones as it never developed greater than a category 1. 
The RAINEX project was a collaboration between the [[University of Miami]] (UM), [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]] (RSMAS), The [[University of Washington]], Department of Atmospheric Sciences, The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and the [[US Navy]], [[Office of Naval Research]]. 
The objective of the research was to study the mechanism by which hurricane [[eyewall replacement cycle]] occurs. Luckily for the sake of the research, one such case of eyewall replacement occurred during the study of [[Hurricane Rita]]. In tropical cyclones maximum wind speed of the storm, which occurs at the eyewall, is a primary indicator of its overall strength which is important in predicting overall intensity. Just beyond this eyewall is a moat which separates the inner rainbands (eventually the outer eyewall) from the (inner) eyewall. Better understanding the dynamics of this region before, and during eyewall replacement could aid in better intensity predictions.

==Background==
RAINEX’ main purpose was to accomplish this task via studying the fluctuations of storm intensity as they are influenced by interactions between the eye, eyewalls, and rainbands of a tropical cyclone. Previously, tropical cyclone intensity forecasting was heavily based on [[sea surface temperature]] and [[upper-atmosphere dynamics]]. These factors are useful in predicting the maximum potential of a tropical cyclone. However, since the intensity of a storm undergoes large daily fluctuations, the maximum possible intensity of a cyclone is usually not reached.

===Hurricane Structure===
[[File:Eyewall smull.png|thumb|right|The structure of Hurricane Rita as seen by ELDORA radar]]
Most hurricanes exhibit a definitive eyewall and spiral rainbands outside of the eye. These spiral rainbands were known to be complex structures that possess deep convective cores enmeshed in low altitude precipitative clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Houze, R. a, Chen, S. S., Smull, B. F., Lee, W.-C., &amp; Bell, M. M. |date = 2007 |url = http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1135650 |title = Hurricane intensity and eyewall replacement |journal = Science |location = New York, N.Y. |volume = 315 |issue = 5816 |pages = 1235–1239 |doi = 10.1126/science.1135650
|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1235H |pmid=17332404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eye or core of a tropical cyclone is characterized by low pressure which causes warm air to spiral upward and rise into the [[atmosphere]]. A tropical cyclone usually develops a distinct eye when the maximum sustained winds of the storm reach and exceed 74&amp;nbsp;mph. A well-formed eye is a good indicator of overall intensity due to an increase in [[rotational velocity]] when the distance between the moving particles and the center of the vortex is decreased. The [[angular momentum]] associated with the tropical cyclone can explain this phenomenon.

[[Angular momentum]] of a particle with mass, m with respect to the origin, ''r'', can be given by

''L = mvr(sin(θ))''

When ''r'' is decreased (the distance between the moving particle and the center of the vortex), the mass of this particle, ''m'' remains the same and the angular momentum, ''L'' is conserved. Therefore, the rotational velocity of the particle must increase. In tropical cyclones, when the eye contracts, wind speed increases. 
Another example of this intensification can be seen in [[figure skating]]. When a spinning figure skater pulls his/her arms in to their chest while spinning the distance between the skaters hands and his/her angular momentum is conserved but his/her rotational velocity, ''v'' increases.

==Experimental Design==
Three [[P-3 Orion]] aircraft were deployed during 13 flights into Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Ophelia. Two of the [[WP-3D]] aircraft were owned and operated by NOAA and were named N42 and N43. The P-3 N42 was equipped with a fore and aft fixed flat-plate antenna which served as a dual-beam [[Weather radar#Velocity|Doppler weather radar]]. The P-3, N43 was equipped with one single-parabolic antenna which was able to operate as a dual-Doppler radar by alternating scanning direction (once again between fore and aft). These NOAA aircraft were able to attain 1.5&amp;nbsp;km horizontal resolution. The third P-3, NRL, was equipped with an ELDORA (Electra Doppler radar) and was the first ELDORA used in the imaging of tropical cyclones. In addition to the radars, each aircraft was equipped with a large quantity of dropsondes to be deployed every 5–10 minutes (about 30–65&amp;nbsp;km on flight path). During Hurricane Katrina, 302 dropsondes were deployed, during Ophelia 462, and Rita 503. A detailed description of dropsonde specifications can be found in Hock and Franklin 1999. The aircraft transmitted all of the information collected by these instruments to the RAINEX operations center (ROC) at RSMAS during flight in order for the ground team to forecast the development of the tropical cyclone while flight crews were in the air and afterward.

===Equipment===
The experiment entailed a high-resolution numerical model of the internal structure of the [[vortex]] and collection of data by three [[P3 Orion]] aircraft equipped with dual beam Electra [[Doppler weather radar]] and intensive [[dropsonde]] coverage.  These aircraft were based at the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at [[MacDill Air Force Base]] in Tampa, Florida.&lt;ref name="washington post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Jack|title=2005: A terrible year for hurricanes, a great year for research|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/10/13/2005-a-terrible-year-for-hurricanes-a-great-year-for-research/|accessdate=9 May 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=13 October 2015|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; All flights were controlled from the RAINEX operations center (ROC) at the [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science]] (RSMAS) at the [[University of Miami]] (UM). Postanalysis was to include high-resolution model simulations of the data collected in flight at the RSMAS atmosphere-wave-ocean modeling system.

[[File:NOAA 2P3pics.jpg|thumb|Two NOAA P-3 aircraft equipped with Doppler radar]]

===Project Communications===
As data was collected in the field, satellite communications relayed the information from aircraft to the RAINEX Operations Center at RSMAS. In order to determine which days were suitable for flight, [[principal investigator]]s, forecasters, pilots, and facility engineering staff held a daily conference call originating from the RSMAS center in [[Miami, Florida]]. Based on the forecast of evolution of the tropical cyclone throughout the proposed time of flight, principal investigators would develop a plan of flight for the day. Flight patterns typically followed one of two plans accepting special cases. Plan A was usually selected when aircraft were to arrive during a time without eyewall replacement. Plan B was employed when eyewall replacement was expected to occur during flight. For instance, during flight into Hurricane Rita a second eyewall was forming and Plan B was executed.

==Notable Hurricanes==
[[File:Hurricane Katrina Eye viewed from Hurricane Hunter.jpg|thumb|left|View from P-3 aircraft from inside the eyewall of Hurricane Katrina]]

===Hurricane Katrina===
Because RAINEX was planned in advance of the 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season, it did fly in to [[Hurricane Katrina]] among other storms. Hurricane Katrina followed a very similar track to a later storm in this season (Hurricane Rita); however, Katrina did not undergo eyewall replacement during its time in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. RAINEX flights into Hurricane Katrina occurred on August 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, 2005. These flights followed the storm through its development from a tropical cyclone into a Category 5 hurricane.

===Hurricane Ophelia===
[[Hurricane Ophelia (2005)|Hurricane Ophelia]] was an interesting storm to document due to its long duration and considerable fluctuations in strength throughout its existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Houze, Robert A., Lee, Wen-Chau, and Bell, Michael M. |year = 2009 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009MWR2727.1|title = Convective Contribution to the Genesis of Hurricane Ophelia. |journal = Monthly Weather Review |volume = 137 |issue = 9 |pages = 2778–2800|doi = 10.1175/2009MWR2727.1 |bibcode = 2009MWRv..137.2778H }}&lt;/ref&gt; RAINEX flights into Hurricane Ophelia occurred on September 6, 9, and 11, 2005.

===Hurricane Rita===
[[Hurricane Rita]] was not a welcome sight in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] following the devastating Katrina. Hurricane Rita underwent eyewall replacement while in the Gulf of Mexico where the storm went from a category 5 on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale]] to a category 3 storm by landfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Judt, F., &amp; Chen, S. S. |year = 2010 |url = http://doi.org/10.1175/2010JAS3471.1 |title = Convectively Generated Potential Vorticity in Rainbands and Formation of the Secondary Eyewall in Hurricane Rita of 2005. |journal = Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume = 67 |issue = 11 |pages = 3581–3599|bibcode = 2010JAtS...67.3581J |doi = 10.1175/2010JAS3471.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RAINEX flights into Hurricane Rita occurred on September 20, 21, 22, and 23, 2005. These flights observed the rapid development of Hurricane Rita from a Category 1 hurricane into a Category 5 and eventually through its eyewall replacement cycle and weakening.

The '''Solar Car Challenge''' is an annual [[Solar car racing|solar-powered car race]] for [[high school]] students.The event attracts teams from around the world, but mostly from American high schools. The race was first held in 1995. Each event is the end product of a two-year education cycle launched by the Winston Solar Car Team. On odd-numbered years, the race is a road course that starts at the [[Texas Motor Speedway]], [[Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]; the end of the course varies from year to year. On even-numbered years, the race is a track race around the [[Texas Motor Speedway]]. [[Dell]] sponsored the event from 2002-2008. [[Hunt Oil Company]] sponsored the 2010 race.

|accessdate=2007-08-06
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Race==
In 1993, the Solar Car Team launched an education program to teach high school students how to build and safely race roadworthy solar cars.  The Solar Education Program met this objective, and worked to provide curriculum materials, on-site visits, and workshop opportunities for high schools across the country.  This program was designed to motivate students in the sciences, engineering, and technology.  The end product of each two-year education cycle is the Solar Car Challenge: a closed-track event at the world famous Texas Motor Speedway, or a cross country race designed to give students an opportunity to display their work.

==Goal of The Solar Challenge==
The Solar Car Challenge is designed to motivate students into science, engineering, technology, and green energy engineering. The participants not only learn about importance of science to effectively have their car go a farther distance, but also learn the importance of teamwork, where teams work harmoniously with one another to do well in this challenge.

The participants in this race like to think of this as a challenge, rather than a competition, because this race focuses more detail in partnership and unity. This is how the idea of "The Spirit of Solar Car Racing" derived from, establishing an award known as the Marx Award (a prestigious award given to a single team member every year).

==Race Objective==
Teams experience the fun of the Solar Car Challenge at the world famous Texas Motor Speedway.  Car breakdowns, weather, and team experience limit the number of laps a team can drive each day.  The team driving the most laps accumulated over the four days of racing will be declared the winner.

==Solar Car Categories==
The purpose of the Solar Car Challenge is to provide a level playing-field for high school solar car teams.  Newer teams generally enter the Classic Division which requires participants to use less expensive conventional motors, lead acid batteries, and less efficient solar cells.  Older teams enter the Open Division based on their use of more expensive technology.  The new Advanced Division allows teams to use university body molds and more exotic batteries.

==Admission into the Race==
Teams seeking admission to the event must register their vehicle and demonstrate that their solar car complies with all the rules during a qualifying process known as “Scrutineering.”  In cross-country races, teams are licensed in Texas as experimental vehicles, and carry liability insurance.

==Safety &amp; Supervision==
Each car must have a roll cage, “crush zones,” safety harness, horn, communications, turn signals, and a fire extinguisher.  Chase vehicles and trailers are available for support in the event of a breakdown on the track.  All aspects of the Solar Car Challenge Rules are closely monitored.  A wireless computer network helps race officials closely monitor the individual cars.

'''Thorcon''' is a company that is designing the ThorCon Reactor, a [[small modular reactor]] (SMR) that employs [[molten salt reactor|molten salt]] technology, based on the [[Denatured molten salt reactor|DMSR]] design from [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ThorCon Power|url=http://www.thorconpower.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It relies on large modules as are used in modern ship building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=modern shipbuilding techniques|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipbuilding#Modern_shipbuilding_manufacturing_techniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ThorCon reactor is a "burner" reactor that employs liquid fuel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=liquid fuel|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel#Liquid_fuels}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a conventional solid fuel; this liquid contains the [[nuclear fuel]] and also serves as primary [[coolant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas J. |first1=Dolan |title=Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy|date=2017 |publisher=Woodhead Publishing |location=Cambridge, MA, USA |isbn=978-0-08-101126-3 |pages=557–564 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In December 2015, Thorcon signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] with three Indonesian companies to develop its molten salt reactor technology in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itheo.org/articles/indonesia-and-thorcon-develop-thorium-msr|title=Indonesia and ThorCon to Develop Thorium MSR|website=International Thorium Energy Organization|accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study included ThorCon and seven other designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.innovationreform.org/2017/07/01/will-advanced-nuclear-power-plants-cost/|title=What Will Advanced Nuclear Plants Cost?|author=EIRP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusion: "If power plants featuring these technologies are able to produce electricity at the average LCOE price projected here (much less the low-end estimate), it would have a significant impact on electricity markets."

In April 2018, the [[United States Department of Energy]] awarded Thorcon $400,000 as a GAIN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gain.inl.gov/SiteAssets/2018VoucherAbstracts/2018GAINVoucherRecipients-1stRound30Apr2018.pdf|title=GAIN Voucher Recipients 1st Round - 30 Apr 2018|author=DOE}}&lt;/ref&gt; research project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gain.inl.gov/SiteAssets/2018VoucherAbstracts/RFA-18-15820_ThorCon.pdf|title=Electroanalytical Sensors for Liquid Fueled Fluoride Molten Salt Reactor|author=DOE}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be conducted jointly by ThorCon USA Inc and [[Argonne National Laboratory]].

==Design==
ThorCon uses modular shipbuilding production processes. except the blocks are barged to the site and dropped into place. Thorcon plans to build its reactors in shipyards, It reauires as much steel as a medium size, 125,000 dwt [[Suezmax]] tanker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/08/china-and-russia-looking-at-27-floating-nuclear-reactors-but-thorcon-and-indonesia-could-scale-to-100-per-year.html|title=China and Russia looking at 27 floating nuclear reactors but ThorCon and Indonesia could scale to 100 per year|last=Wang|first=Brian|date=August 27, 2018|website=www.nextbigfuture.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor consists of two main components, steam/electrical and nuclear. The steam/electrical component features the same design and cost ($700/kw) of a 500 MWe coal plant. A 1 GWe nuclear component requires less than 400 tons of supercritical alloys and other exotic materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/08/china-and-russia-looking-at-27-floating-nuclear-reactors-but-thorcon-and-indonesia-could-scale-to-100-per-year.html|title=China and Russia looking at 27 floating nuclear reactors but ThorCon and Indonesia could scale to 100 per year|last=Wang|first=Brian|date=|website=www.nextbigfuture.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reactor operates at near-ambient pressure, reducing steel requirements by 50% and concrete requirements by 80% versus a conventional reactor. Little of the [[concrete]] must be [[Reinforced concrete|reinforced]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Passive cooling is needed only in the event of overheating, which first stops the reaction, and then triggers freeze valves to drain the reactor.  Fluoride salt reacts with hazardous fission products [[iodine-131]], [[Caesium-137|cesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], preventing their release. Each reactor unit operates for four years, cools for four years, and then is replaced. All recycling occurs offsite. Each power module has two siloed reactor units generating 557 MW (thermal) yielding 250 MW (electric).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2018/08/global-race-for-transformative-molten-salt-nuclear-includes-bill-gates-and-china.html|title=Global race for transformative molten salt nuclear includes Bill Gates and China|last=Wang|first=Brian|date=August 26, 2018|website=www.nextbigfuture.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuel ==
In addition to (low cost) thorium, a 1 GWe reactor initially requires 3,156 kg of 20% [[Enriched uranium|low enriched uranium]] along with 11 kg per day of operation. Every 8 years the fuel must be changed out. At a [[yellowcake]] cost of $66/kg, a $7.50 [[Uranium hexafluoride|{{Chem|UF|6}}]] conversion cost and $90 per [[Separative Work Unit|separative work unit]], the levelized fuel cost is 0.53 cents per kilowatt-hour.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Waste product ==
Every 8 years 160 tons of spent fuel travel to the recycling facility, consisting of about 75% thorium, with 95% of the balance uranium. Without separation (other than removing the salt), the total fuel waste stream averages about 2 m&lt;sup&gt;3/yr&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Greenhouse gases==
No greenhouse gases are produced by ThorCon reactors because heat is produced by [[nuclear fission]] rather than [[combustion]].[[File:Thorcon block assembly progression.gif|thumb|Image sequence of the block assembly progression]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21126">[[File:Bridge Creek, OK tornado 1999-05-03.png|right|thumb|300px|Large, violent tornadoes can cause catastrophic damage when striking populated areas.]]
A '''tornado emergency''' is an enhanced version of a [[tornado warning]], which is used by the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) in the [[United States]] during significant [[tornado]] occurrences in highly populated areas. Although it is not a new warning type from the NWS, issued instead within a severe weather statement (or in rare cases, in the initial tornado warning), a tornado emergency generally means that significant, widespread damage is expected to occur and a high likelihood of numerous fatalities is expected with a large, strong to violent tornado.&lt;ref name="DMX media advisory"&gt;{{cite web | title = Tornado Emergency Media Advisory  | publisher = NWS - [[Des Moines, Iowa]]  | date = March 12, 2010  | url = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/dmx/Media%20Advisory%202010-01.pdf  | accessdate = 2010-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These enhanced warnings are intended to convey the urgency of the weather situation to the general public, who are advised to take safety precautions immediately if they are in or near the projected path of a large tornado or its accompanying thunderstorm; tornado emergencies are usually identified following the preceding storm summary in the tornado warning product, which itself will denote visual or radar confirmation of "a large and extremely dangerous [or destructive] tornado" that is ongoing; precautionary action statements in the product also recommend that people in the storm's path find shelter in an underground shelter or [[safe room]] to protect themselves from the storm, if available. 

While many tornadoes observed to be at or larger than ¼-mile in width have been documented to have produced catastrophic damage falling under the "strong" or "violent" categories (EF2-EF5) of the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]], there have been instances in which tornadoes of this have resulted in very few to no fatalities and, occasionally, have produced damage corresponding to the Fujita Scale's "weak" category (EF0-EF1).

== History ==

=== First use ===
The term was first used during the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak|May 3, 1999 tornado outbreak]] that spawned [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado|an F5 tornado]] which struck the municipalities of [[Bridge Creek, Oklahoma|Bridge Creek]] and [[Moore, Oklahoma|Moore]], located just south of [[Oklahoma City]], followed by southern and eastern parts of the city itself, [[Del City, Oklahoma|Del City]], and [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]]. On that day, between 5:30 and 6:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., David Andra, the Science and Operations Officer at the [[National Weather Service]] [[National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma|Weather Forecast Office]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] watched as the large, destructive tornado approached Oklahoma City. This led to the issuance of the first tornado emergency, which in this instance was released as a standalone weather statement issued separately from the original tornado warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tornado emergency in south oklahoma city metro area |publisher=NWS - [[Norman, Oklahoma]] |date=May 3, 1999 |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/storms/19990503/svsokc.txt |accessdate=2007-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213230526/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/storms/19990503/svsokc.txt |archivedate=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;''"As the large tornado approached western sections of the OKC metro area, we asked ourselves more than once, 'Are we doing all we can do to provide the best warnings and information?' It became apparent that unique and eye-catching phrases needed to be included in the products. At one point we used the phrase 'Tornado Emergency' to paint the picture that a rare and deadly tornado was imminent in the metro area. We hoped that such dire phrases would prompt action from anyone that still had any questions about what was about to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | title = May 3rd, 1999 from the NWS's Perspective | journal = The Southern Plains Cyclone  |date=Spring 2004  | volume = 2  | issue = 2  | publisher = National Weather Service  | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/newsletter/spring2004  | accessdate = 2008-02-15  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041108065124/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/oun/newsletter/spring2004/#19990503 | archivedate = 2004-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolved usage===
At 3:01&amp;nbsp;p.m. CDT on [[2013 Moore tornado|May 20, 2013]], this bulletin was issued by the National Weather Service Norman forecast office confirming that a destructive tornado was on the ground and headed for Moore and southern portions of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Note the differences between this bulletin and the first-ever bulletin from 1999. It should also be noted that this was issued during an updated [[tornado warning]] and not in a follow-up [[Severe weather terminology (United States)|severe weather statement]]. The Moore disaster did claim many lives, but this emergency prevented many more fatalities. The type of tornado, EF5, is a very deadly type, thus this bulletin was issued, with the [[particularly dangerous situation]] phrase intended.

===Standardization and recent usage ===
After the original usage for the [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado|May 3, 1999 F5 tornado]], the term Tornado Emergency was used by other National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs), although no uniform criteria existed and the issuance was entirely at the discretion of the forecaster issuing the warnings. Usage of the term varied from simply confirmed tornadoes in populated areas to significant, rare tornadoes causing severe damage and injuries. Some NWS forecast offices, such as the one serving the [[Des Moines, Iowa]] metropolitan area, have created standardized criteria and purpose for the usages of the heightened wording. Because data about the tornado and its exact path are often ascertained after the initial tornado warning is issued, this designation is usually added to the Severe Weather Statement ([[Specific Area Message Encoding|SAME]] code: SVS) that is used to follow up a tornado warning.

On April 2, 2012, the National Weather Service began an experimental program within its [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]/[[Pleasant Hill, Missouri|Pleasant Hill]] offices in Kansas and Missouri called Impact Based Warning, which allows the respective offices to enhance warning information, such as adding tags to the warning messages which signify the potential damage severity. In regards to tornadoes, the creation of this multi-tiered system resulted in the implementation of an intermediate tornado warning product, a [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]] Tornado Warning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/crh/IBW/Resources/IBW1pager.pdf |title=Impact Based Warning Experimental Product |accessdate=2012-04-04 |author= |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher=National Weather Service |pages= |language= |doi= |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116133101/http://www.crh.noaa.gov/images/crh/IBW/Resources/IBW1pager.pdf |archivedate=January 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Draper |coauthors= |title='UNSURVIVABLE!'

News]] and the [[Associated Press]] |publisher= |date=2012-04-01 |accessdate=2012-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 1, 2013, the IBW experiment expanded to include all National Weather Service WFOs within the Central Region;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/crh/?n=2013_ibw_info |title=Impact Based Warning Experimental Product |publisher=Crh.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IBW experiment was expanded again to include eight additional offices within the Eastern, Southern and Western Regions in the spring of 2014.&lt;ref name=IBW&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/impacts/|title=Impact Based Warnings|author=[[National Weather Service]]|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 12, 2014|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the span of eleven days, the National Weather Service WFO in Norman issued tornado emergencies for parts of the [[Oklahoma City metropolitan area]] and [[central Oklahoma]]: first on May 20, 2013 for the EF5 tornado that struck Moore and portions of southern Oklahoma City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Howell |first=George |url=http://www.kcci.com/news/national/tornado-touches-down-in-oklahoma-city-area/-/9357144/20214732/-/i8erd/-/index.html |title=Okla.

The usage of tornado emergencies to alert major population centers to the imminent threat of a catastrophic tornado impact has also led to the development of the [[flash flood warning#flash flood alerts|flash flood emergency]] which is similarly employed when severe [[flash flood]]s threaten populated areas.

==Criteria==
The National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] is one of the forecast offices to have created a set purpose and criteria for the usage of "tornado emergencies" in tornado warning products, which were made effective on March 12, 2010.&lt;ref name="DMX media advisory"/&gt; According to the Des Moines office, the purpose of the tornado emergency wording is as follows:
* To motivate and provide a sense of urgency to persons in the path of this storm to take immediate shelter in a reinforced structure that offers maximum protection from destructive winds.
* To communicate to state, local, and county officials and emergency responders that they should prepare for immediate search and rescue operations.
* To communicate the need to prepare for immediate medical emergencies, evacuation measures, and emergency sheltering.
And before usage, the following criteria must be met:
* A large and catastrophic tornado has been confirmed and will continue (a radar signature alone is not sufficient).
* The tornado will have a high impact and/or affect a highly vulnerable population (estimated to be once every 10 years for central Iowa).
* The tornado is expected to cause numerous fatalities.

The National Weather Service office in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]] also created criteria to declare a tornado emergency within a tornado warning statement effective January 1, 2011. It states, "Tornado Emergency can be inserted in the third bulletin of the initial tornado warning (TOR) or in a severe weather statement (SVS)." Before the phrase can be used:
* a confirmed large tornado (EF-3 or higher) must be going through a highly populated area such as [[Nashville metropolitan area|Metro Nashville]]
* a violent tornado with a significant damage history
* a confirmed tornado, radar shows evidence of debris
* the confirmed tornado is expected to cause significant widespread damage and loss of life.
The [[Washington, Illinois]] tornado on November 17, 2013 did not prompt a Tornado Emergency; however, it affected many people. The town of Washington is not populated enough; however, it has a population of approximately 15,000 residents. The National Weather Service in [[Lincoln, Illinois|Lincoln]] may have similar criteria, however.

==Tornado safety==
{{main|Tornado preparedness}}
It is recommended that people in the path of a large and violent tornado, whether referenced in a tornado warning or a tornado emergency, seek shelter in a [[basement]], cellar or [[safe room]], as stronger tornadoes (particularly those significant enough to warrant the inclusion of a tornado emergency declaration within a tornado warning) pose a significant risk of major injury or death for people above ground level. Those who do not have below-ground shelter are still advised to take cover in a room in the center of the home on the lowest floor, and cover themselves with some type of thick padding (such as [[mattress]]es or [[blanket]]s), to protect against falling debris in the event that the roof and ceiling collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/#Safety |title=The Online Tornado FAQ (by Roger Edwards, SPC) |publisher=Spc.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[meteorology]], '''training''' denotes repeated areas of [[rain]], typically associated with [[thunderstorm]]s, that move over the same region in a relatively short period of time.  Training thunderstorms are capable of producing excessive [[rain]]fall totals, often causing [[flash flooding]].&lt;ref name=glossary&gt;{{cite web  | title = Glossary at T

{{cite book| last = Nese| first = Jon |author2=Schwartz, Glenn |author3=Rendell, Edward G. | title = The Philadelphia Area Weather Book| publisher = [[Temple University Press]]| date = 2005| pages = 111| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mon_ivVXUY4C&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=training+train+track+cars+flooding+thunderstorms&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uNmpI-klCX&amp;sig=45U7_WX1Zl6QrTqe5DRJn8A1jRs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=U9CpScrgHpCKnge0sZ3iDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPP1,M1| isbn = 1-59213-391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
Showers and thunderstorms along thunderstorm trains usually develop in one area of stationary [[Convective instability|instability]], and are advanced along a single path by prevailing winds. Additional showers and storms can also develop when the [[gust front]] from a storm collides with warmer air outside of the storm. The same process repeats in the new storms, until overall conditions in the surrounding atmosphere become too stable for support of thunderstorm activity. Showers and storms can also develop along [[stationary fronts]], and winds move them down the front. The showers that often accompany thunderstorms are usually thunderstorms that are not completely developed.

==Hazards==

A series of storms continually moving over the same area, dumping heavy rains, can cause flash flooding.&lt;ref name=glossary/&gt; Each storm usually produces heavy rain, and after a significant amount of rain falls from the storms which have moved over the same area, flooding occurs.

==Thunderstorm training==

'''''Thunderstorm training''''' is used to refer specifically to training occurring with thunderstorms. It forms when storms tend to backbuild. This type of training can quickly cause [[flash flood]]ing, especially if the thunderstorms are strong.

A '''variable-frequency transformer''' ('''VFT''') is used to transmit [[electric power|electricity]] between two ([[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] or synchronous) [[alternating current]] [[frequency]] domains. The VFT is a relatively recent development. Most asynchronous grid inter-ties use [[high-voltage direct current]] converters, while synchronous grid inter-ties are connected by lines and "ordinary" [[electrical transformer|transformer]]s, but without the ability to control power flow between the systems.

It can be thought of as a very high power [[synchro]], or a [[rotary converter]] acting as a [[frequency changer]], which is more efficient than a [[motor–generator]] of the same rating.

==Construction and operation==
A variable-frequency transformer is a [[doubly fed electric machine]] resembling a vertical shaft [[hydroelectric]] generator with a [[three-phase power|three-phase]] wound [[rotor (electric)|rotor]], connected by [[slip ring]]s to one external power circuit. The [[stator]] is connected to the other. With no applied torque, the shaft rotates due to the difference in frequency between the networks connected to the rotor and stator. A [[direct-current]] torque motor is mounted on the same shaft; changing the direction of torque applied to the shaft changes the direction of power flow.

The variable-frequency transformer behaves as a continuously adjustable [[quadrature booster|phase-shifting transformer]]. It allows control of the power flow between two networks. Unlike power electronics solutions such as back-to-back [[high-voltage direct current|HVDC]], the variable frequency transformer does not demand harmonic filters and reactive power compensation. Limitations of the concept are the [[current-carrying capacity]] of the slip rings for the rotor winding.

==Projects==
Five small variable-frequency transformer with a total power rate of 25 MVA were in use at [[Neuhof Substation]], Bad Sachsa, Germany for coupling power grids of former East and [[West Germany]] between 1985 and 1990.

Langlois Substation in [[Québec]], [[Canada]] ({{Coord|45|17|13.76|N|74|0|56.07|W|}}) installed a 100 MW variable-frequency transformer in 2004 to connect the asynchronous grids in Québec and the [[northeastern United States]]. This was the first large scale, commercial variable frequency transformer, and was installed at [[Hydro-Québec]] Langlois substation and is located electrically near sixteen hydro generators at [[Les Cèdres, Quebec]] and thirty-six more hydro generators at [[Beauharnois, Quebec]]. The operating experience since April 2004 has demonstrated the VFT’s inherent compatibility with the nearby generators&lt;ref&gt; Marchen, P.E, Marczewski, J.J, D'Aquila, R, Hassink, P., Roedel, J.H. and Bodo, R.L. (2014). VFT – A Smart Transmission Technology That Is Compatible With the Existing and Future Grid. Power Systems Conference and Exposition, 2009, 1-7. doi:10.1109/PSCE.2009.4840083 Retrieved from https://www.academia.edu/10527124/VFT_A_Smart_Transmission_Technology_That_Is_Compatible_With_the_Existing_and_Future_Grid?auto=download&amp;campaign=weekly_digest &lt;/ref&gt;

AEP Texas installed a 100 MW VFT substation in [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], Texas, [[United States]] ({{Coord|27|34|13.64|N|99|30|34.98|W|}}) in early 2007. It connects the power systems of [[ERCOT]] (in the United States) to [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad|CFE]] (in Mexico). (See [https://web.archive.org/web/20150621212836/http://www.ettexas.com/projects/vft.asp The Laredo VFT Project].)

Smaller VFTs are used in large land-based [[wind turbine]]s, so that the turbine rotation speed can vary while connected to an [[electric power distribution]] [[electrical grid|grid]].

==Linden VFT==
[[General Electric]] installed a 3 × 100 MW VFT substation in [[Linden, New Jersey]], in the United States in 2009. It connects the power systems of [[PJM Interconnection|PJM]] &amp; New York Independent System Operator (NYISO). This installation is in parallel with three existing phase-shifting transformers to regulate synchronous power flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geenergyfinancialservices.com/press_releases/view/140 |title=GE to Offer Additional Electric Transmission Capacity from its Smart Grid Transformers at New Jersey Power Plant |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=11 Dec 2012 |website=GE Energy Financial Services Press Release |accessdate=7 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics of energy trading==
VFTs provide the technical feasibility to flow power in both directions between two grids, permitting [[electricity market|power exchanges]] that were previously impossible. Energy in a grid with lower costs can be transmitted to a grid with higher costs (higher demand), with energy trading. Power capacity is sold by providers. Transmission scheduling rights (TSRs) are auctioned by the transmission line owners.

Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) are a financial instrument used to balance energy congestion and demand costs.

[[File:Yoyo.gif|thumb|right|A demonstration, repeating just the downward move of a yo-yo.]]
A '''yo-yo''' (also spelled '''yoyo''') is a [[toy]] consisting of an [[axle]] connected to two [[cylinder|disks]], and a string looped around the axle. It has some similarities to a slender [[wikt:spool|spool]]. 

A yo-yo is played by holding the free end of the string known as the handle (by inserting one finger{{emdash}}usually the middle or index finger{{emdash}}into a [[slip knot]]) allowing [[gravity]] (or the force of a throw and gravity) to spin the yo-yo and unwind the string (similar to how a [[pullstring]] works). The player then allows the yo-yo to wind itself back to the player's hand, exploiting its spin (and the associated [[rotational energy]]). This is often called "yo-yoing". 

In the simplest play, the string is intended to be wound on the spool by hand; The yo-yo is thrown downwards, hits the end of the string, then winds up the string toward the hand, and finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. One of the most basic tricks is called the [[sleeper (yo-yo trick)|sleeper]], where the yo-yo spins at the end of the string for a noticeable amount of time before returning to the hand.

==Etymology==
The word probably comes from the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano word]] yóyo, which is a [[Cognate|cognate word]] from the [[Filipino language|Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yo-yo|title=Definition of YO-YO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Yo-yo player Antikensammlung Berlin F2549.jpg|thumb|Boy playing with a terracotta yo-yo, [[Attica|Attic]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]], c. 440 BC, [[Antikensammlung Berlin]] (F 2549)]]

[[File:Lady with a Yo-yo Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright|Lady with a yo-yo, Northern India (Rajasthan, Bundi or Kota), c. 1770 Opaque watercolor and gold on paper]]
A [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] vase painting from 440 BC shows a boy playing with a yo-yo (see right).&lt;ref name="Miller2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Stephen G.|title=Ancient Greek Athletics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Wdh6YGXOxMC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=19 March 2013|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300115291|pages=169–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek records from the period describe toys made out of wood, metal, or painted terra cotta (fired clay).&lt;ref name="Miller2004"/&gt; The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age—discs of other materials were used for actual play.

=== First yo-yo company ===
[[File:Mexican yoyos.jpg|alt=|thumb|After the yo-yo was introduced to the [[United States]], it spread to Mexico—a pile of handmade wood Mexican yo-yos is pictured]]

In 1928, [[Pedro Flores (Yo-yo manufacture)|Pedro Flores]], a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] immigrant to the United States, opened the Yo-yo Manufacturing Company in [[Santa Barbara, California]].&lt;ref name=flores&gt;{{Citation
|url=http://www.nationalyoyo.org/museum/pedroflores.htm
|title=Pedro Flores
|publisher=National Yo-Yo Museum
|accessdate=2008-02-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120172822/http://www.nationalyoyo.org/museum/pedroflores.htm |archivedate = January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business started with a dozen handmade toys; by November 1929, Flores was operating two additional factories in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Hollywood]], which altogether employed 600 workers and produced 300,000 units daily.&lt;ref name=flores /&gt;

The principal distinction between the Filipino design popularized by Flores and more primitive yo-yos is in the way the yo-yo is strung. In older (and some remaining inexpensive) yo-yo designs, the string is tied to the axle using a knot. With this technique, the yo-yo just goes back-and-forth; it returns easily, but it is impossible to make it sleep.  In Flores's design, one continuous piece of string, double the desired length, is twisted around something to produce a loop at one end which is fitted around the axle. Also termed a ''looped slip-string'', this seemingly minor modification allows for a far greater variety and sophistication of motion, thanks to increased stability and suspension of movement during free spin.

Shortly thereafter (c. 1929), an entrepreneur named [[Donald F. Duncan, Sr.|Donald F. Duncan]] recognized the potential of this new fad and purchased the Flores yo-yo Corporation and all its assets, including the Flores name, which was transferred to the new company in 1932.

In 1933 yo-yos were banned in [[Syria]], because many locals superstitiously blamed the use of them for a severe drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= YO&amp;ndash;YO BANNED IN SYRIA|url= https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/48418581|work= Barrier Miner|location= Sydney, Australia|date= 23 Jan 1933|access-date= 8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1946, the [[Duncan Toys Company]] opened a yo-yo factory in [[Luck, Wisconsin]]. The Duncan yo-yo was inducted into the [[National Toy Hall of Fame]] at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]], in 1999.

=== 1960s resurgence ===
Declining sales after the [[World War II|Second World War]] prompted Duncan to launch a comeback campaign for his trademarked "Yo-Yo" in 1962 with a series of [[television]] [[advertising|advertisements]].

In a [[trademark]] case in 1965, a federal court's appeals ruled in favor of the Royal Tops Company, determining that ''yo-yo'' had become a part of common speech and that Duncan no longer had exclusive rights to the term. As a result of the expenses incurred by this legal battle as well as other financial pressures, the Duncan family sold the company name and associated trademarks in 1968 to [[Flambeau, Inc]], who had manufactured Duncan's plastic models since 1955.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} {{as of|2014}}, Flambeau Plastics continued to run the company.

=== Rise of the ball bearing ===
[[File:Metallyoyos.jpg|thumb|left|Modern yo-yos]]
As popularity spread through the 1970s and 1980s, there were a number of innovations in yo-yo technology, primarily regarding the connection between the string and the axle. In 1979, dentist and yo-yo celebrity [[Tom Kuhn]] patented the “No Jive 3-in-1” yo-yo, creating the world's first "take-apart" yo-yo, which enabled yo-yo players to change the axle.

Swedish bearing company [[SKF]] briefly manufactured novelty yo-yos with [[ball bearings]] in 1984. In 1990, Kuhn introduced the SB-2 yo-yo that had an aluminum transaxle, making it the first successful ball-bearing yo-yo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.retroplanet.com/blog/retro-archives/classic-toys/the-yo-yo/ Classic Toys: The Yo-Yo]. Retro Planet (2009-05-12). Retrieved on 2012-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all transaxle yo-yos, ball bearings significantly reduce friction when the yo-yo is spinning, enabling longer and more complex tricks. Subsequent yo-yoers used this ability to their advantage, creating new tricks that had not been possible with fixed-axle designs.

There are many new types of ball bearings in the market which deviate from the original design and/or material of the standard [[stainless steel]] ball bearing. For example, a certain type of bearing has an inward facing curved surface, to prevent the string from rubbing on the sides of the yo-yo, which would cause unwanted friction when performing intricate string tricks. Other manufacturers replicate this with a similar inwardly curved surface, but use minor modifications. Some high-end bearings use [[ceramic composite]]s in the balls of the bearing, to reduce internal friction, again making for a smoother spinning yo-yo.

== Techniques ==
&lt;!--[[Yo-yo trick]] redirects directly here.--&gt;

=== Sleeping ===
&lt;!--[[Sleeper (yo-yo trick)]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
The sleeper is one of the most common yo-yo throws and is the basis for nearly all yo-yo throws other than [[#Looping|looping]]. Keeping a yo-yo spinning while remaining at the end of its uncoiled string is known as sleeping. While the yo-yo is in the "sleeping" state at the end of the string, one can then execute tricks like "walk the dog", "around the world", or the more complex "rock the baby".

The essence of the throw is that one throws the yo-yo with a very pronounced wrist action so that when the yo-yo reaches the end of the string it spins in place rather than rolling back up the string to the thrower's hand. Most modern yo-yos have a transaxle or [[ball bearing]] to assist this, but if it is a fixed axle yo-yo, the tension must be loose enough to allow this. The two main ways to do this are (1), allow the yo-yo to sit at the bottom of the string to unwind, or (2) perform lariat or UFO to loosen the tension. When one decides to end the "sleeping" state, one merely jerks the wrist and the yo-yo "catches" the string and rolls back up to the hand. Ball-bearing yo-yos with a "butterfly" shape, primarily used for string tricks, frequently (but not always) have low response (or are, in fact, completely unresponsive), requiring a "bind" for the yo-yo to return.

In competition, mastery of sleeping is the basis for the 1A division. Inexpensive fixed-axle yo-yos usually spin between 10–20 seconds, while expensive ball bearing yo-yos can spin about 1–4 minutes depending on the throw &lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/yo-yo-basics2.htm Yo-Yo Basics], [http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com howstuffworks.com].&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2010}}, the world record sleep times were 3:51.54 minutes for fixed-axle and 21:15.17 minutes for transaxle yo-yos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ayya.org/ American Yo-Yo Association] website.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the transaxle yo-yo sleep time record was broken by the C3YoyoDesign BTH, with a time of 30:28.30 minutes.

=== Looping ===
&lt;!--[[Looping (yo-yo)]] and [[Looping (yo-yo trick)]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
Looping is a yo-yo technique which emphasizes keeping the body of the yo-yo in constant motion, without sleeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040417/bob9.asp Science News, Week of April 17, 2004; Vol. 165, No. 16, p. 250] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420082752/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20040417/bob9.asp |date=April 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yo-yos optimized for looping have weight concentrated in their centers so they may easily rotate about the string's axis without their mass contributing to a resistance due to a gyroscopic effect.

In yo-yo competitions, looping both to the inside and outside of the hand with the yo-yo plays a strong role in the 2A division.

=== Off-string ===
In the "off-string" technique, the yo-yo's string is not tied directly to the yo-yo's axle, and the yo-yo is usually launched into the air by performing a "forward pass" to be caught again on the string.
However, some players can 'throw down' off-string yo-yos and catch it on the string just as it leaves the end of the string by pivoting the string around a finger as it unwinds, so that the yo-yo is caught on the string. This is exactly the opposite of a "forward pass", but with the same result.

Yo-yos optimized for off-string tricks have flared designs, like the butterfly shape, which makes it easier to land on the string, and often have soft rubber rings on the edges, so minimum damage is inflicted on the yo-yo, the player, or anyone who happens to be standing nearby, should a trick go wrong.

Yo-yo competitions have the 4A division for off-string tricks.

=== Freehand ===
In freehand (5A) tricks, the yo-yo's string is not tied to the player's hand, instead ending in a counterweight. The counterweight is then thrown from hand to hand and used as an additional element in the trick.

Developed in 1999 by [[Steve Brown (yo-yo player)|Steve Brown]], as of 2008 freehand is considered to be the fastest-growing style of yo-yo play. Steve Brown was awarded a patent on his freehand yo-yo system, which was assigned to Flambeau Products ([[Duncan Toys Company|Duncan's]] parent company).

In yo-yo competitions, counterweight yo-yos are emphasized in the 5A division.

== Physical mechanism ==
When the yo-yo is first released, the gravity (and the throw) give it [[translational kinetic energy]] and necessarily, since the string must unwind, much of this energy is converted into [[rotational kinetic energy]] establishing the free move of the yo-yo, and causing it to spin rapidly. As the yo-yo unwinds downwards, it also converts [[gravitational potential energy|potential energy from gravity]] to both translational and rotational kinetic energy. Because the yo-yo has significant [[Moment of inertia|rotational inertia]], it can store enough energy in its rotation to overcome gravity all the way back up to the hand.

Because the sense of spinning does not change during the whole move, the string winds up in the opposite direction upon the return of the yo-yo. If the shaft of the yo-yo is connected to the string with a loop, there may not be enough [[friction|frictional force]] to overcome the weight of the yo-yo, which is necessary to begin winding up the string. In this case, the yo-yo will continue to spin in the loop at the end of the string (= ''sleep''), just being slightly braked by the small dynamic friction, instead of returning. However, if the string is jerked slightly up, this will increase the force from the string on the shaft, thereby rising the boundary for static friction, proportional to the "weight" of the yo-yo, above the current frictional force, making it static friction, thereby forcing the rotational energy of the yo-yo to wind up the string and finish the rest of the return.

Patents have been issued to create more complicated mechanisms to allow tension control and an adjustable mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6331132}} Filed July 27, 1999; Issued December 18, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|7192330}} Filed October 29, 1999; Issued December 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
