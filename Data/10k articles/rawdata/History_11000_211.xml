The '''8th millennium BC''' spanned the years 8000 through 7001 BC. During this time, [[agriculture]] became widely practised in the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Anatolia]].

[[Pottery]] became widespread (with independent development in [[Central America]]) and [[animal husbandry]] ([[pastoralism]]) spread to [[Africa]] and [[Eurasia]].

[[World population estimates|World population]] at this time was more or less stable, at [[Mesolithic]] level reached during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], at roughly 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Noël Biraben, "Essai sur l'évolution du nombre des hommes", ''Population'' 34-1 (1979), 13-25, estimates 40 million at 5000 BC and 100 million at 1600 BC, for an average growth rate of 0.027% p.a. over the Chalcolithic to Middle Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5474">[[File:MAHOBA, U.P. - allha.preview.jpg|thumb|Veer Alha of Mahoba, U.P., India]]
'''Alha''' was a legendary general of the [[Chandela|Chandel]] king [[Paramardideva]] (also known as Parmal), who fought [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] in 1182 [[Common Era|CE]], immortalised in the ''[[Alha-Khand]]'' ballad.

== The Origin of Alha ==
Alha and [[Udal Mahoba|Udal]] were children of the Dasraj, a successful commander of the Chandel king Parmal. He belonged to the community of [[Banaphar]] Rajputs.&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel160"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alf|authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel|title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics: Draupadi among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits |year=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-34050-3|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC&amp;dq=king+dalpat+of+gwalior}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banpahar clan claimed [[Rajput]] background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cynthia Talbot |title=The Last Hindu Emperor: Prithviraj Cauhan and the Indian Past, 1200–2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3DjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 |year=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-11856-0 |page=203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Bhavishya Purana]]'', a text with several interpolated sections that cannot be reliably dated, Alha's mother, Devaki, was a member of the  [[Ahir]] caste. The Ahirs are among the "older, pastoralist tradition", his father was a Rajput of Banaphar Clan &lt;ref name=" Alf Hiltebeitel1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMFdosx0PokC |title=Rethinking India's Oral and Classical Epics: Draupadi among Rajputs, Muslims, and Dalits |publisher=University of Chicago Press |first=Alf |last=Hiltebeitel |authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel |year=2009 |pages=132-133 |isbn=978-0-226-34055-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Bhavishya Purana'' further adds that it is not only the " two brother of Banaphar Rajput's" mother who are Ahir, but their paternal grandmother from Baksar are also Ahir, who entered the family with a blessing of ''Devi chandika'' that come not from wrestling buffaloes but from her nine-year vow to the nine Durgas and hence the Ahirs were natural relatives of the family. Some of this checks out with the Elliot's Alha, where the gopalaka (Ahir) King Dalvahana is called Dalpat, King of [[Gwalior]]. he is still the two girl's father, but merely gives them to Dasraj and Bachraj when Parmal requested him.&lt;ref name="Alf Hiltebeitel1" /&gt; The Queen Malhna insists that King Parmal reward Dashraj and Bachraj with brides from within the Chandel land. King Dalpat of [[Gwalior]] volunteers his daughters Devi (Devaki, Alha's mother) and Birma. Queen Malhna welcomes Devi to [[Mahoba]] by placing the nine lakh chain (Naulakha Haar) around her neck and also gives Birma a necklace. King Parmal then gives new Banaphar families a village where they bear and raise their sons named Alha and [[Udal Mahoba|Udal]].&lt;ref name="Hiltebeitel160" /&gt;

Alha is one of the heroes of the ''Alha-Khand'' poem, popularly recited in the [[Bundelkhand]] region of India. It may be based on a work ''Mahoba Khand'' which has been published with the title ''Parmal Raso''.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

== Folklore ==
Alha is an oral epic, the story is also found in a number of medieval manuscripts of the ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'' and the ''Bhavishya Purana''. There is also a belief that the story was originally written by Jagnik, bard of Mahoba, but no manuscript has yet been found.&lt;ref name="South Asian Folklore:"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ienxrTPHzzwC&amp;pg=PA12 |title=South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka Special -Reference |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |author1=Peter J. Claus |author2=Sarah Diamond |author3=Margaret Ann Mills |year=2003 |page=12 |isbn=978-0-415-93919-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karine Schomer depicted Alha in ''South Asian Folklore'' as:
{{quote|Originating in the [[Bundelkhand]] Region. it (Alha) recounts the intertwined fates of the three principal Rajput Kingdoms of North India on the eve of Turkish conquest (late 12th century C.E.); Delhi (ruled by Prithviraj Chauhan), Kannauj (ruled by ''Jaichand Rathor''), and Mahoba (ruled by Chandel king ''Parmal''). The heroes of the epic are the brothers Alha and Udal retainers of the Rajput status with exceptional valour,  whose cause is the protection of Mahoba and defense of its honour. Called the "Mahabarata of the Kaliyuga", Alha both parallels and inverts the themes and the structures of the classical religious epic.

The (Alha) cycle consists of fifty-two episodes in which the heroes confront enemies of Mahoba or the resistant fathers of prospective brides. It ends with the great historical battle between the kingdoms of Mahoba and [[Delhi]], in which the Chandels were annihilated and the [[Chauhan]]s so weakened that they could not resist the subsequent attack of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]].&lt;ref name="South Asian Folklore:" /&gt;

'''Amnon Netzer''' ({{lang-he|אמנון נצר}}; November 1934 – February 15, 2008) was an [[Iran]]ian-born [[Israel]]i [[historian]], [[researcher]], [[professor]] and [[journalist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/home/preview.php?id=18956 Dr. Amnon Netzer, World-Renowned Iranian Jewish Scholar, Dies at 73], The Jewish Journal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFAFA/isrelIraninans/190208-AmnonNetzer Prof.Amnon Netzer would be buried in Israel], (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel - in ''Persian'')&lt;/ref&gt;
He dedicated much of his life to uncovering, analyzing, and recording the literature, culture, and 2,700-year history of [[Iran's Jewry]].

He founded [[Israel Broadcasting Authority]]'s ''Persian Service'' in 1958 and was a professor at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] until his death in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huji.ac.il/dataj/controller/ihoker/MOP-STAFF_LINK?sno=742370&amp;Save_t=Amnon%20Netzer AMNON  NETZER, PROFESSOR OF PERSIAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE], Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Amnon Netzer is perhaps the world's foremost authority on Iranian history, culture as well as Persian and Judeo-Persian languages. Born in Rasht, Iran in 1934, Netzer immigrated to Israel in 1950. By 1958 he created the daily Persian language broadcasts for the Voice of Israel radio and in 1963 graduated with degree in Middle East and International Affairs from Jerusalem Hebrew University. In 1965 Netzer received his degree from Columbia University in New York in Iranian Studies, Indo-European Languages, and Semitic Language and Literature. In 1969 he received his doctoral degrees in the same subjects from Columbia. In 1970 Netzer returned to Israel where he co-founded the Iranian Studies Department at Jerusalem Hebrew University and began his research in Iranian Jewish History and Culture. He has not only authored numerous articles about Iranian Jews in Persian, Hebrew, English, and French worldwide, but helped edit and compile "Padyavand" a comprehensive three volume book detailing various significant events in Iranian Jewish history. In 1988 Netzer was Recipient of the Distinguished Professor commendation from Jerusalem Hebrew University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=H-Judaic&amp;month=0802&amp;week=c&amp;msg=VNq3VemDR+gYmID8N/PeOA&amp;user=&amp;pw=|title=H-Net Discussion Networks -|website=h-net.msu.edu|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Asterix and the Great Crossing''''' is the twenty-second volume of the [[Asterix]] [[List of Asterix volumes|comic book series]], by [[René Goscinny]] (stories) and [[Albert Uderzo]] (illustrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asterix.com/la-collection/les-albums/la-grande-traversee/|title=La Grande Traversée - Astérix - Le site officiel|website=www.asterix.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.hachettechildrens.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9780752866475|title=René Goscinny - Asterix and the Great Crossing - Hachette Children's Group|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
[[List of Asterix characters#Unhygienix|Unhygienix]] has run out of fresh fish. Since his stock has to be transported from Lutetia (modern-day Paris), it will be some time before the next delivery. However [[List of Asterix characters#Getafix|Getafix]] says he can't wait since he needs some for his potion. Asterix and [[Obelix]] volunteer to resolve the issue by going fishing, to which end they borrow a boat from [[List of Asterix characters#Geriatrix|Geriatrix]]. After a storm, they get lost, but despite Obelix's concerns, they do not reach the [[Flat Earth|edge of the world]]; instead, following a brief encounter with the pirates, they arrive on an island (which the reader surmises is [[Manhattan Island]]) with delicious birds that the Gauls call "gobblers" ([[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]]), [[bear]]s and "[[Roman legion|Romans]]" with strange facial paintings ([[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]).

Soon they earn the "Romans"' affection, but they decide to leave after the "[[centurion]]" chooses Obelix as his rather [[rubenesque]] daughter's fiancé. They go to a small island (which the reader surmises is [[Liberty Island]]). Seeing a boat coming, Asterix climbs a cairn of rocks holding a torch and a book like the [[Statue of Liberty]] to attract it. The crew are anachronistic [[Norsemen]] (with names like Herendethelessen, [[Steptoe and Son|Steptøånssen]], Nøgøødreåssen, [[Harold Wilson|Håråldwilssen]], Irmgard, [[Fire screen|Firegård]], and their [[Great Dane]], [[Hunting season|Huntingseåssen]]) - who managed a [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]] and take the Gauls, who they thought to be the local natives, to their homeland as proof that there are continents beyond Europe.

The Gauls wanting to return home, and the Vikings' eagerness to prove their story of a new world, results in a trip back to Europe to the Vikings' homeland. The Vikings' chief, Ødiuscomparissen, greets them and is skeptical of their stories, until he sees the Gauls. They plan a celebration, then attempt to sacrifice the "natives", much to the chagrin of the other Vikings ("Why? They haven't done anything!").

Before this can be carried out, a Gaulish prisoner called Catastrofix, who can understand both Gallic and Norse, stirs up Ødiuscomparissen's suspicion that Herendethelessen is a liar, causing a fight between the [[Norsemen]] with the assumption that Herendethelessen has simply gone to Gaul rather than to a new world. Meanwhile, the Gauls escape. This escape is conducive to their original purpose, since Catastrofix is a fisherman and hence able to procure some fish for the magic potion. Unhygenix, however, prefers the scent of his own stock; a preference that explains why his product is such a delicate topic.

==Cultural references==

* Asterix and Obelix discover a [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] and decide to eat it. Asterix says it tastes great, but Obelix notes that it might be better to stuff it with another type of food. This is a reference to [[Thanksgiving]], when American families traditionally eat stuffed [[Thanksgiving turkey]].
* On page 21 Asterix calls the country ''"a [[New World]]",'' a reference to the nickname 16th century discoverers gave America. He also claims that in this place everything is possible. Asterix is actually talking about possible dangers, but the authors wrote this quote as a reference to the [[American Dream]].
* When Obelix punches one of the attacking Native Americans [[knockout|K.O.]] the warrior first sees American-style emblematic eagles; the second time he sees stars in the formation of the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]; the third time, he sees stars shaped like the [[United States Air Force]] [[roundel]].
* On page 29 Obelix claims that this way he will certainly not be eating cold dog meat. This is a reference to [[hot dog]]s.
* [[Asterix]]' idea for getting the attention of the nearby Viking ship by holding up a torch references the [[Statue of Liberty]] (which was a gift from France). Obelix is first sceptical, but when Asterix reminds him that if they don't try this plan he will have to marry the Native American Chief's daughter, Obelix gets frightened and states: ''"I value my liberty",'' as another reference to the Statue of Liberty.
* The idea that Vikings reached America centuries before [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] is one that was seriously considered at the time&lt;ref&gt;''Timespan Mysteries'' by Tim Healey, published in 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and is now seen as fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/vinland.html |title=Vikings in America |publisher=Pitt.edu |date=2002-08-27 |accessdate=2010-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225114009/http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/vinland.html |archivedate=2010-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Vikings [[L'Anse aux Meadows|landed in America around 1000]] [[Common Era|C.E.]], roughly a thousand years after the time period where Asterix is set.
* When the Vikings set foot on American ground Herende the lessen paraphrases [[Neil Armstrong]]'s famous quote: ''"It's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind"'', defending the quote on the grounds that it "just came to [him]".
* In the original French version, on page 32, Obelix claims he learned a thing or two while he was at the prairie and uses the word ''"yep!"''. This is a reference to [[Western (genre)|western]]s, and incidentally to Franco-Belgian comics series [[Lucky Luke]], also written by [[René Goscinny]] at the time, set in the [[American Frontier|American Old West]], and whose titular character frequently used the expression.
* On page 36 the Vikings give Asterix and Obelix [[bead]]s, just like 15th-17th century European settlers gave beads to the native tribes in America.
* The nationality of the Vikings in this story is [[Danish people|Danish]], while the Vikings in the earlier ''[[Asterix and the Normans]]'' were depicted as [[Norsemen]], a more general term. Several references make this clear:
**This is made clear by several references to [[William Shakespeare]]'s play about the Danish prince [[Hamlet]]. Odiuscomparissen at one point says: "Something is rotten in the state of ..." while holding a [[skull]] in his hand. In the play, the character Marcellus claims "something is rotten in the state of Denmark", and Hamlet delivers a monologue on death while holding the exhumed skull of his childhood playmate, the court jester [[Yorick (Hamlet)|Yorick]]. Towards the end of the comic Herendethelessen is seen wondering if he is a discoverer or not? He concludes by quoting Hamlet: "To be or not to be, that's the question."
**When the Viking's village is in sight, Herendethelessen tells his crewmembers to get ready to be covered with honors only for them to be greeted by an angry booming voice. Steptøånssen remarks that it is their fearsome chief Odiuscomparissen, to which Herendethelessen tells him that it certainly is not a mermaid — a reference to the statue [[The Little Mermaid#The Little Mermaid statue|The Little Mermaid]] in the port of Danish capital [[Copenhagen]].
**Herendethelessen's dog, Huntingseåssen, is a [[Great Dane]].
**Pseudo-Danish spelling (English replacing all the O's by [[Ø]]'s and all the A's by [[Å]]'s) is used for the Vikings' speech.
**The Norwegian version neatly avoided some of the Danish references by naming Hereendeththelessen after the historical [[Leiv Eiriksson]], making a point of his father's red hair ([[Eirik Raude]]). Thus, a Norwegian reader instinctively puts the Viking village on [[Iceland]] or possibly [[Greenland]]. 
* In the English translation a Viking in the voyage is named Håråldwilssen, presumably because the English translators felt he shared [[Harold Wilson]]'s physical features.

==Film adaptation==
*The animated movie ''[[Asterix Conquers America]]'', starring [[Craig Charles]] as the voice of Asterix, is based on this book. The most noticeable differences between the book and the film is that in the film, Getafix accompanies Asterix to America – albeit because he had been abducted by Romans seeking to get rid of him by throwing him off the edge of the world – and that the Vikings do not appear in the film.

'''Ban Zhao''' ({{zh|c=班昭}}; 45 – c. 116 CE), [[courtesy name]] '''Huiban''' ({{zh|c=惠班|p='''Huìbān'''|w='''Hui&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-Pan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'''}}), was a Chinese historian, philosopher, and politician. She was the first known female Chinese historian. She completed her brother [[Ban Gu]]'s work on the history of the [[Western Han]], the ''[[Book of Han]]''. She also wrote ''[[Lessons for Women]]'', an influential work on women's conduct. She also had great interest in astronomy and mathematics and wrote poems, commemorative writings, argumentations, commentaries, essays and several longer works,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wang|2003|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; not all of which survive. She became China's most famous female scholar&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perkins|2000|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an instructor of [[Taoist sexual practices]] for the imperial family.&lt;ref&gt;Gender and Sexuality in Modern Chinese History By Susan L. Mann page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Ban Zhao was born in Anling, near modern [[Xianyang]], [[Shaanxi]] province. At age fourteen, she married a local resident named Cao Shishu, and was called in the court by the name as '''Venerable Madame Cao''' (曹大家). Her husband died when she was still young. She never remarried, instead devoting her life to scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennet Peterson|2000|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the daughter of the famous historian [[Ban Biao]] and younger of 2 sisters of the general [[Ban Chao]] and of historian [[Ban Gu]]. She was also the grandniece of the notable scholar and poet [[Consort Ban]].

==Work==
[[File:Ban Zhao.jpg|thumb|Image of Ban Zhao by Shangguan Zhou (上官周, b. 1665)]]
Ban Zhao contributed greatly to the completion and transmission of ''Hanshu'' (漢書, literally the "Book of the [Former] Han"), the official dynastic history of the [[Western Han]]. After Ban Gu was imprisoned and died in 92 because of his association with the family of [[Empress Dou (Zhang)|Empress Dowager Dou]], Ban Zhao helped finish the work by making up for the missing part of the ''Babiao'' (八表 Eight Tables). She added the genealogy of the mother of the emperor, providing much information which was not usually kept. Later, Ma Xu added a treatise on [[astronomy]] (天文志), making ''Hanshu'' a complete work.

Ban Zhao also wrote the ''[[Lessons for Women]]''. This treatise on the education of women was dedicated to the daughters in Ban Zhao's family but was circulated immediately at court. It was popular for centuries in China as a guide for [[Women in ancient and imperial China|women's conduct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donawerth|2002|p=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the interpretation of classic Western [[Orientalism]], this is a moralistic book, which generally advises women to be compliant and respectful towards the greater purpose of [[Women in ancient and imperial China#Han dynasty|maintaining familial harmony]], a highly regarded concept in historical China. According to this interpretation, the book also indicates women should be well-educated so they can better serve their husbands. This interpretation cites translations of passages Ban wrote such as "Even should the husband say he loves something, when the parents-in-law say no, this is called a case of duty leading to disagreement... Nothing is better than obedience which sacrifices personal opinion." {{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

A minor revisionist theory states that the book is a guide to teach women how to avoid scandal in youth so they can survive long enough to become a powerful [[dowager]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Modern interpretations of [[Lessons for Women]] indicate that it is a founding text of [[Confucian feminism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | title=Kongzi as Feminist: Confucian Self-Cultivation in a Contemporary Context | last=Wawrytko | first=Sandra | year=2002 | publisher=Journal of Chinese Philosophy | url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0301-8121.00011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One study notes that it establishes a "different concept of agency ... forged out of the powerlessness of individual women, which is familial, communal, indirect, and conferred by others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | title=Inventing Familial Agency from Powerlessness: Ban Zhao's Lessons for Women | last=Lee | first=Lin-Lee | year=2009 | publisher=Western Journal of Communication | url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10570310802636318}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She taught [[Empress Deng Sui]] and members of the court in the royal library, which gained her political influence.&lt;ref name="Bennet Peterson 2000 102"&gt;{{harvnb|Bennet Peterson|2000|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Empress and concubines gave her the title ''Gifted one'' and the empress made her a [[Lady-in-waiting]]. As the Empress became regent for the infant [[Emperor Shang of Han]], she often sought the advice of Ban Zhao. In gratitude, the Empress gave both Ban Zhao's sons appointments as officials.&lt;ref name="Bennet Peterson 2000 102"/&gt; Ban Zhao was also a librarian at court, supervising the editorial labors of a staff of assistants and training other scholars in her work. In this capacity, she rearranged and enlarged the ''Biographies of Eminent Women'' by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]]. It is possible that she supervised the copying of manuscripts from [[bamboo slips]] and silk onto a recently invented material, paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donawerth|2002|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 113, Ban Zhao's son Cao Cheng (曹成) was appointed an official in [[Chenliu Commandery]]. Ban accompanied him to Chenliu and wrote about the journey in ''Dong Zheng Fu'' 東征賦), which has survived. After her death, her daughter-in-law, née Ding, gathered her works in the three-volume ''Collected Works of Ban Zhao'', but most have been lost.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee|title=Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women: Antiquity Through Sui, 1600 B.C.E.-618 C.E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7mLql4TAxoC&amp;pg=PA104|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-4182-3|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13203">'''Cinecolor''' was an early [[subtractive color]]-model [[RG color space|two color]] [[Color motion picture film|motion picture process]], based upon the [[Prizma]] system of the 1910s and 1920s and the [[Multicolor]] system of the late 1920s and 1930s. It was developed by William T. Crispinel and Alan M. Gundelfinger, and its various formats were in use from 1932 to 1955.

==How Cinecolor worked==
{{Main|Bipack color}}

A bi-pack color process, the photographer loaded a standard camera with two film stocks, an [[orthochromatic]] strip dyed red, plus a [[panchromatic]] strip behind it. The ortho film stock recorded only blue and green, while its red filtration passed red light to the panchromatic film stock.

In the laboratory, the negatives were processed on [[duplitized film]] and each emulsion was toned red or cyan.

While Cinecolor could produce vibrant reds, oranges, blues, browns and flesh tones, its renderings of other colors such as bright greens (rendered [[dark green]]) and [[purple]]s (rendered a sort of dark [[magenta]]) were muted.

==History==
The Cinecolor process was invented in 1932 by English-born cinematographer [[William Thomas Crespinel]] (1890–1987),&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]]&lt;/ref&gt; who joined the [[Kinemacolor]] Corporation in 1906, and who went to New York in 1913 to work with [[Kinemacolor]]'s American unit.&lt;ref&gt;"William Crespinel, 96; Pioneer in Color Films", ''New York Times'', June 24, 1987, p. B10. Passenger list of the S.S. ''Carmania'', Port of New York, 3 February 1913, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; After that company folded in 1916, he worked for [[Prizma]], another color film company, founded by William Van Doren Kelley.&lt;ref&gt;World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917–1918, State of New Jersey, County of Bergen, Draft Board 3, 5 June 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; He later worked for [[Multicolor]], and patented several inventions in the field of color cinematography.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?id=h2dEAAAAEBAJ&amp;dq Gate for Multiple Films], 1930; [http://www.google.com/patents?id=ZZBAAAAAEBAJ Method and Apparatus for Placing Sound Records in Color Photography], 1930; [http://www.google.com/patents?id=16c_AAAAEBAJ Method of Producing Films in Natural Color], 1930; [http://www.google.com/patents?id=rkVQAAAAEBAJ Colored Photograph and Method of Making Same], 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crespinel founded '''Cinecolor, Inc.''' (later '''Cinecolor Corporation''') in 1932 as a response to the success of the [[Technicolor|Technicolor Corporation]], which held a partial monopoly on motion picture color. William Loss, a director of the Citizens Traction Company in New York, was its principal investor. The company bought four [[acre]]s of land in [[Burbank, California]] for its processing plant. Crespinel retired as president of Cinecolor in 1948.

The company was largely founded on the patents and equipment of William Van Doren Kelley and his Prizma Color system, and was in direct competition with [[Multicolor]], which folded in 1932. At that point, Cinecolor bought its equipment. Although limited in tone by comparison, Cinecolor's chief advantages over Technicolor were that color rushes were available within 24 hours, that the process itself cost only 25% more than black-and-white photography (the price grew cheaper as larger amounts of Cinecolor film stock were bought), and could be used in modified black-and-white cameras.&lt;ref&gt;Gene Fernett, ''Hollywood's Poverty Row 1930-1950'' (Coral Reef Publications, 1973), pp 15-19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before 1945, Cinecolor was used almost exclusively for short films. From 1932 to 1935, Cinecolor was used in at least 22 cartoons -- including [[Fleischer Studios]] cartoons for [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[Hugh Harman]] and [[Rudolf Ising]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]; and [[Ub Iwerks]], whose [[ComiColor Cartoons|Comicolor]] cartoons were released by independent distributor [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]] – the period when [[Walt Disney]] held an exclusive contract with Technicolor for the use of its three-strip process for animation.&lt;ref&gt;Including [[Betty Boop]] in Fleischer's ''Poor Cinderella'' (1934); two [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoons, ''Honeymoon Hotel'' (1934) and ''Beauty and the Beast'' (1934); two of MGM's [[Happy Harmonies]] cartoons, ''The Discontented Canary'' (1934) and ''The Old Pioneer'' (1934); and Ub Iwerks' [[ComiColor Cartoons|Comicolor]] series that began in November 1933. [http://www.bcdb.com/ The Big Cartoon Database].

Two-strip Technicolor became available for non-Disney cartoons in September 1934, and three-strip Technicolor in September 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the best known animated [[short subject]]s series made in Cinecolor were [[Poor Cinderella]], the first installment of [[Max Fleischer|Max Fleischer's]] ''[[Color Classics]]'' and [[Ub Iwerks]]' ''[[ComiColor Cartoons|ComiColor]]'' cartoons, several 1930s and 1940s [[Warner Bros.]] ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', many of [[Famous Studios]]' late-1940s ''[[Popeye the Sailor]]'' cartoons, and [[Screen Gems]]' ''[[Phantasies]]'' from 1947 to 1949.

The first feature-length pictures released in Cinecolor were the documentary feature ''Sweden, Land of the Vikings'' (1934) and the independently made western ''The Phantom of Santa Fe'' (1936, but filmed in Multicolor in 1931), followed by [[Monogram Pictures]]' release ''[[The Gentleman from Arizona]]'' (1939). No other Cinecolor features followed until 1945. Poverty row companies such as Monogram, [[Producers Releasing Corporation]], and [[Robert L. Lippert|Screen Guild Productions]] were Cinecolor's chief employers. A 1945 PRC Cinecolor release ''[[The Enchanted Forest (film)|The Enchanted Forest]]'' was the highest grossing film of that studio. The commercial and critical success of the film led both major and minor studios to use Cinecolor such as [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s ''[[Gallant Bess]]'' (1946).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,777162,00.html?iid=chix-sphere |title=Movies: Profit through Loss |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 23, 1946 |accessdate=May 29, 2015 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system could produce acceptable color pictures at a fraction of the cost of Technicolor. Most features made in Cinecolor were westerns, because the main color palette in those films consisted of blues, browns and reds; the system's limitations were thus less apparent.

Cinecolor was also prominently employed in processing Paramount's ''[[Popular Science (film)|Popular Science]]'' series of short films – although later prints were made by [[Consolidated Film Industries]] under their [[Magnacolor]] process. [[Hal Roach|Hal Roach Studios]] made all four of its features in Cinecolor in 1947–1948, becoming the first [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] studio to do an all-color schedule. The last American feature released in Cinecolor was [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]' ''Pride of the Blue Grass'' (1954). 

[[Republic Pictures]] began using [[Consolidated Film Industries|CFI's]] [[Trucolor]] from the end of 1946 for a variety of films ranging from Westerns, travelogues, and epics of the life of [[Richard Wagner]] (''[[Magic Fire]]'') and the [[battle of the Alamo]] (''[[The Last Command (1955 film)|The Last Command]]'').  Trucolor differed, however, in that it used a dye-coupler already built into the film base, rather than the application of chemical toner.

===SuperCinecolor===
The year 1948 was a major one for the Cinecolor Corp. Aside from growing film stock prices, they introduced a new, hyper-sensitive stock and {{convert|1000|ft|m|sing=on}} film magazines, which cut back on the on-set lighting costs by 50%, and kept the cost of shooting in Cinecolor only 10% more than black and white.&lt;ref&gt;"New Sensitized Film Cuts Lighting Costs." ''Boxoffice Magazine'', 17 July 1948: 43.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, Gundelfinger also developed a three-color process called '''SuperCinecolor''', but did not begin using it until 1951 with ''[[The Sword of Monte Cristo]]''. Other films of note that used the SuperCinecolor process were ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd]]'' (1952), ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk (1952 film)|Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' (1952), ''[[Invaders from Mars (1953 film)|Invaders From Mars]]'' (1953), ''[[Gog (film)|Gog]]'' (1954), and ''[[Top Banana (film)|Top Banana]]'' (1954). The latter two were both also filmed in [[3-D film|3-D]].

SuperCinecolor utilized black-and-white matrices made primarily by monopack color negatives made with [[Agfa|Ansco/Agfa]], [[DuPont]], [[Kodachrome]], or [[Eastmancolor]] film, for principal photography. After the negative was edited, it was copied through color filters into three black-and-white negatives. An oddity of the system was that rather than use cyan, magenta and yellow primary subtractive colors, SuperCinecolor printed their films with red, blue and yellow matrices in order to create a system that was compatible with the previous printers.&lt;ref&gt;Original separations for "Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd" (WB, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=March 2016}} The result of the combination of color spectra was an oddly striking look to the final print.

Printing SuperCinecolor was not a difficult process as it was engineered to utilize the old process' equipment. Using duplitized stock, one side contained a silver emulsion toned red-magenta, and on the other side, cyan-blue. A yellow layer was added on the blue side through means of imbibition.&lt;ref&gt;Color in Motion Pictures and Television by Lyne S. Trimble was a textbook for Professor Trimble's class, who had worked for Cinecolor for many years, and it described the process and it might not have used the word "imbibition" for re-exposure of the duplitized stock, after toning.&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack was subsequently applicated on the blue-yellow side in a blue soundtrack, but separate from those records. The final prints had vivid dyes that did not fade, were of acceptable grain structure and sharp in focus. The common perception of Cinecolor prints being grainy and not easily focused is perpetrated by 16&amp;nbsp;mm, regular-process Cinecolor prints, where these elements are an issue.{{cn|date=November 2012}}

===The last years of Cinecolor===
Cinecolor Corp. operated at a net loss from 1950 through 1954, partly because the weak financial position of its division in England made it necessary for the parent company to refinance it, and partly because of its own operating losses.&lt;ref&gt;"Cinecolor Corp. Plans To Lay Off 'Substantial' Personnel Temporarily", ''The Wall Street Journal'', April 2, 1952, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abreast 15"&gt;"Abreast of the Market", ''The Wall Street Journal'', August 26, 1955, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Donner Corporation, a private investment organization, acquired Cinecolor Corp. in June 1952.&lt;ref name="Abreast 11"&gt;"Abreast of the Market", ''The Wall Street Journal'', June 22, 1953, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, it became the '''Color Corporation of America''', and specialized in SuperCinecolor printing, as well as being a major [[Ansco|Anscocolor]] processor. It also made [[Eastmancolor]] prints, did commercial film processing and printing of non-theatrical films, and black-and-white film processing for television. To stimulate its theatrical film business, Color Corp. financed independent movie producers.&lt;ref name="Abreast 11"/&gt; The last theatrical feature with a SuperCinecolor credit was ''The Diamond Queen'', released by [[Warner Bros.]] in November 1953. Thereafter, "Color by Color Corp. of America" was used for films like ''Shark River'' (1953) and ''Top Banana'' (1954).

Color Corporation of America was bought out on April 8, 1954 by Houston Color Film Laboratories, which processed Anscocolor at its plant in Los Angeles, and Houston Fearless Corp., which made processing and developing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;"Donner Corp. Sells Interest In Color Corp. of America", ''The Wall Street Journal'', May 5, 1954, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It became strictly an Anscocolor processor. Color Corp. sold its film processing laboratory in mid-1955 to provide its television and motion picture equipment-making division a laboratory in which to test its equipment,&lt;ref name="Abreast 15"/&gt; and the corporation was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;California Secretary of State, [http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/list.html California Business Portal].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Claude Longchamp''' (born March 14, 1957 in [[Fribourg]], [[Switzerland]]) is a Swiss [[historian]] and [[political scientist]] (with no university degree). He is a prominent [[political analyst]] for Swiss national television and radio, and he is the main figure behind the research institute [[gfs.berne]], which conducts both the main pre- and post-vote polls and projections of national votes in Switzerland.

Longchamp’s main research interest lies in the analysis of [[direct democracy]], in particular [[voting behaviour]] of citizens in a direct democratic setting, social and political determinants of opinion formation, as well as political communication and the [[mass media]]. One of his main contributions to the analysis of direct democratic decisions is the “Disposition Approach”, a framework combining the predispositions citizen hold and the information available to them to explain voting behavior.

Longchamp’s research also covers [[Swiss politics]], [[European politics]], [[health policy]], [[Economic policy|economic]] and [[financial policy]], [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[technology policy]], [[political culture]], [[anti-Semitism]], [[public opinion]], [[political communication]], [[Opinion poll|polling]], and [[lobbying]].

Since 1987, Longchamp has been the main analyst of voting behavior for Swiss national television and radio (SRG SSR idée Suisse). He and his team at gfs.berne have been responsible for [[vote projection]]s on behalf of Swiss television since 1992 and the national polls on [[election]]s, [[referendum]]s and initiatives since 1998. In addition, since 1992 he has been editor of the government-funded post-vote Vox-Analyses of national referendums and initiatives.  Longchamp is also responsible for the annual [[Swiss Worry Barometer]], the [[Swiss Health Monitor]], the [[Swiss Financial Monitor]], and is currently preparing the [[Swiss Racism Monitor]].

Until 1992, Longchamp lectured on political science at the [[University of Berne]]. Thereafter, he taught at the Universities of Freiburg, [[Zurich]], [[St. Gallen]], as well as the Polytechnics in [[Winterthur]], Zurich, and [[Lausanne]]. Since 2008, he has been teaching the course “Applied Political Research” at the [[University of St. Gallen]] in the context of the International Affairs Program.

From 1993 until 2003, Longchamp was CEO and member of the [[board of directors]] of the [[GfS-Research Institute]], Politics and State Division. Since 2004, he has been CEO and since 2009 also chairman of the board of directors of the research institute gfs.berne, the successor organization of the GfS-institute. As a reaction to criticism directed at the research institute gfs.berne and its managing director, the [[Independent Complaints Authority for Swiss Radio and Television]] affirmed in 2008 that gfs.berne was one of the most highly recognized institutions in applied political research in Switzerland.[1]

In addition to his work in applied political science, Claude Longchamp also works as an applied historian, conducting historico-politico-cultural guided [[city tour]]s for international delegations, politicians, government employees, and journalists.
Longchamp is a member of the [[Swiss Social Democratic Party]] [2], however, since 1993 he has been a passive member only. He is also involved in the society “Bern neu gründen” (“Re-Founding Berne”), which has the aim of re-forging Berne as the leading political centre in Switzerland.

'''Cornelis van der Aa''' ([[Leiden]], 22 October 1749 - [[Amsterdam]], 1816), was a bookseller in [[Haarlem]] when he was convicted in 1796 by the [[schepen]]en of the city to five years imprisonment and consecutive perpetual exile from the department [[Holland]] for political reasons as a follower of the [[stadtholder]]s. At the end of 1799, he was released and settled in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] as a bookseller. From then on until his death in 1816 in [[Amsterdam]], where he moved to later on, he spent his time writing the following books:

[[File:Eduard Ausfeld.jpg|right|thumb|Eduard Ausfeld (1850–1906)]]
'''Heinrich Eduard Ausfeld''' (27 May 1850, Schnepfenthal bei [[Gotha]] – 4 April 1906, [[Magdeburg]]) was a German [[archivist]] and [[historian]].

Following studies at several German universities, he obtained his doctorate in 1880 at the [[University of Marburg]]. Subsequently he worked at the ''Staatsarchiv'' (state archives) in [[Idstein]] (trainee status), [[Wiesbaden]] (from 1881), [[Koblenz]] (from 1892) and [[Magdeburg]] (from 1897). In 1898 he succeeded [[George Adalbert von Mülverstedt]] (1825–1914) as director of archives at Magdeburg. In Magdeburg he took part in plans for construction of a new archives building on Augustastraße (now Hegelstraße), which first opened for business in 1908, two years after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-magdeburg.de/mbl/Biografien/1006.htm University of Magdeburg] (biography of Georg Winter).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ausfeld was a member of the ''Historischen Kommission für die Provinz Sachsen und das Herzogtum Anhalt'' (Historical Commission for the [[Province of Saxony]] and the [[Duchy of Anhalt]]) and the ''Geschichtsverein und dem Verein für Nassauische Altertumskunde und Geschichte'' (Historical Society and the Association of Nassau [[Archaeology]] and History).

[[Image:Eusebius Fermendzhin.jpg|right|frame|Eusebius Fermendžin]]
'''Eusebius Fermendžin''' (also ''Fermendzhin, Fermendjin''; {{lang-bg|Евсевий, Еузебий, Еусебий, or Еусебиус Ферменджин}}) (21 September 1845 – 25 June 1897) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] high-ranking [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] cleric, [[Franciscan]] friar and academic of [[Banat Bulgarians|Banat Bulgarian]] origin.

Born in [[Vinga]] in the [[Austrian Empire]] (today in [[Romania]]) to Luka Fermendžin and Agáta Malćin, Fermendžin was educated in his home place and then in [[Maria Radna]] and [[Vienna]], he joined the Franciscan order and substituted his secular name ''Martin'' with the religious ''Eusebius''. In the Franciscan order, he held several responsible offices, such as Provincial of [[Budapest]], General-Visitor and Definitor of the Provincial of [[Rome]] and representative of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] Franciscans in [[Warsaw]] (1882).

His main historical works include ''Acta Bulgariae ecclesiastica аb аnno 1565 usque ad annum 1799'', issued in [[Zagreb]] in 1887, ''Kronikon Bulgarije'', ''Acta Bosniae potssimum eccelesiastica, ad ba. 925 usque ad ba. 1752'', ''History of the Order of [[Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]]'', ''[[Krashovani|Krashovan]] Grammar'', etc. He was an active correspondent member of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts|Zagreb Academy of Sciences]].

'''Francis Elrington Ball''', known as '''F. Elrington Ball''' (1863–1928), was an Irish author and [[Legal history|legal historian]], best known for his work ''The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921'' (1926).

==Life==

A younger son of [[John Thomas Ball]] (1815 to 1898), the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]] from 1875 to 1880, and his wife Catherine Elrington,  Ball was unsuccessful in seeking election (as a [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]]) to Parliament at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1900]] in [[South Dublin (UK Parliament constituency)|South Dublin]]. His father had represented [[Dublin University (constituency)|Dublin University]] in Parliament from 1868 to 1875.

[[File:Four Courts Conflagration.jpg|thumb|right|225px|The Four Courts on fire during the Civil War]]
Ball is, however, best known for his scholarship, particularly for his work on [[Jonathan Swift|Swift]], the local history of [[Dublin]] and on the history of the judiciary in Ireland from 1221 to 1921. The [[Four Courts#Destruction in Civil War|destruction of the Four Courts]] in 1922, during the [[Irish Civil War]], and of the public records and legal archives it contained (especially those of the [[Irish Public Records Office]]) made Ball's prior research into the history of the Irish judiciary up to 1921 particularly valuable to later scholars. The review published in the ''[[Irish Law Times]] &amp; Solicitors' Journal'' described it as "a truly marvellous condensation of judicial history involving the exhaustive study of a long period, the earlier part of which was hitherto obscure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Review: ''The Judges in Ireland'' | author = Anon | year = 1927 | journal = I.l.t. &amp; S.j. | volume = lxi | pages = 3–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review characterised Ball as "a writer of great care and accuracy, whose work is always characterised by minute and diligent research."

Ball was also a governor of the [[The King's Hospital|Blue Coat School]], [[Oxmantown]], Dublin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1185">'''Gasparcolor''' was a color motion picture film system, developed in 1933 by the Hungarian chemist Dr. [[Bela Gaspar]] (1898-1973). It used a [[Subtractive color|subtractive]] 3-color process on a single film strip, one of the earliest to do so.

During the 1930s and 1940s, it was used primarily in animation, notably by [[Oskar Fischinger]] (''Muratti Gets in the Act'', 1934; ''Composition in Blue'', 1935), [[Len Lye]] (''Birth of a Robot'', ''Rainbow Dance'', both 1936), and [[George Pal]]. 

[[William Moritz]], in his article for the Fischinger Archive (see External Links), gives more detail about this history of this color process. Dr. Gaspar eventually moved to Hollywood and sold his patents to [[Technicolor]] and [[3M]].

'''George Popovici''' ({{Lang-de|Georg Popovici}};&lt;ref&gt;Hallabrin, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; {{OldStyleDate|November 20|1863|November 8}} – July 11/12, 1905) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Romania]]n agrarian politician, jurist and poet. The scion of a middle-class intellectual family in Austrian-ruled [[Bukovina]], he took to politics as a youth, participating in the [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist movement]] as a member of [[Societatea Academică Junimea]] and Concordia Society. He won a seat in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Austrian House of Deputies]] [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1897|in 1897]], and, during his mandate, co-founded the [[Romanian National People's Party]], which he also represented in the [[Diet of Bukovina]]. Popovici and [[Iancu Flondor]] led the party's autonomist wing, which rejected compromise with the Austrian administration and demanded national rights for the Romanian Bukovinans.

Popovici lost the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1900–1901|parliamentary election of 1900]], during which time he ran into heavy debt. He left for the [[Kingdom of Romania]], renouncing Austrian citizenship and focusing on his career as a historian of law. He eventually committed suicide at [[Mukacheve|Munkács]], which was at the time part of [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian Transleithania]]. His poetry was collected into a volume after his death.

Born in [[Czernowitz]] (''Cernăuți''), in [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-ruled [[Duchy of Bukovina]], his parents were the [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest Eusebiu Popovici (1838–1922) and his wife Elena Hacman.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 137; Iațencu, pp. 722, 725. See also Iorga, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebiu's father Constantin (1807–1890), himself a parish priest, had served in the Diet in 1861; his uncle, [[Constantin Clement Popovici]], a church historian, also had a career in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Iațencu, pp. 721–722&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebiu himself was recognized for his work as an antiquarian, librarian, and theologian.&lt;ref&gt;Iațencu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; The family was unrelated to Eusebie Popovici (1863–1937), a senior politician who later was George Popovici's colleague. Eusebie had embraced [[Romanian nationalism]] from the 1870s, against the conservatism of the [[boyar]] class; George radicalize himself even further, by introducing social demands into the nationalist program and seeking direct backing from the peasants.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 163, 199, 235; Drahta, pp. 594–597&lt;/ref&gt;

George entered a local primary school in 1870, followed by the German high school four years later. While a student there, he and several classmates edited a magazine in manuscript form, ''Întreprinderea''. He graduated in 1882, immediately joining [[Societatea Academică Junimea]], the Romanian cultural club.&lt;ref name="drg137"&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; That autumn, he entered the law faculty of [[Czernowitz University]]. Rising from secretary to president of Junimea for the 1883–1884 year, he was part of a quartet that organized a ten-year celebration of [[Arboroasa]] in 1885.&lt;ref name="drg137"/&gt; During his university years, he published historical studies and poetry both in the [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]]-based ''Candela'' and in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and ''[[Sămănătorul]]'', from the [[Kingdom of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 137; Drahta, p. 595; Iațencu, p. 722; Iorga, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1885, he took part in maneuvers at [[Stanislau]] with the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]. He graduated university in 1888; the same year, he left to continue his studies at the [[University of Innsbruck]], but a serious illness prevented this for nearly two years. Popovici earned his doctorate in 1894.&lt;ref name="d138"&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 138&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1897, he undertook a study trip to Vienna, Innsbruck and Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 138. See also Drahta, p. 595; Iațencu, p. 722; Iorga, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; He then returned to Czernowitz in order to campaign for a seat in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Austrian House of Deputies]] at the [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1897|March election]], joining the Concordia Society (or National Romanian Party, PNR) of [[Ioan Zotta]] and [[Modest Grigorcea]].&lt;ref name="ccz232"&gt;Cocuz, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; He won the seat with 597 of 625 votes cast, and represented the southern portion of Bukovina: [[Storojineț]], [[Siret]], [[Rădăuți]], [[Suceava]], [[Gura Humorului]] and [[Câmpulung Moldovenesc]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 138. See also Cocuz, p. 232; Drahta, pp. 594, 597; Hallabrin, pp. 38–39; Iorga, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; He ran on an agrarian-focused platform, declaring: "All the lands of our empire, and of other empires as well, are marching toward economic betterment while us Bukovinans have lagged behind, so therefore I promise to do everything necessary to mend the economic state of our Bukovinan peasant."&lt;ref name="ccz232"/&gt; During that stage of his career, Popovici also believed that all Romanian provinces would be united under Austrian rule.&lt;ref name="iorg8"&gt;Iorga, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissatisfied with the conservative Concordia, in April 1897 Popovici entered the [[Romanian National People's Party]] (PNPR), a more radical nationalist group whose ideologue was [[Iancu Flondor]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 235–239&lt;/ref&gt; He served on its leadership board, with, among others, Grigorcea, [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi]], [[Varteres von Prunkul]], [[Ion Țurcan]], and his uncle C. C. Popovici. Later, he and [[Georg Wassilko von Serecki|Graf Wassilko]] where co-opted on the Party Directorate; Popovici also served on the electoral board of Czernowitz.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 246, 255, 258–262&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebie Popovici also joined the new group, and, in 1898, became a member of its electoral board in Suceava.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 255–259&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 1897, Popovici proposed before parliament the establishment of an appeals court for Bukovina, and participated in a peasants' assembly at Vienna that gathered together representatives of the empire's rural Romanian population.&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140; Drahta, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1898, he delivered a speech in parliament where he called for the rights of the peasantry to be respected in the matter of land rents.&lt;ref name="d138"/&gt; He was the party rapporteur on the issue of regional autonomy, which the PNPR supported as part of a right-wing coalition in the House, against the objections of [[German nationalism in Austria|German nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1898, after a heated campaign with accusations of fraud against his competitors, he won a seat in the Diet for the rural constituency of Câmpulung Moldovenesc.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 259–260, 262–268. See also Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; When not engaged in political campaigning, he submitted entries on old Romanian law to ''[[Enciclopedia română]]'', which appeared that same year. Meanwhile, his fiancée Virginia, the daughter of cultural figure Dionisie Bejan, died.&lt;ref name="t140"&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflicts, departure, death===
In May 1899, Popovici held a passionate speech before a join session of imperial legislators held in Budapest, calling on Romania to join the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] and warning of the threat posed by the [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140. See also Drahta, p. 598&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1899, he signed his name to a formal protest against the [[Friedrich Bourguignon von Baumberg|Bourguignon von Baumberg]], the [[List of Governors of Bukovina|Bukovina Governor]], accusing him of being anti-Romanian and of censoring the local nationalist press.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 271–273; Drahta, pp. 598–600&lt;/ref&gt; He also stood up against the governor's ban on public displays of the [[Flag of Romania|Romanian tricolor]], arguing that the colors were naturally found on [[Romanian dress|Romanian folk costumes]], which would risk being banned.&lt;ref&gt;Drahta, pp. 598–599&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in September by another protest, prompted by Bourguignon's conflict with the Orthodox clergy, including his own father.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 274–275&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900, Popovici had stopped participating in sessions of the Diet, in protest at the older Bukovina Romanian politicians' policy of concessions and patience with the Austrian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 278, 294–295; Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140; Drahta, pp. 600–602&lt;/ref&gt; The PPNR split into factions, but the core group, steered by Flondor and Popovici, endured, hoping to rely on renewed support from the Romanian peasantry.&lt;ref&gt;Drahta, pp. 600–602&lt;/ref&gt;

In August, he became president of the reconstructed PNPR.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 284, 286; Drahta, p. 601&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 1900, he [[Cisleithanian legislative election, 1900–1901|ran for re-election]] to the Vienna parliament, but lost to an accommodationist candidate, [[Dimitrie Isopescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, p. 283; Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140. See also Draha, p. 601; Iorga, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Beset by campaign debts,&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 140; Drahta, p. 610; Iorga, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Popovici left Austrian territory settled in [[Bucharest]], capital of the Kingdom of Romania. He refused to run again for a vacated seat the House, citing "personal reasons"; his absence cleared the way for [[Tudor Flondor]], who was Iancu's brother and political rival.&lt;ref&gt;Cocuz, pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1901, at Bucharest, Popovici married Maria, the daughter of politician [[Ștefan C. Șendrea]].&lt;ref name="t140"/&gt;

Popovici renounced Austrian citizenship upon emigrating, and was naturalized a Romanian citizen in February 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Angelescu, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to publish studies in 1903, gave lectures at the [[Romanian Atheneum]],&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1904 submitted material on Romanian diplomacy to ''Enciclopedia română''.&lt;ref name="t140"/&gt; He was working on a large-scale volume dealing with the history of Romanian law, but never finished it; instead, he helped his fellow nationalist historian, [[Nicolae Iorga]], reviewing for print his texts in German.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, pp. 8–9, 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; Popovici was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in April 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Fotino, p. 119; Iațencu, p. 722&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was blocked in his bid for the chair of Romanian law at the [[University of Bucharest]], after conservative Bukovinans launched a press campaign against him. According to Iorga: "A Bukovinan made a fuss in the papers, in the newspaper ''Conservatorul'', spewing insults at this correct, modest and delicate man, this man who had never insulted anyone; a veritable camp emerged at the Faculty to block his entry. We know how much that insult hurt him, how he knew who the perpetrator was, and how, knowing this, he knew that he could expect no vindication [of his honor] from him".&lt;ref name="iorg10"&gt;Iorga, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, the peasants of Bukovina continued to hold Popovici in high esteem, and kept copies of his portrait.&lt;ref name="iorg8"/&gt; By then, Iancu Flondor had replaced him as president of the PNPR. Flondor was accused by adversary [[Aurel Onciul]] of the [[Democratic Peasants' Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Peasants' Party]] of having plagiarized his friend's projects for electoral reform; Onciul also claimed that Popovici had only stayed by Flondor's side because he was being paid to.&lt;ref&gt;Drahta, pp. 601, 604–605&lt;/ref&gt;

That July, some time after visiting Iorga in Bucharest,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Popovici left for Hungary. He as reportedly ashamed by prospects of insolvency&lt;ref&gt;Drahta, p. 610&lt;/ref&gt; and one night, while at an inn in [[Mukacheve|Munkács]], took a lethal dose of morphine. A letter and six telegrams were found in his room. The letter was addressed to the town's administrator, while the telegrams were for family members, a friend and the prefect of the Bucharest police. He left no indication of why he committed suicide, instead giving instructions as to his burial.&lt;ref&gt;Angelescu, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; Popovici was buried in his native city.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga, p. 6; Iosif, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Sămănătorul'' obituary, Iorga argued: "Among those who were brought down by our sins, among those who were murdered by the stupidity and wickedness of this nation, I know none for whom more tears should be spilled. He was of pure gold, blocking the path of those who, with lead as their ornament, have trampled on him."&lt;ref name="iorg10"/&gt; A posthumous volume of poetry was published in 1908 by [[Ștefan Octavian Iosif]],&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "Tabel cronologic", p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; with a preface by Iorga.&lt;ref&gt;Iațencu, p. 722&lt;/ref&gt; These and other works appeared under the pen name T. Robeanu;&lt;ref&gt;Iosif, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; the moniker originated with an 1885 pun addressed to his then-fiancée: ''Te robea, nu?'' ("He enslaved you, no?").&lt;ref&gt;Drăgușanul, "T. Robeanu...", p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giordano Berti.jpg|thumb|right|Giordano Berti]]
'''Giordano Berti''' (born 27 February 1959) is an [[Italy|Italian]] writer and teacher of History of Arts.

==Biography==
Born in [[Bologna]], Giordano Berti grew up in [[Monghidoro]], a town of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines. After obtaining his college diploma he went on to study history and philosophy at [[University of Bologna]] and shortly thereafter started his career of editor and writer.&lt;ref&gt;DONINI, Domenico, ''Giordano Berti: un artista poliedrico'', in IMAGO, catalog of the exhibit at Museo della Grafica, Brisighella, June 1985, p.5-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Berti is an established and prolific author of many books about different subjects, such as History of [[Esotericism]] ([[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[divination]], [[witchcraft]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], heresies, [[gnosticism]], [[heaven]] and [[hell]], [[angels]] and [[devil]]s) in his relationship with Art. Some of Berti's books are translated in English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Polish and Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;MORSUCCI, Anna Maria, "About Giordano Berti", in ''Tarocchi: from Renaissance to present days'', catalog of the exhibition in Turin, October 2017 – January 2018, Lo Scarabeo, Turin 2017, p.23&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been co-founder and president of the Istituto Graf at Bologna, an association dedicated to the research and, often, rediscovery of the Arts and [[Folklore]]. Berti frequently organises, with the patronage and support of local Councils, many Art and History exhibitions throughout Italy. [http://www.istitutograf.org/istituto_berti.htm]

Over the decades, Giordano Berti, as director of the Istituto Graf or author of editorial projects, has collaborated with famous philosophers, art historians and artists, such as [[Michael Dummett]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Tiziano Sclavi]], [[Angelo Stano]], [[Robert M. Place]], [[Rachel Pollack]].&lt;ref&gt;GEDDA, Alberto, "Giordano Berti, a short byography", in ''Tarot of the New Vision'', Lo Scarabeo, Torino 2005, P. 156 {{ISBN|88-8395-484-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a worldwide renown [[Tarot]] historian, Berti was invited, as special guest, at the third World Tarot Congress, in [[Chicago]] (May 10 to 14 2001), where he delivered a long conference titled "The Babel of Tarot, or the evolution of the 22 allegoric Triumph cards as a transformation into an esoteric language" [http://www.tarotpassages.com/berti.htm].

Berti is consultant for two Tarot and Playing Cards great editors: Lo Scarabeo ([[Turin]], [[Italy]]) and [[Dal Negro]] ([[Treviso]], [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;KAPLAN, R. Stuart, "Giordano Berti", in ''The Encyclopedia of Tarot'', vol. IV, U.S. Games Systems, Stamford 2005, pp. 670-672 {{ISBN|1-57281-506-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Giordano Berti started the project ''Monghidoro: the Gateway to Europe'', in collaboration with art designer Letizia Rivetti and the municipal administration of [[Monghidoro]]. The project consists in a series of artworks titled "The Stones of History", permanently fixed on the squares and streets of Monghidoro. In fact this ancient village, situated on the bolognese Apennine mountains roughly halfway between Bologna and Florence, over the centuries has been the required resting place of merchants, Lords, Princes, Popes, Emperors, writers, scientists and adventurers, who during their travels found shelter in country inns or were guests at the olivetani Abbey of San Michele at Alpes.&lt;ref&gt;DI BERNARDO, Bruno, ''La memoria storico di Monghidoro nelle targhe di Giordano Berti'', in Valli Savena Idice, n°1, September 2013. PAGANI, Giada, ''Monghidoro: un monumento all'emigrante'', in Il Resto del Carlino, August 31, 2013. PAGANI, Giada, ''La Liberazione di Monghidoro: un viaggio nel passato'', in Il Resto del Carlino, October 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giordano Berti is also author of articles for numerous magazines: Fenix, Il Giornale dei Misteri, Charta, The Cartomancer, Tarot Chronicles, RILKO, Atmosphere.

In 2014 Giordano Berti created the project "Rinascimento - Italian Style Art" devoted to the reprinting of old Tarot, Sibyls and Playing cards that stand out for their beauty and rarity. [https://rinascimentoitalianartenglish.wordpress.com/about-us/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8056">{{Marxism|Variants}}
'''Impossibilism''' is a [[Marxist]] theory and perspective on the emergence of [[socialism]] that stresses the limited value of political, economic, cultural and social reforms within a [[capitalist]] economy. It argues that the pursuit of such reforms is counterproductive because they stabilize and strengthen support for capitalism, thereby helping to ensure its continuation. Impossibilism holds that the pursuit of reforms should not be a major concern for socialists because such reforms are irrelevant, if not counter-productive, to the realization of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/i/m.htm "Impossiblism"]. Marxists.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Impossibilism insists that socialists should solely (or at the least, primarily) focus on structural changes (sometimes termed "revolutionary changes") to society as opposed to advancing social reforms. Impossibilists argue that spontaneous revolutionary action is the only viable method of instituting the structural changes necessary for the construction of socialism. Impossibilism is thus held in contrast to [[reformist]] socialist parties that aim to rally support for socialism through the implementation of popular social reforms (such as a [[welfare state]]) and those who believe that socialism can emerge through gradual economic reforms implemented by an elected [[Social democracy|social democratic]] political party.

Impossibilism is the opposite of "possibilism" and "[[immediatism]]". Possibilism and immediatism are based on a gradualist path to socialism and a desire on the part of socialists to help ameliorate the social ills "immediately" through practical programs implemented by existing institutions such as [[labor unions]] and electoral politics, thereby de-emphasizing the ultimate objective of building a socialist economy. As a result, socialists who embraced possibilism and immediatism sounded and acted little different from non-socialist reformers.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenstone, Robert. [http://authors.library.caltech.edu/14561/1/HumsWP-0017.pdf "Why is there no socialism in the United States?"]. Reviews in American History (November 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

Impossibilist movements are also associated with [[anti-Leninism]] in their opposition to both [[vanguardism]] and [[democratic centralism]].

== Origins of the concept ==
[[File:Socialist Standard October 1904 Editorial The Futility of Reform.png|thumb|Editorial "The Futility of Reform" by ''[[Socialist Standard]]'', October 1904]]
The concept of impossibilism—though not the specific term—was introduced and heavily influenced by American Marxist [[theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Daniel De Leon]] on the basis of [[De Leonism|theory that De Leon generated]] before his interest in [[syndicalism]] began. It came to be focused especially on the question of whether socialists should take part in government and pursue policy reforms that benefited the working-class under capitalism.

At the [[International Socialist Congress, Paris 1900|Paris Congress of the Second International in 1900]], those who favored entry into government with all the implied compromises called themselves "Possibilists" while those who opposed them (those around [[Jules Guesde]]) characterized them as political "[[opportunism|Opportunists]]". Conversely, the [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialists]] who opposed ameliorative reforms and participation in existing governments were called "Impossibilists" by their detractors because they allegedly sought the impossible by refusing to partake in the governing of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Waldo R. Browne (ed.) (1921). "Impossiblism, Impossibilist" in ''What's What in the Labor Movement: A Dictionary of Labor Affairs and Labor Terminology''. New York: B.W. Heubsch. p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

While not usually described as an impossibilist, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] opposed both reformism and [[vanguardism]], taking the more classical Marxist perspective that revolution would be a spontaneous reaction to underlying material changes in the productive forces of society. According to Luxemburg, under reformism "[capitalism] is not overthrown, but is on the contrary strengthened by the development of social reforms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/hallas/works/1973/01/reform.htm|title=Do We Support Reformist Demands?|author=Duncan Hallas|year=1973|website=Controversy: Do we support reformist demands?|publisher=International Socialism|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis in Karl Marx's work ==
[[Karl Marx]] famously critiqued reformism and immediatist/possibilist goals advocated by modern [[Social democracy|social democrats]] in his ''Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League'' (1850). Specifically, he argued that measures designed to increase wages, improve working conditions and provide welfare payments would be used to dissuade the working class away from socialism and the revolutionary consciousness he believed was necessary to achieve a socialist economy and would thus be a threat to genuine structural changes to society by making the conditions of workers in capitalism more tolerable through reform and welfare schemes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/communist-league/1850-ad1.htm "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League"]. Marxists.org. Retrieved January 5, 2013. "However, the democratic petty bourgeois want better wages and security for the workers, and hope to achieve this by an extension of state employment and by welfare measures; in short, they hope to bribe the workers with a more or less disguised form of alms and to break their revolutionary strength by temporarily rendering their situation tolerable".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impossibilist political organizations ==
Impossibilism was particularly popular in [[British Columbia]] in the early 20th century through the influence of [[E. T. Kingsley]]. Several members of Kingsley's [[Socialist Party of Canada]] (SPC) were elected to the British Columbia legislature between 1901 and 1910. It is also said to be the basis of the theory and practice of the oldest existing British Marxist party, the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (SPGB), founded in 1904; and the international [[World Socialist Movement]], though they reject this description.

In the United States, the De Leonist [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] was viewed as "impossibilist" by its opponents, particularly those in the electorally-oriented [[Socialist Party of America]]. A more self-consciously impossibilist organization emerged in 1920 as the [[Proletarian Party of America]], an organization headed by the Scottish-born [[John Keracher]] which was directly influenced by the ideas of the SPGB and the SPC.

In France, [[Jules Guesde]] and the [[French Workers' Party]] were accused of impossibilism.

'''John Musgrave &amp; Sons''' was a company that manufactured [[stationary steam engine]]s.  It was founded in 1839 by John Musgrave and his son, Joseph, at the Globe Ironworks, in [[Bolton]], [[Historic counties of England|historically]] in [[Lancashire]], England. 

In 1854 the company supplied a twin cylinder horizontal [[winding engine]], and in 1861 a single cylinder pumping engine to [[Chanters Colliery]] in [[Hindsford]].{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=40|ps=}} Musgraves supplied winding engines to [[Pendlebury Colliery|Wheatsheaf Colliery]] in 1868,{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=132|ps=}}  [[Mosley Common Colliery]] in 1870,{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=129|ps=}} Brackley Colliery in 1879,{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=130|ps=}} [[Gin Pit Colliery]] in 1884, {{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=128|ps=}} and [[Nook Colliery]] in 1913.{{sfn|Hayes|2004|p=127|ps=}}

The company produced steam engines during the 19th century and between 1899 and 1908 produced 504 large steam-driven engines for [[Cotton mill|textile mills]] in Lancashire.&lt;ref name=H244&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company produced engines and equipment for the coal mining industry and built a boilerworks in [[Westhoughton]] in 1900 to produce [[Lancashire boiler]]s. The Westhoughton works were subject to a chancery court judgement and sold in 1912 leading to the formation of John Musgrave and Sons (1913) Ltd. which kept the Globe Ironworks. The company produced munitions during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Townley|1994|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The business closed in 1926; its drawings and patterns were taken over by [[W &amp; J Galloway &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref name=H267&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final notice of winding-up was published on 11 March 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33256 |page=1635 |date=11 March 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--  Copied section le3ft for comparative structure ==History==
'''John Urmson and John E Thompson''' started business in 1865 in [[Hathershaw]], [[Oldham]]. While Urmson was a trained engineer who had worked at [[Woolstenhulmes &amp; Rye]]., Thompson is thought to have contributed capital. Thompson died in 1882, and Urmson with his sons John and Andrew continued the business. On the sons death in 1888 the firm was incorporated, and continued until 1933..&lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;

The firm operated out of the Hathershaw Foundry. The firm started as millwrights but in the 1870s, they started making stationary steam engines as well. The in 1904 they started to make a series of large mill engines. The largest engine they built was a 2000ihp job for Ace Mill Co. Ltd., Chadderton in 1914. The was erected in 1919.

The later engines were large. Arthur Roberts  &lt;ref name=AR&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;
reported that Hartford Mill was powered by 1800hp twin tandem compound engine by Urmson and Thompson, built in 1907. It was steamed at 160 psi at 68 rpm. It had a 5ft stroke driving a 24 ft flywheel. The transmission method was by ropes. There were 40. The engine was reputed to be the only twin tandem the Urmson &amp; Thompson ever built. It had two 30" diameter HP (high pressure cylinders) at the rear and two 60" LP (low pressure cylinder in front. There were [[Corliss engine|Corliss valves]] on all cylinders. The air pumps were driven from each crosshead. There was a Whitehead governor. The engine cost £5400 and the three boilers cost £1900. &lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;George Watkins differed in the detail, proposing it was a 1500 hp engine with 21" and 44" cylinders on a 5 ft stroke, that was steamed at 170psi. The 24 ft flywheel drove 34 ropes. George Watkins. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Mills driven by its engines==
They produced mill engines in boom of the 1870s, and millwrighted ie produced the bevelled gear shafts, for mills such as Nile Mill, Chadderton. The period 1904-1914 was productive, when they created 14,300 ihp for 9 Oldham mills. &lt;ref name=GH15/&gt;

'''Launch on warning''' ('''LOW''') is a strategy of [[second strike|nuclear weapon retaliation]] that gained recognition during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. With the invention of [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs), launch on warning became an integral part of [[mutually assured destruction]] (MAD) theory. Under the strategy, a retaliatory strike is launched upon warning of enemy nuclear attack while its missiles are still in the air and before detonation occurs. U.S. land-based missiles can reportedly be launched
within five minutes of a presidential decision to do so, and submarine-based missiles within 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/01/Hair-Trigger%20FAQ.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the introduction of [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]] (ICBMs), the U.S. [[Strategic Air Command]] had multiple bombers on patrol at all times&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/agency/sac.htm Globalsecurity.org, Strategic Air Command.] Accessed 23 February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; like, presumably, its Soviet counterpart.{{cn|date=September 2015}} In the event of a nuclear strike by one of the nations, the other nation would order its bombers to fly to the other country and drop their nuclear payload on predetermined targets. In the United States, the bombers were typically either [[B-47 Stratojet]]s or [[B-52 Stratofortress]]es, and there were three major flight routes. Keeping bombers in the air assured that a [[second strike]] would be feasible even if the [[first strike]] were to impair ground facilities. At the height of the Cold War, the United States had special [[Boeing EC-135#Looking Glass|Boeing EC-135 "Looking Glass"]] aircraft equipped as control centers for the nuclear arsenal. The battle staff included a general or flag officer who was authorized to order a retaliatory strike if the President could not be contacted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/special/ec135.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110193544/http://www.fas.org/programs/ssp/man/uswpns/air/special/ec135.html |archivedate=10 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launch on warning has its roots in US President [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s "Positive Control" strategy but really took shape with the introduction of the [[Minuteman missile]]. Since many ICBMs (including the Minuteman) were launched from underground silos, the concern arose that a first strike, by one nation, could destroy the ground launch facilities of the retaliating nation.

In 1997, the [[Clinton administration]] changed the official policy away from launch on warning to one of retaliation after withstanding an initial first strike.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of nuclear-tipped ICBMs required new strategies because unlike bombers, ICBMs cannot be recalled after launch. There were two primary options. One option, "retaliation after ride-out", required the second-strike nation to wait until after it was attacked to launch their missiles. Some portion of the nuclear arsenal would inevitably be destroyed in such an attack, which led to both superpowers investing heavily in survivable basing modes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1970/jan-feb/widder.html Launch on Warning: A Counter to the Arms Race&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for their nuclear forces, including hardened underground missile silos for ICBMs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/Research/NationalSecurity/bg120.cfm Insuring Survivability: Basing the MX Missile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The other choice was "launch on warning", launching nuclear missiles before the other side's missiles could destroy them. That became possible primarily because of improvements in missile technology that allowed for faster launches,&lt;ref name=nsa2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Burr|first=William|title=Launch on Warning: The Development of U.S. Capabilities, 1959-1979|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB43/|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=24 February 2011|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with invention of the [[Ballistic Missile Early Warning System]] in the early 1960s, which made it possible for the US to detect the launch of Soviet missiles.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} The capability was further enhanced in the 1970s with the deployment of space-based launch detection technology on both sides, the American geosynchronous [[Defense Support Program]] and Soviet [[Oko]] satellites. Evidence found in declassified documents suggests that launch on warning was at least in part the policy of the United States from the late 1950s through to at least the 1970s.&lt;ref name = nsa2001/&gt;

Strategies are available that can reduce the effectiveness of a launch-on-warning stance. For example, the first-strike nation can use a technique called X-ray pin-down to delay a retaliatory response. It involves a barrage of submarine-based missiles fired from close range in a "depressed trajectory" mode that reaches its targets in minutes. The warheads would be set to explode every minute or so at high altitudes, which significantly disrupts the ability of the attacked nation to launch its own ICBMs.&lt;ref&gt;John Steinbruner, "Launch under Attack", ''Scientific American'', January 1984, pp. 37–47&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, submarines could launch a depressed-trajectory strike against the capital of the targeted country in an effort to destroy its command structure before any retaliatory decision could be made; that is known as a [[decapitation strike]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The deployment of submarine-launched ballistic missiles ([[SLBM]]s) decreases the strategic need for a launch-on-warning strategy. These submarines are capable of hiding in the ocean during an attack, thus ensuring that a second strike can be made even if the attacked country is unable to launch a land-based counterstrike.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

'''Lennart Möller''' is a professor of environmental medicine at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in  [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ki.se/en/people/lemoll web page at the Karolinska Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;  He  received  a doctor's degree in [[Medical sciences]] from the Karolinska Institute in 1988, with a thesis "2-nitrofluorene, in vivo metabolism and assessment of cancer risk of an air pollutant" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/2-nitrofluorene-in-vivo-metabolism-and-assessment-of-cancer-risk-of-an-air-pollutant/oclc/186566989&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat item entry ]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the editor and author of several books in popular sciences and theology covering urban air quality, [[cancer]], [[environmental medicine]], [[ethics]], and [[photography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.envimed.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/wcidentities/np-moller,%20lennart WorldCat author listing]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the deputy chairman of the board for the [[Lennart Nilsson Award]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lennartnilssonaward.se/&lt;/ref&gt; an international prize in scientific photography.

The statement expresses skepticism about the ability of [[Random mutation#Mutation|random mutations]] and [[natural selection]] to account for the complexity of life, and encourages careful examination of the evidence for "[[Darwinism]]", a term intelligent design proponents use to refer to [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Forrest"&gt;{{cite web|author=Forrest B |pages=5 |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf |title=UNDERSTANDING THE INTELLIGENT DESIGN CREATIONIST MOVEMENT: ITS TRUE NATURE AND GOALS |format=pdf |publisher=Center for Inquiry, Inc. |year=2007 |accessdate=25 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519124655/http://www.centerforinquiry.net/uploads/attachments/intelligent-design.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}.  "As I stated earlier, Johnson, Dembski, and their associates have assumed the task of destroying 'Darwinism,' 'evolutionary naturalism,' 'scientific materialism,' 'methodological naturalism,' 'philosophical naturalism,' and other 'isms' they use as synonyms for evolution."&lt;/ref&gt; Its claims have been rejected by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/media/voices/science Statements from Scientific Organizations] [[National Center for Science Education]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-615-20461-1|author=Sager C|title=Voices for Evolution|publisher=National Center for Science Education, Inc.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Möller is also the author of ''The Exodus Case'', a 448-page book published in 2002 and revised and expanded in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/exodus-case/oclc/52427568&amp;referer=brief_results WorldCat item record]&lt;/ref&gt; The book expounds Moller's theory about the route of the biblical Exodus from Egypt, in particular that a mountain called [[Jabal al-Lawz]] in [[Saudi Arabia]] is the biblical Mount Sinai.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=WABrBgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Exodus-Case-Lennart-Moller/dp/8772477083/&lt;/ref&gt;

A review by Swedish archaeologist Martin Rundkvist stated that "Möller emphasizes that he is neither a theologian, a historian nor an archaeologist." and concludes with "The Exodus Case is such an extreme example of pseudo-science that any reasonably well-informed reader will wonder if Möller is joking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rundkvist|first1=Martin|title=Biblical Pseudoarchaeology by a Swedish Professor of Medicine|journal=Skeptical Inquirer|date=November–December 2004|volume=28|issue=6|url=http://www.algonet.se/~arador/rec/exoduscase_2000.html|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review on the ''[[:de:Studiengemeinschaft Wort und Wissen|Studiengemeinschaft Wort und Wissen]]'' (Study Community Word and Knowledge) website, whose members take a literal approach to the Bible, stated that it contained such "serious substantive and methodological errors" that it could not be recommended while agreeing that the Exodus took place. Peter van der Veen and Uwe Zerbst specifically criticized his identification of [[Jabal al-Lawz]] with [[Mount Sinai]] and a number of the geographical locations he thought to be part of the Exodus route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=van der veen|first1=Peter|last2=Erbst|first2=Uwe|title=Die Akte Exodus|url=http://www.wort-und-wissen.de/info/i12/1/i12-1.html|website=Wort und Wissen|publisher=Studiengemeinschaft Wort und Wissen|accessdate=13 June 2015|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4402">[[Image:Girardin.jpg|thumb|right|Marc Girardin]]
'''Saint-Marc Girardin''' (22 February 1801 – 1 April 1873) was a French politician and [[Intellectual|man of letters]], whose real name was '''Marc Girardin'''.

==Biography==
Girardin was born in Paris. After a brilliant university career in the city, he began in 1828 to contribute to the ''[[Journal des Débats]]'', on the staff of which he remained for nearly half a century. After the [[July Revolution]] and the accession of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] as ''[[List of French monarchs|King of the French]]'' (the [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberal]] ''[[July Monarchy]]''), he was appointed professor of history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] and ''master of requests'' in the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]. Soon afterwards he exchanged his chair of history for one of poetry, continuing to contribute political articles to the ''Journal des Débats'', and sitting as deputy in the Chamber from 1835 to 1848.

In 1833, he was charged with a mission to study [[German Confederation|German]] [[Education in Germany|methods of education]], and issued a report advocating the necessity of newer methods and of technical instruction. In 1844 he was elected a member of the [[Académie française|French Academy]].

During the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolution of February 1848]] Girardin was for a moment a minister, but after the establishment of the [[Second French Republic]], he was not re-elected deputy in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].

After the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he was returned to the [[Bordeaux]] assembly by his old ''[[Département in France|département]]'' &amp;mdash; [[Haute-Vienne]]. His [[Orléanist]] tendencies and his objections to the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]] were strong, and although he at first supported [[Adolphe Thiers]], he afterwards became a leader of the opposition to the [[President of the French Republic|president]]. He died, however, in 1873 at [[Morsang-sur-Seine]], before Theirs was actually driven from power.

==Works==
His chief work is his ''Cours de littérature dramatique'' (1843–1863), a series of lectures better described by its second title ''De l'usage des passions dans le drame''. The author examined dramatic passions, discussing the mode in which they are treated in ancient and modern drama, poetry and romance. The book, a defence of the ancients against the moderns, "did not", according to the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'', "take into account the fact that only the best of ancient literature has come down to us." Girardin's ''oeuvre'' was, overall, very hostile toward [[Romanticism]].

Girardin's other works included ''Essais de littérature'' (2 vols., 1844), made up chiefly of contributions to the ''Débats'', his ''Notices sur l'Allemagne'' (1834), and many volumes of collected ''Souvenirs'', ''Réflexions'', etc., on foreign countries and passing events (including his notes on the [[Regulamentul Organic|period of Russian administration]] in the [[Danubian Principalities]]). His last major works were ''[[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]] et les Fabulistes'' (1867) and an ''Étude sur [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|J.-J. Rousseau]]'' (1870) which had appeared in the ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]''.

{{Arab-Israeli conflict (topics)}}
'''Media coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict''' by [[journalist]]s in international [[news media]] has been said to be biased by both sides and independent observers. These perceptions of bias, possibly exacerbated by the [[hostile media effect]],&lt;ref&gt;Vallone, R. P., Ross, L., &amp; Lepper, M. R. (1985). [http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~jpiliavi/965/hwang.pdf The hostile media phenomenon: Biased Perception and Perceptions of Media Bias in Coverage of the "Beirut Massacre".] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', '''49''', 577–585. [http://faculty.babson.edu/krollag/org_site/soc_psych/vallone_beirut.html summary].&lt;/ref&gt; have generated more complaints of partisan reporting than any other news topic and have led to a proliferation of [[Watchdog journalism|media watchdog groups]].&lt;!-- dead ref, no version via https://web.archive.org because of robots.txt &lt;ref name="theotherwar"&gt;[http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2003/3/bias.asp The Other War: A Debate] by [[Columbia Journalism Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name=HR-7Principles/&gt;

==Types of bias==
Bias in print and broadcast media may manifest itself in varying ways, including:

===Diction===
{{see also|Euphemism|Connotation|Framing (social sciences)}}
Diction, or word choice, affects the interpretation of the same set of entities or events. There is an emotional and semantic difference between the verbs ''died'' and ''killed,'' and similarly between ''kill'' and ''murder''; ''murder'' evokes stronger negative emotions and connotes intent. In the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], various terminological issues arise. The terms "disputed territories" versus "occupied territories" reflect different positions on the legal status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The terms "security fence" and "apartheid wall," "neighbourhood" and "settlement," and "militant," "freedom fighter," and "terrorist," while used to describe the same entities, present them in a different light and suggest a different narrative. Similarly, describing an attack or bombing as a "response" or "retaliation" again places the events in a different light.

====Retaliation====
A study by the American organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] monitored the use of the term "retaliation" in the nightly news broadcasts of the three main American networks CBS, ABC, and NBC between September 2000 through March 17, 2002. It found that of the 150 occasions when "retaliate" and its variants were used to describe attacks in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict,  79 percent were references to Israel "retaliating" and only 9 percent were references to Palestinians "retaliating".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/activism/network-retaliation.html Fair.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115042817/http://www.fair.org/activism/network-retaliation.html |date=2009-01-15 }}, In U.S. Media, Palestinians Attack, Israel Retaliates&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emotive language====
[[Image:MediaCoverageOfTheArabIsraeliConflict wallorfence.png|thumb|right|300px]]
In a study of BBC television news coverage, the [[Glasgow Media Group]] documented differences in the language used by journalists for Israelis and Palestinians. The study found that terms such as "atrocity," "brutal murder," "mass murder," "savage cold blooded killing," "lynching" and "slaughter" were used to describe the death of Israelis but not the death of Palestinians. The word "terrorist" was often used to describe Palestinians. However, in reports of an Israeli group attempting to bomb a Palestinian school, members of the Israeli group were referred to as "extremists" or "vigilantes" but not as "terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;Greg Philo and Mike Berry, Bad News From Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omission===
In the context of [[News media|media]], an omission refers to the failure to include information. This selective inclusion of information, which results from omitting other information, may distort the presentation of events in favor of one side or the other. In the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], for example, consider the difference in overall impact between:
*An article mentioning both a Palestinian suicide bombing in Israel and an Israeli offensive in the West Bank
*An article mentioning only the Palestinian suicide bombing
*An article mentioning only the Israeli offensive

In a 2001 study done by [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting|FAIR]], only 4% of the US media mentioned that an [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation by Israel]] is occurring.&lt;ref name="Uprising Without Explanation"&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1055 Uprising Without Explanation] Extra! January/February 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In an update to the study, the number has reportedly gone down to only 2% of the media mentioning an occupation.&lt;ref name="fair.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3714|title=FAIR challenges CBC Ombud’s Report|work=FAIR|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 figure is also seen in the documentary ''[[Peace, Propaganda &amp; the Promised Land|Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land]]''.&lt;ref name="Uprising Without Explanation"/&gt;

[[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America]] (CAMERA) (a pro-Israel group) notes that factual errors can be errors of omission, where something important was not said, resulting in readers being misled, or commission, where information used is not true.&lt;ref name="camera_canyoutrusteverythingyouread"&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=22&amp;x_article=165 Critical Thinking: Can You Trust Everything You Read?] by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Honest Reporting]] have asked the following questions : "was the reporting one-sided and imbalanced?";and "was key information missing (selective omission)?"&lt;ref name="honestreporting_understandingbias"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.com/a/understandBias.asp|title=HonestReporting|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605041152/http://www.honestreporting.com/a/understandBias.asp|archivedate=5 June 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palestine Media Watch]] in its "Media critique quick sheet" asked the following questions: "how many times were UN reports/findings/resolutions mentioned?"; "How many times were Human Rights reports/findings/statements mentioned?"; "did the story describe official Palestinian denials/pleas of ignorance and innocence in violent acts?" and "did the story describe official Israelis denials/pleas of ignorance and innocence in violent acts?"

===Lack of verification===
{{see also|Journalism ethics and standards|Media ethics|Journalistic scandal}}

The [[Journalism ethics and standards|ethics and standards of journalism]] require [[Journalism|journalists]] to verify the factual accuracy of the information they report.  Factual verification" is what separates journalism from other modes of communication, such as propaganda, fiction or entertainment".&lt;ref name="pej"&gt;[http://www.journalism.org/resources/principles Principles of Journalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505015451/http://journalism.org/resources/principles |date=2008-05-05 }} by [[Project for Excellence in Journalism|PEJ]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of verification involves the publication of potentially unreliable information prior to or without independent confirmation of the facts, and has resulted in various [[Journalistic scandal|scandals]]. In the context of the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]], for example, consider:
*The [[Battle of Jenin]], after which early media reports claimed that Israel "massacred" hundreds of Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Hundreds of victims 'were buried by bulldozer in mass grave| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/04/13/wmid213.xml|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=April 13, 2002 | location=London | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Jenin 'massacre evidence growing'| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1937048.stm| publisher=[[BBC]]| date=April 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ben Wedeman: Access to Jenin difficult| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/04/11/wedeman.otsc/index.html| publisher=[[CNN]]| date=April 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later investigations by the [[United Nations]] and [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated the total Palestinian death toll at 52 (with estimates of civilian deaths ranging from 22 to 26) and contradicted previous claims that a massacre had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/peace/jenin/ Report of the Secretary-General on Jenin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806175121/http://www.un.org/peace/jenin/ |date=August 6, 2002 }} by the [[United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2002/israel3/israel0502-05.htm#P234_38516|title=Jenin: IDF Military Operations|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| title=UN says no massacre in Jenin| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2165272.stm| publisher=[[BBC]]| date=August 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| title=U.N. report: No massacre in Jenin| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2002-08-01-unreport-jenin_x.htm| publisher=[[USA Today]]| date=August 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Death on the campus: Jenin; U.N.

*The [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad|Islamic Jihad]] shooting attack on [[Kiryat Arba]] in November 2002, which Western media reports described as an attack on "worshipers," resulting in international condemnations.&lt;ref name="SalonManu"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/11/19/hebron/| title=Manufacturing a Massacre| publisher=[[Salon.com|Salon]]| date=November 19, 2002| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606232957/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/11/19/hebron/| archivedate=June 6, 2011| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2002/sgsm8498.doc.htm|title=SECRETARY-GENERAL CONDEMNS 'DESPICABLE' HEBRON TERRORIST ATTACK|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Jerusalem Post]], [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad|Islamic Jihad]] "opened fire at a [sic] security forces safeguarding Jewish worshipers," and according to both [[Haaretz]] and the [[Jerusalem Post]], the twelve Israelis killed all belonged to the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], the [[Israeli Border Police]], or the Hebron security force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Victims of the Hebron shooting attack| url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=231197&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=4&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y| publisher=[[Haaretz]]| date=November 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=12 killed in Hebron Shabbat eve ambush| url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/CasualtiesOfWar/2002_11_15.html| publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]| date=November 15, 2002| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503040123/http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/CasualtiesOfWar/2002_11_15.html| archivedate=May 3, 2008| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Honest Reporting]] (a pro-Israel group) believe that many media outlets devoted huge amounts of ink to "unverified Palestinian tales of conspiracies, mass murders, common graves, and war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/Atrocities_of_the_British_Press.asp|title=Atrocities of the British Press|work=HonestReporting|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827213600/http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/critiques/Atrocities_of_the_British_Press.asp|archivedate=27 August 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CAMERA believe that when dealing with vilification of Israel, facts remain unchecked, accusations remain unverified, and journalistic responsibility is replaced by disclaimers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=8&amp;x_nameinnews=118&amp;x_article=198 Edward Said's Documented Deceptions] by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selective reporting===
[[File:MediaCoverageArabIsraeliConflictSelectivityGiladShalit.jpg|frame|right|A pro-Palestinian webcomic about the capture of [[Gilad Shalit|Israeli Cpl. Gilad Shalit]] ]]
Selective reporting involves devoting more resources, such as news articles or air time, to the coverage of one side of the story over another. [[Honest Reporting]] has asked whether "equal time" was granted to both sides of the conflict, or was one side given preferential treatment – hence lending more weight and credibility to that side's positions.&lt;ref name="honestreporting_understandingbias" /&gt;

In the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], FAIR believe the media in the United States downplay violence against Palestinians and stated that [[National Public Radio]] reported more Israeli casualties of the Arab–Israeli conflict than Palestinian casualties by percentage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/activism/npr-israel-quiet.html For NPR, Violence Is Calm if It's Violence Against Palestinians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514145307/http://www.fair.org/activism/npr-israel-quiet.html |date=2008-05-14 }} by [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]&lt;/ref&gt; CAMERA made the opposite complaint – that NPR gave pro-Arab speakers 77% more time than Israeli or pro-Israeli speakers, and segments that included only pro-Arab speakers were almost twice as numerous and four times as long as those that omitted Arab speakers altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=4&amp;x_outlet=28&amp;x_article=70 NPR Distorts Even Its Bias] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070905235848/http://camera.org/index.asp?x_context=4&amp;x_outlet=28&amp;x_article=70 |date=2007-09-05 }} by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|NPR controversies#Allegations of bias for and against Israel}}

===Decontextualization===
Decontextualization is a type of [[#Omission|omission]] in which the omitted information is essential to understanding a decision, action, or event, its underlying motivations or key events leading up to it. In the context of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], for example, consider the effect of the following:
* An article discussing the [[West Bank Barrier]] which does not mention the suicide bombings of the [[Second Intifada]]
* An article discussing the [[2006 Hamas Election Victory]] which does not mention the corruption of [[Fatah]]

Honest Reporting believe that failing to provide proper context and full background information, journalists can dramatically distort the true picture.&lt;ref name="honestreporting_objectivityandthemedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.com/a/media_objectivity.asp|title=HonestReporting|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226205756/http://www.honestreporting.com/a/media_objectivity.asp|archivedate=26 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMERA believes it to be a frequent problem when reporting about the Middle East.

==Reasons for bias==
{{unbalanced|section|date=September 2013}}
{{rquote|right|The world is not responding to events in this country, but rather to the description of these events by news organizations. The key to understanding the strange nature of the response is thus to be found in the practice of journalism, and specifically in a severe malfunction that is occurring in that profession—my profession—here in Israel.|[[Matti Friedman]], 2014&lt;ref name=HR-7Principles&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=HonestReporting|title=The 7 Principles of Media Objectivity|url=http://honestreporting.com/7-principles-of-media-objectivity/|accessdate=25 June 2015|publisher=HonestReporting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriedmanM-IsraelBiasCause&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Matti|title=An Insider’s Guide to the Most Important Story on Earth  A former AP correspondent explains how and why reporters get Israel so wrong, and why it matters|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/183033/israel-insider-guide|accessdate=25 June 2015|agency=www.tabletmag.com|publisher=Nextbook Inc.|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Print and broadcast media may be biased for varying reasons,&lt;ref name=HR-7Principles/&gt; including:

===Coercion or censorship===
[[File:MediaCoverageArabIsraeliConflict CoercionCensorship DryBones.jpg|thumb|frame|right|A comic from [[DryBonesBlog|DryBones]] about the [[Kidnapping of Alan Johnston|kidnapping]] of [[BBC]] reporter [[Alan Johnston]] and a decision by the [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] to boycott Israeli goods]]
{{Main|Media of Israel}}
{{see also|Israeli Military Censor}}
Coercion or censorship refers to the use of intimidation or force to promote favorable reports and to confiscate unfavorable reports. In the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, both sides accuse each other of coercion or censorship as an explanation of alleged bias in favor of the other side. In support of these claims, Israeli advocates point to kidnappings of foreign reporters by Palestinians, while Palestinian advocates point to [[media blackout]]s and confiscation of reports by Israelis. Additionally, both sides point to reports by both governmental and non-governmental organizations, which assess the degree of journalistic freedom in the region. See [[Media of Israel]] and [[Human rights in Israel#Freedom of speech and the media]].

===Forgery or falsification===
{{see also|Journalistic fraud|Forgery|Fraud}}
Forgery or falsification involves the intentional misrepresentation, alteration, or invention of reported information. Due to the severity of these actions, which violate the [[Journalism ethics and standards|ethics and standards of journalism]], instances of forgery and/or falsification are [[#Frequently cited incidents|frequently cited]] by Israelis and their advocates and/or by Palestinians and their advocates—depending on the nature of the forgery and/or falsification—in order to support claims that the media favors the other side.
HonestReporting commented on the [[2006 Lebanon War photographs controversies]] that "A Reuters photo turns out to be an outright lie, manipulated to make damage in Beirut appear much worse than reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/Bold_Distortions_and_Outright_Lies.asp|title=Bold Distortions and Outright Lies|work=HonestReporting|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053625/http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/Bold_Distortions_and_Outright_Lies.asp|archivedate=5 December 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For additional claims see [[Pallywood]]

===Placement===
{{see also|Headline|Serial position effect|Primacy effect|Recency effect}}
According to  CAMERA,
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=13 Headlines &amp; Graphics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302090914/http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=13 |date=2008-03-02 }} by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;
headlines are the first, and sometimes only, news items seen by readers and should provide the accurate and specific essence of a news story. It criticized ''[[The New York Times]]'' for the placement of news stories about the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], focusing heavily on Palestinian suffering while continually minimizing the personal toll on Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=35&amp;x_article=25 New York Times Skews Israeli-Palestinian Crisis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611202736/http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=35&amp;x_article=25 |date=2007-06-11 }} by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exaggeration or sensationalism===
[[Sensationalism]], in general, is a form of being extremely controversial, loud, or attention grabbing. In the context of the media, sensationalism refers to claims that the media chooses to report on shocking events or to exaggerate, at the expense of accuracy and objectivity, in order to improve viewer, listener or readership ratings. This criticism, also known as [[media circus]], is proffered by both Israelis and Palestinians as a possible explanation for alleged bias.

[[HonestReporting]] believes a new de facto "stylebook" is being used by the media which sensationalize the intensity and scope of Israeli military actions. the following regarding sensationalism:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/reports/-New_Rules-_For_Mideast_Reporting.asp "New Rules" For Mideast Reporting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015203847/http://honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/reports/-New_Rules-_For_Mideast_Reporting.asp |date=2007-10-15 }} by HonestReporting&lt;/ref&gt; CAMERA criticized ''[[Haaretz]]'' for using a sensational headline:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=31&amp;x_article=783|title=CAMERA: Selective Quotes Distort Intent of Sharon's Gaza Withdrawal|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudiced journalists===
Journalists may intentionally or unintentionally distort reports due to political ideology, national affiliation, antisemitism, anti-Arabism, or Islamophobia.

[[Richard Falk]], United Nations special rapporteur on Palestinian human rights, has stated that in the media-distorted picture surrounding the Middle East, those who reports honestly and factually are accused of bias, whereas pro-Israel bias is perceived as mainstream. Falk has stated that because the media don't adequately report violations of international law by Israel, "the American public isn't aware of the behavior of Israel or the victimization of the Palestinian people. This creates a kind of imbalance."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacbee.com/2012/06/09/4549418/un-official-says-media-biased.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
CAMERA attributed [[Christiane Amanpour]]'s allegedly biased news coverage to her political ideology;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=3&amp;x_outlet=14&amp;x_article=1370 Amanpour's Troubling Journalism] by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ira Stoll]] of the ''[[New York Sun]]'', and formerly of the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', attributes alleged anti-Israel media bias in part to reporters of Jewish background.&lt;ref name="theotherwar"&gt;[http://cjrarchives.org/issues/2003/3/bias.asp The Other War: A Debate] by [[Columbia Journalism Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contentious incidents==
{{unbalanced|section|date=June 2012}}
{{see also|Journalistic scandal}}
In order to substantiate claims that the media favors the other side, participants in the conflict on each side frequently cite a number of illustrative and extreme examples of controversial reporting. This section lists incidents of controversial reporting frequently cited by only Israelis and Israel advocates, by only Palestinians and Palestinian advocates, or by both sides. The list of incidents appear chronologically, according to when the incident took place. Where events took place on the same date, the incidents appear sorted alphabetically.
&lt;!--INCLUSION CRITERIA
Though there have been a number of controversial news reports regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict, reports listed in the "frequently cited incidents" section must meet the following criteria:
1. The reported information was refuted by one or more prominent governmental or non-governmental organizations, or
2. The reported information was admitted to be false by the publisher, or
3. The reported information was called into question by a high contracting party or by notable persons (e.g. a high-ranking government official of Israel or the Palestinian Authority)
AND
1. At least one pro-Israel/pro-Palestinian media watchdog group has referred to the incident on more than one occasion, or
2. Several pro-Israel/pro-Palestinian media watchdog groups have referred to the incident.

===Photo of Tuvia Grossman===
[[Image:grossmanattack.jpg|thumbnail|200px|right| [[Associated Press]] photograph misidentified [[Tuvia Grossman]]'s nationality and the photograph's location, and implied police brutality by Grossman's Israeli rescuer.]]
On September 30, 2000, ''[[The New York Times]]'', the [[Associated Press]], and other media outlets published a photograph of a club-wielding Israeli police officer standing over a battered and bleeding young man.&lt;ref name=NYTtuvia/&gt; The photograph's caption identified the young man as a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and the location as the [[Temple Mount]].&lt;ref name=NYTtuvia/&gt; The young man in the picture was 20-year-old [[Tuvia Grossman]], a [[Jewish]] American student from Chicago who had been studying at a [[Yeshiva]] in [[Israel]]; the [[Israel]]i police officer in the photograph, actually came to his rescue by threatening his Palestinian assailants.&lt;ref name="nytimes_aldura_oct7_correction"&gt;{{cite news|title=Corrections| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C02EEDD123CF934A35753C1A9669C8B63|work=[[New York Times]]| date=October 7, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a complaint by Grossman's father, ''The New York Times'' issued a correction on October 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corrections| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E6DF1E3DF937A35753C1A9669C8B63|work=[[New York Times]]| date=October 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the ''Times'' published an article about the incident and printed a more complete correction.&lt;ref name=NYTtuvia /&gt; The ''Times'' attributed the error to a misidentification by the Israeli agency that took the photo compounded by a further misidentification by the Associated Press "which had received many pictures of injured Palestinians that day".&lt;ref name=NYTtuvia&gt;{{cite news| title=Abruptly, a U.S. Student In Mideast Turmoil's Grip| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5DB153CF934A35753C1A9669C8B63|work=[[New York Times]]| date=October 7, 2000 |first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_aldura_oct7_correction" /&gt;

The Grossman photo appears frequently in Israeli criticisms of the media, because the photograph implied that the police officer who rescued Grossman had beaten him, it implied an Israeli perpetrator, it implied a Palestinian victim, and it conveyed the opposite of what had transpired.&lt;ref name="honestreporting_thephotothatstarteditall"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/reports/The_Photo_that_Started_it_All.asp|title=The Photo that Started it All|work=HonestReporting|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118155341/http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/reports/The_Photo_that_Started_it_All.asp|archivedate=18 January 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fraudfactor_grossman"&gt;[http://www.fraudfactor.com/ffmediafraud9001.html New York Times Media Fraud, Incompetence, and Bias] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414131452/http://www.fraudfactor.com/ffmediafraud9001.html |date=2008-04-14 }} by [[Fraud Factor]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/jewishissues/israeldiary/Victim_of_the_Media_War.asp|title=Redirecting...|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.std.com/~camera/docs/alert/tuvia-up.html Photo Falsehood and the Rosh Hashanah Riots] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930223257/http://world.std.com/~camera/docs/alert/tuvia-up.html |date=2007-09-30 }} by [[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]]&lt;/ref&gt; Seth Ackerman of [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]] described the attention given to the photo, as well as the two ''[[New York Times|NYT]]'' corrections, as disproportionate to a "plausible, though careless" assumption resulting from "garbled information from the Israeli photographer".&lt;ref&gt;Seth Ackerman (2001), [http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/those-arent-stones-theyre-rocks/ Those Aren't Stones, They're Rocks].&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2006, ''[[The Independent]]'' published an article, by [[Robert Fisk]], which speculated, based on information from the [[European Committee on Radiation Risk]], that Israel may have used [[depleted uranium]] weapons during the [[2006 Lebanon War]].&lt;ref name="independent_mystery"&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Fisk: Mystery of Israel's secret uranium bomb |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/fisk/robert-fisk-mystery-of-israels-secret-uranium-bomb-421960.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 28, 2006 |location=London |accessdate=May 12, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010195321/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/fisk/robert-fisk-mystery-of-israels-secret-uranium-bomb-421960.html |archivedate=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article prompted criticism by HonestReporting for coming to conclusions prematurely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.co.uk/articles/critiques/Indies_Uranium_Charges.asp|title=honestreporting.co.uk|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601135704/http://www.honestreporting.co.uk/articles/critiques/Indies_Uranium_Charges.asp|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in an investigation by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref name="independent_investigates"&gt;{{cite news |title=UN investigates Israel's 'uranium weapons' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/un-investigates-israels-uranium-weapons-422210.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=October 30, 2006 |location=London |first=Eric |last=Silver |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 8, 2006, [[UNEP]] concluded that [[Israel]] had not used any form of [[uranium]]-based weapons.&lt;ref name="un_nouranium"&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel did not use depleted uranium during conflict with Hizbollah, UN agency finds |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20532&amp;Cr=leban&amp;Cr1 |publisher=[[UN News Centre]] |date=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynet_nouranium"&gt;{{cite news |title=UN: No IDF uranium bomb use in Lebanon |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3325254,00.html |publisher=[[YNet]] |date=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Israelis]] and [[Israel]] advocates cite the article as an instance of "shoddy journalism", arising allegedly as a result of [[#Exaggeration or sensationalism|media sensationalism]].&lt;ref name="honestreporting_noretractionforindiesfalseuraniumlibel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.co.uk/articles/critiques/No_Retraction_For_Indies_False_Uranium_Libel.asp|title=honestreporting.co.uk|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601160302/http://www.honestreporting.co.uk/articles/critiques/No_Retraction_For_Indies_False_Uranium_Libel.asp|archivedate=1 June 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samir Kuntar as a hero===
On 19 July 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon that covered the "welcome-home" festivities for [[Samir Kuntar]], a Lebanese militant who had been imprisoned in Israel for murdering several people, including a four-year-old child, in a [[Palestine Liberation Front]] raid from Lebanon into Israel. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar as a "pan-Arab hero" and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) threatened to boycott the satellite channel unless it apologized. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, in which he admitted that the program violated the station's Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel's programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/video-al-jazeera-admits-to-unethical-behavior-over-kuntar-party-1.251274 Al-Jazeera admits to 'unethical' behavior over Kuntar party] By Yoav Stern and Haaretz Correspondent&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/media-blog/33223/honoring-samir-kuntar/greg-pollowitz Honoring Samir Kuntar] By Greg Pollowitz, NRO’s MSM watchdog.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1818.htm #1818 - Al-Jazeera TV Throws a Birthday Party for Released Lebanese Terrorist Samir Al-Quntar].

===Baby death date misrepresentation===
A Gaza man falsely claimed that his five-month-old baby died on March 23, 2012, when the generator powering his respirator ran out of fuel, a result of the Egyptian blockade on Gaza and Egyptian cut-off of fuel to Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/10162374 |title=Gaza baby dies after respirator runs out of fuel |work=The Guardian |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baby's death, which had been "confirmed" by a Gaza health official, would have been the first to be connected with the territory's energy shortage. The baby's father, Abdul-Halim Helou, said that his son Mohammed was born with a lymphatic disorder and needed removal of the fluids that accumulated in his respiratory system, and had only a few months to live. He said that they had erred in how much fuel was required and that if they had been "living in a normal country with electricity", his son's chances of living longer would have been better.&lt;ref name="Baby Hamas "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4207715,00.html |title=Hamas blames fuel shortage for Gaza baby's death |work=Yedioth Ahronot |date=25 March 2012 |accessdate=October 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the report was called into question when it emerged that the timing of the baby's death had been misrepresented, and appeared to be an attempt by Gaza's Hamas rulers to exploit the death to gain sympathy.&lt;ref name="Baby Hamas" /&gt; The [[Associated Press]] later learned that news of Mohammed Helou's death had already appeared on March 4 in the local Arabic newspaper Al-Quds and that Hamas was now trying to recycle the story to capitalize on the family's tragedy. The Al-Quds article contained the same details as the later report, but with an earlier date.&lt;ref name=YahooBaby /&gt;&lt;ref name=HeraldSunBaby /&gt; When confronted by the Associated Press, the family and Hamas official Bassem al-Qadri continued to insist that the baby had only recently died. The AP reporter Diaa Hadid tweeted, "#Hamas misrepresented a story. Two Hamas officials misled us and so did the family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/diaahadid |title=Diaa Hadid Tweets |publisher=Twitter |date=26 March 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaza is a coastal plain, bordering the Negev desert which witnesses flash floods during heavy rains as water runs across the surface of the impervious desert soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geckogo.com/Guide/Israel/Natural-Environment/Climate/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901093540/http://www.geckogo.com/Guide/Israel/Natural-Environment/Climate/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-09-01 |title=Israel Natural Environment |publisher=Geckogo.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Peace, Propaganda, and the Promised Land''===

==Other criticisms==
; False compromise
{{see also|False compromise|Middle ground|Moral equivalence|Moral relativism}}
False compromise refers to the claim, made by some Israeli advocates and by some Palestinian advocates, that their side of the conflict is morally right and the other side is morally wrong and, therefore, attempts to balance the presentation of both viewpoints wrongfully suggests that both sides are morally equivalent.  In the words of journalist [[Bret Stephens]], "Moral clarity is a term that doesn't get much traction these days, least of all among journalists, who prefer 'objectivity' and 'balance.' Yet good journalism is more than about separating fact from opinion and being fair. Good journalism is about fine analysis and making distinctions, and this applies as much to moral distinctions as to any others. Because too many reporters today refuse to make moral distinctions, we are left with a journalism whose narrative and analytical failings have become ever more glaring".&lt;ref&gt;''Eye on the Media: Depending on your 'point of view' '' by [[Bret Stephens]] on [[Jerusalem Post]], quoted from [http://watch.windsofchange.net/themes_16.htm Watch – "Immoral equivalency"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030705210224/http://watch.windsofchange.net/themes_16.htm |date=2003-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Structural geographic bias

Structural geographic bias refers to the claim, made by some Palestinian advocates, that the Western media favors Israel, allegedly as a result of Western reporters living in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/24/weekinreview/24okrent.html|title=The Hottest Button: How The Times Covers Israel and Palestine|date=24 April 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040829150852/http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=2364 Killings Of Dozens Once Again Called Period Of Calm By US Media] by Michael Brown and [[Ali Abunimah]] on [[ZNet]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet and social media==

Advocacy groups, governments and individuals use the [[internet]], [[new media]] and [[social media]] to try to influence public perceptions of both sides in the Arab/Palestinian–Israeli conflict.

===Facebook===
[[Facebook]] is a [[social networking website]], which allows users to connect and interact with other people online, both directly by "friending" people and indirectly through the creation of groups. Because the website allows users to join networks organized by city, workplace, school, and region, Facebook has become embroiled in a number of regional conflicts. [[Facebook groups]] such as "'Palestine' Is not a country... De-list it from Facebook as a country!" and "Israel is not a country! ... Delist it from Facebook as a country!", among others reflecting the mutual non-recognition of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, have protested Facebook's listing of Israel and Palestine, respectively, as countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Playing politics on Facebook|url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/209925 |work=[[Toronto Star|The Star]]|date=May 3, 2007 |location=Toronto |first=Antonia |last=Zerbisias |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controversy became particularly heated when, in response to protests over Palestine being listed as a country, Facebook delisted it. The move infuriated Palestinian users and prompted the creation of numerous Facebook groups such as "The Official Petition to get Palestine listed as a Country", "Against delisting Palestine from Facebook", and "If Palestine is removed from Facebook ... I'm closing my account".&lt;ref name="jpost_facebook_debate" /&gt; Facebook, in response to user complaints, ultimately reinstated Palestine as a country network.&lt;ref name="jpost_facebook_debate" /&gt; A similar controversy took place regarding the status of [[Israeli settlements]]. When Israeli settlements were moved from being listed under the Israel network to the Palestine network, thousands of Israelis living in the area protested Facebook's decision.&lt;ref name="arutzsheva_facebook_aboutface"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/125595|title=Facebook Makes an About-Face|publisher=[[Arutz 7]]|date=March 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the protest, Facebook has allowed users living in the area to select either Israel or Palestine as their home country.&lt;ref name="arutzsheva_facebook_aboutface" /&gt;

Another controversy over Facebook regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict concerns [[Facebook groups]] which, against Facebook's [[terms of use]], promote hatred and violence. According to former [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Shimon Peres]], Facebook has been used to promote [[New antisemitism|anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref name="jpost_facebook_dilemna" /&gt; A proliferation of Facebook groups praising the perpetrator of the [[Mercaz HaRav massacre]] in 2008 prompted the creation of the Facebook group "FACEBOOK: Why do you support Anti-Semitism and Islamic Terrorism", which claimed to have succeeded in deleting over 100 pro-Palestinian Facebook groups with violent content, by reporting the groups to Facebook.&lt;ref name="arutzsheva_facebook_jewishactivist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish Activist Battles For Israel on Facebook|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/125783|publisher=[[Arutz 7]]|date=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, which since evolved into the [[Jewish Internet Defense Force]], took over the Facebook group "Israel is not a country! Delist it from Facebook as a country" when, according to the JIDF, Facebook stopped removing such groups.&lt;ref name="jpost_jidf"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish Internet Defense Force 'seizes control' of anti-Israel Facebook group|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215331137728&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=July 29, 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph_jidf"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facebook: 'Anti-Semitic' group hijacked by Jewish force|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2478773/Facebook-Anti-semitic-group-destroyed-by-Israeli-hackers.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 31, 2008 |location=London |first=Matthew |last=Moore |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After taking over the group, the JIDF began to remove its more than 48,000 members and replaced the group's graphic with a picture of an [[Israeli Air Force|IAF]] jet with the [[flag of Israel]] in the background. This sparked controversy.&lt;ref name="telegraph_jidf" /&gt;

===Twitter===
According to a McClatchy news article, those using social media, including even official spokesmen and public officials, have a habit of "re-purposing" older photographs and videos to illustrate current-day events. Few people check the accuracy of the material before spreading it to others.&lt;ref name=Frenkel&gt;Sheera Frenkel, [http://northiowatoday.com/?p=12254 Tweets of misleading photos feed Israeli-Palestinian feud], [[The McClatchy Company]], March 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[March 2012 Gaza–Israel clashes]] there were three such notable Twitter incidents. [[Ofir Gendelman]], a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], tweeted a photo of an Israeli woman and her two children ducking a Gaza rocket describing it as "when a rocket fired by terrorists from Gaza is about to hit their home." When it was proved the photo was from 2009 he said "I never stated that the photo was current. It illustrates the fear that people in southern Israel live in."&lt;ref name=Hadid /&gt; [[Avital Leibovich]], the head of the foreign desk for Israel's military, sent a tweet from her official account of a video of rockets from Gaza being fired at Israel. It later was discovered the video had been taken in October 2011. When questioned she said her tweet was not misleading and "Launching a rocket does not differ whether it happened in November, July or now".&lt;ref name=Frenkel /&gt;

Leibovich was one of a number of bloggers who criticized Khulood Badawi, an Information and Media Coordinator for the [[United Nations]] [[Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] who tweeted a picture of a Palestinian child covered in blood.&lt;ref name=Frenkel /&gt; She captioned it "Another child killed by #Israel... Another father carrying his child to a grave in #Gaza." It was discovered the picture was published in 2006 and was of a Palestinian girl who had died in an accident and been brought to the hospital shortly after an Israeli air strike in Gaza. Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations [[Ron Prosor]] called for Badawi's dismissal, stating that she was "directly engaged in spreading misinformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel: Fire UN official over false Gaza photo|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?ID=262098&amp;R=R1|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=2012-03-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120030608/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?ID=262098&amp;R=R1|archivedate=2013-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanitarian Coordinator and the Head of Office in Jerusalem later met with officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel to discuss these events.&lt;ref name=FoxNews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/03/17/tweeting-international-controversy/ |title=UN agency under fire for staffers' tweet of bloody child |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=March 27, 2012 |date=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fake photos of escalation posted on Twitter|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=261757|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=2012-03-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317121000/http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=261757|archivedate=2012-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Under-Secretary General [[Valerie Amos, Baroness Amos|Valerie Amos]] wrote, "It is regrettable that an OCHA staff member has posted information on her personal Twitter profile, which is both false and which reflects on issues that are related to her work."&lt;ref name=FoxNews /&gt;

A few days later Badawi tweeted on her personal account "Correction: I tweeted the photo believing it was from the last round of violence &amp; it turned out to be from 2006 This is my personal account."&lt;ref&gt;Herb Keinon, [http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=262541 No sign UN will fire worker over incendiary tweet], ''Jerusalem Post'', March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ma'an News Agency]] reported a week later that the hospital medical report on the dead girl read that she died "due to falling from a high area during the Israeli strike on Gaza". There are differing accounts of how the Israeli air strike, reported to be as little as 100 meters away, may have caused the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Alfred, [http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=471498 Twitter flap obscures details of Gaza girl's death], [[Ma'an News Agency]], 27/03/2012 (updated) 01/04/2012 09:31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wikipedia===
{{see also|Reliability of Wikipedia}}
[[Wikipedia]] is an online, [[Collaborative writing|collaboratively written]] encyclopedia. While editing conflicts occur frequently, one particular conflict, involving CAMERA and [[Electronic Intifada]], made headlines in the ''Jerusalem Post'' and the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]''.&lt;ref name="jpost_wikipedia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wiki-Warfare: Battle for the on-line encyclopedia|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1210668627359&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=May 13, 2008}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iht_wikipedia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wiki-war in the Middle East|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/06/opinion/edbeam.php|work=[[International Herald Tribune|IHT]]|date=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When CAMERA encouraged individuals sympathetic to Israel to participate in editing Wikipedia in order to "lead to more accuracy and fairness on Wikipedia",&lt;ref name="camera_wikipedia"&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=118&amp;x_article=1485 How and Why to Edit Wikipedia] by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronic Intifada]] accused CAMERA of "orchestrating a secret, long-term campaign to infiltrate the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history, pass off crude propaganda as fact, and take over Wikipedia administrative structures to ensure these changes go either undetected or unchallenged."&lt;ref name="ei_wikipedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article9474.shtml|title=EI exclusive: a pro-Israel group's plan to rewrite history on Wikipedia|work=The Electronic Intifada|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations led to various administrative actions on [[Wikipedia]]—including the banning of certain editors. HonestReporting subsequently responded to the incident with its own article, entitled "Exposed – Anti-Israeli Subversion on Wikipedia" which complained of "anti-Israel bias on Wikipedia" and described Wikipedia's [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] policy as a "noble goal not always applied equally by Wikipedia users.&lt;ref name="honestreporting_wikipedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/new/Exposed_-_Anti-Israeli_Subversion_on_Wikipedia.asp|title=Exposed - Anti-Israeli Subversion on Wikipedia - honest reporting|work=HonestReporting|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316193353/http://honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/new/Exposed_-_Anti-Israeli_Subversion_on_Wikipedia.asp|archivedate=16 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMERA similarly responded to the incident with a letter entitled "The failure of Wikipedia", appearing in [[International Herald Tribune|IHT]], which described Wikipedia's Middle East articles as "often-unreliable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=5&amp;x_outlet=196&amp;x_article=1490 CAMERA Letter About Wikipedia in International Herald Tribune] by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The failure of Wikipedia|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/11/opinion/edletmon.php|work=[[International Herald Tribune]]|date=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate article entitled "The Wild West of Wikipedia", which appeared in ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' and [[Independent Media Review Analysis|IMRA]], [[Gilead Ini]] of CAMERA decried "Wikipedia's often-skewed entries about the Middle East", described Wikipedia's rules as "shoddily enforced", and wrote that, following the incident, "many editors who hoped to ensure accuracy and balance ... are now banned" while "partisan editors ... continue to freely manipulate Wikipedia articles to their liking".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/16372/ The Wild West of Wikipedia] by [[Gilead Ini]] of CAMERA.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yesha Council]]  and [[Israel Sheli]], launched a project to improve coverage of Zionist views on Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;''Haaretz'', 2010 Aug. 18, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/the-right-s-latest-weapon-zionist-editing-on-wikipedia-1.308667 "The Right's Latest Weapon: 'Zionist Editing' on Wikipedia-- 'Idea Is Not to Make Wikipedia Rightist But for It to Include Our Point of View,' Naftali Bennett, Director of the Yesha Council Says."]&lt;/ref&gt; The project organiser, Ayelet Shaked emphasized that the information has to be reliable and meet Wikipedia rules.&lt;ref name="sheva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138917|title=Zionist Struggle on Wikipedia - Jewish World - News  - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea is not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view," said Naftali Bennett, the director of the Yesha Council.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt; In this vein, the groups taught a course on how to edit Wikipedia. The Yesha Council also launched a new prize, "Best Zionist Editor," to be awarded to the most productive editor on Israel-related topics.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

In 2013, a number of news outlets, including Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' and [[France24]], reported on an indefinite block of an editor who had concealed the fact that he was an employee of right-wing media group [[NGO Monitor]]. The editor was reported to have edited English Wikipedia articles on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict "in an allegedly biased manner".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo|title=Biased Wikipedia editing in Israel raises concerns of political meddling|work=France 24|accessdate=6 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203023611/http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo|archive-date=3 February 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/aligning-text-to-the-right-is-a-political-organization-editing-wikipedia-to-suit-its-interests.premium-1.530285|title=Aligning Text to the Right: Is a Political Organization Editing Wikipedia to Suit Its Interests?|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2013-06-19/In the media]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watchdog groups==
This is an alphabetically sorted list of [[Watchdog journalism|media watchdog groups]] which monitor coverage of the conflict in Western news media. While academics debate the [[Media influence|impact of the media]] on public opinion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://psweb.sbs.ohio-state.edu/grads/ntoronto/papers/ISPP2004.pdf Empathy with Palestinians vs. Israelis: Examining U.S. Media Representations, Coverage, and Attitudes]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Donald A. Sylvan]] and [[Nathan Toronto]], pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; lobbying organisations view the media as essential in influencing public perceptions of the conflict and, therefore, as paramount in influencing and securing favorable public policy in relation to the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://camera.org/index.asp?x_context=24 About CAMERA] by CAMERA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imeu.net/news/about-imeu.shtml|title=About Us|author=IMEU|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417082545/http://imeu.net/news/about-imeu.shtml|archivedate=17 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--INCLUSION CRITERIA
While there are countless organizations which monitor media pertaining to the Arab-Israeli conflict, the following criteria have been applied to organizations for inclusion in the "media watchdog groups" list:
1. The organization must monitor Western media coverage of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Organizations which monitor Middle Eastern coverage of the conflict have been excluded, for the purposes of limiting the length of this list.
2. The organization must monitor news for the purpose of revealing biases, with the intent of effecting change in reporting. Palestinian Media Watch and Middle East Media Research Institute which monitor for the purpose of revealing incitement to Western audiences have, thus, been excluded.
3. The organization may focus on the Arab-Israeli conflict or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically; however, the organization may monitor media coverage of a wide variety of topics, so long as the Arab-Israeli conflict is one such topic.
4. The organization should have a Wikipedia article.

A '''National Historic Landmark District''' may include [[contributing properties]] that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non-contributing properties.  Contributing properties may or may not also be separately listed.

==Creation of the program==
Prior to 1935, efforts to preserve cultural heritage of national importance were made by piecemeal efforts of the United States Congress. In 1935, Congress passed the [[Historic Sites Act]], which authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Interior Secretary]] authority to formally record and organize historic properties, and to designate properties as having "national historical significance", and gave the [[National Park Service]] authority to administer historically significant federally owned properties.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Nicholas. ''Environmental Regulation of Real Property'', Volume 1. New York: Law Journal Press, 1982. pp. 6:22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the following decades, surveys such as the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] amassed information about culturally and architecturally significant properties in a program known as the Historic Sites Survey.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Antoinette Josephine. ''The American Mosaic: Preserving a Nation's Heritage''. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|978-0-8143-2719-7}}. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the designations made under this legislation became [[National Historic Sites (United States)|National Historic Sites]], although the very first designation, made December 20, 1935, was for a [[List of National Memorials of the United States|National Memorial]], the [[Gateway Arch National Park]] (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  The first National Historic Site designation was made for the [[Salem Maritime National Historic Site]] on March 17, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;McDonnell, Janet; Mackintosh, Barry. ''The National Parks: Shaping the System''. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-912627-73-1}}. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the National Park Service took on the administration of the survey data gathered under this legislation, and the National Historic Landmark program began to take more formal shape.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Karolin; Petersen, Patricia. ''Historic Preservation in the USA''.  Berlin: Springer, 2002. {{ISBN|978-3-540-41735-4}}. p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  When the [[National Register of Historic Places]] was established in 1966, the National Historic Landmark program was encompassed within it, and rules and procedures for inclusion and designation were formalized.  Because listings (either on the National Register, or as an NHL) often triggered local preservation laws, legislation in 1980 amended the listing procedures to require owner agreement to the designations.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 6:24&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 1960, 92 properties were announced as designated NHLs by Secretary of the Interior [[Fred A. Seaton]]. The first of these was a political nomination: the [[Sergeant Floyd Monument]] in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] was officially designated on June 30 of that year, but for various reasons, the public announcement of the first several NHLs was delayed.

==Criteria==
NHLs are designated by the [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] because they are:
* Sites where events of national historical significance occurred;
* Places where prominent persons lived or worked;
* Icons of ideals that shaped the nation;
* Outstanding examples of design or construction;
* Places characterizing a way of life; or
* Archeological sites able to yield information.

==Current NHLs==
[[List of National Historic Landmarks by state|More than 2,500 NHLs]] have been designated. Most, but not all, are in the United States.

There are NHLs in all 50 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. Three states ([[List of National Historic Landmarks in Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], and [[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York|New York]]) account for nearly 25 percent of the nation's NHLs. Three cities within these states ([[List of National Historic Landmarks in Boston|Boston]], [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia|Philadelphia]], and [[List of National Historic Landmarks in New York City|New York City]]) all separately have more NHLs than 40 of the 50 states. In fact, New York City alone has more NHLs than all but five states: [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Virginia|Virginia]], [[List of National Historic Landmarks in California|California]], Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York (the latter of which has the most NHLs of all 50 states). There are 74 NHLs in the District of Columbia.

Some NHLs are in [[List of United States National Historic Landmarks in United States commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states|U.S. commonwealths and territories, associated states, and foreign states]]. There are 15 in [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Virgin Islands]], and other [[U.S. Commonwealth|U.S. commonwealths and territories]]; five in U.S.-associated states such as [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]; and [[American Legation, Tangier|one]] in [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name = "NHL_list"&gt;{{Cite web | last = National Park Service | first = | authorlink = National Park Service | last2 = | first2 = | authorlink2 = | date = November 2007 | title = National Historic Landmarks Survey: List of National Historic Landmarks by State | location = | publisher = | edition = | volume = | id = | isbn = | url = http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/LIST07.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = July 1, 2008 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The counts and locations of NHLs are described most accurately in [[List of National Historic Landmarks by state]]. This extends, and corrects errors from, the National Park Service's "National Historic Landmarks Survey List of National Historic Landmarks by State", also referenced.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[List of U.S. National Historic Landmark ships and shipwrecks|Over 100 ships or shipwrecks]] have been designated as NHLs.

==Other==
About half of the National Historic Landmarks are [[Property|privately owned]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nhl/Downloads/UpdateonNHLs2004.pdf National Historic Landmarks Update], National Park Service, October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the [[National Park Service]], which also assists in maintaining the [[landmarks]]. A friends' group of owners and managers, the National Historic Landmark Stewards Association, works to preserve, protect and promote National Historic Landmarks.

If not already listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], an NHL is automatically added to the Register upon designation. About three percent of Register listings are NHLs.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons, visits Alexander (1696).jpg|thumb|[[Alexander the Great]] receives a visit from [[Thalestris]], queen of the [[Amazons]], one of the legends recounted by Onesicritus.]]

'''Onesicritus''' ({{lang-el|Ὀνησίκριτος}}; c. 360 BC – c. 290 BC), a [[Greeks|Greek]] historical writer, who accompanied [[Alexander the Great]] on his campaigns in Asia. He claimed to have been the commander of Alexander's fleet but was actually only a helmsman; Arrian and Nearchus often criticize him for this. When he returned home, he wrote a history of Alexander's campaigns. He is frequently cited by later authors, who also criticize him for his inaccuracies.

==Life==
He was a native of [[Astypalaia]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 84; Arrian, ''Ind.'' 18; Aelian, ''H. N.'' xvi. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and it was probably to this island origin that he owed the nautical skills which would prove so advantageous to him. He was a disciple of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 75; Plutarch, ''Alexander'', 65; Strabo, xv. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diogenes Laërtius]] also calls him "Onesicritus of [[Aegina]]",&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 75; cf. vi. 84&lt;/ref&gt; and says that he came to [[Athens]] because his two adult sons, Androsthenes and [[Philiscus of Aegina|Philiscus]], were attracted to the philosophy of Diogenes the Cynic, whence Onesicritus also became an ardent disciple. If so, he must have been already advanced in years when he joined the expedition of Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;It is conceivable that there were two people called Onesicritus: one from Astypalaia who campaigned with Alexander, and an older Onesicritus from Aegina who lived in Athens, but this would create two separate disciples of Diogenes both called Onesicritus.&lt;/ref&gt;

We have no account of the circumstances which led him to accompany Alexander into Asia, nor in what capacity he attended on the conqueror; but during the expedition into India he was sent by the king to hold a conference with the Indian philosophers or [[Gymnosophists]], the details of which have been transmitted to us from his own account of the interview.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xv.  65; Plutarch. ''Alex.'' 65.&lt;/ref&gt; It was Onesicritus, whom Alexander first sent to summon [[Dandamis]] to his court. When later Onesicritus returned empty-handed with the reply of Dandamis, the King went to forest to visit Dandamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legends of Alexander the Great  By Richard Stoneman|year=2012|pages=43–47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8gMKhTO5ZAC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=dandamis+alexander&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FAFoT9-cK9HRrQey6f2QCA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dandamis%20alexander&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Alexander constructed his fleet on the [[Hydaspes]], he appointed Onesicritus to the important position of pilot of the king's ship, or chief pilot of the fleet ({{lang-el|ἀρχικυβερνήτης}}). Onesicritus held this position not only during the descent of the [[Indus]], but throughout the long and perilous voyage from the river to the [[Persian gulf]]. Alexander was so satisfied with his work that, on his arrival at [[Susa]], Onesicritus was rewarded with a crown of gold, at the same time as [[Nearchus]].&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anab.'' vi. 2. § 6, vii. 5. §9, ''Ind.'' 18; Curt. ix. 10. § 3, x. 1. § 10; Plutarch, ''Alex.'' 66, ''de Fort. Alex.''&lt;/ref&gt; Yet [[Arrian]] blames him for lack of judgment, and on one occasion expressly ascribes the safety of the fleet to the firmness of Nearchus in overruling his advice.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anab.'' vii. 20, ''Ind.'' 32.&lt;/ref&gt; We know nothing of his subsequent fortunes; but from an anecdote related by [[Plutarch]] it seems probable that he attached himself to [[Lysimachus]], and it was perhaps at the court of that monarch that he composed his historical work,&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Alex. 46"&gt;Plutarch, ''Alex.'' 46&lt;/ref&gt; though, on the other hand, a passage of [[Lucian]]&lt;ref&gt;''Quomodo hist, conscr.'' c. 40&lt;/ref&gt; might suggest that this was begun during the lifetime of Alexander himself.

==Writings==
We learn from [[Diogenes Laërtius]]&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 84&lt;/ref&gt; that Onesicritus wrote a work about Alexander called ''How Alexander was Educated'' ({{lang-el|Πῶς Ἀλέξανδρος Ἤχθη}}), imitating the style of [[Xenophon]], though he fell short of him as a copy does of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, vi. 84; Suda, ''Onesicritos''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is most frequently cited in regard to the campaigns of Alexander in Asia, and for descriptions of the countries that he visited. Though an eye-witness of much that he described, it appears that he intermixed many fables and falsehoods with his narrative, so that he early fell into discredit as an authority. [[Strabo]] is especially severe upon him.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xv., comp. ii..&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] cites him as one of those who related the fable of the visit of the [[Amazons]] to Alexander, for which he was justly ridiculed by [[Lysimachus]],&lt;ref name="Plutarch, Alex. 46"/&gt; and [[Arrian]] accuses him of falsely representing himself as the commander of the fleet, when he was in truth only the pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Arrian, ''Anab.'' vi. 2. § 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aulus Gellius]]&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ix. 4&lt;/ref&gt; even associates him with [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]], and other purely fabulous writers. But it is clear that these censures are overcharged; and though some of the statements cited from him are certainly gross exaggerations,&lt;ref&gt;see for instance Strabo, xv. p. 698; Aelian. ''H. N.'' xvi. 39, xvii. 6&lt;/ref&gt; his work appears to have contained much valuable information concerning the remote countries for the first time laid open by the expedition of Alexander. In particular he was the first author that mentioned the island of [[Taprobane]],&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, xv. p. 691; Pliny, ''H. N.'' vi. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; which is known today as Sri Lanka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14193">'''Oral history preservation''' is the field that deals with the care and upkeep of [[oral history]] materials, whatever format they may be in. Oral history is a method of historical documentation, using interviews with living survivors of the time being investigated. Oral history often touches on topics scarcely touched on by written documents, and by doing so, fills in the gaps of records that make up early historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;Keakopa, M. (1998). The role of the archivist in the collection and preservation of oral traditions. S.A. Archives Journal, 40, 87-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting oral history ==

The earliest method of collecting oral history was through memory. (see: [[oral tradition]])
With the loss of elders who were willing to preserve and pass along these histories, cultural memories began to vanish.

With the advent of the written word, it became possible for cultures to preserve their history without the memory of a select few. Spoken word was transcribed, and the eyewitness accounts of those who lived through both significant and everyday events were able to be saved for future generations to study.

This method of historical preservation was augmented with the invention of different methods to record sound. Spoken word can now be recorded on audio or video tape, or through newer digital methods.

While new media allows for richer histories to be saved, it also comes with greater issues for preservationists, one such issue being that of copyright and the ethical concerns that come along with it. For all intents and purposes, copyright does not exist in oral testimonies, at least not as clearly as it does in written documents. It is hard to decide who holds the rights to the materials and how they should be handled.&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, J. (2003). Preservation of oral sources: An analysis of the methods employed by the Sinomlando Project, University of Natal, for the preservation of oral sources. S.A. Archives Journal, 43, 33-41.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are ways to combat copyright and ethical concerns and restrictions, however. One such way is through a letter of intent. Users sign this document before listening to an oral history recording in order to demonstrate that they understand and have agreed to the usage restrictions put in place by the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Knoke, P.J., Schneider, W., &amp; Mudd, I. (1990). PROJECT JUKEBOX: technology for oral history preservation and access. Audiovisual Librarian, 7(2), 108-113.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medium ==

=== Past ways of saving oral histories ===

Early methods of recording sound included [[phonograph cylinder]]s (a stylus would draw wax grooves on the outside of a cylinder), [[gramophone record]]s (grooves on the flat side of a disk) and magnetic recordings.

=== Current way to save oral histories ===

While [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]]s are still used, [[video recording]]s have become standard. This allows the researcher to take body language and facial expressions (both important means of communication in themselves) into account. There is also an emerging trend to use the telephone to make [[Personal journal#Audio journals|audio journals]] when distance prevents face-to-face contact.

In order to ensure the preservation of oral histories it is important that all work is properly transcribed and stored on reliable media. It is important to preserve oral histories in modern digital format to ensure longevity and usability.  The simplest and easiest way to do this for audio histories is to purchase a "personal MP3 player" that has recording capabilities, and record directly to the flash chip in the player.  These are very inexpensive and can hold many hours of interviews.  The files should then be uploaded to a central computer server and copies can be burned to optical media, or copied to USB flash drives owned by the researchers, scholars and students working with the material.

Recordable compact discs are commonly used over magnetic tape for the preservation of oral histories over a long period of time.  Compact Cassette tapes and Videotape were popular but have been almost completely replaced by optical media such as CD-R and DVD media.  CD-R is a successful technology that has proven its reliability over period of time, but it should be viewed with caution for long term storage as the media is easily scratched.  The safest way is to make a "gold master" CD that is not ever checked out for use from the library, and duplicate copies of this for use by people wishing to access it.  The Folk Heritage Collections, at the Library of Congress, set a standard for 24 bits when digitizing music. This creates "superb" sound and has a high level of detail (Danielson, 2001). The Library of Congress uses CD-R as one of its storage methods. The Library of Congress has a higher budget than many university or archives, therefore they are able to store materials in multiple places. But, the Library of Congress has stated that they do believe storing sound on CD-R is a safe storage method (Danielson, 2001). One can assume if it is considered safe by the Library of Congress it is a relatively safe method of preservation.

A huge challenge of oral history preservation today is the battle with digital obsolescence. There is an obvious link between oral history preservation and [[digital preservation]]. Oral histories are often recorded on an assortment of tapes which are ultimately transferred onto computerized, or digitized, formats in order to facilitate their longevity. These digitized formats then have to be preserved, along with their corresponding metadata, just as any other digital objects are. Technological advances are happening everyday and it is difficult to keep up with these changes.  [[Emulator|Emulation]] and [[Data migration|migration]] are two ways in which formats can be changed in order to be of use for longer. Emulation focuses on designing hardware and software that will imitate the old system so that it can accept the old files while migration focuses on fitting preserved data into a smaller number of formats that can still encode the complexities of the structure and form of the original format.&lt;ref&gt;Soete, G.J. (1997). Transforming libraries: Issues and innovations in preserving digital information. Washington, DC: Association of Research Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the recent cost decreases in hard disk drives, oral archivists are considering moving many of their popular holdings to permanent storage in a server farm.  For example, a single terabyte disk drive costing under $100 USD can hold 1,900 hours of uncompressed audio.  A CD-R by contrast can only hold 76 minutes of uncompressed audio.  Disk drive array cards such as the 3ware 9650SE can field 8TB of redundantly protected data in a standard PC case.  One of the big advantages of doing this is that as the servers age and are retired, the files can simply be copied to newer, larger replacement servers making hardware obsolescense a thing of the past.

== Basic preservation of the collection ==

===Oral history education===
Due to the growing importance of oral histories the United States, as well as the international community, have increased funding to produce more oral histories, preserve oral history collections, and train oral historians. There are a growing number of oral history programs and classes in college and university campus across America. Although Indiana University does not offer academic degrees in oral history The Center for the Study of History and Memory offers students the opportunity to take classes on the topic. Some of the major universities that offer classes or degrees in oral history are Columbia University, University of Kentucky, and University of California Los Angeles. Many international universities and organizations are also enhancing their programs. The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, have all established oral history associations and offer educational classes on the subject. These programs are aimed at educating future oral historians on key issues relating to oral history, such as preservation. This is a highly debated subject matter, due to increasing technology and funding.

=== General ===
The basic preservation rule for oral histories is that the repository must make three copies each of the oral history, of the transcript, and of all accompanying paperwork (summaries and copyright statements).

* One copy will be the original item
* One copy will be the duplicating master
* One copy will be the access (public use) copy

=== Paper records ===
Transcripts of oral histories can facilitate their dissemination to the public. There are a few basic rules for paper (transcript) preservation of your oral history collection:

* Make sure transcriptions are created on [[acid-free paper]].
* Save original transcript, and make copies for public use. Do not loan out original.
* Store paper copies of transcriptions in archival-quality, acid free boxes.

=== Magnetic records ===
There are a few basic rules for [[magnetic recording]] preservation of your oral history collection:

* Save the original tape as well as the transcript of the interview
* Make an audio copy for public use, do not allow your original to be used
* Store your tapes away from magnetic fields
* Discourage users from fast forwarding and rewinding the audio tapes, this adds unnecessary wear and tear
* Remember that master copies must be played every once in a while to ensure they are still viable
* Keep your tapes in an environment that will maintain a temperature between {{convert|10|and|21|C|F}}. The environment must also maintain a humidity level between 40-50% relative humidity (RH).

=== Digital preservation ===
There are many different [[digital preservation]] strategies, but no one strategy has been agreed upon as appropriate for all data types or institutions.

== Oral history archives ==
Oral history materials are often stored in archival repositories that facilitate their preservation and longevity. Archival repositories are kept at the correct temperature to store oral history materials and trained professionals are there to ensure that the formats of the materials are kept up to date. Archivists, Preservationists and Conservators are in a unique position to appraise the shortcomings of existing archival records and to subsequently know what value can be made by oral history materials.&lt;ref&gt;Keakopa, M. (1998). The role of the archivist in the collection and preservation of oral traditions. S.A. Archives Journal,40,87-93.

Read « Philippe-Ernest », not Philippe-Emmanuel.&lt;/ref&gt;) was a French [[Hellenistic period|Hellenist]]. An historian, philologist, archaeologist, epigrapher, his great work was the translation and editing of [[Histories (Herodotus)]], published in the [[Collection Budé]], which is still a reference.

== Career ==
Philippe-Ernest Legrand studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] from 1885 to 1888&lt;ref name="Mollat"/&gt; and received a doctorate of Letters in 1898; One of his thesis was on Theocritus, and his complementary thesis was entitled ''{{lang|la|Quo animo Graeci praesertim V° et VI° saeculis tum in vita privata tum in publicis rebus divinationem adhibuerint}}''.&lt;ref name="Mollat"/&gt;

He taught at the [[University of Lyon]] from 1891 until 1926. In 1902, he obtained the chair of Greek philology and epigraphy, and then, from 1920, that of Greek language and literature.&lt;ref name="Mollat"/&gt; He took early retirement in 1926, and settled in the [[Château de Culan]] to work on his edition of Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Mollat"/&gt;

He was also a member of the [[French School at Athens]] between 1888 and 1891&lt;ref name="Mollat"/&gt; and a member of the [[Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]] from 1933.&lt;ref name="Séchan"/&gt;

== Work ==
Besides Herodotus, he studied the work of many Greek poets, including the Bucolics. A specialist of literary history, he was also strongly interested in [[Menander]], who was rediscovered at the beginning of the century thanks to the ''[[Oxyrhynchus Papyri]]''&lt;ref name="Séchan"/&gt; as well as in new comedy.&lt;ref name="Séchan"/&gt; An incomplete list of authors on which he worked includes [[Sophron]], [[Callimachus]], [[Herondas]], [[Leonidas of Tarentum]], the pseudo-Theocritus, [[Bion of Phlossa]], [[Moschos]], and [[John Chrysostom]].&lt;ref name="Séchan"/&gt;

[[File:Administrative division of pomerania.png|upright=1.25|thumb|Contemporary administrative units with ''Pomerania'' in the name, not representing the exact historical region]]

'''Pomerania''' ({{lang-pl|Pomorze}}; [[German language|German]], [[Low German]] and [[North Germanic languages]]: ''Pommern''; [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]]: ''Pòmòrskô'') is a [[historical region]] on the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] in [[Central Europe]], split between [[Germany]] and [[Poland]].

The name derives from the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''po more'', meaning "by the sea" or "on the sea".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pommersches-landesmuseum.de/kulturreferat-fuer-pommern/aufgaben/aufgaben.html ''Der Name Pommern (po more) ist slawischer Herkunft und bedeutet so viel wie „Land am Meer“.''] (Pommersches Landesmuseum, German)&lt;/ref&gt; Pomerania stretches roughly from the [[Recknitz]] and [[Trebel (river)|Trebel]] rivers in the west to the [[Vistula]] river in the east.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000, Pomerania [http://www.bartleby.com/61/39/P0433900.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Pomeranian islands are [[Rügen]], [[Usedom|Usedom/Uznam]] and [[Wolin]]. The largest Pomeranian city is [[Gdańsk]], or, when using a narrower definition of the region, [[Szczecin]]. Outside its urban areas, Pomerania is characterized by farmland, dotted with numerous lakes, forests, and towns. The region was strongly affected by [[Polish Corridor|post–World War I]] [[Oder-Neisse line|and II]] border and population shifts, with most of its pre-war inhabitants [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|leaving or being expelled]] after 1945.

==Geography==
[[File:Pomeraniae Ducatus Tabula.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Historical Pomerania]]

===Borders===
Pomerania is the area along the [[Bay of Pomerania]] of the [[Baltic Sea]] between the rivers [[Recknitz]] and [[Trebel (river)|Trebel]] in the west and [[Vistula]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;&lt;ref name="bartleby.com"/&gt; It formerly reached perhaps as far south as the [[Noteć]] river, but since the 13th century its southern boundary has been placed further north.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Landscape===
Most of the region is coastal lowland, being part of the [[North European Plain|Central European Plain]], but its southern, hilly parts belong to the [[Baltic Ridge]], a belt of terminal [[moraine]]s formed during the [[Pleistocene]]. Within this ridge, a chain of [[moraine-dammed lake]]s constitutes the [[Pomeranian Lake District]]. The soil is generally rather poor, sometimes sandy or marshy.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

The western coastline is jagged, with many peninsulas (such as [[Darß]]&amp;ndash;[[Zingst]]) and islands (including [[Rügen]], [[Usedom]], and [[Wolin]]) enclosing numerous bays ([[Bodden]]) and lagoons (the biggest being the [[Lagoon of Szczecin]]).

The eastern coastline is smooth. [[Łebsko lake|Łebsko]] and several other lakes were formerly bays, but have been cut off from the sea. The easternmost coastline along the [[Gdańsk Bay]] (with the [[Bay of Puck]]) and [[Vistula Lagoon]], has the [[Hel Peninsula]] and the [[Vistula peninsula]] jutting out into the Baltic.

===Subregions===
The Pomeranian region has the following administrative divisions:

* [[Western Pomerania|Hither Pomerania]] (''Vorpommern'') in northeastern Germany, stretching from the Recknitz river to the [[Oder–Neisse line]]. This region is part of the [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. The southernmost part of historical Vorpommern (the [[Gartz]] area) is now in [[Brandenburg]], while its historical eastern parts (the [[Oder]] estuary) are now in Poland. Vorpommern comprises the historical regions inhabited by Slavic tribes Rugians and Volinians,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} otherwise the [[Principality of Rügen]] and the [[County of Gützkow]].
* The [[Zachodniopomorskie|West Pomeranian Voivodeship]] (''Zachodniopomorskie'') in Poland, stretching from the Oder–Neisse line to the [[Wieprza]] river, encompassing most of historical Pomerania in the narrow sense (as well as the northern half of [[Neumark]]).
* The [[Pomeranian Voivodeship]], with similar borders to [[Pomerelia]], stretching from the Wieprza river to the [[Vistula]] delta in the vicinity of [[Gdańsk]].
* The northern half of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]], comprising most of [[Chełmno Land]].

The bulk of [[Farther Pomerania]] is included within the modern West Pomeranian Voivodeship, but its easternmost parts (the [[Słupsk]] area) now constitute the northwest of Pomeranian Voivodeship. Farther Pomerania in turn comprises several other historical subregions, most notably the [[Principality of Cammin]], the [[County of Naugard]], the [[Lands of Schlawe and Stolp]], and also the [[Lauenburg and Bütow Land]] (the last, however, is sometimes regarded as a part of [[Pomerelia]] or [[Kashubia]]).

Parts of Pomerania and surrounding regions have constituted a [[euroregion]] since 1995. The [[Pomerania euroregion]] comprises Hither Pomerania and [[Uckermark]] in Germany, West Pomerania in Poland, and [[Scania]] in Sweden.

==Etymology==
"Pomerania" and its cognates in other languages are derived from Old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''po'', meaning "by/next to/along", and ''more'', meaning "sea", thus "Pomerania" literally means "seacoast" or "land by the sea", referring to its proximity to the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000, Pomerania [http://www.bartleby.com/61/39/P0433900.html]: "Pomerania is the medieval Latin form of German ''Pommern'', itself a loanword in German from Slavic. The Polish word for Pomerania is ''Pomorze'', composed of the preposition ''po'', "along, by," and ''morze'', "sea." The Slavic word for sea, ''more'', which becomes ''morze'' in Polish, comes from the Indo-European noun *mori–, "sea," the source of Latin ''mare'', "sea," and the mer- of English mermaid."&lt;/ref&gt;

Pomerania was first mentioned in an [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] document of 1046, referring to a ''Zemuzil dux Bomeranorum'' ([[Zemuzil, Duke of Pomerania|Zemuzil]], Duke of the Pomeranians).&lt;ref&gt;Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.23,24, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pomerania is mentioned repeatedly in the chronicles of [[Adam of Bremen]] (c. 1070) and [[Gallus Anonymus|Gallus Anonymous]] (ca. 1113).

===Terminology===
The term "West Pomerania" is ambiguous, since it may refer to either Hither Pomerania (in historical&lt;ref name=eghere/&gt; and German usage) or to the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (in common Polish usage).

The term "East Pomerania" may similarly carry different meanings, referring either to [[Farther Pomerania]] (in historical&lt;ref name=eghere&gt;e.g. [[:File:Pomerania 1653.PNG|here]] (Sheperd Atlas), or in [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdAnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA483&amp;dq=western+pomerania+date:0-1940&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;client=firefox-a old Enc Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; and German usage), or to Pomerelia or the Pomeranian Voivodeship (in Polish usage).

===Renaissance (circa 1400 - 1700) to Early Modern Age===
{{main article|Pomerania during the High Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}

In the 12th century, narrow Pomerania [[Conversion of Pomerania|became Christian]] under saint [[Otto of Bamberg]] (''the Apostle of the Pomeranians''); at the same time [[Pomerelia]] became a part of [[diocese of Włocławek]]. Since then, the [[Griffin]] [[Duchy of Pomerania]] stayed with the Holy Roman Empire and the [[Principality of Rugia]] with Denmark, while Pomerelia, under the ruling of [[Samborides]], was a part of Poland.&lt;ref name=Piskorski35ff&gt;Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, 1999, pp.35ff, {{ISBN|83-906184-8-6}} {{OCLC|43087092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Realenzyklopedie40ff&gt;Gerhard Krause, Horst Robert Balz, Gerhard Müller, ''Theologische Realenzyklopädie'', Walter de Gruyter, 1997, pp.40ff, {{ISBN|3-11-015435-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Realenzyklopedie40ff/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Buchholz, ''Pommern'', Siedler, 1999, p.34ff,87,103, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Piskorski43&gt;Jan M. Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, 1999, p.43, {{ISBN|83-906184-8-6}} {{OCLC|43087092}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pomerania, during its alliance in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], shared borders with [[Slavs|Slavic]] state Oldenburg, as well as [[Poland]] and [[Brandenburg]]. The [[Teutonic Knights]] succeeded in integrating Pomerelia into [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|their monastic state]] in the early 14th century. Meanwhile, the [[Ostsiedlung]] started to turn Slavic narrow Pomerania into an increasingly [[Germans|German]]-settled area; the remaining [[Wends]] and Polish people, often known as [[Kashubians]], continued to settle within Pomerelia.&lt;ref name=Piskorski77ff&gt;Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, 1999, pp.77ff, {{ISBN|83-906184-8-6}} {{OCLC|43087092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner Buchholz, ''Pommern'', Siedler, 1999, pp.45ff, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1325 the line of the princes of Rügen died out, and the principality was inherited by [[House of Pomerania|the Griffins]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Buchholz, ''Pommern'', Siedler, 1999, pp.115,116, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1466, with the [[Teutonic Order]]'s defeat, Pomerelia became again subject to the [[Polish Crown]] as a part of [[Royal Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Buchholz, ''Pommern'', Siedler, 1999, p.186, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the German population in the Duchy of Pomerania adopted the [[Protestant reformation]] in 1534,&lt;ref name="Buchholz pp.205-220"&gt;Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.205–212, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard du Moulin Eckart, ''Geschichte der deutschen Universitäten'', Georg Olms Verlag, 1976, pp.111,112, {{ISBN|3-487-06078-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Realenzyklopädie, p.43ff"&gt;Gerhard Krause, Horst Robert Balz, Gerhard Müller, ''Theologische Realenzyklopädie'', Walter de Gruyter, 1997, pp.43ff, {{ISBN|3-11-015435-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Polish (along with [[Kashubians|Kashubian]]) population remained with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The [[Thirty Years' War]] severely ravaged and depopulated narrow Pomerania; few years later this same happened to Pomerelia (''the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Werner Buchholz, Pommern, Siedler, 1999, pp.263,332,341–343,352–354, {{ISBN|3-88680-272-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the extinction of the [[House of Pomerania|Griffin house]] during the same period, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1653)|Duchy of Pomerania was divided]] between the [[Swedish Empire]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] [[Peace of Westphalia|in 1648]], while Pomerelia remained in with the Polish Crown.

===Modern Age===
{{main article|History of Pomerania (1806-1933)|History of Pomerania (1933-1945)|History of Pomerania (1945-present)}}
[[File:German Empire - Prussia - Pomerania (1871).svg|thumb|The Prussian Province of Pomerania within Prussia and the German Empire circa 1871.]]

With Prussia, both provinces joined the newly constituted [[German Empire]] in 1871. Under the German rule the Polish minority suffered discrimination and oppressive measures aimed at eradicating its culture. Following the empire's defeat in World War I, however, Pomorze Gdańskie/[[Pomerelia]] was returned to the rebuilt Polish state as part of the so-called [[Polish Corridor]]), while German-majority Gdansk/Danzig was transformed into the independent [[Free City of Danzig]]. Germany's Province of Pomerania was expanded in 1938 to include northern parts of the former Province of [[Posen–West Prussia]], and in late 1939 [[Polish territories annexed by Nazi Germany|the annexed]] Pomorze Gdańskie/Polish Corridor became part of the [[Nazi Germany|wartime]] [[Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia]]. The [[Nazis]] deported the Pomeranian Jews [[Nisko plan|to a reservation near Lublin]]&lt;ref&gt;Leni Yahil, Ina Friedman, Haya Galai, ''The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945'', Oxford University Press US, 1991, {{ISBN|0-19-504523-8}}, p.138: February 12/13, 1940, 1,300 Jews of all sexes and ages, extreme cruelty, no food allowed to be taken along, cold, some died during deportation, cold and snow during resettlement, 230 dead by March 12, Lublin reservation chosen in winter, 30,000 Germans resettled before to make room [https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=stettin+jews+february&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA139,M1]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in Pomerelia. The Polish population suffered heavily during the Nazi oppression; more than 40,000 died in executions, death camps, prisons and forced labour, primarily those who were teachers, businessmen, priests, politicians, former army officers, and civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/466681/Poland/28215/World-War-II|title=Poland|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Poles and Kashubians suffered deportation, their homes taken over by the German military and civil servants, as well as some Baltic Germans resettled there between 1940-1943.

After [[Nazi Germany]]'s defeat in World War II, the German–Polish border was shifted west to the [[Oder–Neisse line]], and all of Pomerania was under [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet military control]].&lt;ref name="Buchholz"/&gt;{{rp|512–515}}&lt;ref name="Piskorski"&gt;Jan M Piskorski, Pommern im Wandel der Zeiten, {{ISBN|83-906184-8-6}} {{OCLC|43087092}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|373ff}} The German citizens of the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] and Poles of German ethnicity from Pomerelia were [[Expulsion of Germans from Poland after World War II|expelled]], and the area was resettled primarily with Poles of Polish ethnicity, (some themselves [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|expellees]] from [[Kresy|former eastern Poland]]) and some [[Ukrainian minority in Poland|Poles of Ukrainian ethnicity]] (resettled under [[Operation Vistula]]) and few [[Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]].&lt;ref name="Piskorski"/&gt;{{rp|381ff}}&lt;ref&gt;Tomasz Kamusella in Prauser and Reeds (eds), ''The Expulsion of the German communities from Eastern Europe'', p.28, EUI HEC 2004/1 [http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Ther, Ana Siljak, ''Redrawing Nations: Ethnic Cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944-1948'', 2001, p.114, {{ISBN|0-7425-1094-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7425-1094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Hither or [[Western Pomerania]] (''Vorpommern'') remained in Germany, and at first about 500,000 fled and expelled Farther Pomeranians found refuge there, later many moved on to other German regions and abroad. Today German Hither Pomerania forms the eastern part of the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], while the Polish part is divided between the [[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West Pomeranian]] and [[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]] voivodeships, with their capitals in Szczecin and [[Gdańsk]]. During the 1980s, the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and ''[[Die Wende]]'' ("the change") movements overthrew the [[Communism|Communist regimes]] implemented during the post-war era; since then, Pomerania is [[democracy|democratically governed]].

Pomerania still lives in the country of Brazil in a colony where the language is still spoken. The arrival of Pomerania immigrants with Germans and Italians helped form the state of [[Espírito Santo]] since the early 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://midiacidada.org/os-pomeranos-um-povo-sem-estado-finca-suas-raizes-no-brasil/|title=Os pomeranos: um povo sem Estado finca suas raízes no Brasil|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Gustavo Barreto. Their importance and respect are one of the cultural signatures of the area. Brazilian city Pomerode (state os Santa Catarina) was founded by Pomeranian Germans in 1861 and is considered the most typically German of all German towns of southern Brazil.

==Demographics==
[[File:Dzewus w kaszebsczich ruchnach.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[Kashubians]] in regional dress]]
{{see also|Historical demography of Pomerania}}
[[Western Pomerania]] is inhabited by [[German Pomeranians]]. In the eastern parts, Poles are the dominating ethnic group since the [[territorial changes of Poland after World War II]], and the resulting [[Polonization]]. [[Kashubians]], descendants of the [[Pomeranians (Slavic tribe)|medieval Slavic Pomeranians]], are numerous in rural [[Pomerelia]].

===Hither Pomerania===
German [[Hither Pomerania]] had a population of about 470,000 in 2012 (districts of [[Vorpommern-Rügen]] and [[Vorpommern-Greifswald]] combined) - while the Polish districts of the region had a population of about 520,000 in 2012 (cities of [[Szczecin]], [[Świnoujście]] and [[Police County]] combined). So overall, about 1 million people live in the historical region of Hither Pomerania today, while the [[Szczecin metropolitan area]] reaches even further.

==Culture==
===Languages and dialects===
[[File:Pommern 1892.jpg|thumb|right|Section of a detailed map from ''Meyers Kleiner Hand-Atlas'' published by Julius Meyer in Leipzig and Vienna in 1892.]]

In the German part of Pomerania, [[Standard German]] and the [[East Low German]] [[Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch dialect|Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommersch]]
and [[Central Pomeranian dialect|Central Pomeranian]] dialects are spoken, though Standard German dominates. [[Polish language|Polish]] is the dominating language in the Polish part; [[Kashubian language|Kashubian dialects]] are also spoken by the [[Kashubians]] in [[Pomerelia]].

[[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]], the [[East Low German]] dialect of [[Farther Pomerania]] and western Pomerelia, [[Low Prussian]], the [[East Low German]] dialect of eastern Pomerelia, and [[Standard German]] were dominating in Pomerania east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] before [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|most of its speakers were expelled after World War II]]. [[Slovincian]] was spoken at the [[Farther Pomerania]]n–Pomerelian frontier, but is now extinct.

[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] and East Low German are also spoken by the descendants of émigrées, most notably in the Americas (e.g. [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]] and [[Canada]]).

The [[Pomeranian State Museum]] in [[Greifswald]], dedicated to the history of Pomerania, has a variety of archeological findings and artefacts from the different periods covered in this article. At least 50 museums in Poland cover history of Pomerania, the most important of them The National Museum in [[Gdańsk]], Central Pomerania Museum in [[Słupsk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.slupsk.pl/ |title=Muzeum Pomorza Środkowego - Strona główna |publisher=Muzeum.slupsk.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darłowo]] Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeumdarlowo.pl/ |title=Muzeum w Darłowie - Zamek Książąt Pomorskich zaprasza |publisher=Muzeumdarlowo.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Koszalin]] Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.koszalin.pl/ |title=Muzeum w Koszalinie |publisher=Muzeum.koszalin.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Museum, Szczecin|National Museum]] in [[Szczecin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muzeum.szczecin.pl/ |title=Muzeum Narodowe w Szczecinie - Aktualności |publisher=Muzeum.szczecin.pl |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Agriculture primarily consists of raising livestock, forestry, fishery and the cultivation of [[cereals]], [[sugar beets]], and [[potato]]es. Industrial food processing is increasingly relevant in the region. Since the late 19th century, [[tourism]] has become an important sector of the economy, primarily in the numerous [[seaside resort]]s along the coast. Key producing industries are [[shipyard]]s, [[mechanical engineering]] facilities (i.a. [[renewable energy]] components), [[sugar refineries]], paper and wood fabricators.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; Service industries today are an important economical factor in Pomerania, most notably with [[logistics]], [[information technology]], [[life sciences]]/[[biotechnology]]/[[health care]] and other [[high tech]] branches often [[Business cluster|cluster]]ing around research facilities of the Pomeranian universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3067">'''Robert Francis Vere Heuston''', [[Queen's Counsel|QC (Hon.)]], [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (17 November 1923 – 21 December 1995) was a British legal scholar and legal historian. He is best known for his ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaryprofessor-robert-heuston-1322177.html|title=OBITUARY:Professor Robert Heuston|last=Stevens|first=Robert|date=3 January 1996|work=The Independent|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heuston was born in Dublin, the eldest son of Vere Douglas Heuston, general manager of the [[Guinness Brewery]], and of Dorothy Helen Heuston, ''née'' Coulter. He was related to the Irish nationalist [[Robert Emmet]]. He was educated at [[St Columba's College, Dublin]] and [[Trinity College, Dublin]], where he read Law and obtained first-class honours. He was also president of the [[College Historical Society]].

Heuston was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] by [[King's Inns]] in 1947, but decided to pursue an academic career. He joined [[St John's College, Cambridge]] as a research student, but soon left Cambridge, upon his election as the first law fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] in 1947, where he remained until 1965, when he joined the [[University of Southampton]] as a Professor of Law. He was [[Gresham Professor of Law]] between 1964 and 1970 and [[Regius Professor of Laws (Dublin)|Regius Professor of Laws]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] between 1970 and 1983.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Works ==
Heuston published works on constitutional law (''Essays in Constitutional Law'', 1961) and torts (''Salmond and Heuston on the Law of Torts''). However, he is best known for his ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors, 1885-40'' and ''Lives of the Lord Chancellors: 1940-1970'', containing biographies of Lord Chancellors from [[Hardinge Giffard, 1st Earl of Halsbury|Lord Halsbury]] to [[Gerald Gardiner, Baron Gardiner|Lord Gardiner]].

== Honours ==
Heuston was elected an honorary fellow of Pembroke College, Cambridge in 1982, honorary [[bencher]] of King's Inns in 1983, honorary bencher of [[Gray's Inn]] in 1988, and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy in 1993. He was appointed an honorary [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1995.

'''Roger of Hoveden''' or '''Howden''' ([[floruit|fl.]]&amp;nbsp;1174–1201) was a [[English historians in the Middle Ages|12th-century English chronicler]].

==Biography==
From Hoveden's name and the internal evidence of his work, he is believed to have been a native of [[Howden, East Riding of Yorkshire|Howden]] in the [[East Riding of Yorkshire]]. Nothing is known of him before the year 1174. He was then in attendance upon [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], by whom he was sent from [[France]] on a secret mission to the [[lords of Galloway]]. In 1175 he again appears as a negotiator between the king and a number of English religious houses. The interest which Hoveden shows in ecclesiastical affairs and miracles may justify the supposition that he was a [[Clerk in Holy Orders|clerk in orders]]. This, however, did not prevent him from acting, in 1189, as a justice of the forests in the shires of Yorkshire, [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]] and [[Northumberland]].

During this time, Hoveden is believed to have been working on his ''Gesta Henrici II et Gesta Regis Ricardi''. This [[chronicle]] was formerly ascribed to [[Benedictus Abbas|Benedict of Peterborough]], who had the manuscript copied for his library. The ''Gesta Regis Henrici II &amp; Gesta Regis Ricardi'' is the work of a well-informed man, connected with the court and inclined to take the side of Henry II. He confines himself to the external history of events, and his tone is strictly impersonal. He incorporates some official documents, and in many places obviously derives his information from others which he does not quote. There is a break in his work at the year 1177, where the earliest manuscript ends. The work begins at Christmas 1169, and concludes in 1192; it is thus in form a fragment, covering portions of the reign of Henry II and [[Richard I of England|Richard I]].

Hoveden went on the [[Third Crusade]] with [[Richard I of England]], joining him in [[Marseille]] in August 1190. He left for Europe in August 1191, in the entourage of [[Philip II of France]]. On his return, about the year 1192 he began to compile his ''Chronica'', a general history of England from 732 to his own time. Up to the year 1192 his narrative adds little to our knowledge. For the period 732–1148 he chiefly drew upon an extant, but unpublished chronicle, the ''Historia Saxonum sive Anglorum post obitum Bedae'' ([[British Library]] Royal MS 13 A VI&lt;ref&gt;British Library Archives and Manuscripts catalogue: [http://searcharchives.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?docId=IAMS040-002106818 Royal MS 13 A VI].&lt;/ref&gt;), which was composed about 1150. From 1148 to 1170 he used the ''[[Melrose Chronicle]]'' (edited for the [[Bannatyne Club]] in 1835 by [[Joseph Stevenson]]) and a collection of letters bearing upon the [[Thomas Becket]] controversy. From 1170 to 1192 he drew upon his own earlier ''Gesta Regis Henrici II'' and ''Gesta Regis Ricardi'', revising the text and inserting some additional documents. From 1192, the ''Chronica'' is an independent and copious authority.

Hoveden is sedulously impersonal, and makes no pretense to literary style, quotes documents in full and adheres to the annalistic method. His chronology is tolerably exact, but there are mistakes enough to prove that he recorded events at a certain distance of time. Both on foreign affairs and on questions of domestic policy he is unusually well informed. His practical experience as an administrator and his official connections stood him in good stead. He is particularly useful on points of constitutional history. His work breaks off abruptly in 1201, though he certainly intended to carry it further. Probably his death should be placed in that year.

The '''Society for Creative Anachronism''' ('''SCA''') is an international [[living history]] group with the aim of studying and recreating mainly Medieval European cultures and their histories before the 17th century. A quip often used within the SCA describes it as a group devoted to the [[Middle Ages]] "as they ought to have been",&lt;ref name="What is the SCA?" /&gt; choosing to "selectively recreate the culture, choosing elements of the culture that interest and attract us".&lt;ref name="What is the SCA?"&gt;{{cite web | title = Life in the Current Middle Ages: What is the SCA? | publisher = Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. | date = 2008-04-04 | url = http://www.sca.org/officers/chatelain/sca-intro.html  | accessdate = 2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1966, the non-profit educational corporation has over 30,000 paid members {{As of|2017|lc=on}}&lt;ref name=Members&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the SCA?|work=Society for Creative Anachronism|url=http://socsen.sca.org/what-is-the-sca/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with about 60,000 total participants in the society (including members and non-member participants).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/officers/chatelain/sca-intro.html |title=What is the SCA? |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:SCA50DLP.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Diana Paxson in 2016 celebrating the 50th anniversary of the SCA]]
The SCA's roots can be traced to a backyard party of a [[UC Berkeley]] medieval studies graduate, the author [[Diana Paxson]], in [[Berkeley, California]], on [[May Day]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="The Origins of the SCA"&gt;{{cite web | last = Keyes | first = William | title = The Origins of the SCA | publisher = Ken Mayer | year = 1980 | url = http://history.westkingdom.org/Year0/index.htm | accessdate =2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party began with a "Grand Tournament" in which the participants wore [[helmets]], fencing masks, and usually some semblance of a costume, and sparred with each other using weapons such as plywood swords, padded maces, and fencing foils. It ended with a parade down [[Telegraph Avenue]] with everyone singing "[[Greensleeves]]". It was styled as a "protest against the 20th century".&lt;ref name="Epoch Times"&gt;{{cite web | last = Croucher | first = Martin | title = Latter-Day Knights Battle for Imaginary Kingdoms | publisher = The Epoch Times | date = 17 March 2008 | url = http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-3-17/67686.html | accessdate = 2008-06-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080515192325/http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-3-17/67686.html | archivedate = 15 May 2008 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The SCA still measures dates within the society from the date of that party, calling the system ''Anno Societatis'' ([[Latin]] for "in the Year of the Society"). For example, 2009 May 1 to 2010 April 30 was A.S. XLIV (44). The name '''Berkeley Society for Creative Anachronism''' was coined by science fiction author [[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], an early participant, when the nascent group needed an official name in order to reserve a park for a tournament.&lt;ref name="SCA Intro"&gt;{{cite web | last = O'Roarke | first = Mistress Siobhan Medhbh | title = Life in the Current Middle Ages: How did the SCA begin? | publisher = Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. | url = http://www.sca.org/officers/chatelain/sca-intro.html | accessdate = 2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Berkeley" was dropped as the group expanded.&lt;ref name=Drachenväter&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hillenbrand |first1=Tom |last2=Lischka |first2=Konrad |date=2014 |title=Drachenväter: Die Interviews |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67atBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA109 |location= |publisher=MV-Verlag |page=109 |isbn=9783981700800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three more co-founders are mentioned by Douglas Martin in the New York Times Obituaries of August 3, 2001 (p.A23, "[[Poul Anderson|Poul Anderson]], Science Fiction Novelist, Dies at 74"):  "[Anderson and Karen Kruse] moved to San Francisco and were married...They and their daughter, Astrid...founded the Society for Creative Anachronism, which...has spread nationwide."
In 1968, Bradley moved to [[Staten Island]], [[New York City|New York]] and founded the Kingdom of the East, holding a tournament that summer to determine the first Eastern King of the SCA. That September, a tournament was held at the [[26th World Science Fiction Convention|26th]] [[World Science Fiction Convention]], which was in Berkeley that year. The SCA had produced a book for the convention called ''A Handbook for the Current Middle Ages'', which was a how-to book for people wanting to start their own SCA chapters. Convention goers purchased the book and the idea spread. Soon, other local chapters began to form. In October 1968, the SCA was incorporated as a [[501(c)(3)]] [[Non-profit organization|non-profit corporation]] in [[California]].&lt;ref name="The Origins of the SCA"/&gt; By the end of 1969, the SCA's three original kingdoms had been established: [[West Kingdom]], East, and Middle. All SCA kingdoms trace their roots to these original three. The number of SCA kingdoms has continued to grow by the expansion and division of existing kingdoms; for example, the kingdoms now called the Outlands, Artemisia, Ansteorra, Gleann Abhann, Meridies, and Trimaris all are made up of lands originally belonging to the fourth kingdom, Atenveldt, which began as a branch of the West Kingdom.

In 2012, SCA agreed to pay $1.3 million to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of 11 victims of [[child sexual abuse]]. The abuse was committed in Pennsylvania at the private residence of Ben Schragger, who pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2004. Schragger was a member of SCA at the time of the abuse. His membership was suspended on his arrest and permanently revoked after his plea.  The lawsuit contended that the SCA had not conducted a background check on Schragger, though at the time the organization did not perform background checks in general and there is no legal requirement to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2007/05/08/Six-file-federal-complaint-over-sex-abuse-conviction/stories/200705080198|title=Six file federal complaint over sex abuse conviction|last=Lovigliothe|first=Joann|date=2007-05-08|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2017-12-17|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sca.org/BOD/announcements/settlementFAQ.pdf|title=SCA Settlement FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=sca.org|access-date=2017-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://file770.com/?p=9800|title=SCA Will Pay $1.3M  To Settle Abuse Case|last=Trembley|first=Andrew|date=2012-08-03|work=File 770|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
[[File:SCA50horse.jpg|thumb|right|Equestrian combat in the SCA]]
{{main article|Society for Creative Anachronism activities}}
The SCA engages in a broad range of activities, including [[SCA armoured combat]], [[SCA fencing]], [[archery]], [[equestrianism|equestrian activities]], feasting, [[medieval dance]] and recreating [[medieval art]]s and [[Science in the Middle Ages|sciences]], including a broad range of crafts as well as [[medieval music]] and [[medieval theatre|theatre]].  Other activities include the study and practice of [[heraldry]] and scribal arts ([[calligraphy]] and [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]]).  Members are afforded opportunities to register a medieval personal name and [[coat of arms]] (often colloquially called a "device" in SCA parlance).  SCA scribes produce illuminated [[scroll]]s to be given by SCA royalty as awards for various achievements.

Most local groups in the SCA hold weekly fighter practices, and many also hold regular archery practices, dance practices, A&amp;S (Arts &amp; Science) nights and other regular gatherings.  Some kingdoms and regions also have occasional war practices, where fighters practice formations and group tactics in preparation for large scale "war" events.

The research and approach by members of the SCA toward the recreation of history has led to new discoveries about medieval life.&lt;ref name="McLean Singman"&gt;{{cite book | title = Daily Life in Chaucer's England | last = McLean | first = Will |author2=Jeffrey L. Singman  | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 1995 | page = 221 | isbn = 0-313-29375-9 | oclc = 32167609 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events===
[[File:HeatherDale.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Heather Dale]] singing at an SCA event]]
Some local groups participate in nearby [[Renaissance fair]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scatoday.net/node/22187 |title=Medieval Fair of Norman |publisher=SCA Today |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Event Details: Lakewood Ren Faire XXXII |publisher=East Kingdom of the Society for Creative Anachronism |date=2013-03-30 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the main focus of activity is organized through the SCA's own events.  Each kingdom in the SCA runs its own schedule of events which are announced in the kingdom newsletter (and usually posted on the kingdom web site), but some of the largest SCA-sanctioned events, called "wars", attract members from many kingdoms. [[Pennsic War]], fought annually between the East Kingdom and Middle Kingdom, is the biggest event in the SCA. The Estrella War has been held for over thirty years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estrellawar.org/faq/|title=Newcomer's Portal -|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly between two large regional SCA groups: the Kingdom of [[Atenveldt]] and the  Kingdom of the [[Outlands]].&lt;ref name="estrellawar.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estrellawar.org/chronology/|title=Chronology -|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Estrella wars are held near [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] Arizona in late February and last around 7–9 days.&lt;ref name="estrellawar.org"/&gt;  Several thousand people attend each year, some from as far as Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, and Australia. Other annual SCA wars include Gulf Wars in Gleann Abhann (formerly Meridies), Great Western War in Caid, War of the Lillies in Calontir and others.  Other annual or semi-annual Kingdom-level events held analogously by most or all SCA kingdoms include Crown Tournament, Coronation, Kingdom Arts and Sciences competition and Queen's Prize.  Additionally, most baronies in the SCA have their own traditional annual events such as Baronial Arts and Sciences competition, a championship tournament, and often a [[Yule]] or [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] feast.  Various SCA groups also sometimes host collegia or symposia, where members gather for a raft of classes on various medieval arts and sciences and other SCA-related topics.

The minimum standard for attendance at an SCA event is "an attempt at pre-17th century clothing",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sca.org/docs/pdf/govdocs.pdf page 4&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a general goal of maintaining a historical atmosphere.  However, SCA members will use modern elements when necessary for personal comfort, medical needs, or to promote safety (e.g. wearing prescription eye-wear, using [[rattan]] for swords or [[Dilatant|shear thickening]] substances for padding). Unlike some other [[living history]] groups, most SCA gatherings do not reenact a specific time or place in history, leaving members free to dress as any culture within the SCA's time period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowenthal"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Past is a Foreign Country | author = David Lowenthal | year = 1985 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-29480-0 | page = 363 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=jMqsAQZmv5IC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22Society+for+Creative+Anachronism%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The SCA produces two quarterly publications, ''The Compleat Anachronist'' and ''Tournaments Illuminated'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/docs/pubs.html |title=Publications |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each kingdom publishes a monthly newsletter.

''The Compleat Anachronist'' is a quarterly [[monographic series]], each issue focused on a specific topic related to the period of circa 600–1600 in European history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/ca/ |title=The Compleat Anachronist |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues are written by SCA members and have covered a wide range of topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/ca/issues.html |title=The Compleat Anachronist: Index of Issues |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Tournaments Illuminated'' is a quarterly magazine, each issue covering a range of topics and including several features such as news, a humor column, book reviews, war reports and various articles on SCA-related topics of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/ti/ |title=Tournaments Illuminated |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==

=== Corporate organization ===
The SCA is incorporated as a [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit corporation in [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sca.org/officers/treasurer/exemptletter.pdf |title=IRS Letter confirming the SCA's 501(c)(3) status}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its current headquarters in the city of [[Milpitas, California|Milpitas]]. It is headed by a [[board of directors]], each of whom is nominated by the membership of the SCA, selected by sitting directors, and elected to serve for 3.5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sca.org/BOD/ |title=SCA, Inc. – The Board of Directors |publisher=The Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each director serves as an [[ombudsman]] for various kingdoms and society officers. The BoD, as it is called, is responsible for handling the corporate affairs of the SCA and is also in charge of certain disciplinary actions, such as revoking the membership status of participants who have broken [[wiktionary:corpus|Corpora]] regulations or modern law while participating in SCA activities.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;
Because the SCA now has groups all over the world, it has also been incorporated in other countries, e.g. SCAA in Australia and SCANZ in New Zealand. These affiliated bodies work with the US board of directors with regards to societal issues, but make all decisions affected by local law independently of the US parent body. Although they agree to work in unity with the US SCA board of directors, they are autonomous and are not bound by any ruling of the US body.&lt;ref name="libdocs"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.sca.org/docs/library.html | title= Library of SCA Documents | publisher = Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. | accessdate = 2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Branches ===
The SCA is divided into administrative regions which it calls ''kingdoms''. Smaller branches within those kingdoms include ''Principalities'', ''Regions'', ''Baronies'', and ''Provinces'', and local chapters are known as ''Cantons'', ''Ridings'', ''Shires'', ''Colleges'', ''Strongholds'', and ''Ports''. Kingdoms, Principalities, and Baronies have ceremonial rulers who preside over activities and issue awards to individuals and groups. Colleges, Strongholds, and Ports are local chapters (like a shire) that are associated with an institution, such as a school, military base, or even a military ship at sea.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"&gt;{{cite book | title = The By-Laws and Corporate Policies of the SCA, Inc | publisher = Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc. | year = 2007 | location = Milpitas, CA | pages = | url = http://www.sca.org/docs/pdf/govdocs.pdf |format=PDF| doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All SCA branches are organized in descending order as follows:&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;

* Kingdom: area ruled by a King and Queen ''(typically covering several U.S. states or Canadian provinces, and can be as large as countries or collections of countries)''. Minimum members required 400.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;
** Principality: area within a kingdom ruled by Prince and Princess ''(large area sometimes comprising entire states)''. Minimum members required 100.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;
** Region: equivalent of principality without ceremonial representative
*** Barony: area administered by a Baron and/or Baroness, the ceremonial representative(s) of the Crown. Minimum members required 25.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;
**** Canton: local branch reporting through a barony (local chapter, which may be on the way to becoming a shire)
*** Province: equivalent of barony without ceremonial representative
**** Riding: local branch reporting through a province
*** Shire: local branch reporting directly to a kingdom or principality. Minimum members required 5.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;
*** College: institutional branch based at a school, research facility, etc. (may be a part of a larger local group or report directly to a principality or kingdom)
*** Stronghold: institutional branch based at a military installation (may be a part of a larger local group or report directly to a principality or kingdom)
*** Port: institutional branch based at a military installation in situations where groups of members will be detached for long periods, as with ships at sea (may be a part of a larger local group or report directly to a principality or kingdom)

Groups are active all over the United States, Canada, [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[New Zealand]], with scattered groups elsewhere, including [[China]], [[Panama]] and [[Thailand]]. At one time there was even a group on the aircraft carrier [[USS Nimitz|USS ''Nimitz'']], known as the "Shire of Curragh Mor" (anglicized [[Irish language|Irish]] for "Big Boat"), and the shire's arms played on the ''Nimitz's'' ship's badge. There is also an active chapter in [[South Korea]], the Stronghold of Warrior's Gate, with a mix of active duty military personnel from the several services and military-connected civilians. There are also non-territorial, usually called "households", which are not part of the Society's formal organization, the largest of which is the [[Mongol Empire]]-themed [[Great Dark Horde]].&lt;ref name="Legio"&gt;{{cite web | author = "Gunnbjorn Gunnarsson" (Michael S.

=== Officers ===
The Society as a whole, each kingdom, and each local group within a kingdom, all have a standard group of officers with titles loosely based on medieval equivalents.&lt;ref name="GovDocs" /&gt;
* ''[[Seneschal]]'': The seneschal acts as the administrative head, or president of the group. Every local group is required to have a local seneschal who reports to the kingdom's seneschal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://welcome.sca.org/history-and-culture/|title=SCA Newcomer's Portal|date=2013-05-11|work=SCA Interactive Demo|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Chancellor of the [[Exchequer]]'' or [[Reeve (England)|Reeve]]: The treasurer, who handles the financial matters of the group. Every local group is required to have one. The Society Chancellor of the Exchequer, who administrates the kingdom and local reeves, reports to the Society Treasurer who handles the corporate finances. In most kingdoms the Exchequer (kingdom or local) are some of the only officers having a financial warrant  to collect gate fees and handle money for the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17KKEWIR27ZOiRX5p-NpD-809zilMbx0M|title=Policies - Google Drive|website=drive.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Knight Marshal]]'': The combat supervisor, the knight marshal administrates all combat activities for the branch, including [[SCA armoured combat|armored combat]], [[SCA fencing|rapier combat]], archery and equestrian. A local group is required to have one in order to host combat activities.
* ''[[Minister (government)|Minister]] of Arts and Sciences'': Sometimes split into two offices, one for arts and one for sciences, this office coordinates arts and sciences activities for the group, arranging both monthly classes and demonstrations as well as larger yearly collegium ( a 2 to 3 day workshop with multiple classes), and leading participants to others who work in fields of their interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://welcome.sca.org/crafting/|title=SCA Newcomer's Portal|date=2013-05-11|work=SCA Interactive Demo|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atenveldt.org/People/Officers/GreatOfficers/OfficeoftheMinisterofArtsSciences|title=Office of the Minister of Arts &amp; Sciences|last=Atenveldt|first=Kingdom Of|website=www.atenveldt.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Herald]]'': This officer is in charge of heraldic activities, such as the creation and registration of names and [[Coat of arms|arms]]. Each kingdom has a College of Heralds which prepares submissions to go to the Society [[College of Arms]], headed by the Laurel Sovereign of Arms.
*''[[Châtelain|Chatelaine]]'' or ''Hospitaller or Gold Key'' : In charge of welcoming and facilitating new participants into the SCA including recruiting, onboarding, and transitioning members from other branches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://welcome.sca.org/costuming/|title=SCA Newcomer's Portal|date=2013-05-09|work=SCA Interactive Demo|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Marshal'': Supervises a specific combat-related activity, insuring safety of participants and refereeing where applicable.  A marshal must be certified for the type of activity they oversee; as such there are armored combat marshals, rapier marshals, target archery marshals, equestrian marshals, etc.  A marshal of a given certification must be present for that particular activity to take place at an event.
* ''[[Constable]]'':  In all kingdoms they handle public safety and security, and may collect gate fees depending on the policy of the kingdom the event is in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Laws of the Kingdom of The West - Section 10 | author =  | work = westkingdom.org | date =  | accessdate = 2016-10-25 | url = http://www.westkingdom.org/kingdom-information/laws-kingdom-west | quote = Section 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kingdom Waiver Secretary: In charge of maintaining and tracking liability waivers for events. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atenveldt.org/People/Officers/OtherOfficers/KingdomWaiverSecretary|title=Kingdom Waiver Secretary|last=Atenveldt|first=Kingdom Of|website=www.atenveldt.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Chronicler'': Produces and edits the group's newsletter. The Society Chronicler monitors each of the kingdom and local group's chroniclers, while the SCA's two organization-wide publications, ''[[#Publications|Tournaments Illuminated]]'' and ''[[#Publications|The Compleat Anachronist]]'', each have their own [[editor-in-chief]].
* ''Minister of Children, Minister of Youth or Youth Activities Officer'': Arranging and officiating children's activities.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atenveldt.org/People/Officers/OtherOfficers/OfficeofYouthActivities|title=Office of Youth Activities|last=Atenveldt|first=Kingdom Of|website=www.atenveldt.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Historian]]'': Recording the history of the group, from the local to the Society level.
* ''Webminister'': Derived from [[webmaster]], this officer is in charge of maintaining the [[Internet]] presence of the group.
* ''Chirurgeon'': In charge of safety and modern [[first aid]]. First formed in 1983, the office was dissolved on August 10, 2015 amid concerns of legal liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socsen.sca.org/closure-of-the-office-of-the-chirurgeonate-august-10-2015/|title=Closure of the Office of the Chirurgeonate – August 10, 2015 - Society|website=socsen.sca.org|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture of the group ==
[[File:SCAfeastHromnice2008.JPG|thumb|left|upright|An SCA participant in historically based clothing prepared for a feast]]

Members of the SCA study and take part in a variety of activities, including combat and chivalry, [[archery]], [[heraldry]], equestrian activities, costuming, [[Medieval cuisine|cooking]], metalwork, woodworking, leathercrafting, music, dance, [[calligraphy]], fiber arts, and others as practiced during the member's time period.&lt;ref name="SCA Intro" /&gt;

=== Personae ===
To aid historical recreation, participants in the SCA create historically plausible characters known individually as ''personae''.&lt;ref name="SCA Intro" /&gt; To new members, a persona can simply be a costume and a name used for weekend events, while other members may study and create an elaborate personal history. The goal of a well-crafted persona is a historically accurate person who might have lived in a particular historical time and place. The SCA has [[onomastics|onomastic]] students who assist members in creating an appropriate  persona name. The SCA rules state that: "We allow elements and patterns for personal names from beyond Europe, but we require them to be from cultures that were known to medieval and Renaissance Europeans or whose members might reasonably have traveled to Europe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Standards for Evaluation of Names and Armory: The Rules for Submissions|url=http://heraldry.sca.org/sena.html#GP1|website=SCA College of Arms on the Web|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, while less common, there are members with Saracen, Chinese, Japanese or Native American personas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA-Personas-art|url=http://www.florilegium.org/?http%3A//www.florilegium.org/files/NEWCOMERS/SCA-Personas-art.html|website=Stefan's Florilegium|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, claiming to be a specific historical individual, especially a very familiar one (e.g. [[Genghis Khan]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Henry Plantagenet]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]), is not permitted. Likewise, one is not allowed to claim the ''persona'' of a fellow SCA member, alive or dead. Nor is one allowed to take on the persona of a sufficiently familiar fictional character (e.g. Robin of Locksley/[[Robin Hood]]).&lt;ref name="SCA Intro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GovDocs" /&gt;

=== Heraldry ===
A major dimension to the SCA is its internal system of [[Heraldry]]. Any member of the society may apply to register a name and [[Coat of Arms|device]] for their persona, which are checked by the [[Officer of Arms|heralds]] for uniqueness and period authenticity, before being blazoned and recorded in the society's Armorial. The system has evolved since the formation of the society; and now has three [[King of Arms|Sovereigns of Arms]], with ''Principal Heralds'' for each Kingdom, who oversee deputy officers for matters such as heraldic education and processing registrations, and local officers (generally one for each local chapter) who assist the local participants.&lt;ref name = "SCA Heraldry"&gt;{{cite web |author= Laurel Sovereign of Arms|title=Heraldry |url= http://heraldry.sca.org/|work= |publisher=SCA |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to design of arms, heralds in the Society also provide services such as voice heraldry (similar to a [[master of ceremonies]]) at tournaments and official functions, and organizing tournament brackets or "lists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCA College of Arms – Voice Heraldry Articles|url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/voice.html|work=SCA College of Arms|publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism, Inc.|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royalty ===
[[File:NorthshieldCourt2007-05-27.JPG|thumb|right|Northshield court at an outdoor SCA event]]
The SCA has ceremonial rulers chosen by winning tournaments (Kings/Queens, Princes/Princesses) in [[SCA armoured combat]]. Barons and Baronesses are appointed by Royalty, although some baronies hold elections or competitions to choose their preferred Baron and/or Baroness. One of the primary functions of state for reigning monarchs is to recognize participant achievement through awards. Most awards denote excellence in a specific pursuit such as local service, arts and sciences, and combat. Some awards change the precedence and title of the recipient, giving him or her the privilege of being known as "Lord"/"Lady", "Baron", "Duchess", "Master", and so forth. High level awards are often given with the consultation of the other people who have received the award, such as peerages and consulting orders.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;  The Crown has some authority over other matters relating to leadership, but the extent of this varies from kingdom to kingdom.

==== Rule by right of arms ====
[[File:SCAcourt.JPG|thumb|An SCA tournament of chivalry]]
Each SCA kingdom is "ruled" by a king and queen chosen by winning a Crown [[tournament (medieval)|Tournament]] in [[SCA armoured combat|armored combat]]. Corpora require this to be held as a "properly constituted armored combat" tournament.&lt;ref name="GovDocs" /&gt; The winner of the Crown Tournament and his/her Consort are styled "Crown Prince and Princess" and serve an advisory period (three to six months, depending upon the scheduling of the Crown Tournament) under the current King and Queen prior to acceding to the throne and ruling in their turn.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;  

This selection method is not based on how actual medieval [[monarch]]s were chosen, as there is no record of one being selected by [[Tournament (medieval)|Tournament]] combat in this manner. There are, however, literary and historical bases for the custom, most famously the tournament in [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. In the Middle Ages, there were a number of different "mock king" games, some of which involved some form of combat, such as King of the Mountain or the King of Archers. In the 17th century the [[Cotswold Games]] were developed, the winner of which was declared to be "king". Also, the medieval [[saga]]s contain accounts of uniting [[petty kingdom]]s under a single king through ''actual'' combat.&lt;ref name="Laxdaela Saga"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Anonymous |author2=Magnusson, Magnus |author3=Palsson, Hermann | title = Laxdaela Saga | publisher = Penguin Classics | year = 1969 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=um91wPf9c7MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA48,M1 | accessdate = 2008-05-24 | isbn = 978-0-14-044218-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCA's first event did not choose a "king". Fighters vied for the right to declare their ladies (only men fought at the first event) "fairest", later called the "Queen of Love and Beauty".&lt;ref name="The Origins of the SCA"/&gt;

=== Peerage orders ===
The highest ranking titles in the SCA belong to the royalty, followed by the former royalty. Former kings and queens become counts and countesses (dukes and duchesses if they have reigned more than once), and former princes and princesses of Principalities become viscounts and viscountesses.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt; This system is not historically based, but was developed out of practical necessity early in the Society's history.

Directly beneath this "landed" nobility (current and former royalty) rank the highest awards, the Peerages. The SCA has four orders of peerage: the Order of the Chivalry, awarded for skill at arms in Armored Combat; the Order of the Laurel, awarded for skill in the arts and sciences; the Order of the Pelican, awarded for outstanding service to the Society; and the Order of the Masters of Defense, awarded for skill at arms in Rapier Combat. In Several of the Kingdoms the Order of the Rose, made up of former Consorts, is considered a peerage equal to the other four.&lt;ref name="GovDocs"/&gt;

==== Elevation to peerage ====
Peerages are bestowed by the Crown (the Sovereign and Consort) of a Kingdom. In most cases, this is done with the consent of the members of a given peerage, often at their suggestion.&lt;ref name="GovDocs" /&gt; The Society's Bylaws state that "the Crown may elevate subjects to the Peerage by granting membership in one of the Orders conferring a Patent of Arms, after consultation with the members of the Order within the Kingdom, and in accordance with the laws and customs of the kingdom. Restriction: to advance a candidate to the Order of the Chivalry, a Knight of the Society (usually the King) must bestow the [[accolade]]".&lt;ref name="GovDocs" /&gt;

== Cultural impact ==
In May 1999, ''[[The Onion]]'' ran a front-page article headlined "Society For Creative Anachronism Seizes Control Of Russia" featuring photos of actual SCA participants from the Barony of Jaravellir ([[Madison, Wisconsin]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theonion.com/society-for-creative-anachronism-seizes-control-of-russ-1819565189 "Society For Creative Anachronism Seizes Control Of Russia" ''[[The Onion]]'', 1999-05-26].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Desforges.meridies.org|title=Shire Des Forges|url=http://desforges.meridies.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the SCA are given pivotal roles in [[S.M. Stirling]]'s [[Emberverse]] series, where their skills in pre-industrial technology and warfare become invaluable in helping humanity adapt when all modern technology (including firearms) ceases working.&lt;ref name="Stirling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. M. Stirling|title=Dies the Fire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w-XusAq9Z84C|date=3 August 2004|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-04391-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his conclusion to the ''[[The Space Odyssey series|Space Odyssey]]'' series, ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]''; [[Arthur C. Clarke]] portrays the SCA as still being active in the year [[3001 (year)|3001]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The novel ''Murder at the War'' (''Knightfall'' in paperback edition) by Mary Monica Pulver is a [[detective fiction|murder mystery]] set entirely at the SCA's largest annual event, [[Pennsic War]].

In [[David Weber]]'s [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Honor Among Enemies]]'', main character [[Honor Harrington]] mentions that her uncle is a member of the SCA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/09-AtAllCostsCD/AtAllCostsCD/Honor%20Among%20Enemies/0671877232___3.htm|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707035429/http://baencd.thefifthimperium.com/09-AtAllCostsCD/AtAllCostsCD/Honor%20Among%20Enemies/0671877232___3.htm|deadurl=yes|title="Honor Among Enemies", Chapter 3|archivedate=7 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he taught her to shoot from the hip (the time the SCA covers having been moved up to the 19th century in the future era in which the novel is set, to include [[cowboy]] and [[Civil War reenactors]]).

In [[Christopher Stasheff]]'s "Warlock" series the inhabitants of the planet Gramarye are revealed to be descended from SCA participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bounacos|first=G.|title=Warlock Civics Teacher|url=http://book.consumerhelpweb.com/authors/stasheff/0441005608.htm|work=ConsumerHelpWeb: Reviews|publisher=ConsumerHelpWeb|accessdate=20 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315152917/https://book.consumerhelpweb.com/authors/stasheff/0441005608.htm|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A prequel, ''Escape Velocity'', describes how the SCAdians first came to Gramarye, and how lands were assigned to the royal peers.&lt;ref&gt;Stasheff, Christopher. ''Escape Velocity'' (New York: Ace Books, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Ariel'' (1983), a post-apocalyptic fantasy by [[Steven R. Boyett]], technology suddenly stops working and sorcery and sword fight take over. Several characters who are former SCA members attribute their survival to their SCA experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doctorow|first1=Cory|title=Ariel: post-apocalyptic sword-and-sorcery adventure that rocked my world|url=http://boingboing.net/2009/08/25/ariel-post-apocalypt.html|website=Boing Boing|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boyett|first1=Steven R|title=Ariel : a book of the change|date=1983|publisher=Ace Fantasy|location=New York|isbn=9780441029204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fantasy novel ''The Folk of the Air'' by [[Peter S. Beagle]] was written after the author attended a few early SCA events ''circa'' 1968; but he has repeatedly stated that he then studiously avoided any contact with the actual SCA itself for almost two decades, so that his description of a fictitious "League for Archaic Pleasures" would not be "contaminated" by contact with the actual real-life organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Beagle, The Folk of the Air (Ballantine Books, 1986)|url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_beagle_folkoftheair.psb.html|work=Greenmanreview.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110418035700/http://www.greenmanreview.com/book/book_beagle_folkoftheair.psb.html|archivedate=2011-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Folk of the Air|work=Peterbeagle.com|url=http://www.peterbeagle.com/books/folkoftheair/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Number of the Beast'', [[Robert A. Heinlein]] portrayed an SCA tournament where live weapons were used and the battles actually fought to the 'death'.&lt;ref name="The Heinlein Society: A Heinlein Concordance"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cowan|first=M.E.|title=A Heinlein Concordance|url=http://www.heinleinsociety.org/concordance/books/nb_hc.htm#societyforcreativeanachronism|work=The Heinlein Society: A Heinlein Concordance|publisher=The Heinlein Society|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defeated combatants were either transported to an alternate reality where medical technology was advanced enough that they could be revived from any wound or transported to the alternate reality that was Valhalla.  The contestants' desires were placed in sealed envelopes prior to the tournament, which were destroyed if the competitor won and obeyed if a competitor lost.&lt;ref&gt;Heinlein, Robert A. ''The Number of the Beast'' (New York: Fawcett Columbine Books, 1980), page 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[John Ringo]]'s [[The Council Wars]] science-fiction series, characters with SCA or SCA-like experience help their society recover from a catastrophic loss of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsite.com/02b/tw170.htm |last=Speer |first=Cindy Lynn|title=Review: There Will Be Dragons |publisher=SF Site |year=2004 |accessdate=2012-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2364">'''Sonchis of Saïs''' or '''the Saïte''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Σῶγχις ὁ Σαΐτης}}, ''Sō̂nkhis o Saḯtēs''; {{fl.|594}} BC) was an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[priest]] who is mentioned in Greek writings as relating the account of [[Atlantis]]. His status as a historical figure is a matter of debate.

The [[Plato]]nic dialogues ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]],'' written around 360 BC, relate (through the voice of [[Critias]]) how the Athenian statesman [[Solon]] (638–558 BC) traveled to Egypt and in the city of [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]] encountered the priests of the goddess [[Neith]]. A very aged priest tells him that 9000 years earlier, Athens had been in conflict with the great power of [[Atlantis]], which was then destroyed in a catastrophe.&lt;ref name="Timaeus"&gt;Plato, ''[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/timaeus.html Timaeus]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's dialogue does not mention a name for the priest, but [[Plutarch]] (46–120 AD), in his ''[[Parallel Lives|Life of Solon]]'' identified the aged priest as Sonchis:
{{quote|Near Nilus' mouth, by fair [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]]' shores, and spent some time in study with Psenophis of [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], and Sonchis the Saïte, the most learned of all the priests; from whom, as Plato says, getting knowledge of the Atlantic story, he put it into a poem, and proposed to bring it to the knowledge of the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Solon"&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/solon.html Life of Solon]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Plutarch gives a more detailed description on the Greek philosophers who visited Egypt and received advice by the Egyptian priests in his book ''[[Moralia|On Isis and Osiris]]''. Thus [[Thales of Miletus]], [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], [[Solon]], [[Pythagoras]], (some say [[Lycurgus of Sparta]] also) and [[Plato]], traveled into Egypt and conversed with the priests. Eudoxus was instructed by Chonupheus of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], Solon by Sonchis of Saïs and Pythagoras by Oenuphis of Heliopolis.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/A.html On Isis And Osiris]'', ch. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2166">In the ancient Sanskrit book, [[Rig Veda]], '''Srbinda''' is a mythical foe of the God [[Indra]]. He is mentioned briefly as being slain in battle by Indra along with Anarsani, Pipru, and Ahisuva, after which he "let loose the floods". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv08032.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mythical Founder of the Serbs==

Certain pseudo-historians theorize that Srbinda is related to, and possibly the founder of, the [[Serbia|Serbian]] nation. Besides the identical root, the fact that the name Srbinda structurally is identical to the modern Serbian word "Srbenda", which is a superlative form of "Serb", expressing a [[Serb]] who is thoroughly and uncompromisingly devoted to all things [[Serbdom|Serbian]]. &lt;ref name="Zivkovic 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Živković |first=Marko |year=2011 |title=Serbian Dreambook: National Imaginary in the Time of Milošević}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian historian Walther Wüst theorized in 1934 that Srbinda was a warlord and leader of the [[Serbs]], based on the fact that Serbs use the term "Srbenda". He hypothesized that Srbinda and Srbenda were the same word, and that they meant someone great, strong, first among the Serbs - in line with the meaning of "Srbenda". He also theorized that when the Veda texts mention that after Indra defeats Srbinda he "let loose the floods", that floods were a metaphor for a migration of people, in this case the Serbs, migrating west. &lt;ref name="Wust 1934"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wüst |first=Walther |authorlink=Walther Wüst |date=1934 |title=Die indogermanischen Bestandteile des Rigveda und das Problem der "urindischen' Religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbian historian Drasko Scekic stated that Srbinda is the oldest mention of the word 'Srb' in history, and that Srbinda is an ancient Serbian word, predating the [[Sanskrit]] language. &lt;ref name="Scekic 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scekic |first=Drasko |authorlink=Drasko Scekic |date=1994 |title=Sorabi: istoriopis, Saborna sfer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tainan is the oldest city on the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] and also commonly known as the "Capital City" ({{zh|c=府城|p=Fǔchéng}}; [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Hú-siâⁿ'') for its over 200 years of history as the capital of Taiwan under [[Koxinga]] and later [[Qing dynasty]] rule. Tainan's complex history of comebacks, redefinitions and renewals inspired its popular nickname "the Phoenix City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=99336&amp;CtNode=124 | title=Rise of the Phoenix? | last=Chang | first=Winnie | work=Taiwan Today | date=April 1994 | accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Taiwan's oldest [[urban area]], Tainan was initially established by the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) as a ruling and trading base called [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]] during [[Dutch Formosa|the period of Dutch rule on the island]]. After Dutch colonists were defeated by Koxinga in 1661, Tainan remained as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungning Kingdom]] until 1683 and afterwards the capital of [[Taiwan Prefecture]] under [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|Qing Dynasty rule]] until 1887, when the new provincial capital was moved to [[Taipei]]. Tainan has been historically regarded as one of the oldest cities in Taiwan, and its former name, Tayouan, has been claimed to be the origin of the name "Taiwan". It is also one of Taiwan's cultural capitals, for its rich folk cultures including the famous [[Taiwanese cuisine|local street food and traditional cuisine]], extensively preserved [[Taoist]] rites and other living local traditions covering everything from child birth to funerals. The city houses the first [[Tainan Confucian Temple|Confucian school–temple]] in Taiwan, built in 1665,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://confucius.cca.gov.tw/english/navigator/map02.htm |title=Tainan Confucian Temple |publisher=Council for Cultural Affairs |accessdate=2008-08-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080501181411/http://confucius.cca.gov.tw/english/navigator/map02.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remains of the Eastern and Southern gates of the old city, and countless other historical monuments. Tainan claims more [[Buddhist]] and Taoist temples than any other city in Taiwan.

===Early history===
Archaeological excavations in the township of [[Zuozhen, Tainan|Zuozhen]] suggest that the Tainan region has been inhabited for at least 20,000 to 31,000 years. The indigenous [[Siraya people|Siraya]] tribe dominated the region by the 16th century. The Sakam people of the Sinkan sub-tribe inhabited the area of the present-day city.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"&gt;{{cite book |editor=蔡玉仙 |display-editors=etal |publisher=[[Tainan City Government]] |year=2007 |script-title=zh:府城文史 | language = zh-hans |isbn=9789860094343 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Sirayan sub-tribes, including the Soelangh, Mattauw and Baccloangh inhabited the surrounding area.

By the late 16th century, Chinese merchants and fishermen had set up several bases along the west coast of the island, including a sandbar across the ''Taikang Inner Sea'' ({{zh|c=[[:zh:臺江內海|臺江內海]]|poj=Tâi-kang lāi-hái}}) off the bay of Sakam village (modern-day [[Fort Provintia]]). The Chinese adopted ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Taioan|zh|3=大員}}'' (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping]]) as the name of the sandbar.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Shih Shou-chien |editorlink=Shih Shou-chien |year=2003 |trans-title=Ilha Formosa: the Emergence of Taiwan on the World Scene in the 17th Century |script-title=zh:福爾摩沙 : 十七世紀的臺灣、荷蘭與東亞 | language = zh-hans |publisher = National Palace Museum |isbn=9789575624415 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kato" /&gt; Slightly north of ''Taioan'', along the shoreline near ''Bassemboy'' ({{zh|c=北線尾|poj=Pak-siàn-bóe|labels=no}}), Japanese traders established bases for trade with China.&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/&gt; The early Chinese and Japanese also traded with the Sirayan people. Salt and food was exchanged for deer hides and dried deer meat. The Siraya people were influenced by both Chinese and Japanese cultures and lifestyles. They started to use Chinese words in their language, use Japanese [[tantō]] in ritual events, and also migrated inland due to the influx of newcomers. By the time the Europeans arrived, the influence of Chinese and Japanese traders and fishermen was already prominent.&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"&gt;{{Cite book |year=2007 |title=Taiwan: A New History |editor=Rubinstein, Murry A. |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |place=New York |isbn=9780765614940 |edition=expanded |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch colony===
[[File:Tainan Taiwan Fort-Zeelandia-01.jpg|thumb|Anping Fort (site of the [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]])]]
{{main|Dutch Formosa}}
Early Dutch colonists had attempted but failed to control [[Macau]] and the [[Penghu islands]]. In July 1622, the [[Dutch East India Company]] textile merchant [[Cornelis Reijersen|Cornelis Reyersz]] sailed to Taiwan in search of a suitable location to build a trading post. In 1624 he established a small fort named 'Orange' on the sandy peninsula they called '''Tayouan''' (modern-day [[Anping District|Anping]]). The fort was then expanded and renamed [[Fort Zeelandia (Taiwan)|Fort Zeelandia]]. The settlement was initially designed as a base to attack their Spanish rivals and as a trading post between China and [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] in Indonesia. Later the post became the center of Dutch trade between China, Japan and Europe.&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/&gt; During the governorship of [[Pieter Nuyts]] (1627–29), there was hostility between the Dutch and Japanese merchants, leading at one point to Nuyts being held hostage by a Japanese trader, Hamada Yahee.&lt;ref name="Kato"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kato |first=Mitsutaka |origyear=1940 |year=2007 |script-title =zh:昨日府城 明星台南: 發現日治下的老臺南 |language=zh-tw |translator={{lang|zh-hant|黃秉珩}} |publisher=臺南市文化資產保護協會 |isbn=9789572807996 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/&gt;

The [[Dutch pacification campaign on Formosa]] was a series of military actions and diplomatic moves undertaken in 1635 and 1636. They aimed at subduing hostile aboriginal villages in the south-western region of the island. In 1642 the Dutch seized the Spanish garrison at [[Santisima Trinidad (Taiwan)|Santisima Trinidad]] in [[Keelung]]. The Dutch East India Company became the first authority to claim control of the whole of Formosa, with Fort Zeelandia as the seat of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tua_01.jsp?ID=1&amp;Lang=E |title= Anping Harbor National Historical Park |publisher= Tainan City Government |accessdate= 2010-03-31 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015111400/http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tua_01.jsp?ID=1&amp;Lang=E |archive-date= 2009-10-15 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions arose between the Dutch and the Chinese inhabitants of Taiwan due to heavy Dutch taxation and Dutch participation in plunder during the collapse of the [[Ming dynasty]]. Eventually, this led to the brief, but bloody, [[Guo Huaiyi Rebellion]] in 1652.&lt;ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/&gt; The Dutch crushed the revolt only with the help of the local Sinkanese.

The settlements near to Fort Zeelandia expanded as a result of the Dutch trading post in the area. In 1653, the Dutch built a new fort, [[Fort Provintia]], in the Sakam area as a center for an agricultural colony. The Dutch encouraged Chinese farmers to migrate to Taiwan to grow rice and sugar cane. The Dutch settlement in southern Taiwan was so successful that, by the 1650s, it had overtaken Batavia.&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/&gt;

===Kingdom of Tungning===
[[File:Statue of Koxinga.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Koxinga]] in Koxinga's Shrine]]
{{main|Kingdom of Tungning}}
[[Koxinga]] (also known as Zheng Chenggong) was a Ming loyalist and chief commander of the Ming troops on the maritime front for the later emperors of the withering dynasty. In 1661, Koxinga attacked the Dutch colonists in Taiwan. After a nine-month siege, the Dutch Governor of Taiwan, [[Frederik Coyett]], surrendered Fort Zeelandia to Koxinga on 1 February 1662.&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/&gt; This effectively ended 38 years of Dutch rule on Taiwan. Koxinga then devoted himself to transforming Taiwan into a military base for loyalists who wanted to restore the Ming Dynasty.

Koxinga set about making Taiwan a base for the Ming loyalist movement. Fort Provintia was renamed ''[[Kingdom of Tungning|Tungtu]]'', and Fort Zeelandia became [[Anping District|Anping]]. Koxinga set up military colonies on the surrounding plains to help feed his forces.{{sfnp|Shih|2003}} Many suburbs surrounding Tainan City today include in their names "Ying", "Jia", and "Tian", all derived from this event. After the death of Koxinga in 1662, his son, [[Zheng Jing]], changed the name of Dongdu to Dong Ning. His chief minister, {{Interlanguage link multi|Chen Yonghua|zh|3=陳永華 (明鄭)}}, introduced Chinese bureaucracy, built [[Taiwan Confucian Temple|the first Confucius temple]] on the island, and introduced the method of salt production to coastal areas. The British were invited to set up a trading post in Anping to continue trade between Taiwan, Japan, and South East Asia. This helped to maintain the region as a center of trade.

===Qing dynasty===
[[File:臺南接官亭石坊.JPG|thumb|right|Jieguanting ({{lang|zh|接官亭}}) in ''Go-tiau-kang'', Tainan gateway to the sea during Qing dynasty]]
{{main|Taiwan under Qing rule}}
The death of Zheng Jing in 1681 was followed by a struggle for succession. Seizing the advantage presented by the infighting, on July 17, 1683, [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] naval commander [[Shi Lang]] defeated the Tungning fleet in the [[Battle of Penghu]]. Two days later, Qing troops landed at Tungning and encountered little resistance. In 1684 the kingdom was incorporated into the Qing Empire as part of Fujian province, ending two decades of rule by the Zheng family.&lt;ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/&gt; [[Taiwan Prefecture]] was established, with its prefectural seat ''Taiwan-fu'' at modern-day Tainan.

In 1721, Chinese peasants and indigenous tribes rose in rebellion against Qing misrule. The rebels, led by [[Zhu Yigui]], captured Tainan without a fight. Turmoil ensued as the rebels soon fought amongst themselves. It was only after a Qing army was dispatched from mainland China that order was restored. Zhu was captured and executed. As Qing law prohibited the building of city walls in Taiwan, Qing authorities decided to create a defensive boundary around the city by growing bamboo around the perimeter. After several further uprisings across the island, work on a city wall began in the late 1780s.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt;

A flood in 1823 brought rich silt from nearby rivers, which formed a widespread new fertile plain across the Taijiang bay area between Tainan and Anping. A canal system called ''Go-tiau-kang'' ([[:zh:五條港 (臺南)|五條港]]; {{zh|poj=Gō͘-tiâu-káng}}) was built to keep the port in Tainan functioning but prevented large ships from entering the bay.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt;

After 174 years of restrictions on trade with the Europeans, the Qing reopened [[Anping District|Anping port]] as part of the [[Treaty of Tianjin|Tianjin treaty]] following the [[Second Opium War]] in 1858. The Anping Customs house was established in 1864. Western merchants built trading posts near the remains of Fort Zeelandia.

Following the murder of 54 Japanese sailors by Paiwan aborigines near the southwestern tip of Taiwan in 1871, the punitive [[Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan]] revealed the fragility of the Qing dynasty's hold on Taiwan. As a result, the Qing sent the imperial commissioner [[Shen Baozhen]] to Taiwan to strengthen its defense. In Tainan, Shen made several efforts to modernize the defenses including inviting French engineers to design the [[Eternal Golden Castle]] in Erkunshen. He also recommended setting up a telegraph cable link between Tainan and [[Amoy]].&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray A. Rubinstein"/&gt; Some parts of the castle were built using bricks taken from Fort Zeelandia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tua_01.jsp?ID=2&amp;Lang=E |title= Anping Harbor National Historical Park |publisher= Tainan City Government |accessdate= 2010-03-25 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100314074831/http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tua_01.jsp?ID=2&amp;Lang=E |archive-date= 2010-03-14 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After over 200 years of development, Tainan, known as ''Taiwan-fu'', had become the largest city in Taiwan and a Chinese city with foreign influence. The following is a description of the city by the Scottish missionary [[William Campbell (missionary)|William Campbell]] upon his first arrival to the island in 1871:
{{quotation|As to Taiwan-fu itself, I may say that the brick wall which surrounds it is about fifteen feet in thickness, twenty-five in height, and some five miles in circumference. Lofty watch-towers are built over the four main gateways, and large spaces within the city are given to the principal temples and ''yamens''—or quarters occupied by the civil and military mandarins. There is much need in Taiwan-fu for the carrying out of a City Improvement Scheme. Pleasant walks, no doubt, there are, and some of the shops have an appearance which is decidedly attractive; but, as a rule, the streets are narrow, winding, ill-paved, and odorous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sketches from Formosa|year=1915|last=Campbell|first=William|authorlink=William_Campbell_(missionary)|publisher=Marshall Brothers|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/sketchesfromtaiw00camprich|ol=7051071M|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1885, the Qing government commenced work to develop the island into [[Taiwan Province (Qing)|Taiwan Province]]. The capital of the island, or "Taiwan-fu", was moved to ''Toatun'' (modern-day [[Taichung]]), and therefore the old Taiwan-fu was renamed to the name it bears today – ''Tainan(-fu)'', the seat of [[Tainan Prefecture (Qing dynasty)|Tainan Prefecture]].

===Japanese rule===
[[File:Tainan Taiwan Martial-Art-Hall Butokuden-01.jpg|thumb|Tainan Butokuden (Martial Arts Hall)]]
[[File:Tainanshu Kannaizu.jpg|thumb|Tainan Prefecture]]

As a consequence of the Chinese losing the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1895, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were ceded to Japan by the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]]. The [[Republic of Formosa]] was proclaimed in Tainan in May 1895, in an effort to pre-empt the Japanese occupation. A Japanese army arrived at Tainan in October 1895. [[Liu Yongfu]] and the other Republican leaders fled, leaving the city in disarray. A Scottish missionary, [[Thomas Barclay (missionary)|Thomas Barclay]], was chosen by local elites and foreign merchants to negotiate the Japanese entry into the city. As a result, Tainan was [[Capitulation of Tainan (1895)|taken without resistance]]. Under [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Tainan was initially administered under {{nihongo||臺南縣|Tainan Ken}}.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt; With a population of about 50,000 in 1904, Tainan was Taiwan's most populous city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Takekoshi |first1=Yosaburō |authorlink=Takekoshi Yosaburō |title=Japanese rule in Formosa |date=1907 |publisher = Longmans, Green, and co. |publication-place = London, New York, Bombay and Calcutta |ol=6986981M |oclc=753129 |chapter=Chapter XIII: Population and future development of the island resources |page=200 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-Japanese uprising known as the [[Tapani Incident]] began in Ta-pa-ni (modern-day [[Yujing District|Yujing]]) on April 9, 1915. The revolt, led by {{Interlanguage link multi|Yu Qingfang|zh|3=余清芳}}, spread quickly across the whole island and was supported by both Chinese and indigenous Taiwanese. The Japanese crushed the uprising. Many villages were destroyed and thousands of people were killed during the repression which followed. Yu Qingfang was captured on August 22, 1915. More than 800 people were sentenced to death in Tainan. Over 100 of them were executed while the rest were pardoned by the new [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]]. The place where the rebellion began, Xilai Temple in Tainan ([[:zh:臺南西來庵|臺南西來庵]]), was demolished.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt; The event marked a turning point in Japanese policy, from forced pacification to modernisation and integration of Taiwan into the Japanese Empire.

The Japanese renamed the city to {{nihongo||臺南廳|Tainan Chō}} in 1901, and then {{nihongo4||臺南州|Tainan Shū}} in 1920. [[Tainan Prefecture]] included modern-day [[Yunlin County|Yunlin]], [[Chiayi County|Chiayi]], and the wider region of Tainan. Tainan served as the capital city. The Japanese transformed Tainan by building modern infrastructure, including schools, a courthouse, city hall, new telecommunication facilities, an extensive freight and passenger rail network, a new Anping canal replacing the ''Go-tiau-kang'', an airport, and an [[Chianan Canal|irrigation system]] across the Tainan and Chiayi regions. Modern urban designs were introduced; old narrow streets and city walls were demolished and replaced with wide streets that form the cityscape of the modern-day Tainan city center.&lt;ref name="Kato"/&gt; They also introduced much needed sanitary reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher = J. Murray |publication-place = London |ol=25302448M |title = A Handbook for Travellers in Japan |publication-date = 1903 |last1=Chamberlain |first1=B. |authorlink1=Basil Hall Chamberlain |author2=Mason, W.B. |edition=7th |page=553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war===
[[File:TainanDistrict.png|thumb|Tainan City in 1945-2010]]
The [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) [[History of Taiwan since 1945|took over]] Taiwan on 25 October 1945 after [[World War II]]. Tainan [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|City]] and [[Tainan County]] were established and became separate local entities under [[Taiwan Province]] in 1946. There was civil unrest in Tainan as part of the [[February 28 Incident]] in 1947. [[Tang De-Jhang]], a Japanese descent and Japanese educated lawyer, was a member of government which set up "The February 28 Incident Commission" and a popular candidate for city mayor, was accused of being a separatist and arrested by the ROC army on March 11. He was tortured and executed the next day in the park in front of Tainan City Hall (now named {{Interlanguage link multi|Tang De-jhang Memorial Park|zh|3=湯德章紀念公園}}). Tang was posthumously pronounced not guilty by court later in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.228.org.tw/history228_elite_detail.php?id=27 |title=湯德章 |accessdate=2010-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121000413/http://www.228.org.tw/history228_elite_detail.php?id=27 |archivedate=January 21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other regions in Taiwan, many people in Tainan suffered for their real or perceived opposition to the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT, Chinese Nationalist Party) during the [[White Terror (Taiwan)|autocratic era]].

The city held its first councilor and mayoral elections in 1950. In the 1960s, Tainan was overtaken by [[Kaohsiung]] as the economic center of southern Taiwan due to the redevelopment of [[Port of Kaohsiung|Kaohsiung port]]. While Tainan City struggled through the second half of twentieth century, the county, especially the river south region, benefited from national priority development programmes. The completion of the [[National Highway No. 1 (Taiwan)|National Highway No. 1]] was followed by the building of many industrial parks and other road improvements. As a result, the city sprawled inland into North, East and then the Yongkang and Rende districts.

In 1992, a redevelopment plan in the West district, to widen Haian Rd and build an underground plaza proved a failure as lack of geological surveying and overall planning meant that the works ran into a layer of groundwater. The development destroyed part of the historic ''Go-tiau-kang'' area. As a consequence, the Zhongzheng Road district, previously the most popular shopping precinct in Tainan since Japanese rule, went into decline due to the poor quality of the environment. By the mid-1990s, there was a growing awareness of the need to protect Tainan's historical and cultural treasures. Since then, the government and civil societies have worked to protect Tainan's heritage. It is an ongoing issue for Tainan to protect its past while reviving its old business center.

Following the establishment of the [[Southern Taiwan Science Park]] in 1995, the outskirt of the city saw a rapid growth in population through the 2000s. The city became more prosperous after the completion of several major transport infrastructure plans. The city center shifted eastward in the mid-1990s, closer to the densely populated Yongkang, East and North districts. There are several redevelopment plans to transform these districts into the new business centers of the city.

On [[3-19 shooting incident|March 19, 2004]], President [[Chen Shui-bian]] was shot whilst campaigning for re-election in Tainan. The city has been a major center for the pro-independent movement since the end of Japanese rule. On October 21, 2008, Chinese ARATS Vice President [[Zhang Mingqing]] was injured when he encountered protesters in Tainan Confucius Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E5%BC%B5%E9%8A%98%E6%B8%85%E8%A8%AA%E5%8F%B0%E9%81%87%E8%A5%B2%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6 | script-title=zh:張銘清訪台遇襲事件 |language=zh | accessdate = 2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 December 2010, Tainan County and Tainan City merged to become Tainan [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]].

On February 6, 2016, the area was hit by a 6.4 magnitude earthquake, causing 116 fatalities&lt;ref name="2016twquake"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuo-fang|first1=Huang|last2=Hsu|first2=Elizabeth|title=Remains of last unaccounted-for quake victim found|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201602130018.aspx|accessdate=18 February 2016|agency=The Central News Agency|publisher=Focus Taiwan|date=13 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and major damage, including building collapses (see [[2016 Kaohsiung earthquake]]).

==Culture==
[[File:Chuniaomugong.JPG|thumb|right|Ritual adulthood celebration for all 16-year-olds]]

Tainan claims its name as one of the Taiwanese cultural capitals for its abundant historic monument and citizen lifestyle. The city is dotted by Taoist temples, Buddhist temples and churches. Many of them are among the oldest in Taiwan. The city also has its own unique traditions and cuisines developed by Chinese frontiers over its long history.

===Folk cultures===
The lives of Tainan citizens are closely related to many Chinese gods and temples. Parents bring their children to the "Weaving Maid goddess" ({{zh|t=七娘媽|poj=Chhit-niû-má}}), the children’s goddess, to wish for good will. Traditionally Chinese people step into adulthood when they are 16. In Tainan, there is a large ritual celebration for all 16-year-olds on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, the goddess's birthday. This extended celebration is unique to Tainan: In the past, families with children working in the harbor took the advantage of this ceremony to show the employers that their children should be paid in adult rate after this day.

Before any form of exam people visit a temple of [[Wenchang Wang|Wenchangdijun]], the literacy god, to pray for good luck. One of the Wenchang temples is on the top floor of the [[Fort Provintia]]. Many final year high school students preparing for university exams visit the temple in June, before the exam. Those asking for marriage visit [[Yue Lao|Yuelao]], the god for marriages. People also visit temples for many reasons, from simply praying for good luck to celebrating god’s birthday to even consulting with the other world.&lt;ref name="台南市文資導讀"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tnc.gov.tw/book/fron/index.html |title=台南市文資導讀 |publisher= Tainan City Government | accessdate = 2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wedding ceremony in Tainan is a series of complex processes that are very exact and detailed. Both groom and bride need to prepare 12 specific gifts representing different meanings during their engagement ceremony with more to come in the wedding. People believe this complexity is a sign of being civilized.&lt;ref name="台南市文資導讀"/&gt;

Anping residents use a special symbol called Sword Lion to keep bad spirits away. During Zheng’s regime, Anping was one of Koxinga's main naval stations. When returning home from military drills, soldiers would put lion-face shields on the main gates of their houses and insert their swords crosswise in the lion’s mouth. Locals incorporate this symbol into the design of their houses as a symbol of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tud_01.jsp?ID=25&amp;Lang=E |title= Sword Lion |publisher= Anping Harbor National Historical Park |accessdate= 2011-05-12 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060223172941/http://anping.tncg.gov.tw/tour/tud_01.jsp?ID=25&amp;Lang=E |archive-date= 2006-02-23 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tainan cuisine===
Many well-known [[Taiwanese cuisine|Taiwanese food dishes]] originated in Tainan. Since Tainan was a center of sugar production, Tainan cuisine tends to be sweeter than other Taiwanese cuisines. For example, eel noodle soup has a distinctive sweet and sour taste. [[Milkfish]] dishes are very popular in Tainan, where locals also call it "Koxinga's fish" ({{zh|t=國姓魚|poj=kok-sèng-hî}}). People believe the Chinese name of the fish ({{zh|t=虱目魚|poj=sat-ba̍k-hî|labels=no}}) was given by Koxinga, and this name has been loaned into Japanese as {{nihongo4||サバヒー|sabahī}}. The fish are bred in farms located in the coastal outskirts of the city. Many Tainan restaurants and snack stands have histories that trace back to the Qing  or Japanese eras.&lt;ref name="台南市文資導讀"/&gt;

On Guo Hua Street (國華街), a lot of restaurants and street vendors sell local cuisine, including such dishes as "savory rich pudding" ([[:zh:碗粿|碗粿]]), [[oyster omelette]], [[gua bao]], and [[popiah]]. Local people tend to have these dishes either in the morning or at noon.{{citation needed | date=February 2016}}

===Temples===

[[Nanguan music|Nanyin]] and Shisanyin were the first types of Chinese music introduced to Tainan; Nanyin is performed mostly for entertainment while Shisanyin is performed in the Confucius worship ceremony. There are two Nanyin clubs in Tainan: Zhenshengshe, a 200-year-old club once dissolved in the 1980s for ten years which then returned with the support from younger generation musicians and Nanshengshe, a 95-year-old club performing globally.&lt;ref name="台南市文資導讀"/&gt;

===Taiwan Confucian Temple===
The Taiwan Confucian Temple (or the Scholarly Temple) was built in 1665 by Cheng Ching, son of Koxinga, to offer lectures and cultivate intellectuals. It was the first learning institute for children when Taiwan was ruled by the [[Taiwan under Qing Dynasty rule|Qing Dynasty]]. As a result, it is also called the First Academy of Taiwan.

The temple is a popular tourist attraction and preserves ancient Confucian ceremonies, which are conducted regularly. The grounds include storerooms for the ritual implements and musical instruments that are used in these ceremonies.

===National Museum of Taiwan History===
The [[National Museum of Taiwan History]] is located in the [[Annan District]]. The construction of the Exhibition and Education Building began in 2005, and opened on 29 October 2011.The main objectives of this museum include collection, categorization, preservation, research, exhibition, education and promotion of artifacts related to Taiwan's history and culture for both locals and visitors.

It is one of the most famous [[Night markets in Taiwan|night markets]] and it is often considered to be the largest night market of Taiwan; however, unlike the others, this night market is open for business three days a week - Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.

===Beehives===

In [[Yanshui District]], the most important and prominent fireworks in [[Lantern Festival]] are the so-called "beehives", essentially multiple launchers of bottle rockets. These rocket forts are actually thousands of bottle rockets arranged row atop row in an iron-and-wooden framework. The set-up looks like a beehive full of unleashed gunpowder. When the contraption is ignited, rockets shoot out rapidly in all directions. Dazzling explosives whiz and whirl across the sky and often into the crowd itself, both thrilling and intimidating the spectators.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Climate==
Tainan has a [[humid subtropical climate]], closely bordering a tropical wet-dry sub-climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/business/tainan-taiwan-15073.html | title=Gold Coast travel guide: Tainan | accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is characterized by year-round high [[relative humidity]] and temperatures (although temperatures do dip somewhat in the winter months), with a rainy season (April to September) and a dry season (October to March).

==Cityscape==

===The Great Cross Street===
The earliest plan of the city was designed by Dutch colonist, Cornelis Jansz. Plockhoy, the designer of this new settlement, laid a 25-30m wide main street (on today’s Minquan Rd Sec. 2) across the settlement and radial roads than ran deep into agricultural developments .&lt;ref name="Shih Shou-chien"/&gt; The Han Chinese settlement “Heliaogang Jie” (today’s Zhongyi Rd) later crossed the main street of Provintia and formed the so-called ''Shizi Dajie'' (十字大街) or The Great Cross Street.&lt;ref name="蔡玉仙等編"/&gt; With the fall of the Ming dynasty, new migrants flooded into the settlement. Chinese population boomed from 5,000 to 35,000 between 1640 and 1661. As a result, farmers, deer hunters, traders and craftsmen each formed a colony on the cross street.&lt;ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化"&gt;{{cite book|last=金山|first=翁 |script-title=zh:台南市都市設計規劃綱要之研究 1 都市空間的溯源與演化|year=2002|publisher=財團法人成大建築文教基金會}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the Chinese tradition where different trades and regions worship different Taoist gods, the city later developed into neighborhoods, each with own center temple.&lt;ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化"/&gt; Now, after 300 years of Chinese migration, the city has become a showcase of both Taoist and Chinese Buddhist temples. Although the city has transformed dramatically since the late 19th century, the temples remain because of their importance to the locals. Some of the early administration centers have also been transformed into temples for political and social reasons. An administrative building of the Tungning Kingdom became temple of the [[Mazu (goddess)|sea goddess]], and the location where Tungning Kingdom performed annual ceremonies of prayer to Heaven is now the Altar of Heaven Temple. Castle Provintia, one of two Dutch forts in Tainan, now has a sea god temple and a literacy god temple built on top of it, creating East-West fusion architecture. Many Han Chinese religious and historic monuments can be found near the old cross street centered by the Castle Provintia.

===Japanese Redevelopment Program===
The cityscape of modern Tainan was founded under the urban redevelopment programs carried out by Japanese colonial government. The city center adopted a Baroque design similar to the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|Paris renovation in mid 19th century]], the plan connected major facilities via a system of wide streets and five square-roundabouts. Among the five squares, {{nihongo4|Taishō Park|大正公園||modern-day [[Tang De-jhang Memorial Park]]}} at the center is the most important crossing point. The square is surrounded by the city hall, the fire brigade and the weather bureau. It is connected by a number of avenues heading towards the train station, the airport, military bases and the dock at the end of the Anping cannel. With the police station and the court nearby, this area demonstrated the power of the colonial government within the city.&lt;ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化"/&gt; The financial district was located in {{nihongo4||白金町|Shirokanechō}} and {{nihongo4||大宮町|Ōmiyachō}} between Taishō park and Anping cannel along {{nihongo4||銀座通り|Ginzadōri}},&lt;ref name="Kato"/&gt; the modern day Zhongzheng Rd. It was the busiest street of the city from Japanese rule to the mid-1990s. Many Colonial Baroque style historic buildings from Japanese era can be found in this part of the city.

===Three Ring Belts===
A three-belt system was adopted by the provincial city official:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisgroup.com/events/download/5_3/3-4.pdf |title=Green and blue belts reference |accessdate=2011-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425131759/http://www.gisgroup.com/events/download/5_3/3-4.pdf |archivedate=April 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the green boulevard ring, the blue belt Anping cannel and the Zhonghua road system. The green boulevard ring and Zhonghua road system first appeared on the 1937 city redevelopment plan proposed by the Japanese colonial government.

The green boulevard was a Japanese response to the [[Garden city movement|garden city trend]] of early 20th century urban planning.&lt;ref name="都市空間的溯源與演化"/&gt;  This system connects the Shuipingwen Park to the west, Tainan Park to the north, [[National Cheng Kung University|NCKU]] to the east and the Athletic park complex to the south.  Zhonghua Rd system is an arterial road system, the system now connects major new development areas surrounding old city center. The Anping cannel ''blue belt'' was created after the completion of the ''Fifth redevelopment area''. The project of ''Fifth redevelopment area'' filled the [[floodplain]] of old Taijiang lagoon and extended the Japanese Anping cannel into Kunshen lagoon to form an artificial island, this area is also known as ''New Anping''. In contrast to the low rise old city center, many high rise buildings are built along these three rings.

===The River South Region===
Beyond the city center, Tainan city can be divided into two: the River South Region and the River North Region, bounded by the [[Zengwen River]].

River South Region belongs to the Tainan metropolitan area. Satellite towns spread across the region in a radial pattern from the city center. [[Southern Taiwan Science Park]] [[Tainan Science Park|Tainan campus]] is located at the north of the region. According to the [[Council for Economic Planning and Development]], this region is designated to grow further into suburban sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cepd.gov.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0011780&amp;ex=1&amp;ic=0 |title= CEPD |accessdate= 2011-11-02 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043134/http://www.cepd.gov.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0011780&amp;ex=1&amp;ic=0 |archivedate= 2012-04-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The River North Region===
This region is one of the major agricultural centers in Taiwan. There are several regional centers; some of them are as old as Tainan city. These centers are: Xinying, Yujing, Jiali and Madou.

Xinying was the seat of the former Tainan County Government and currently serves as the administration center for the region. Yujing is a regional center for the hilly districts east of the city; it is famous for its mango and was the scene of the [[Tapani incident]]. Jiali is the regional center of the coastal Tainan. It was the base of the Soelangh sub-tribe. Near the bank of the Zengwen River, Madou is the regional center of the lower plain area that bears the name of the river. The town was home to the Mattauw sub-tribe.

==Government and politics==
{{main|Tainan City Government|Tainan City Council}}
{{see also|List of mayors of Tainan|Republic of China municipal elections, 2010#Tainan}}

Tainan City is a [[Special municipality (Republic of China)|special municipality]], which is the highest level local government under Local Government Law of [[Republic of China]]. Technically it is at the same level as Province, although Province is being streamlined. The city is led by the elected city mayor and supervised by the city council. Its subdivisions ''qu'' or districts do not have the autonomy power, instead they are administration units only. Further to the citywide election, there are urban villages (里 ''li'') and neighborhood (鄰 ''lin'') functioning as primary local autonomy entity.

Currently there are two administration centers, one in [[Anping District]] and another in [[Xinying District]]. They are former Provincial Tainan city government and Tainan county government respectively. Administration centers manages citywide affairs and developments such as education and city planning. Apart from administration centers, there are district offices functioning as local access point to the governmental services.

The city has generally been seen as a powerbase for the [[Democratic Progressive Party]], especially in nationwide elections. Although before the merger, the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) have always had more seats in the provincial Tainan city council and KMT won the presidential elections (2008) by a  narrow margin in the city. On the other hand, [[Democratic Progressive Party]] always dominated former Tainan county. In the first municipal election, after the merger, DPP dominated the political demographics of the city. William Lai, a former member of the Legislative Yuan from the DPP won the first mayoral election in 2010.

===City mayor===

Mayor Hsu was re-elected, polling 46% to Chen Rong-sheng's 41%. In 2010, William Lai of the DPP was elected mayor. However, due to Lai's appointment as Premier of the Republic of China in September 2017, the mayor position was replaced by [[Li Meng-yen]] as acting mayor.

===Presidential elections===

A majority of city residents have voted for the winning candidates in many presidential elections since the position was first chosen by popular vote in 1996.

* Annan District was originally the An-Shun township of Tainan County, but was merged into Tainan City in 1946. In 2004, Central District and West District were merged into the new '''West Central''' district.

==Economy==
[[File:TSMC in Tainan Science Park.JPG|thumb|right|TSMC in Tainan Science Park]]

===Industry===
Once reliant on traditional manufacturing industries, the region became a major high-tech industrial hub after the establishment of [[Southern Taiwan Science Park]] in 1995. Optoelectronics, integrated circuits, green energy and biotechnology are the park's dominant industries. Prominent companies are [[Chimei Innolux Corporation|Chimei-Innolux]], [[United Microelectronics Corporation|United Microelectronics]] and [[TSMC]]. With the establishment of Tainan Technology Park, Shugu (Tree Valley) LCD Park and Yonkang Technology Park, the city became a major center for the optoelectronics industry in Taiwan with a complete supply chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LCD manufacturing in Tainan |url=http://web1.tainan.gov.tw/InvestInTainan_eng/CP/11710/present.aspx |work=Tainan City Government |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520044941/http://web1.tainan.gov.tw/InvestInTainan_eng/CP/11710/present.aspx |archivedate=May 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tainan still plays an important role in auto parts, food processing, textiles, plastics and other traditional manufacturing. Notable companies include [[Uni-President Enterprises Corporation|Uni-President]], [[Chi Mei Corporation|Chi Mei]] and Tainan Spinning, which have headquarters in the city. Overall, industrial production accounted for 62.6% of the gross city product in 2010.&lt;ref name="Report on the economic structure to CPED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the economic structure to CPED|url=http://www.cepd.gov.tw/dn.aspx?uid=10314|work=Tainan City Government|accessdate=20 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407043144/http://www.cepd.gov.tw/dn.aspx?uid=10314|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is important to the city, especially the River North Region. While fisheries and fish farming signify the coastal districts, rice and fruit farms shaped the landscape of the inland agriculture region. The city is famous for its milkfish, oyster, rice, mango, sugar cane, pomelo (文旦), pineapple and lotus seed. A state-funded [[Tainan District Agricultural Research &amp; Extension Station|agricultural research center]] was established in [[Xinhua District, Tainan|Xinhua District]] to ensure the market competitiveness of the crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tainan District Agricultural Research &amp; Extension Station, COA |url=http://tndais.coa.gov.tw/view.php?catid=351 |publisher=COA |accessdate=18 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306173655/http://tndais.coa.gov.tw/view.php?catid=351 |archivedate=March 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquarters of the [[World Vegetable Center]], a [[Nonprofit organization|NPO]] that aims to improve crop quality in poorer countries, is in [[Shanhua District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AVRDC|url=http://avrdc.org/?page_id=698|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once dominant industries, salt and sugar production are declining to almost non-existence. Taiyen (Taiwan salt) co. and Taiwan Sugar Corp., both headquartered in Tainan, transformed to businesses in biotechnology, quality agriculture, retail and tourism.

Orchid growing is one of the most symbolic agriculture industry for its well-known brand name in the [[floristry]] world. A nationally founded special plantation district with R&amp;D resources is established in [[Houbi District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taiwan Orchid Plantation|url=http://top.tainan.gov.tw/a.php|work=Taiwan Orchid Plantation|accessdate=20 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021041136/http://top.tainan.gov.tw/a.php|archive-date=2011-10-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
Tourism is an industry with increasing importance. As the first capital of Taiwan, the wealth resource of cultural heritage and its potential is under exploration. In the first half of 2013, there were over 7 million tourist visited attractions in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=zh:臺南市觀光遊憩景點遊客人次統計|url=http://tour.tainan.gov.tw/Upload/UserFiles/102%E5%B9%B4%E8%87%BA%E5%8D%97%E5%B8%82%E8%A7%80%E5%85%89%E9%81%8A%E6%86%A9%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E9%81%8A%E5%AE%A2%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%A1%E7%B5%B1%E8%A8%88(1-7%E6%9C%88).pdf|work=Tainan City Government Tourism Bureau Official Website|publisher=Tainan City Government Tourism Bureau|accessdate=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128054942/http://tour.tainan.gov.tw/Upload/UserFiles/102%E5%B9%B4%E8%87%BA%E5%8D%97%E5%B8%82%E8%A7%80%E5%85%89%E9%81%8A%E6%86%A9%E6%99%AF%E9%BB%9E%E9%81%8A%E5%AE%A2%E4%BA%BA%E6%AC%A1%E7%B5%B1%E8%A8%88(1-7%E6%9C%88).pdf|archive-date=2016-01-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are high-end hotels in the city, including the Shangri-la Hotel near Tainan train station.

===Retail===
Retail and services is the largest employment sector in Tainan, margined at 52% in 2010.&lt;ref name="Report on the economic structure to CPED"/&gt; The city center hosts five department stores including two Shin Kong-Mitsukoshi, two FE21s and Focus square. Apart from the city center, there are shopping precincts around the city, with the strongest presence in East, North and Yongkang districts. 'Dream Mall' is a joint development project between Uni-President Corp. and Tainan Spinning Ltd. It was the largest shopping center in the city when it opened Feb 12, 2015 and the precinct will host the new headquarters of Tainan Spinning and a new five-star hotel. The precinct is in the designated East Tainan second CBD near the border of the East and Yongkang districts.

===Public transport===
Original plan for [[:zh:台南捷運|Tainan MRT]] system is muted due to the construction cost and the question of insufficient ridership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsr.gov.tw/homepage.nsf/038ecb2053a216c44825688c000d7a45/c03b4eef9cb62868482570ba0035c379?OpenDocument|title=MRT Plans| language = zh-hans|publisher=Bureau of High Speed Rail|accessdate=2008-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upgrading current railway and buses are now considered as alternative citywide modern public transport options.

Tainan has three major bus operators. They are Singing Bus Co., Shinan Buses and Kaohsiung Buses, operating in river north region, intercity routes and metropolitan routes respectively. In 2012, the city government called to restructure Singing Bus and Shinan Buses route to form a Tainan City Bus System. This new system, which set to start operation in 2013, has six main routes connecting the city and eight main interchanges. From the main routes 66 branch routes then spread out to service local communities. City government hope this new system will boost the public transports ridership and progress into metro-bus system in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citybus.tainan.gov.tw/zh/news/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302112439/http://citybus.tainan.gov.tw/zh/news/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 March 2013|title=Tainan City Bus System|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tainan Public Transport Plans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tainan.gov.tw/tainan/dep_news.asp?nsub=A3A000&amp;ID={E12E1FEB-774D-4BD4-A3A7-E361B125D784}&amp;searchtext=%E5%8F%B0%E5%8D%97%E5%B8%82%E6%8D%B7%E9%81%8B%E5%8C%96%E5%85%AC%E5%85%B1%E9%81%8B%E8%BC%B8%E7%B3%BB%E7%B5%B1|work=Tainan City Government|publisher=Tainan City Government|title=Tainan Public Transport Plan|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A project to transform the railway in the city center into an underground is underway as part of the National wide ''TRA Rapid Transit Systematization in the Metropolitan Areas Project''. This project will help increase service frequency by eliminate potential disruption between road and rail traffic. Further to underground transformation, two new stations are planned to serve East district commuters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rrb.gov.tw/04100.aspx?id=8&amp;lan=enc|title=The Tainan Urban District Railway Underground Project|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[Shalun Line|Shalun HSR link]], this section of TRA corridor will become the backbone of the rail transit system in Tainan.&lt;ref name="Tainan Public Transport Plans"/&gt;

[[File:British Library fragment of the Testament of Ba.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Fragment of the ''Testament of Ba'' at the [[British Library]], with six incomplete lines of [[Tibetan script|Tibetan writing]] ({{IDP|Or.8210/S.9498A}}).]]
'''''The Testament of Ba''''' (Tibetan དབའ་བཞེད or སྦ་བཞེད; [[Wylie transliteration]]: ''dba' bzhed'' or ''sba bzhed'') is an account written in [[Classical Tibetan|Old Tibetan]] of the establishment of [[Buddhism]] in Tibet and the foundation of the [[Samye Monastery]] during the reign of King [[Trisong Detsen]] (r. 755–797/804), reputedly as recorded by Ba Salnang (Tibetan དབའ་གསལ་སྣང or སྦ་གསལ་སྣང; [[Wylie transliteration]]: ''dba' gsal snang'' or ''sba gsal snang''), a member of the king's court. The earliest known versions of the text are two manuscript fragments dating to the 9th or 10th centuries that are held at the [[British Library]].

== Versions of the text ==
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
The ''Testament of Ba'' was transmitted in manuscript form over many centuries, and so there are many different recensions of the text, but not one single, canonical printed version.&lt;ref name="jaos-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=van Schaik | first1=Sam | last2=Iwao | first2=Kazushi | title=Fragments of the Testament of Ba from Dunhuang | journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] | year=2009 | volume=128 | issue=3 | pages=477–487 | issn=0003-0279
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two early versions of the text have been identified by scholars:

* A manuscript in 31 folios discovered in Lhasa in 1997, titled ''Dba' bzhed'' (with a 'd' prefix to the Ba clan name), that is thought to be a revised copy of an 11th-century manuscript, and which was published in facsimile with an English translation in 2000;&lt;ref name="wangdu"&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Wangdu | first1=Pasang | last2=Diemberger | first2=Hildegard | title=dBa' bzhed: the royal narrative concerning the bringing of the Buddha's doctrine to Tibet | publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften | year=2000 | isbn=978-3-7001-2956-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEgnAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three manuscripts titled ''Sba bzhed'' (with an 's' prefix to the Ba clan name), one of which dates to the 12th century, that were used as the basis of an edition published in Beijing in 1980.&lt;ref name="jaos-2009"/&gt;

The ''Testament of Ba'' is also widely quoted in later Tibetan historigraphical works, for example the ''Scholar's Feast'' (''mkhas pa'i dga' ston''). The author of the ''Scholar's Feast'' calls the ''Testament'' the ''Rba bzhed'' (with an 'r' prefix to the Ba clan name), and refers to 'genuine', 'impure', 'large' and 'medium' versions of the text.&lt;ref name="jaos-2009"/&gt;

A later, expanded version of the ''Testament of Ba'', titled ''Sba bzhed zhabs brtags pa'' (''Supplemented Testament of Ba''), was produced during the mid 14th century. A manuscript copy of this text was published with a summary in French by [[Rolf Stein]] in 1961.&lt;ref name="jaos-2009"/&gt;

Up until 2009 it was thought that the ''Testament of Ba'' dated back to no earlier than the 11th or 12th century, and therefore its composition may not have been contemporaneous with the late 8th century events that it recorded.&lt;ref name="jaos-2009"/&gt;  However, in 2009 [[Sam van Schaik]] of the [[British Library]] realised that two Tibetan manuscript fragments catalogued amongst the Chinese manuscripts of the [[Aurel Stein|Stein]] collection (and consequently previously overlooked by Tibetan scholars) preserved a section of the ''Testament of Ba'' relating to the arrival of the Indian monk [[Śāntarakṣita]], abbot of [[Nalanda]] University, to [[Lhasa]]:&lt;ref name="earlytibet"&gt;{{Cite web | last=Van Schaik | first=Sam | title=The Abbot, or Ironing out History's Wrinkles | url=http://earlytibet.com/2009/11/30/the-abbot/ | date=20 November 2009 | accessdate=2011-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IDP|Or.8210/S.9498A}} (6 lines)
* {{IDP|Or.8210/S.13683}} (1 line)

These two fragments came from the '[[Mogao Caves|Library Cave]]' at [[Dunhuang]], which was sealed in the early 11th century, and so pre-date all of the other known versions of the ''Testament of Ba''. Van Schaik dates the fragments to the 9th or 10th centuries.&lt;ref name="jaos-2009"/&gt;

The text of the British Library fragments is very close to that of the ''Dba' bzhed'' manuscript discovered in Lhasa in 1997, but has some differences that suggest that it represents an earlier recension of the ''Testament of Ba''. Most notably, in the British Library fragments the king is concerned that the foreign monk may have brought evil spirits with him, and so Śāntarakṣita is confined in the [[Jokhang]] and interrogated for three months through an interpreter called Ananta. However, the Lhasa manuscript softens the language, politely asking Śāntarakṣita to stay at the Jokhang rather than having him forcibly confined there.&lt;ref name="earlytibet"/&gt;

'''Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance''' ({{lang-uk|Український Інститут Національної Пам’яті}}, UINR), or Ukrainian Institute of National Memory (UINM) is the central executive body operating under the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Established on 31 May 2006 as a special organ for the restoration and preservation of national memory of the Ukrainian people. From 2006 till 2010 it was a central governmental institution with a special status, while from 2010 to 2014 a research budget institution.

On December 9, 2010, the UINR was discontinued by a decree issued by [[Viktor Yanukovych]] and on the same day the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine created the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance as a research institution instead, within the budget from the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

==Decommunization of Ukraine==
In May 2015 President Poroshenko signed [[Ukrainian decommunization laws|four laws]] concerning [[Decommunization in Ukraine]]. The director of the Institute, [[Volodymyr Viatrovych]], was involved in the drafting of two of these laws. The criminal sentences imposed by these acts and their phrasing came in for criticism within the country and abroad. 

The law "On access to the archives of repressive bodies of the communist totalitarian regime from 1917-1991" placed the state archives concerning repression during the Soviet period under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian Institute of National Remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1462928536|title=’Decommunization’ in Ukraine Carried Out Using Communist Methods - Human Rights in Ukraine|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knickers1.jpg|thumb|267px|Women's [[panties]] or knickers]]
[[File:Boxer 002.jpg|thumb|267px|Men's [[boxer shorts]] and [[boxer briefs]]]]
'''Undergarments''' are items of [[clothing]] worn beneath outer clothes, usually in direct contact with the skin, although they may comprise more than a single layer. They serve to keep outer garments from being soiled or damaged by [[Human waste|bodily excretions]], to lessen the [[friction]] of outerwear against the skin, to shape the body, and to provide concealment or support for parts of it. In cold weather, [[long underwear]] is sometimes worn to provide additional warmth. Special types of undergarments have religious significance. Some items of clothing are designed as undergarments, while others, such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts, are appropriate both as undergarments and as outer clothing. If made of suitable material or [[textile]], some undergarments can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s, and some are intended for [[sexual attraction]] or visual appeal.

Undergarments are generally of two types, those that are worn to cover the torso and those that are worn to cover the waist and legs, although there are also garments which cover both. Different styles of undergarments are generally worn by females and males. Undergarments commonly worn by females today include [[bra]]s and [[panties]] (known in the United Kingdom as [[panties|knickers]]), while males often wear [[briefs]], [[boxer briefs]], or [[boxer shorts]]. Items worn by both sexes include T-shirts, [[sleeveless shirt]]s (also called singlets or tank tops), [[Bikini (underwear)|bikini underwear]], [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]], and [[G-string]]s.

== Terminology ==
Undergarments are known by a number of terms. ''[[wikt:underclothes|Underclothes]]'', ''underclothing''  and ''[[wikt:underwear|underwear]]'' are formal terms, while undergarments may be more casually called, in Australia, ''[[wikt:Reg Grundys|Reg Grundys]]'' ([[rhyming slang]] for ''undies'') and ''Reginalds'', and, in the United Kingdom, ''[[wikt:smalls|smalls]]'' (from the earlier ''smallclothes'') and (historically) ''unmentionables''. In the United States, women's underwear may be known as ''delicates'' due to the recommended washing machine cycle or because they are, simply put, delicate.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}

Women's undergarments collectively are called ''[[lingerie]]''. They also are called ''intimate clothing'' and ''[[wikt:intimate|intimates]]''.

An [[undershirt]] (''[[wikt:vest|vest]]'' in the United Kingdom) is a piece of underwear covering the [[torso]], while [[underpants]] (often ''[[wikt:pants|pants]]'' in the United Kingdom), [[wikt:drawers|drawers]], and shorts cover the [[Sex organ|genitals]] and buttocks. Terms for specific undergarments are shown in the table [[#Types and styles|below]].

Not wearing underpants under outer clothing is known in American slang as ''freeballing'' for men and as ''[[going commando]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Go commando|url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/gocommando.asp|publisher=Word Spy|date=9 April 2001|accessdate=3 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; for either sex. The act of a woman not wearing a bra is sometimes referred to as ''freeboobing''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiles|first=Rebecca|title=DO THIS DON'T: Go Braless With Big Boobs|newspaper=XOJane|date=2 August 2013|accessdate=24 June 2016|url=http://www.xojane.com/fashion/do-this-dont-go-braless-with-big-boobs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Underwear is worn for a variety of reasons. They keep outer garments from being soiled by [[perspiration]], [[urine]],&lt;ref&gt;US Patent Number 6447493&lt;/ref&gt; [[semen]], [[menstrual blood]], and [[human feces|feces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Voelkel|first=Megan|title=Germ Warfare|newspaper=The Standard|date=31 July 2000|accessdate=23 May 2009|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_print.asp?art_id=69373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's [[brassiere]]s provide support for the [[breast]]s, and men's [[briefs]] serve the same function for the [[Male reproductive system (human)|male genitalia]]. A [[corset]] may be worn as a [[foundation garment]] to alter a woman's [[female body shape|body shape]]. For additional support and protection when playing sports, men often wear more tightly fitting underwear, including [[jockstrap]]s and jockstraps with cup pocket and [[jockstrap#Protective cup|protective cup]]. Women may wear [[sports bra]]s which provide greater support, thus increasing comfort and reducing the chance of damage to the [[ligament]]s of the chest during high-impact exercises such as jogging.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}

In cold climates, underwear may constitute an additional layer of clothing helping to keep the wearer warm. Underwear may also be used to preserve the wearer's [[modesty]] – for instance, some women wear [[camisole]]s and [[Slip (clothing)|slips]] ([[petticoat]]s) under clothes that are [[Sheer (textile)|sheer]]. Conversely, some types of underwear can be worn for sexual titillation, such as [[edible underwear]], crotchless panties and [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]].{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}

Some items of clothing are designed exclusively as underwear, while others such as [[T-shirt]]s and certain types of shorts are suitable both as underwear and as outer clothing. The suitability of underwear as outer clothing is, apart from the indoor or outdoor climate, largely dependent on societal norms, fashion, and the requirements of the law. If made of suitable material, some underwear can serve as [[nightwear]] or [[swimsuit]]s.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}

=== Religious functions ===
Undergarments can also have religious significance:

&lt;!--Please arrange alphabetically.--&gt;
* '''Judaism'''.  To conform with societal dress codes, the ''[[tallit katan]]'' is often worn beneath the shirt.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}
* '''Mormonism'''. Following their [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] in a [[Temple (Mormonism)|temple]], [[Mormonism|Mormons]] wear special [[temple garment]]s which help them to remember the teachings of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preparing to enter the Holy Temple|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]|accessdate=30 July 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313080439/https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng|archivedate=13 March 2014|df=dmy-all}} Archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sikhism'''. One of the five articles of faith (''[[Five Ks|panj kakaar]]'') worn by [[Sikhism|Sikh]] men and women is a certain style of underpants similar to [[boxer shorts]] and known as the ''[[kacchera]]''.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}
* '''Zoroastrianism'''. Zoroastrians wear an undershirt called a ''[[Sedreh]]'' that is fastened with a sacred girdle around the waist known as a ''[[Kushti]]''.{{citation needed|date = April 2016}}

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:PiazzaArmerina-Mosaik-Bikini.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[mosaic]] from the [[Piazza Armerina]] in Sicily showing a woman wearing a ''[[strophium]]'' (breastcloth) and a ''[[subligaculum]]'']]
[[File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry juillet braies.jpg|thumb|upright|A loincloth in 1412 ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]
The [[loincloth]] is the simplest form of underwear; it was probably the first undergarment worn by human beings. In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an outer garment rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only undergarment available.

A loincloth may take three major forms. The first, and simplest, is simply a long strip of material which is passed between the legs and then around the waist. Archaeologists have found the remains of such loincloths made of leather dating back 7,000 years.&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rushton|first=Susie|title=A brief history of pants: Why men's smalls have always been a subject of concern|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/a-brief-history-of-pants-why-mens-smalls-have-always-been-a-subject-of-concern-771772.html|work=[[The Independent]] (''Extra'')|date=22 January 2008|pages=2–5|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Hawaiian ''malo'' was of this form, as are several styles of the Japanese ''[[fundoshi]]''. Another form is usually called a [[cache-sexe]]: a triangle of cloth is provided with strings or loops, which are used to fasten the triangle between the legs and over the genitals. [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]] (1341 BC – 1323 BC) was found buried with numerous [[linen]] loincloths of this style.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;&lt;!--The article used to state "145", but this number is currently unreferenced.--&gt; An alternate form is more [[skirt]]-like: a cloth is wrapped around the hips several times and then fastened with a [[girdle]].

Men are said to have worn loincloths in [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], though it is unclear whether Greek women wore undergarments. There is some speculation that only slaves wore loincloths and that citizens did not wear undergarments beneath their [[Chiton (costume)|chitons]]. [[Mosaic]]s of the Roman period indicate that women (primarily in an athletic context, whilst wearing nothing else) sometimes wore ''strophiae'' (breastcloths) or [[brassiere]]s made of soft leather, along with ''[[Subligaculum|subligacula]]'' which were either in the form of shorts or loincloths. ''Subligacula'' were also worn by men.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

The fabric used for loincloths may have been [[wool]], [[linen]] or a [[linsey-woolsey]] blend. Only the upper classes could have afforded imported silk.

The loincloth continues to be worn by people around the world – it is the traditional form of undergarment in many Asian societies, for example. In various, mainly tropical, cultures, the traditional male dress may still consist of only a single garment below the waist or even none at all, with underwear as optional, including the Indian ''[[dhoti]]'' and ''[[lungi]]'', or the Scottish [[kilt]].

[[File:Braies.jpg|thumb|left|Medieval ''[[braies]]'']]

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
In the [[Middle Ages]], western men's underwear became looser fitting. The loincloth was replaced by loose, [[Trousers|trouser]]-like clothing called [[braies]], which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf. Wealthier men often wore [[chausses]] as well, which only covered the legs.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Braies (or rather [[braccae]]) were a type of trouser worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages. In the later Middle Ages they were used exclusively as undergarments.

[[File:Tizian 081.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1532–1533 portrait by [[Titian]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], in a codpiece]]

By the time of the [[Renaissance]], braies had become shorter to accommodate longer styles of chausses. Chausses were also giving way to form-fitting [[Hose (clothing)|hose]],&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; which covered the legs and feet. Fifteenth-century hose were often particolored, with each leg in a different-coloured fabric or even more than one colour on a leg. However, many types of braies, chausses and hose were not intended to be covered up by other clothing, so they were not actually underwear in the strict sense.

Braies were usually fitted with a front flap that was buttoned or tied closed. This [[codpiece]] allowed men to [[Urination|urinate]] without having to remove the braies completely.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Codpieces were also worn with hose when very short [[Doublet (clothing)|doublets]] – vest- (UK: waistcoat-) like garments tied together in the front and worn under other clothing – were in fashion, as early forms of hose were open at the [[crotch]]. [[Henry VIII of England]] began padding his codpiece, which caused a spiralling trend of larger and larger codpieces that only ended by the end of the 16th century. It has been speculated that the King may have had the [[sexually transmitted disease]] [[syphilis]], and his large codpiece may have included a bandage soaked in medication to relieve its symptoms.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Henry VIII also wanted a healthy son and may have thought that projecting himself in this way would portray fertility. Codpieces were sometimes used as a pocket for holding small items.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

[[File:Elizabeth Vernon big.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A lady in her private [[boudoir]]; wearing an informal embroidered jacket over her rose-pink [[corset]] or simple [[bodice]] and decorated [[petticoat]], ''c.'' 1600]]

Over the upper part of their bodies, both medieval men and women usually wore a close-fitting shirt-like garment called a [[chemise]] in France, or a smock or shift in England. The forerunner of the modern-day shirt, the chemise was tucked into a man's braies, under his outer clothing. Women wore a chemise underneath their [[gown]]s or [[robe]]s, sometimes with [[petticoat]]s over the chemise. Elaborately [[Quilting|quilted]] petticoats might be displayed by a cut-away dress, in which case they served a skirt rather than an undergarment. During the 16th century, the [[farthingale]] was popular. This was a petticoat stiffened with [[Phragmites|reed]] or [[willow]] rods so that it stood out from a woman's body like a cone extending from the waist.

Corsets also began to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a stiffened decorative [[bodice]] worn on top of another bodice stiffened with [[buckram]], reeds, canes, [[Baleen|whalebone]] or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the [[Victorian era]], but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.

There is a myth that [[Crusades|Crusaders]], worried about the [[fidelity]] of their wives, forced them to wear [[chastity belt]]s. There is no reference, image, or surviving belt to support this story. Most historians of this period are of the view that a chastity belt was worn to prevent sexual assault and that the woman kept the key.{{citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Men's braies and hose were eventually replaced by simple cotton, silk, or [[linen]] drawers, which were usually knee-length trousers with a button flap in the front.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

Medieval people wearing only tunics, without underpants, can be seen on works like [[commons:File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - The Ass in the School - WGA03526.jpg|The Ass in the School]] by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], in the
[[commons:File:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry février.jpg|Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry]] by [[Limbourg Brothers]], or in the [[commons:File:15th-century unknown painters - Grimani Breviary - The Month of February - WGA15776.jpg|Grimani Breviary: The Month of February]] by [[Gerard Horenbout]].

In 2012, findings in [[Lengberg Castle]], in [[Austria]], showed that [[lace]] and [[linen]] brassiere-like garments, one of which greatly resembled the modern bra, date back to hundreds of years before it was thought to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Time|accessdate=21 July 2012|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/19/600-year-old-bras-unearthed-in-austrian-castle/|title=600-year-old bras unearthed in Austrian castle|date=19 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=uibk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/urgeschichte/projekte_forschung/textilien-lengberg/medieval-lingerie-from-lengberg-castle-east-tyrol.html |accessdate=21 July 2012 |publisher=University of Innsbruck |title=Medieval lingerie from Lengberg, East-Tyrol |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206041713/http://www.uibk.ac.at/urgeschichte/projekte_forschung/textilien-lengberg/medieval-lingerie-from-lengberg-castle-east-tyrol.html |archivedate= 6 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlightenment and Industrial Age ===
[[File:Tight lacing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|''Tight Lacing, or Fashion Before Ease'', an early-1770s [[Satire|satirical]] drawing by John Collet]]

The invention of the [[spinning jenny]] machines and the [[cotton gin]] in the second half of the 18th century made cotton fabrics widely available. This allowed factories to [[mass production|mass-produce]] underwear, and for the first time, people began buying undergarments in stores rather than making them at home.

Women's [[History of corsets#16th to late 18th centuries|stays]] of the 18th century were laced behind and drew the shoulders back to form a high, round bosom and erect posture. Coloured stays were popular. With the relaxed country styles of the end of the century, stays became shorter and were [[Bone (corsetry)|unboned]] or only lightly boned, and were now called corsets. As tight waists became fashionable in the 1820s, the corset was again boned and laced to form the figure. By the 1860s, a tiny ("[[Wasp waist|wasp]]") waist came to be seen as a symbol of beauty, and the corsets were stiffened with whalebone or steel to accomplish this. Tight lacing of a corset sometimes led to a woman needing to retire to the [[fainting room]]. By the 1880s, the [[Victorian dress reform|dress reform]] movement was campaigning against the pain and damage to internal organs and bones caused by [[Tightlacing|tight lacing]]. Inez Gaches-Sarraute invented the "health corset", with a straight-fronted bust made to help support the wearer's muscles.

The corset was usually worn over a thin shirt-like shift of linen or cotton or [[muslin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regency nightwear: Shift|url=http://www.janeausten.co.uk/magazine/page.ihtml?pid=478&amp;step=4|publisher=[[Jane Austen|The Jane Austen Centre]]|accessdate=7 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skirt]] styles became shorter and long drawers called [[pantalettes]] or [[wikt:pantaloons|pantaloons]] kept the legs covered. Pantalettes originated in France in the early 19th century, and quickly spread to Britain and America. Pantalettes were a form of [[leggings]] or long drawers. They could be one-piece or two separate garments, one for each leg, attached at the waist with buttons or laces. The crotch was left open for hygiene reasons.

[[File:Perfect Health Corset.png|thumb|left|"Health corsets" in 1883]]
As skirts became fuller from the 1830s, women wore many petticoats to achieve a fashionable bell shape. By the 1850s, stiffened [[crinoline]]s and later [[hoop skirt]]s allowed ever wider skirts to be worn. The [[bustle]], a frame or pad worn over the buttocks to enhance their shape, had been used off and on by women for two centuries, but reached the height of its popularity in the later 1880s, and went out of fashion for good in the 1890s.
Women dressed in crinolines often wore drawers under them for modesty and warmth.

Another common undergarment of the late 19th century for men, women, and children was the [[union suit]]. Invented in [[Utica, New York]] and patented in 1868, this was a one-piece front-buttoning garment usually made of knitted material with sleeves extending to the wrists and legs down to the ankles. It had a buttoned flap (known colloquially as the "access hatch", "drop seat", or "fireman's flap") in the back to ease visits to the toilet. The union suit was the precursor of [[Long underwear|long johns]], a two-piece garment consisting of a long-sleeved top and long pants possibly named after American boxer [[John L. Sullivan]] who wore a similar garment in the ring.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

The [[jockstrap]] was invented in 1874, by C.F. Bennett of a Chicago sporting goods company, Sharp &amp; Smith, to provide comfort and support for bicycle jockeys riding the [[cobblestone]] streets of [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; In 1897 Bennett's newly formed Bike Web Company patented and began mass-producing the Bike Jockey Strap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|publisher=[[BIKE Athletic Company]]|year=2004|accessdate=7 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124113927/http://www.bikeathletic.com/History.aspx|archivedate=24 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900s to 1920s ===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}
[[File:Underwear1913.JPG|thumb|upright|Ladies' underwear advertisement, 1913]]
[[File:NewBritainUnderwearWashingDirections.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|How to handwash the New Britain Standard Hygienic Underwear, ''c.'' 1915]]

By the early 20th century, the mass-produced undergarment industry was booming, and competition forced producers to come up with all sorts of innovative and gimmicky designs to compete. The [[Hanes]] company emerged from this boom and quickly established itself as a top manufacturer of union suits, which were common until the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Textile technology continued to improve, and the time to make a single union suit dropped from days to minutes.

Meanwhile, designers of women's undergarments relaxed the corset. The invention of new, flexible but supportive materials allowed whalebone and steel bones to be removed. The emancipation or [[liberty bodice]] offered an alternative to constricting corsets, and in Australia and the UK the liberty bodice became a standard item for girls as well as women.

Men's underwear was also on the rise. Benjamin Joseph Clark, a migrant to [[Louisiana]] from [[New Jersey]], opened a [[venture capital]]ist firm named Bossier in [[Bossier Parish, Louisiana|Bossier Parish]]. One product manufactured by his firm was tightly fitting boxers that resembled modern underwear. Though the company was bankrupt by the early 20th century, it had some impact on men's underwear design.

Underwear advertising first made an appearance in the 1910s. The first underwear print advertisement in the US appeared in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1911 and featured oil paintings by [[J. C. Leyendecker]] of the "Kenosha Klosed Krotch". Early underwear advertisements emphasised durability and comfort, and fashion was not regarded as a selling point.

By the end of the 1910s, Chalmers Knitting Company split the union suit into upper and lower sections, effectively inventing the modern undershirt and drawers. Women wore lacier versions of this basic duo known as the [[camisole]] and tap pants.
[[File:WarnerStyle70 1922.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.4|A corset over "step ins" and camisole, 1922]]

In 1912, the US had its first professional underwear designer. Lindsay "Layneau" Boudreaux, a French immigrant, established the short-lived panty company Layneau. Though her company closed within one year, it had a significant impact on many levels. Boudreaux showed the world that an American woman could establish and run a company, and she also caused a revolution in the underwear industry.

In 1913, a New York socialite named [[Mary Phelps Jacob]] created the first modern brassiere by tying two handkerchiefs together with ribbon. Jacob's original intention was to cover the whalebone sticking out of her corset, which was visible through her sheer dress. Jacob began making brassieres for her family and friends, and news of the garment soon spread by word of mouth. By 1914, Jacob had a patent for her design and was marketing it throughout the US. Although women had worn brassiere-like garments in years past, Jacob's was the first to be successfully marketed and widely adopted.

By the end of the decade, trouser-like "[[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]]", which were popularized by [[Amelia Jenks Bloomer]] (1818–1894) but invented by [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]], gained popularity with the so-called [[Gibson Girl]]s who enjoyed pursuits such as cycling and tennis. This new female athleticism helped push the corset out of style. The other major factor in the corset's demise was the fact that metal was globally in short supply during the First World War. Steel-laced corsets were dropped in favour of the brassiere.

Meanwhile, World War I soldiers were issued button-front shorts as underwear. The buttons attached to a separate piece of cloth, or "yoke", sewn to the front of the garment, and tightness of fit was adjusted by means of ties on the sides. This design proved so popular that it began to supplant the union suit in popularity by the end of the war. [[Rayon]] garments also became widely available in the post-war period.

In the 1920s, manufacturers shifted emphasis from durability to comfort. Union suit advertisements raved about patented new designs that reduced the number of buttons and increased accessibility. Most of these experimental designs had to do with new ways to hold closed the crotch flap common on most union suits and drawers. A new woven cotton fabric called [[nainsook]] gained popularity in the 1920s for its durability. Retailers also began selling preshrunk undergarments.

Also in the 1920s, as [[hemline]]s of women's dresses rose, women began to wear stockings to cover the exposed legs. Women's bloomers also became much shorter. The shorter bloomers became looser and less supportive as the boyish [[flapper]] look came into fashion. By the end of the decade, they came to be known as "step-ins", very much like modern panties but with wider legs. They were worn for the increased flexibility they afforded.

The [[Garter belts|garter belt]] was invented to keep stockings from falling. 

In 1928, [[Maidenform]], a company operated by [[Ida Rosenthal]], a Russian immigrant, developed the brassiere and introduced modern cup sizes for bras.

=== 1930s and 1940s ===
[[File:Maninboxers.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|A man wearing a pair of [[boxer shorts]]]]

Modern men's underwear was largely an invention of the 1930s. On 19 January 1935, [[Coopers Inc.]] sold the world's first briefs in Chicago. Designed by an "apparel engineer" named Arthur Kneibler, briefs dispensed with leg sections and had a Y-shaped overlapping fly.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; The company dubbed the design the "Jockey" since it offered a degree of support that had previously only been available from the jockstrap. Jockey briefs proved so popular that over 30,000 pairs were sold within three months of their introduction. Coopers, having renamed the company [[Jockey International|Jockey]], sent its "Mascul-line" plane to make special deliveries of "masculine support" briefs to retailers across the US. In 1938, when Jockeys were introduced in the UK, they sold at the rate of 3,000 a week.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

In this decade, companies also began selling buttonless drawers fitted with an elastic waistband. These were the first true boxer shorts, which were named for their resemblance to the shorts worn by [[Boxing|professional fighters]]. Scovil Manufacturing introduced the [[snap fastener]] at this time, which became a popular addition to various kinds of undergarments.

Women of the 1930s brought the corset back, now called the "[[girdle]]". The garment lacked the whalebone and metal supports and usually came with a brassiere (now usually called a "bra") and attached garters.

During World War II, elastic waistbands and metal snaps gave way once again to button fasteners due to rubber and metal shortages. Undergarments were harder to find as well, since soldiers abroad had priority to obtain them. By the end of the war, Jockey and Hanes remained the industry leaders in the US, but Cluett, Peabody and Company made a name for itself when it introduced a preshrinking process called "[[Sanforization]]", invented by Sanford Cluett in 1933, which came to be licensed by most major manufacturers.

Meanwhile, some women adopted the corset once again, now called the "[[Waist cincher|waspie]]" for the [[wasp]]-shaped [[waist]]line it gave the wearer. Many women began wearing the strapless bra as well, which gained popularity for its ability to push the breasts up and [[Cleavage enhancement|enhance cleavage]].

=== 1950s and '60s ===
Before the 1950s, underwear consisted of simple, white pieces of clothing which were not to be shown in public. In the 1950s, underwear came to be promoted as a fashion item in its own right, and came to be made in prints and colours. Manufacturers also experimented with rayon and newer fabrics like [[Dacron]], nylon, and [[Spandex]].&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; By the 1960, men's underwear was regularly printed in loud patterns, or with messages or images such as cartoon characters.

Women's undergarments began to emphasize the breasts instead of the waist. The decade saw the introduction of the bullet bra pointed bust, inspired by [[Christian Dior]]'s "[[Christian Dior#The New Look|New Look]]", which featured pointed cups. The original [[Wonderbra]] and [[Brassiere designs|push-up bra]] by [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] finally hit it big.  Women's panties became more colourful and decorative, and by the mid-1960s were available in two abbreviated styles called the hip-hugger and the [[bikini]] (named after the Pacific Ocean [[Bikini Atoll|island]] of that name), frequently in sheer nylon fabric.

[[Pantyhose]], also called ''tights'' in British English, which combined panties and hose into one garment, made their first appearance in 1959,&lt;ref name=Belkin1986&gt;{{cite news|last=Belkin|first=Lisa|title=Lingerie's Great Leap Forward|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/business/lingerie-s-great-leap-forward.html|accessdate=17 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 August 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; invented by Glen Raven Mills of [[North Carolina]]. The company later introduced seamless pantyhose in 1965, spurred by the popularity of the [[miniskirt]]. By the end of the decade, the girdle had fallen out of favour as women chose sexier, lighter, and more comfortable alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Delis Hill|title=As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising [Costume Society of America series]|location=Lubbock|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|year=2005|page=153|isbn=0-89672-534-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emergence of the woman's movement in the United States sales for pantyhose dropped off during the later half of the 1960s having soared initially.&lt;ref name=Belkin1986 /&gt;

Underwear as fashion reached its peak in the 1970s and 1980s, and underwear advertisers forgot about comfort and durability, at least in advertising. [[Sexual attraction|Sex appeal]] became the main selling point, in swimwear as well, bringing to fruition a trend that had been building since at least the flapper era.

The [[Sleeveless shirt|tank top]], an undershirt named after the type of swimwear dating from the 1920s known as a tank suit or [[maillot]], became popular warm-weather casual outerwear in the US in the 1980s. Performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] were also often seen wearing their undergarments on top of other clothes.

Although worn for decades by [[exotic dancer]]s, in the 1980s the [[G-string]] first gained popularity in South America, particularly in Brazil. Originally a style of [[swimsuit]], the back of the garment is so narrow that it disappears between the buttocks. By the 1990s the design had made its way to most of the Western world, and [[Thong (clothing)|thong underwear]] became popular. Today, the thong is one of the fastest-selling styles of underwear among women, and is also worn by men.

While health and practicality had previously been emphasized, in the 1970s retailers of men's underpants began focusing on fashion and sex appeal. Designers such as [[Calvin Klein]] began featuring near-naked models in their advertisements for white [[briefs]]. The increased wealth of the [[gay community]] helped to promote a diversity of undergarment choices.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In his book ''[[The Philosophy of Andy Warhol]]'' (1975),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Andy Warhol]]|title=The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: (From A to B and Back Again)|location=London|publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Cassell]]|year=1975|isbn=0-86018-109-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Warhol]] wrote:

{{quote|I told B I needed some socks too and at least 30 pairs of Jockey shorts. He suggested I switch to Italian-style [[briefs]], the ones with the T-shaped crotch that tends to build you up. I told him I'd tried them once, in Rome, the day I was walking through a [[Elizabeth Taylor|Liz Taylor]] movie – and I didn't like them because they made me too self-aware. It gave me the feeling girls must have when they wear uplift bras.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;}}

Warhol liked his Jockey [[briefs]] so much that he used a pair as a canvas for one of his dollar-sign paintings.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

In the UK in the 1970s, tight jeans gave briefs a continued edge over boxer shorts among young men, but a decade later boxers were given a boost by [[Nick Kamen]]'s performance in [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi]]'s "Launderette" TV commercial for its [[Levi's 501 jean|501 jeans]], during which he stripped down to a pair of white boxer shorts in a public [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt; Briefs however remained popular in America from the 1950s (amongst young men) until the mid 1990s and in Australia the brief remains popular today and has become iconic.

The 1990s saw the introduction of [[boxer briefs]], which take the longer shape of boxers but maintain the tightness of briefs. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] stars popularized "[[Sagging (fashion)|sagging]]", in which loosely fitting jeans or shorts were allowed to droop below the waist, exposing the waistband or a greater portion of boxer shorts, briefs, or boxer briefs worn underneath. The chiseled muscularity of [[Mark Wahlberg]] (then known as Marky Mark) in a series of 1990s underwear advertisements for Calvin Klein briefs led to his success as a white hip hop star and a [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] actor.&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

== Trends ==
{{Also|Underwear fetishism}}
Some people choose not to wear any underpants, a practice sometimes referred to as "[[going commando]]", for comfort, to enable their outer garments (particularly those which are form-fitting) to look more flattering, to avoid creating a [[panty line]], because they find it sexually exciting, or because they do not see any need for them. Certain types of clothes, such as [[cycling shorts]] and [[kilt]]s, are designed to be worn or are traditionally worn without underpants. This also applies for most clothes worn as [[nightwear]] and as [[swimwear]]. Some analysts have encouraged people with a higher than average [[libido]] to change their underwear more frequently than average due hygiene-related issues of by-products such as [[cowper's fluid]] and [[vaginal lubrication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

Underwear is sometimes partly exposed for fashion reasons or to titillate. A woman may, for instance, allow the top of her brassiere to be visible from under her [[Collar (clothing)|collar]], or wear a see-through [[blouse]] over it. Some men wear T-shirts underneath partly or fully unbuttoned shirts. A common style among young men (2018) is to allow the trousers to [[Sagging (fashion)|sag]] below the waist, thus revealing the waistband or a greater portion of whatever underwear the man is wearing. A woman wearing low-rise trousers may expose the upper rear portion of her thong underwear is said to display a "[[whale tail]]".

===Used underwear===
[[File:Man smelling the crotch of a pair of women's panties.jpg|thumb|upright|Some men find the smell of a women's body secretions sexually stimulating, and use them as a masturbation aid.]]
The sale of used female underwear for sexual purposes began in [[Sexuality in Japan|Japan]], in stores called [[burusera]], and it was even sold in vending machines. In the 21st century, when the [[Internet]] made anonymous mail-order sales possible for individuals, some women in the U.S. and U.K., in response to male demand, began selling their dirty panties, and sometimes other underwear. Some men find the odor of a woman's bodily secretions sexually arousing, and will use the dirty panties as a [[masturbation]] aid. The sale of dirty panties, sometimes worn for several days, and sometimes customized with requested stains, is a significant [[niche market|niche]] in the [[sex work]] field. A far smaller market sells used male underwear to male homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

=== Market ===
In January 2008 it was reported that, according to [[market research]] firm [[Mintel]], the men's underwear market in the UK was worth [[Pound sterling|£]]674 million, and volume sales of men's underpants rose by 24% between 2000 and 2005. British manufacturers and retailers claim that most British men prefer "trunks", or short boxer briefs. The director of menswear of major British retailer [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] (M&amp;S), which sells 40 million pairs of men's underpants a year, was quoted as saying that while boxer shorts were still the most popular at M&amp;S, demand was easing off in favour of hipster trunks similar in design to the [[Swimsuit#Men's swimsuits or swimming trunks|swimming trunks]] worn by actor [[Daniel Craig]] in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name="Independent" /&gt;

In 1985, [[Fruit of the Loom]], [[Hanes]], and [[Jockey International]] had the largest shares of the U.S. men's underwear market; these companies had about 35%, 15%, and 10% of the market, respectively.&lt;ref name=Kannerp28&gt;Kanner, Bernice. "Briefs Encounter: The Long and Shorts of It" ("On Madison Avenue" column). ''[[New York Magazine]]''. [[New York Media, LLC]], April 29, 1985. Vol. 18, No. 17. ISSN 0028-7369. Start p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jbkBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 28]. CITED: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jbkBAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA28 28].&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory Woods, author of "We're Here, We're Queer and We're not Going Catalogue Shopping," stated that in companies often do not market men's underwear to straight men on the assumption that they are not interested in buying underwear for themselves; therefore many such advertisements are catered to women, as well as gay men, to convince them to buy underwear for their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Gregory. "We're Here, We're Queer and We're not Going Catalogue Shopping" (Chapter 7). In: Burston, Paul and Colin Richardson (editors). ''A Queer Romance: Lesbians, Gay Men and Popular Culture''. [[Routledge]], July 26, 2005. {{ISBN|1134864825}}, 9781134864829. Start: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5eKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157 157]. CITED: p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=v5eKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166 166].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Jockey International president Howard Cooley stated that women often shop more than men do, and men request women to buy underwear for them.&lt;ref name=Kannerp28/&gt; According to multiple studies conducted circa 1985, 60-80% of men's undergarments for sale had been purchased by women.&lt;ref name=Kannerp28/&gt;

=== Designers and retailers ===
A number of major [[designer label]]s are renowned for their underwear collections, including [[Calvin Klein]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]], and [[La Perla (clothing)|La Perla]]. Likewise, specialist underwear brands are constantly emerging, such as [[Andrew Christian]], [[2(x)ist]], [[Leonisa]], and [[Papi (brand)|Papi]].&lt;!--NOTE: It is not necessary to list here every single underwear brand that exists in the world. Preference should be given to the most prominent brands, particularly those that have their own Wikipedia articles. Please arrange brand names alphabetically.--&gt;

Specialist retailers of underwear include [[High Street|high street]] stores [[La Senza]] (Canada), [[Agent Provocateur (lingerie)|Agent Provocateur]] (UK), [[Victoria's Secret]] (USA), and GapBody, the lingerie division of the [[Gap Inc.|Gap]] established in 1998 (USA). In 2000, the online retailer, [[Freshpair]], started in New York and in 2008 [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] opened a new chain of stores, [[Gilly Hicks]], to compete with other underwear retailers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7563">'''Vasilije Krestić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Василије Крестић}}; born 1932 in [[Đala]], [[Serbia]]) is an [[intellectual]] and [[historian]], and a member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

==Biography==
As a [[historian]], he focuses on the history of the [[Serbs]] of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In his early career, Krestić wrote about the history of [[Croatia]] before and after the [[Nagodba]] of 1868, with special reference to the [[Serbs of Croatia]] and [[Serbs in Hungary|in Hungary]]. He has written numerous articles on related subjects.

In the mid-1980s Krestić became involved in the politics of nationalist opposition to communism in Serbia. He became a voice of discontent regarding the status of the [[Serbs of Croatia]] and helped to revive Serbian nationalism. He was one of the leading authors of the 1986 [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], which was a founding document in the creation of the Serbian nationalist movement of the 1980s. Krestić was responsible for the sections that described the [[Serbs of Croatia]] as suffering genocide in that Yugoslav republic. Nationalist professors led by Krestić removed Dr. Drago Roksandić from the [[University of Belgrade]] in 1989, causing nine professors to publish an open letter in defence of Roksandić in the March 1990 issue of ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Walicki, Daniel Chirot, Gale Stokes, Ivan Szelenyi, [[Ivo Banac]], [[Jan T. Gross]], Katherine Verdery, [[Norman Naimark]], [[Tony Judt]]: Fired in Belgrade. ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 37, Number 5 - March 29, 1990. Available online at [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3677 nybooks.com]. Retrieved 21 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Krestić published a defense of the Memorandum, with [[Kosta Mihailović]], another of the Memorandum's original authors. Krestić was also active in the defense of [[Slobodan Milošević]] before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY).

His son [[Petar Krestić]] is also prominent Serbian historian.

The Centre was established in 1946 in [[Wellington]], New Zealand.  It ran the first architectural school in Wellington (1946–1956), and the first town planning school in New Zealand (1949–1956).  It also ran the Centre Gallery (1953–1968), an early venue for exhibiting modern art, and published [[Design Review (publication)|Design Review]] (1948–1954) – one of the first design-oriented journals in New Zealand.  The Centre has also held many exhibitions, including: Te Aro Replanned (1947/48), Vertical Living/ Living in Cities (1954), 196X (1960), Harbour Front (1971), Unbuilt Wellington (1987) Home made Home (1991), Reclaiming (Northern Gateway Exhibition) (1999), and the Manifesto exhibition (2006).  It has lobbied the city council about issues to do with Wellington's built environment and run competitions, such as the annual 20under40 24 hour ideas competition, which began in 1990.  Recently, the Architectural Centre published an architectural manifesto (2006) and has been a partner in the organisation of Wellington Architecture Week.

Past and present members of the Architectural Centre include: [[Bill Alington]] (1929–), [[Ian Athfield]] (1940–2015),  [[James Albert Beard]] (1924–), Sandy Beach, Jock Beere (1913–2001), Guy Cleverley, John Cox (1902–1984), Deb Cranko, Ken Davis, Helmut Einhorn (1911–1988), Charles Fearnley (1915-1988), Al Gabites, Julia Gatley, Kate Linzey, Christina Mackay, Guy Marriage, Lew Martin (1925–), Christine McCarthy, Stephen McDougall, Simon Mclellan,  Alan Minty, Gordon Moller, Geoff Nees (1923–1999), Tim Nees, Fred Newman/[[Friedrich Neumann]] (1900–1964), Stuart Niven, Gerald Parsonson, Maurice Patience (1915–1986), [[Ernst Plischke]] (1903–1992), George Porter (1921–1998), Ian Reynolds (1922–2005), [[Bill Sutch]] (1907–1975), [[Bill Toomath]] (1925–), [[Anthony Treadwell]] (1922–2003), Paul Walker (1958–), [[Roger Walker (architect)|Roger Walker]] (1942–), Simon Wilberforce, Allan Wild, [[Derek Wilson]] (1922–) and Keith Wilson.

'''William Abel Pantin''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (1 May 1902 – 10 November 1973) was an historian of [[England in the Middle Ages|mediaeval England]] who spent most of his academic life at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Life==
Pantin was born in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], south London, on 1 May 1902. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he obtained a first-class degree in Modern History in 1923.&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV&gt;{{harvnb|Highfield|1974|p=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook research at the [[University of Oxford]] after winning a Bryce Research Studentship.&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV/&gt;

From 1926 he taught history at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], first as an Assistant Lecturer and then as the [[James Fraser (bishop)|Bishop Fraser]] Lecturer. At Manchester he worked under [[F. M. Powicke]], Professor of Mediaeval History, who influenced Pantin's work for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV/&gt; In 1929 the [[Royal Historical Society]] awarded its Alexander Prize to Pantin for his essay ''The General and Provincial Chapters of the English Black Monks, 1215–1540''.&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV/&gt; The "Black Monks" were the [[Order of Saint Benedict]], whose history in England remained a subject of Pantin's research and published works for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV/&gt;

In 1928 Powicke moved to Oxford to become [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Oxford)|Regius Professor of Modern History]].&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV/&gt; In 1933 Pantin followed, becoming a tutorial [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellow]] and Lecturer in History at [[Oriel College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name=HighfieldIV/&gt; He was also a university lecturer in mediaeval archaeology and history from 1937 onwards.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Pantin was active in the [[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society|Oxford Architectural and Historical Society]] (OAHS), serving on the Editorial Committee of its journal ''Oxoniensia'' and on the OAHS's Sub-Committee for Old Houses.&lt;ref name=HighfieldV&gt;{{harvnb|Highfield|1974|p=v}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was President of the OAHS 1959–64.&lt;ref name=HighfieldV/&gt;

During his career at Oxford a substantial number of the city's unique mediaeval buildings were destroyed for redevelopment. In 1936–37 the University of Oxford had a row of historic houses in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]] demolished to make way for the [[New Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name=Pantin1937&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pantin |first=W.A. |year=1937 |title=The Recently Demolished Houses in Broad Street |journal=[[Oxoniensia]] |volume=II |pages=171–200 |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society|Oxford Architectural and Historical Society]] |url= http://oxoniensia.org/volumes/1937/pantin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954–55 [[F. W. Woolworth Company|F. W. Woolworth]] had the mediaeval Clarendon Hotel in [[Cornmarket Street]] demolished to make way for a new retail store.&lt;ref name=Pantin1958&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pantin |first=W.A. |year=1958 |title=The Clarendon Hotel Oxford. Part II: The Buildings |journal=[[Oxoniensia]] |volume=XXIII |pages=84–129 |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society|Oxford Architectural and Historical Society]] |url= http://oxoniensia.org/volumes/1958/pantin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959 [[Oxford City Council]] had Lower Fisher Row beside [[Castle Mill Stream]] demolished as [[slum clearance]].&lt;ref name=Pantin1960&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pantin |first=W.A. |year=1960 |title=Houses of the Oxford Region. I. Fisher Row, Oxford |journal=[[Oxoniensia]] |volume=XXV |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society|Oxford Architectural and Historical Society]] |pages=121–125 |url= http://oxoniensia.org/volumes/1960/pantin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case Pantin recorded the buildings as fully as possible before and during their demolition, and published his results in ''Oxoniensia''.&lt;ref name=Pantin1937/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantin1958/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pantin1960/&gt;

In 1940 Pantin was appointed General Editor of the [[Oxford Historical Society]].&lt;ref name=HighfieldV/&gt; He developed an interest in the archives of the University of Oxford, which in 1946 appointed him [[Keeper of the Archives]].&lt;ref name=HighfieldV/&gt;

Pantin was appointed a [[Fellow of the British Academy]] (FBA) in 1948 and was a member of the [[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]] from 1963 onwards.&lt;ref name=Who&gt;{{harvnb|Who Was Who 1920–2008|December 2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantin retired from his college and university posts in 1969, and Oriel College made him an Honorary Fellow in 1971.&lt;ref name=Who/&gt; He died on 10 November 1973.&lt;ref name=HighfieldV/&gt;
