'''Alberto Cortina de Alcocer''' (born January 20, 1947, in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]) is a Spanish businessman. Through his holding Percacer, he is co-owner, with his cousin [[Alberto Alcocer]], of Alcor Holding, the owner of 12.5% of [[Grupo ACS]], the biggest construction company in the world by sales with 2014 revenues of USD 50b, and of 21% of [[Ence]], the largest paper pulp and biomass energy company in Europe. He has appeared several years in Forbes List of Billionaires with USD 1.4 billion.

== Biography ==
Cortina studied Law at the [[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]. His life has run parallel to that of his cousin [[Alberto Alcocer]]. In Spain both cousins are commonly referred to as "The Albertos", as they both married two sisters and ran their wives business empire for 20 years. 

In 1969 he married [[Alicia Koplowitz, 7th Marquise of Bellavista|Alicia Koplowitz]]. After that, he and his cousin started working for [[Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas]], the company founded by Alicia's father.
By the year 1976 he became CEO of the company.

Driven by the talent of Cortina and Alcocer, and through a never before tried diversification from its core building business into other sectors, the company grew greatly in value over a period of 18 years. This growth was accomplished in spite of the Spanish crisis that took place between the years of 1973 and 1985. The company that was having a turnover of 1,000 million pesetas when Alberto joined it, became a diversified group of over 30 companies, with a total turnover of close to 300,000 million pesetas and a valuation of USD 3b.

In 1978, both Albertos acquired 5% of Banco de Fomento, belonging to Banco Central. Three years later, they acquire a significant stake in Portland Valderrivas, a cement company owned by [[Banesto]], on which they placed Alberto Cortina's brother, [[Alfonso Cortina]], as head of the company.

In 1982 they acquired Banco Zaragozano. Later, in 1988, together with KIO Group they created Cartera Central which had a significant stake in Banco Central and two seats on its board of directors. They tried to take over the bank Banco Central but were blocked in their attempt by the Government due to anti-monopoly rules. Banco Zaragozano was valued in USD 15m at acquisition and they sold it for over USD 2b to Barclay's Bank in 2003.

In 1997, Alberto sold his brewing business San Miguel that he and his brother had inherited from their father to the consortium of Danone and Mahou.

In 1998, both "Albertos" took at a controlling stake in [[ACS Group]], today's largest construction and services group by revenues, with sales of EUR €40b worldwide in 2015. Among its subsidiaries are the German construction company [[Hochtief]], Australian conglomerate [[CIMIC Group]], Spanish construction company Dragados, Spanish electrical engineering Cobra and waste management company Urbaser. The executive chairman of ACS, [[Florentino Perez]] is also the chairman of [[Real Madrid]] Football Club.

In 2000 he married [[Elena Cué]], with whom he had a daughter in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Matrimonio religioso de ALBERTO CORTINA Y ELENA CUE en su finca de "Las Cuevas" |url=http://www.hola.com/hola/2000/ho2915s4.htm |accessdate=14 January 2016 |publisher=[[¡Hola!]] |date=10 June 2000 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218203645/http://www.hola.com/hola/2000/ho2915s4.htm |archivedate=18 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Elena Cué y Alberto Cortina padres de su primera hija|url=http://www.hola.com/famosos/2006030328083/famosos/elenacue/hija/|accessdate=14 January 2016|publisher=[[¡Hola!]]|date=3 March 2006|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine included Alberto Cortina in their billionaires list ranking as the 828th wealthiest man in the world.

In June 2015 [[Banque de Dakar]] starts to provide financial services at its headquarters in the capital of [[Senegal]] and providing banking services at a Pan African level focusing in the UEMOA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alberto Cortina apuesta por el sector financiero africano|url=http://economia.elpais.com/economia/2015/06/22/actualidad/1434996776_752712.html|accessdate=15 March 2016|publisher=[[El País]]|date=22 June 2015|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bank is controlled by the [[BDK Financial Group]] led by Cortina along with various relevant shareholders. In February 2016 [[Alfredo Sáenz Abad]] is appointed president of the bank and in March he acquires 5% of BDK's shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Veloso|first1=Moncho|title=Alfredo Sáenz, nuevo presidente del banco africano de Alberto Cortina|url=http://www.abc.es/economia/abci-alfredo-saenz-nuevo-presidente-banco-africano-alberto-cortina-201602162053_noticia.html|accessdate=14 March 2016|publisher=[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]|date=16 February 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Navás|first1=José Antonio|title=Sáenz adquiere un 5% del 'holding' africano de Alberto Cortina y Alejandro Betancourt|url=http://www.elconfidencial.com/empresas/2016-03-08/saenz-adquiere-un-5-del-holding-africano-de-alberto-cortina-y-alejandro-betancourt_1164801/|accessdate=14 March 2016|publisher=El Confidencial|date=8 March 2016|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William V. Bidwill, Sr.''' (born July 31, 1931) is an American [[businessman]]. He is the principal owner and chairman of the [[Arizona Cardinals]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He was co-owner from [[1962 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1962]] for ten seasons with his brother Charles Jr. and has been sole owner since [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1972]].&lt;ref name=bbsoocrcg&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=480fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5NgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5608%2C1068812 |newspaper=Southeast Missorian |location=Cape Girardeau |agency=Associated Press |title=Bill Bidwill sole owner of Cards |date=September 12, 1972 |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]],   Bidwill and his older brother Charles were adopted by [[Charles Bidwill|Charles]] and [[Violet Bidwill Wolfner|Violet Bidwill]].&lt;ref name=dctrul&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1963/02/02/page/71/article/court-rules-for-bidwills |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |last=Howard |first=Robert |title=Court rules for Bidwills |date=February 2, 1963 |page=1, part 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hcrifos&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ITsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7CYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2373%2C430376 |newspaper=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=High court rules in favor of sons |date=February 2, 1963 |page=2, part 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bidwill attended [[Georgetown Preparatory School]], then enlisted in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] until 1956. He went to college at [[Georgetown University]], and after his graduation, moved to [[St. Louis]] a few months before the Cardinals moved there.

==Professional sports==
===Chicago Cardinals===
Charles Bidwill purchased the team, then known as the [[History of the Chicago Cardinals|Chicago Cardinals]], from [[David Jones (Cardinals owner)|Dr. David Jones]] in [[1933 Chicago Cardinals season|1933]]. After his death at age 51 in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=1 "Team History, Pro Football Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; his widow authorized business partner Ray Bennigsen to carry on management of the team. Violet Bidwill married St. Louis businessman Walter Wolfner in 1949 and he later became managing director.

===St. Louis Cardinals===

Prior to the [[1960 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1960]] season, Violet moved the Cardinals to [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|St. Louis]].  Charles Jr. and Bill inherited the team after their mother's death in January [[1962 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1962]],&lt;ref name=mwcodcdt&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1962/01/30/page/27/article/mrs-wolfner-cardinals-owner-dies |newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune |agency=Associated Press |title=Mrs. Wolfner, Cardinals' owner, dies |date=January 30, 1962 |page=1, part 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as co-owners for ten seasons, until Bill purchased it outright in [[1972 St. Louis Cardinals season|1972]].&lt;ref name=bbsoocrcg/&gt; Among NFL franchises, only the [[Chicago Bears]] and [[New York Giants]] have been controlled by one family longer than the Cardinals.

===Arizona Cardinals===

Bidwill's ownership has been marked by little success. In his {{Age|1962|1|30}} years as at least part-owner, the Cardinals have only made the playoffs eight times (1974, 1975, 1982, 1998, 2008, 2009, 2014, and 2015).  He moved the team to [[Phoenix, Arizona]], prior to the [[1988 Phoenix Cardinals season|1988]] season after St. Louis refused to build a new stadium to replace [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], in spite of the fact that the team was well supported by the local fans. Bidwill had also publicly pledged to support a future effort to gain an expansion franchise for St. Louis. Instead, he voted to approve a new franchise in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. However, St. Louis eventually gained a new franchise anyway, the relocated [[Los Angeles Rams]] in [[1995 St. Louis Rams season|1995]]. The Rams returned to Los Angeles in 2016.

Bidwill had a reputation for running the Cardinals rather cheaply; the Cardinals had one of the lowest payrolls in the league for many years. Following the move to [[State Farm Stadium]] in  [[2006 Arizona Cardinals season|2006]], the team began to spend more money.  The increased revenue paid off in [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|2008]], when the Cardinals won their division for the first time since [[1975 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|1975]] (when the team was based in St. Louis), hosted a playoff game for only the second time in franchise history (the previous coming in [[1947 NFL Championship Game|1947]] as a Chicago team) and advanced to [[Super Bowl XLIII]].  They won two more division titles in [[2009 Arizona Cardinals season|2009]] and [[2015 Arizona Cardinals season|2015]].

In recent years, Bidwill has ceded most day-to-day control over the Cardinals to his sons [[Michael Bidwill|Michael]] and Bill Jr., who serve as team president and vice president, respectively.  Bidwill also has two other sons, Patrick and Tim, and a daughter, Nicole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2009/01/09/long_rocky_history_marks_bidwills_ownership/ |title=Long, rocky history marks Bidwills' ownership |last=Baum |first=Bob |work=Boston Globe |publisher=AP |accessdate=2009-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204150818/http://boston.com/sports/football/articles/2009/01/09/long_rocky_history_marks_bidwills_ownership/ |archivedate=4 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Ralph Wilson]] in March 2014, Bidwill became the longest-tenured owner in the NFL.

[[File:Deira Skyline on 8 May 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|The Bur Dubai [[Dubai Creek|creek]] area, facing [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]].]]
'''Bur Dubai''' (in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: بر دبي ) is a historic district in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], located on the western side of the [[Dubai Creek]]. The name literally translates to ''Mainland Dubai'', a reference to the traditional separation of the Bur Dubai area from [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] by the Dubai Creek. This is because Bur Dubai historically consisted of all districts between the western bank of the Creek and [[Jumeirah]]. The Ruler's Court is located in the district adjacent to the Grand Mosque.

The district is home to several [[mosques]] including the [[Grand Mosque (Dubai)|Grand Mosque]] with the city's tallest [[minaret]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dubaicity.com/Attractions/..%5CAttractions%5Cgrand-mosque.htm DubaiCity.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216073338/http://www.dubaicity.com/Attractions/..%5CAttractions%5Cgrand-mosque.htm |date=December 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the blue tiled [[Iranian Mosque, Bur Dubai|Iranian Mosque]]. The [[Hindu Temple, Dubai|country's only Hindu temple]] is situated between the Grand Mosque and the Creek.

It is home to several popular places for tourists including renovated historic buildings and museums. The district has many shopping streets and [[souqs]] (or souk), including the textile souq near the [[Abra (boat)|abra]] boat station, though most of the well known souqs are located in Deira.

==Historic area==
{{main|Al Bastakiya}}

The [[Al Bastakiya]] historic area is located to the east of Al Fahidi Fort (now home to [[Dubai Museum]]) and features old courtyard housing which are identifiable with their [[wind towers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/city-guides/dubai-walking-tour-1/|title=Dubai Travel Guide {{!}} National Geographic|website=travel.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shindagha]] to the north west, located between Bur Dubai, the creek, and the sea is the historic location of the ruler's house on the peninsula facing the sea and the creek.

==Modern developments==

Between 2013 and 2016, the [[Dubai Creek]] was extended back to the sea, turning Bur Dubai into an island. Bur Dubai is a popular living area consisting of several apartment buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://whatson.ae/dubai/2016/11/dubai-canal/|title=First look: The Dubai Canal has opened today...|date=2016-11-13|work=What's On Dubai|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3222">'''Buckeye Steel Castings''' was a [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] [[steel]]maker best known today for its longtime president, [[Samuel P. Bush]], who was the grandfather of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] and great-grandfather of President [[George W. Bush]].

Buckeye, named for the [[Ohio Buckeye]] tree, was founded in Columbus as the Murray-Hayden Foundry, which made [[iron]] farm implements. Finding success manufacturing iron [[railroad car]] [[Janney coupler#Changes since 1873|couplers]], the name changed to the Buckeye Automatic Car Coupler Company in 1891 and Buckeye Malleable Iron and Coupler Company in 1894. Eventually demand for stronger coupling assemblies led to a switch to [[steel]] and the name Buckeye Steel Castings. 

The business was closely associated with rail baron [[E.H. Harriman]] and for some time was controlled by [[Frank Rockefeller]], the brother of oil magnate [[John D. Rockefeller]]. In 1901 Buckeye hired Samuel Prescott "S.P." Bush as general manager. Bush, a graduate of [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], had worked his way up from apprentice mechanic at the locally based [[Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]] to superintendent of motive power at that railroad and, briefly, the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Milwaukee Road]]. In 1908 Rockefeller departed and Bush took over as president, a job he would hold until 1928. During this period Bush became known as a top industrialist and had political influence in [[Washington, D.C.]].

Bush had an advanced business outlook for his day and implemented many modern management techniques as well as an unusually generous working environment.

In 1967, the parent company Buckeye International, Inc. was formed, and then acquired in 1980 by [[Worthington Industries]] through a stock [[merger]]. Worthington sold Buckeye Steel in 1999, but it went bankrupt in 2002.

The former president of Worthington, Donald Malenick, formed an investment group to purchase the assets of Buckeye, and has reopened the business as Columbus Steel Castings. Columbus Steel Castings closed in bankruptcy in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundrymag.com/meltpour/columbus-steel-castings-now-idle-bankruptcy-seeking-sale Columbus Steel Castings Now Idle, in Bankruptcy, Seeking Sale]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Securities Market Commission''' (in {{Lang-es|Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores}}) (often abbreviated as '''CNMV''') is the Spanish government agency responsible for the [[financial regulation]] of the [[securities markets]] in [[Spain]].  It is an independent agency that falls under the [[Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (Spain)|Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness]].

==History==
The CNMV was established in 1988 as part of a major reform of Spanish financial sector with the passing of law 24/1988 also known as the "Stock Market" act.  Laws 37/1998 and 44/2002 have updated the powers and responsibilities of the agency establishing a regulatory framework to meet the requirements of the [[European Union]].  It also allowed for the development of the Spanish stock market in the European environment, incorporating new measures for the investor protection.

On 23 May 2008, the then second vice-president and finance minister, [[Pedro Solbes]], announced in the Economic and Financial Committee of Congress that the government was planning a realignment of responsibilities for the regulation of the financial system as agreed by finance ministers of the European Union ([[ECOFIN]]).  The project was expected to separate prudential and supervisory regulation to improve efficiency in monitoring the solvency and competitiveness of financial intermediaries as well as market transparency.

The [[Bank of Spain]], would have taken over some of CNMVs responsibilities and would be required to ensure the creditworthiness not just of banks and savings banks, but also from other financial institutions, including insurance companies and investment institutions.

However almost a year and half after the announcement, on 19 September 2009, a digital newspaper that echoes the forecast said that the law on the unification of financial supervisors was due to reach Parliament in early 2010, but neither parliamentarians nor the bodies concerned had any time on their agenda to perform such a reform.  According to sources from the Ministry of Economy, the restructuring will have to wait for a decision in the European Union, which is studying the matter with a view to adopting a common format that could actually be more similar the current system.

==Purpose and functions==
The aim of the CNMV is to ensure stability and transparency of financial markets, protect investors and make sure that brokers and intermediaries behave correctly.
 
In exercising its powers the CNMV received a significant amount of information, much of which is contained in official records.  This is considered public information.

Action by the CNMV as a supervisory body is mainly focused on:

*companies issuing securities to be placed publicly on the primary market
*participants in the secondary securities markets
*companies providing investment services and collective investment institutions

In addition the CNMV exercises prudential supervision by seeking to ensure that the system is solvent and transactions are secure.
The CNMV is also responsible for assigning the [[International Securities Identification Number|ISIN]] codes for all securities issued in Spain.

==Economic data==
The Spanish securities market was worth 22.65 million euros in 2007 an increase from 13.72 million euros in 2006 according to the supervisor's annual accounts published in the official gazette ([[Boletín Oficial del Estado]])

==International activities==
The CNMV's is a member of both the [[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO) and the [[Committee of European Securities Regulators]] (CESR) and is actively involved in both organisations and its working groups.  They bring together the [[banking]], [[securities]] and [[insurance]] sectors [[world]]wide and within [[Europe]] respectively.

The CNMV also performs an important task of advising and assisting the Spanish authorities in their participation in the institutions of the [[European Union]] and is a regular adviser to the Directorate General of Treasury and Financial Policy and the European Securities Committee.  It also participates in the review of company law and stock market participant.

It also provides technical assistance to the [[European Commission]] in assessing the financial sectors of accession countries that want to join the European Union.

In [[Ibero-America]], the CNMV is working closely with the Iberoamerican Institute of Securities Market (IIMV) in helping to foster progress and modernization of securities markets in Latin America and developing training programs for cooperation.

The CNMV is also involved in the Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL), which was established by agreement between Spain and Portugal in 2004, and in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), whose work on Principles of Corporate Governance it has been working with very actively.

==Structure==
The CNMV consists of a Council, an advisory committee and an executive committee. In addition there are three general managers: one for monitoring entities, one for other market supervision and one for legal service.

===Council of the CNMV===
The CNMV is governed by a Board and consists of the following members:
*A President and Vice-Chairman who is appointed by the Government based on advice from the Finance Minister, from among persons of recognized competence in matters relating to the securities market.
*The Director General of the Treasury and Financial Policy and the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Spain, which have the role of Trustees ex officio.
*Three members appointed by the Minister of Economy among persons of recognized competence in matters relating to the securities market.
*The Secretary, who can advice but cannot vote, they are the Director General of Legal Service.
Appointments lasts four years, following which may be renewed once.

== History ==
Copyright transfer agreements became common in the publishing business after the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] in the United States and similar legislation in other countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1107/S0021889878012753 | title = Transfer of Copyright | journal = Journal of Applied Crystallography | volume = 11 | pages = 63–64 | year = 1978 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; redefined copyright as accruing to the author from the moment of creation (rather than publication) of a work.&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt; This required publishers to acquire copyrights from the author in order to sell the works or access to it, and written statements signed by the rights owner became necessary in order for the copyright transfer to be considered valid.&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap2.html#204 Section 204] of the [[Copyright Act of 1976]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
{{Quotation|The situation in which authors hold the copyright usually involves considerable effort in the form of correspondence and record keeping and often leads to unnecessary delays. Although this may appear to be trivial for a few requests, a good scholarly journal publishing exciting papers can expect several hundred requests per year; a task of this magnitude can become onerous. On the other hand, if the Journal holds the copyright, requests, value judgements, and permissions can be handled expeditiously to the satisfaction of all concerned.|J. Lagowski (1982)&lt;ref name=Lagowski1982/&gt;}}

Granting publishers the permission to copy, display and distribute the work is necessary for publishers to act as such, and copyright transfer agreements across a wide range of publishers have such provisions.&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gaeta | first1 = T. J. | title = Authorship: "Law" and Order | doi = 10.1111/j.1553-2712.1999.tb00393.x | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–301 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10230981| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reach of copyright transfer agreements can go well beyond that, and "[s]ome publishers require that, to the extent possible, copyright be transferred to them."&lt;ref name=Friedman1982/&gt; This means that no one, including the authors, can reuse text, tables, or figures in other publications without first getting permission from the new copyright owner.&lt;ref name="understand"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berquist | first1 = T.

Copyright transfer agreements also ask that the authors confirm to actually own the copyright for all the materials pertaining to a given act of publishing, and that the item for which the copyright is to be transferred has not been previously published and is not under consideration to be published elsewhere,&lt;ref name="understand"/&gt; to limit the frequency of [[duplicate publication]] and [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref name=Gadd2003-4/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = I.

== Criticisms ==
Critics have said that the copyright transfer agreement in commercial scholarly publishing is "as much about ensuring long–term asset management as it is about providing service to the academic community" because the practice seems to grant favor to the publisher in a way that does not obviously benefit the authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willinsky|first=John|title=Copyright Contradictions in Scholarly Publishing|journal=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|date=4 November 2002|volume=7|issue=11|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1006/927|accessdate=20 February 2012|doi=10.5210/fm.v7i11.1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copyright transfer agreements often conflict with [[self-archiving]] practices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gadd | first1 = E. | last2 = Oppenheim | first2 = C. | last3 = Probets | first3 = S. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310698239 | title = RoMEO studies 1: The impact of copyright ownership on academic author self-archiving | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 243 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; or appear to do so due to ambiguous language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = A. | title = Self-archiving and the Copyright Transfer Agreements of ISI-ranked library and information science journals | doi = 10.1002/asi.20494 | journal = Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology | volume = 58 | issue = 2 | pages = 286 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3767615587113113566&amp;q=Storix&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,29 Johnson v. Storix] upheld a copyright transfer involving no written assignment. In that case, the Author, Anthony Johnson sold software as a sole proprietor and incorporated his company in 2003 as Storix, Inc. Eight years later he gave 60% share of the corporation to his employees, who later removed him from the company and claimed ownership of the copyrights. The court upheld a  jury decision that Johnson had made an oral agreement to transfer the copyright to the corporation upon its formation based on an annual report he wrote and signed a year later stating that he had transferred “all assets” from his sole proprietorship. The jury rejected Johnson's claim he intended only to transfer the license to sell the software, and further decided that Johnson became a work for hire upon forming the corporation, thereby also forfeiting all rights to his derivative works. This is the first case in which a document, not itself a contract or agreement and containing no reference to the copyrights, was considered a “note or memorandum” of copyright transfer, and the first time a sole owner of a company was designated a work for hire for copyright ownership purposes. This serves as a lesson that a “writing” required by the Copyright Act need not necessarily be “clear”, but may contain ambiguous language which can be interpreted by course of dealing by third parties to the alleged transaction.  

== Other models ==
Copyright transfer agreements are one way to govern permissions based on copyright. Since the advent of digital publishing, various commentators have pointed out the benefits of author-retained copyright,&lt;ref name=Bachrach1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilbanks2006&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilbanks | first1 = J. | authorlink = John Wilbanks| title = Another reason for opening access to research | doi = 10.1136/sbmj.39063.730660.F7 | journal = BMJ | volume = 333 | issue = 7582 | pages = 1306–1308 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17185718 | pmc =1761190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and publishers have started to implement it&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watt | first1 = F. M. | last2 = Sever | first2 = R. | title = Non-profit publishing: Open access and the end of copyright transfer | doi = 10.1242/jcs.00873 | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 117 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 1 | year = 2004 | pmid =  14657267| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; using license agreements, wherein the author of the work retains copyright and gives the publisher the permission (exclusive or not) to reproduce and distribute the work. A third model is the so-called "browse-wrap" or "click-wrap" license model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burk|first=Dan L.|title=Intellectual Property in the Context of e-Science |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2007|volume=12|issue=2|url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol12/issue2/burk.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is becoming more and more popular in the form of the [[Creative Commons]] licenses: it allows anyone (including the publisher) to reproduce and distribute the work, with some possible restrictions. Creative Commons licenses are used by many [[open access journal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Molloy | first1 = J. C. | title = The Open Knowledge Foundation: Open Data Means Better Science | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 12 | pages = e1001195 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22162946 | pmc = 3232214 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Author addenda ==
Copyright transfer agreements are usually prepared by the publisher, and some print journals include a copy of the statement in every issue they published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00348410 | title = Forthcoming papers | journal = Applied Physics A: Solids and Surfaces | volume = 59 | pages = A5–A5 | year = 1994 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If authors wish to deviate from the default phrasing&amp;nbsp;– ''e.g.'', if they want to retain copyright or would not like to grant the publisher an exclusive right to publish&amp;nbsp;– they can specify desired modifications, either by editing the document directly or by attaching an [[addendum#In contracts|addendum]] to a copy of the default version. Publisher policies on the acceptance of such addenda vary, though. Some institutions offer instructions and assistance for staff in creating such addenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author rights: using the SPARC Author Addendum to secure your rights as the author of a journal article|url=http://www.sparc.arl.org/resources/authors/addendum|work=SPARC|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amend a Publishing Agreement|url=https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/authors/amend|work=Harvard University Library|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''downtown core of [[St. Catharines]]''', [[Ontario]], Canada is defined by the city as the area between [[Ontario Highway 406|Highway 406]] on the west and south, Geneva Street on the east until it reaches St. Paul Street then Niagara Street north until it meets Welland Avenue.

It an historical area of the city, as well as a significant cultural and entertainment destination, playing host to several bars and restaurants along St. Paul and James Streets, and the popular Niagara Grape &amp; Wine Festival and Grand Parade in September. Various retail and commercial businesses, are found throughout the core, as well as government, financial and law offices. Since 2015, the neighbourhood is home to the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, a campus of [[Brock University]].

==History==
Intersecting [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] trails, at the confluence of Dick's Creek and 12 Mile Creek, laid the foundation of the [[downtown]] streets as they appear today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2017/10/27/herod-the-heart-of-st-catharines|accessdate=28 October 2017 |title=Yesterday and Today: The heart of St. Catharines |publisher=St. Catharines Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them remains the largest and most historically significant of the city, St. Paul Street. Construction of the first and second Welland Canals behind St. Paul Street quickly elevated the area into a prosperous hub for commerce and industry in the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region]].

==Revitalization==
[[File:St. Catharines courthouse.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Old Courthouse, at the corner of James and King streets]]
Like many downtowns in [[North America]], the area experienced significant decline as [[shopping malls]] and [[Power center (retail)|power centre]]s in the [[suburbs]] took over as major shopping destinations. Citizens of St. Catharines often complained of the lack of parking and inconveniences associated with one-way streets in the core. Today, the downtown is experiencing a modest turnaround thanks to public and private investment in the areas surrounding St. Paul and James Streets, as well as the former Lower Level Parking Lot.

On April 3, 2006, [[St. Catharines City Council]] voted in favour of returning two-way traffic to the downtown core, at an anticipated cost of $2 million. At the time, two-way traffic was promoted as one way of making the downtown streets safer, slowing down traffic and boosting business. By October 2009, most of the conversion work was completed. The addition of two-way traffic, especially to St. Paul Street, played a role in the Ontario Wine Council's decision to modify the [[Niagara Wine Route]] to pass through downtown St. Catharines in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tourismstcatharines.ca/news/details/wine-route-has-arrived-in-downtown-st-catharines |accessdate=18 June 2014 |title=Wine Route Has Arrived in Downtown St. Catharines |publisher=St. Catharines Economic Development and Tourism Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2006 the Province of Ontario released a Growth Plan under the ''Places to Grow Act, 2005'', of which was born the [[Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe]] in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://placestogrow.ca/images/pdfs/ggh2017/en/growth%20plan%20%282017%29.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2017 |title=Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe 2017 |publisher=Province of Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the plan, Downtown St. Catharines is identified as one of 22 Urban Growth Centres for the province, given a growth target of 150 residents and jobs combined per hectare by 2031.
[[File:Canada Hair Cloth building St Catharines 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Canada Hair Cloth building, before conversion for university use]]
Since the Places to Grown Act, municipal and regional governments have invested heavily in infrastructure projects in the downtown core. A detailed inspection and analysis of the Burgoyne Bridge in 2010 revealed the need for a new span over [[Twelve Mile Creek (Ontario)|Twelve Mile Creek]]. Construction on the new signature bridge, which features a steel truss-arch, began in 2014 with an estimated budget of $91.35 million, and was completed in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2015/05/07/task-force-created-to-look-into-burgoyne-bridge-replacement |accessdate=7 May 2015 |title=Task Force Created to Look Into Burgoyne Bridge Replacement |publisher=Canoe Sun Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nearby Lower Level Parking Lot, construction began in 2013 on the Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, a new campus of [[Brock University]]. Completed in 2015, the school operates alongside the [[FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre]], a municipal cultural project, built on adjacent lands. The facilities house 500 full-time students in new buildings along St. Paul Street and the historic Canada Hair Cloth building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brocku.ca/brock-news/?p=33867 |accessdate=1 June 2015 |title=With construction finished, Brock’s new downtown arts school gets ready to educate |publisher=The Brock News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand opening of the city's new spectator arena, the [[Meridian Centre]], took place on October 21, 2014. The 5,300 seat arena was built by the municipality to house the [[Niagara IceDogs]] ice hockey team of the [[Ontario Hockey League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharines.ca/en/News/index.aspx?newsId=a2c46e56-730b-4bf3-a1eb-aec9a6bc9181 |accessdate=11 October 2014 |title=Meridian Centre ready to entertain |publisher=The City of St. Catharines}}&lt;/ref&gt; The venue also plays host to numerous events throughout the year such as sporting events, concerts, trade shows and conferences.

==Historical sites==
The downtown's extensive history left an impressive showplace of [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] sites in the core. Architectural landmarks reveal the stories behind St. Catharines varying roles as the former seat of Lincoln County, a popular [[destination spa|health-spa]] destination, and the premiere retail centre for Niagara. 
[[File:St. Catharines Ontario Street arch.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Architecture on Ontario St.]]
*St. Catharines Armoury - A recognized Federal Heritage building, listed #1991 on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/beefp-fhbro/FHB_Rech_Search_e.asp Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[British Methodist Episcopal Church, Salem Chapel]] - A national historic site, played an important role during the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] era and frequented by [[Harriet Tubman]], the famed conductor of the [[Underground Railroad]].
*City Hall - Built on the site of the previous [[City Hall]], this building was officially opened in August 1937 at the corner of Church and James Streets. Designed by local architect Robert Macbeth, the structure was originally built to accommodate all city departments, including a police station and jail in the basement. In 1963, the building was extensively renovated, however, most of the significant elements found inside, such as the main entryway, its marble floors, ornate ceiling and wide sweeping staircase, were left intact.
*Farmers' Market - One of the oldest farmers' markets in [[Ontario]], dating back to the early 1860s.  It continues to operate every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, as it did over a century ago. [[File:St. Catharines Montebello Park.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Montebello Park]]
*The Grand Opera House (1877–1998) - With seating for 1200, the facility opened to much fanfare as a centre for musical production on Ontario Street.  Over the years it housed an orchestra and featured numerous concerts and vaudeville shows.  After a fire ravaged the building's facade and most of its interior, there was some public interest in restoring what was left of the auditorium, but the city and some professionals concluded that renovations would be much too costly and the site was levelled. The site is used today as a parking lot.
*The Canada Hair Cloth Company Ltd (1882–2007) - An industrial factory for over a century, the building closed in 2007 and is now home to Brock University's Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts.
*The Russell Hotel - a noted hotel and tavern built in 1843 by Samuel Stinson at the corner of St. Paul and James streets. The building was destroyed by fire and the site currently sits empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stcatharinesstandard.ca/2016/07/22/yesterday-and-today-the-russell-hotel|title=YESTERDAY AND TODAY: The Russell Hotel |author=Dennis Gannon |publisher=St. Catharines Standard |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Mansion House - Thought to have been constructed in the early 19th century by [[William Hamilton Merritt]], it is the oldest tavern in St. Catharines and the oldest continually licensed bar in [[Canada]].[[File:Welland House Hotel.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The former Welland House]]
*[[Montebello Park]] - Designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in 1887, who went on to create [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]]. A commemorative rose garden with over 1,300 bushes in 25 varieties is the city's largest rose collection and features an ornamental fountain. The focal point of the park is a band shell and pavilion built in 1888. The park is designated under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.
*Old Courthouse - Built in 1848-49, the Old [[Courthouse]] was the centre of political, cultural and social life in St. Catharines. Designed by renowned architect [[Kivas Tully]], it was hailed as a great architectural achievement. The existing building soon became too small and an addition was added in 1863-65.  Today, the building is home to Carousel Players, an independent theatre group, and recently underwent an extensive restoration.
*[[Welland House Hotel]] - One of the few surviving symbols of the city's extensive health spa history.  Today the building is home to a student residence and [[CFBU]], [[Brock University]]'s [[campus radio]] station.

===Heritage corridor===

The St. Catharines Economic and Tourism Services department, with support from the [[Ministry of Tourism and Recreation (Ontario)|Ontario Ministry of Tourism]], launched the Heritage Corridor Project in 2004.  The goal of the project is to draw tourists off the Niagara Wine Route into St. Catharines' downtown and other historically significant areas.

===Transportation===

The downtown core of St. Catharines is served by the [[St. Catharines Transit]] on numerous routes. The central bus terminal is located downtown. The terminal also has charter buses taking you to numerous cities around the region including Welland &amp; Thorold, as well as Greyhound buses towards Toronto.

==Residential streets==

A few streets within the St. Catharines Downtown Core where the houses are primarily used for residential purposes.
[[File:St. Catharines James Street.jpg|right|thumb|200px| James Street]]
*Yates Street Heritage District - Stately [[Victorian era]] homes line this street of what was once a thriving canal-side village.  The remnants of the original [[Welland Canal]] can still be seen at the bottom of the cliff on which this street is perched.

An '''indexed annuity''' (the word ''equity'' previously tied to indexed annuities has been removed to help prevent the assumption of stock market investing being present in these products) in the United States is a type of tax-deferred [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] whose credited interest is linked to an equity index &amp;mdash; typically the [[S&amp;P 500]] or international index. It guarantees a minimum interest rate (typically between 1% and 3%) if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal. An equity index annuity is a contract with an insurance or annuity company. The returns may be higher than fixed instruments such as CDs, money market accounts, and bonds but not as high as market returns. Equity Index Annuities are insured by each State's Guarantee Fund; coverage is not as strong as the insurance provided by the FDIC. For example, in [[California]] the fund will cover "80% not to exceed $250,000." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.annuityadvantage.com/stateguarantee.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The guarantees in the contract are backed by the relative strength of the insurer.  

The contracts may be suitable for a portion of the asset portfolio for those who want to avoid risk and are in retirement or nearing retirement age.  The objective of purchasing an equity index annuity is to realize greater gains than those provided by CDs, money markets or bonds, while still protecting principal. The long term ability of Equity Index Annuities to beat the returns of other fixed instruments is a matter of debate.

Indexed annuities represent about 30% of all fixed annuity sales in 2006 according to the Advantage Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indexannuity.org Index Annuity]&lt;/ref&gt;

Equity-indexed annuities may also be referred to as fixed indexed annuities or simple indexed annuities. The mechanics of equity-indexed annuities are often complex and the returns can vary greatly depending on the month and year the annuity is purchased. Like many other types of annuities, equity-indexed annuities usually carry a surrender charge for early withdrawal. These "surrender periods" range between 3 and 16 years; typically, about ten.

See [[Indexed annuity]]

==A different way to credit interest==
The indexed annuity is virtually identical to a fixed annuity except in the way interest is calculated. As an example, consider a $100,000 fixed annuity that credits a 4% annual effective interest rate. The owner receives an interest credit of $4,000.  However, in an equity-indexed annuity, the interest credit is linked to the equity markets. For example: Assume the index is the S&amp;P 500, a one-year point-to-point method is used, and the annuity has an 8% cap. The $100,000 annuity could credit anything between 0% and 8% based on the change in the S&amp;P 500. The cap, 8% in this example, is determined by how much is afforded by budget which is usually at or near the 4% fixed rate. If fixed rates increase, it would be expected that the cap would increase as well.

This allows the owner the security of knowing that the $100,000 is safe but rather than receiving the sure 4% they can receive up to 8%.  Historically since 1950, an 8% cap on the S&amp;P 500 has resulted in an average interest credit of 5.2%, very similar to what is considered the "risk free rate of return" delivered by T-bills, 5.1% over a similar period. The return may also be adjusted by other factors such as the participation rate and market value adjustments to cover bring the cost of the option into the budget available.   

This means the owner of the indexed annuity now has assumed more risk than a fixed annuity but less than being in the equity markets themselves. The result is that the expected yield (risk adjusted) for an indexed annuity is higher than a fixed annuity, CD, etc. However, the expected yield of being in the market is higher for several reasons.  

The principal (in our example the $100,000) is at risk of loss when owning the index outright. Equity Index Annuity does not participate in dividends as owning the index outright would and similar there are no ongoing transaction expenses or fees. Interest is compounded as frequently as when interest is credited and this is almost always annually but contracts are available that credit interest over a 5-year term.

The taxation of the gains in an indexed annuity is identical to that of fixed annuities.  Taxes are deferred until monies are received and then interest is withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income.  If the index was owned outright, gains would not be tax deferred, but may qualify for the more favorable capital gains tax rate.

==Understanding options==
This way of linking to an equity index like the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones is accomplished through an option, usually a call option. A call option is the right- but not the obligation- to purchase something at a future date for a specified price.

The naming convention for options used by the insurance industry is different from that of Wall Street, but the options are structurally identical. Here's a sample of options commonly seen in indexed annuities:

*[[Insurance]] vs. [[Wall Street]]
*[[Market-linked CD#Point-to-point|Point-to-Point]] vs. European
*Monthly Average vs. Asian
*Monthly Point-to-Point vs. Cliquet
*Performance Triggered vs. Binary

The options in indexed annuities can usually be fit into the following taxonomy developed by the National Association of Fixed Annuities.

''Term'' - the length of time before option matures, usually one year.  Two, three, four, and ten are also prevalent in the market.  Some longer term options are but have a "highwater" feature that allows interest to be credited more frequently.  An example of this would be a ten-year Monthly Average option that credits interest each year if there is a gain.

''Index'' - the equity, stock, bond, or other index to which the interest credit is linked.

''Gain formula'' - the method used to determine the gain in the index.  Point to point, monthly averaging, daily averaging are the most common methods of calculating the gain.  For example, of the S&amp;P 500 index starts at 1120 and ends at 1300 then the point to point gain is 16.07%.

''Adjustment method'' - the way the option is limited in order to reduce the cost (and subsequent return) so that it becomes affordable.  As an example the point to point option may cost 7% of the account value but will be "adjusted" to reduce the cost.

"Market value adjustment" - the company may reserve the right to adjust the value of your account based on current market conditions.  This adjustment is most often applied to distributions, partial or complete withdrawals, and exchanges to other accounts.  

The most common adjustments are cap, fee, participation rate or a combination of the three. Other adjustments are less common. In keeping with the preceding example and allowing for an 8% cap as the adjustment the policyholder would not receive the 16.07% point-to-point gain, but rather 8% as an interest credit.

Should provide examples for:
P2P with Participation Rate
Monthly Averaging with Cap
Monthly Averaging with Fee

Should also link to the withdrawal benefits provided in variable annuities and indexed annuities at this point.  These concepts were added because of the risk associated with the accumulation in both variable annuities and indexed annuities.

== US Taxation ==

While the taxes on gains are deferred, earnings are taxed at an individual's ordinary income tax rate as opposed to capital gains and qualified  stock dividends which are tax at lower capital gains rates. Also annuities do not qualify for a step in basis at the owner's death while most stock, bond and real estate investments are. Any earnings will be tax at the beneficiary's ordinary [[Income tax in the United States|income tax rate]]. &lt;ref&gt; https://www.cnbc.com/id/101239958 &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Federico Cerruti''' (1 January 1922 – 15 July 2015) was a reclusive Italian art collector whose collection was described by ''Artribune'' as one of the best in Europe. He told his retainers to arrange his funeral before his death became public in order to avoid the "useless gossiping and socialising crowd" attending.

==Early life==
Federico Cerruti was born in [[Genoa]] on 1 January 1922. His family were bookbinders who moved to Turin where the firm prospered despite its factory being destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. In 1943, Cerruti narrowly escaped death when a ship he should have been on, the battleship ''[[Italian battleship Roma (1940)|Roma]]'', was sunk by German aircraft.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

==Career==
Cerruti was brought up with a strong work ethic. He studied accountancy and expanded the family business of  [[Legatoria Industriale Torinese]] to one of the largest bookbinders in Italy. The firm had the contract to bind the telephone directories of Italy. He lived above the office, and only slept at the villa he had built for him, once in 50 years. His assistant for 30 years was Annalisa Ferrari.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

==Art collection==
Cerruti's collection was described by ''Artribune'' as one of the best in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artribune.com/2015/07/il-collezionista-misterioso-che-vinse-su-uffizi-e-getty-museum-morto-a-torino-a-93-anni-federico-cerruti-la-sua-una-delle-migliori-raccolte-deuropa/ Il collezionista “misterioso” che vinse su Uffizi e Getty Museum. Morto a Torino a 93 anni Federico Cerruti: la sua una delle migliori raccolte d’Europa.] Massimo Mattioli, ''[[Artribune]]'', 19 July 2015. Retrieved 15 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It ranged from the Medieval period to works of the 20th Century. The first work he acquired was a drawing by the Russian [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] artist [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. He also owned ten works by modern Italian [[Metaphysical art|Metaphysical]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]] which hung in the dining room of his villa. In the main bedroom were late Medieval and early Renaissance paintings by [[Paolo Veneziano]], [[Sassetta]], and [[Bergognone]]. Cerruti often allowed his works to be shown at exhibitions and small groups of art lovers were allowed to view his collection.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

Appropriately, Cerruti also collected books in fine bindings. He owned the ''[[Atlas Maior]]'' by [[Joan Blaeu]] in 12 volumes and an edition of ''À la Recherche du Temps Perdu'' in an [[Art Deco]] design by [[Pierre Legrain]].&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

==Death==
Cerruti died on 15 July 2015. He never married and left no descendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilgiornaledellarte.com/articoli/2015/7/124738.html Era il più importante collezionista d'arte d'Italia.] ''Il Giornale Dell' Arte.Com'', 16 July 2015. Retrieved 28 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He told Annalisa Ferrari to arrange his funeral before his death became public in order to avoid the "useless gossiping and socialising crowd" attending. He was interred with an ivory crucifix and photographs of his mother and [[Padre Pio]].&lt;ref name=artnews&gt;[http://theartnewspaper.com/news/obituary/158441/ Was this unknown man Italy’s greatest collector?] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 7 September 2015.

==Legacy==
Around 2013, Cerruti created the Fondazione FC in which he vested his collection and villa, as well as a capital sum.&lt;ref name=artnews/&gt;

{{Corporate law|by country}}

'''French company law''' is the law governing corporations incorporated in [[France]] or under French corporate law.

==History==
In the wake of the [[French Revolution]] in 1791, the right to free registration for all private companies was proclaimed. There was a boom in registrations, but this was followed by a bust in 1793. The law was reversed until 1796 when the principle of free incorporation was established again.

The law was consolidated in Napoleon's ''[[Code de commerce]]'' of 1807 using a concession system. While previously public companies with special privileges were created by a special act of the state, the ''Code'' allowed the companies to be formed according to general company law rules. Specific state permission was still required. Article 33 recognised [[limited liability]] for members.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 33 Code de Commerce, adopted by Law No. 2804, November 1807, Bull. des Lois No. 164 (1808), 161–299 (France).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Code de commerce'' was applicable outside France in [[Baden]] and the [[Prussian Rhine]] province, and it came to serve as a model for all later European public company statutes. The first German public company statute was the Prussian Act of 1843, five years after the Prussian Act on railway enterprises of 1838. Under the ''[[Loi sur les Sociétés]]'' of 1867 France adopted a system for free registration of companies.&lt;ref&gt;See Law of July 24, 1867 amending the Code de Commerce, Bull. des Lois 11e S., B. 1513, n. 15, 328 p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict===
Component localization targets, set to encourage creation of a local [[supply chain]], exacerbated tensions. They were met late if at all, and while the French initially profited from parts sales, Chinese consumers saw increased component localization from inexperienced suppliers lead to inferior products.&lt;ref name=psa83&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IFWY9J9QwLsC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Guangzhou%20Automobile%20Group&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fernandez and Liu, p. 83]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Chinese resistance, Peugeot repatriated profits,&lt;ref name=psa81&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IFWY9J9QwLsC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=Guangzhou%20Automobile%20Group&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fernandez and Liu, p. 81]&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural conflicts continued throughout.&lt;ref name=psa85/&gt; By 1993, a soured Peugeot saw its now-inferior models out-completed by better offerings&lt;ref name=psa85&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IFWY9J9QwLsC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=Guangzhou%20Automobile%20Group&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fernandez and Liu, p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; with sales dropping to 2,544 while competing [[Shanghai VW]] built no less than 146,000 cars—fifty percent of the overall market.&lt;ref name=psa86/&gt; By 1996, the Guangzhou government decided it no longer wanted a French foreign partner.&lt;ref name=psa91/&gt; Peugeot removed itself in 1997,&lt;ref name=peu137&gt;{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Oej72nssLcUC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=%22Guangzhou%20Automobile%22&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Changing lanes in China: foreign direct investment, local government, and auto sector development | page = 137 | first = Eric | last = Thun | publisher = Cambridge University Press | date = March 2008 | isbn = 9780521724098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Guangzhou Automotive chose to begin a new joint venture with Honda.&lt;ref name=WOC&gt;{{cite book | title = World of Cars 2006·2007 | publisher = Media Connection Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 234 | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harry Henry''' (11 March 1916 – 22 November 2008) was born in London on 11 March 1916, as the elder son of an accountant, who died in 1924. His mother brought up and provided for her two sons by working as a dressmaker. Henry was one of Britain's [[market research]] pioneers whose contributions to its acceptance and understanding won him an international reputation. He was the last survivor of the 23 founders of the Market Research Society (MRS), which he helped establish in 1947, and which now has 8,000 members in 50 countries. He married Mary Anstey, daughter of [[Vera Anstey]], in 1938. She died in 1989, a year after they had celebrated their golden wedding anniversary.

In publishing, he was Marketing Director of the Thomson Organisation for nine years, where he also became a Deputy Managing Director. His influence was significant in pulling an old-fashioned conservative industry towards the appreciation and practice of marketing in newspapers and magazines, a benefit inherited by radio and television. He was the first to use the computer in a market research study. In 1988, he received the Market Research Society's rarely awarded Gold Medal. In 2004, he received the [[Advertising Association]]'s prestigious Mackintosh Medal, awarded for outstanding personal and public service to the industry (in this case, only the third time in the previous fifteen years, and also in recognition of forty years as chairman of its Advertising Statistics Committee).

==Education==
He attended two primary schools, one in Finchley and the other in Hackney and at the age of eleven was transferred to Upton House London County Council Central School, in Homerton. This type of school, an early experiment in state secondary education, had just been created for students up to the age of sixteen, who would otherwise be leaving school at fourteen, to extend their general education with the addition of some commercial subjects. He obtained the London Matriculation with Honours, and was awarded a Wedgewood Scholarship to City of London College in 1932. In 1934, he was awarded a [[Bursary]] that enabled him to enter the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), where he read Economics, with Statistics as a subsidiary subject.

In those days, the LSE had less than 3,000 students. Henry served as Senior Treasurer of the Students' Union, Editor of the [[Clare Market Review]], the Union's official magazine (after having edited and largely written Felix, an extremely unofficial one), Chairman of the Social Committee, Chairman of the Literary Society, Business Manager of the Review of Economic Studies (an academic journal), and Vice-Chairman of the Labour Society.

Towards the end of this, he was involved in a libel action arising from an article he wrote in the [[University of London]] [[University of London Union|Union]] Magazine, pointing out that the [[gerrymandering]] involved in the election of the M.P. for London University gave control to the commercial correspondence colleges, whose interests were commercial rather than academic. Pressure from the judge ([[in chambers]]) led to a reluctant withdrawal, but there were no damages and he was convinced that Higher Authority had organised a cover-up.

He obtained a [[B.S.|B.Sc.]] (Economics) in 1937, which qualified him for his first job. Colman Prentis &amp; Varley, a relatively new and extremely small advertising agency, having gained two minor advertising accounts from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] (just beginning to make a presence felt in the UK, under the name of Thomas Hedley) learnt that it would need a market research department. They went to LSE to find somebody to fill this role, in the mistaken belief that what was required was a [[statistician]]. Henry was appointed to this post in 1938, and began to learn about market research, largely by experiment. He supplemented this as the London correspondent of the [[Boston Globe]], providing a weekly column on the various social and other activities of the family of [[Joseph Kennedy]], the then US [[ambassador]] to London.

==War==
The outbreak of war terminated these apprenticeships, and he was called up in 1940. After training in the ranks of the [[Royal Artillery]], he was commissioned in 1941, and served as a regimental officer in various anti-aircraft batteries until 1943, when he transferred to the newly formed statistical branch of the Army as a [[Staff Officer]]. He was eventually posted to the Headquarters staff of Montgomery's [[21st Army Group]], where he played a modest part in the preparations for the invasion of Europe and in subsequent operations in France, Belgium and Germany.

During the latter part of this period, he found the opportunity to use his market research skills in surveys of radio listening among the troops in that theatre of war, and was also responsible for the introduction of a number of what would later be referred to as Information Systems. One of these involved the production of a weekly abstract of administrative statistics for circulation throughout the theatre, and another, the devising and operating of 'TOCCI' (Theatre Officers Central Card Index), a system making use of [[Hollerith]] punched-card equipment to facilitate and speed up the [[demobilisation]] of officers.

==Post war==
Henry was demobilised with the rank of Major in 1946. He returned to Colman Prentis &amp; Varley, which had begun to move into the big league, first as Market Research Manager and shortly thereafter as Director and General Manager of Market Information Services Ltd, a subsidiary company that he created from scratch. By the time he left Market Information Services in 1954, it had grown into one of the top ten research companies in the country. These years were a period of rapid expansion in the field of market research as a whole, and he took his part in the development of many of the procedures which subsequently came into common use.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Market Research Society===
He was one of the 23 people who, in 1946, founded the Market Research Society, and played a major role both in the development of research techniques and in the promotion of market research as a tool of [[management]]. His particular interest in the media of communication was stimulated by the fact that he was responsible for the planning, conduct and production from 1947 to 1953 of the Hulton Readership Surveys, which were the predecessors of what became the National Readership Surveys. In this same area, he was responsible for the Hulton Tables of Advertisement Attention Value (1949), the development of the first system for using punched-card equipment to compute net press coverage (1949), and the first national surveys of readership among farmers (1947), among retailers (1948) and among children (1950). He was also Editor and joint author of The Rural Market (1948) and Patterns of British Life (1950).

===McCann-Erickson Advertising===
In 1954, he joined [[McCann-Erickson]] Advertising Ltd. as Director of Research, and there built up a very sizeable research department, more closely integrated with the overall workings of the agency than was usual in those days. In particular, it became agency policy to persuade clients (particularly new clients) that full-scale research into their markets would result in more effective advertising. In 1959, he launched Marplan Ltd., a subsidiary company, which developed along these lines into what was one of the leading market research agencies in Great Britain. He organised the establishment of sister Marplan companies in Belgium, France and Germany, and was Chairman of the McCann-Erickson European Research Committee, while continuing as a senior member of the board of McCann-Erickson Ltd.

===Revolution in research===
During the mid-1950s, he had come to the conclusion that the existing techniques of market research, though adequate to the measurement of consumer behaviour, could not offer a reliable framework for marketing decisions. This led to the publication of his 1958 book, ''Motivation Research: Its Practice and Uses'', the first on the subject to be published in Europe. In this book, he drew on his experience to produce a practical guide to the rigorous scientific use of indirect techniques to produce insights which, he argued, could not be validly or even reliably derived from direct questioning or discussion.

===The Thomson Organisation===
In 1961, he was invited to join the Board of [[Thomson Organization|The Thomson Organisation Ltd]], then principally (apart from its ownership of Scottish Television) the publisher of the [[The Sunday Times (UK)|Sunday Times]] and a raft of regional newspapers, as Director of Marketing, bringing marketing into newspaper publishing for the first time.

In 1962, he established the annual Thomson Medals and Awards for Advertising Research, which, by stimulating fresh thinking on media research problems, were responsible over the following ten years for the formulation and dissemination of a number of fundamental contributions to the theory and practice of advertising. Also in 1962, he took advantage of the relaxation by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] of the rigidity of Soviet rule to mount an unprecedented promotion exercise for the recently launched Sunday Times Colour Magazine, which did not immediately return satisfactory advertising revenue. This involved hiring a Tupulev 114 from [[Aeroflot]] in which to fly a plane-load of British business tycoons for the week-end, to meet and talk to their opposite numbers in Moscow.

In 1965, after successfully tendering for the contract from Post Office Telecommunications for the introduction into the UK of '[[yellow pages]]' telephone directories, he set up and was the first Chairman of Thomson Yellow Pages Ltd.
In 1968, he and Mick Shields (of [[Associated Newspapers]]) were asked by Cecil King, then Chairman of the Newspaper Publishers' Association, to examine the practicability of the introduction into the Association of a marketing function as a means of improving the efficiency of the national newspaper industry and of enabling it better to withstand competition. This led to the establishment of a consortium, the 'NPA Marketing Executive' (which he chaired) and the recruitment of some specialist staff, but which petered out because, as he observed then and at intervals over the next thirty years, the national newspaper publishers would always prefer to hang separately than to hang together. But what might be regarded as its successor was launched in 2002 as the Newspaper Marketing Agency. He left the Thomson Organisation in 1970, setting up his own consultancy in 1971.

===Admap===
As Consultant Editor and subsequently as Editor-in-Chief of Admap, he consolidated that publication's reputation for intellectual stringency and authority, which sets it aside from the generality of newsy, even gossipy, advertising periodicals. In 1983, he joined Mike Waterson in setting up a modest venture to launch the quarterly Food &amp; Drink Forecast. This developed rapidly, and had grown by 1998 into Information Sciences Ltd and become one of the world's largest private sector suppliers of economic information through its operating arm NTC Research Ltd, and one of the world's major publisher of advertising and media knowledge via Admap, many other trade journals and books, and the [http://www.warc.com World Advertising Research Center].

==Impact on the field of marketing==
His whole career was marked by innovation. He was the first to use a computer [[LEO computer|LEO]], the first UK computer dedicated to business use) to analyse market research data (1959) and the first to do so in a readership survey (for the Western Mail in 1961). He carried out the first national study of public attitudes towards advertising (1954), the first survey of the poster audience (1948), the first readership survey among retailers (1948), the first national readership survey among children(1950), and the first qualitative study of regional newspaper readership (1963). In 1956, he acted as technical consultant to the first Italian national readership survey.

Not surprisingly, he has been much in demand by industry and academic bodies. He was at various times (and sometimes simultaneously) Visiting Professor of Marketing at the University of Bradford and the [[Cranfield School of Management|Cranfield Institute of Technology]] (now University), and Professor of Marketing and Media Policy at the International Management Centres. He was for twelve years Chairman of the Marketing Communication Research Centre, an ongoing operation funded by a number of major marketing companies which was founded in Bradford in 1972, and subsequently moved to Cranfield when he did. He had chaired the technical sub-committee of the National Readership Survey, and the Research Committees of the Regional Newspaper Advertising Bureau and of British Posters, and was for forty years Chairman of the Research Committee of the Advertising Association. He was a Governor of the [http://www.hatads.org.uk History of Advertising Trust], and a member of the editorial boards of the Journal of Advertising History and the International Journal of Advertising.

==Publications==
As a by-product of his business and academic activities, and in various managerial capacities, he wrote and lectured extensively, in a number of countries, on management, marketing, research and related topics.
Books published in earlier years, include ''Patterns of British Life'' (1948) and ''The Rural Market'' (1950).

His first book, written when he was 21 years old, ''The Insurance Man and his Trade'' (1938), in the 'Fact' library published monthly by Raymond Postgate (1/- cloth board, 6d. paper covers), suggested that burial insurance was 'the grossest form of systematic exploitation ever practised in this country'

A selection of his papers up to 1971 having been published in that year under the title of ''Perspectives in Management, Marketing and Research''.

Later publications included ''Behind the Headlines: Readings in the Economics of the Press'' (1978) and ''The Dynamics of the British Press, 1961 to 1984'' (1986) and he edited the massive Proceedings of the four International Readership Research Symposia of 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1988 (published as ''Readership Research: Theory and Practice'').

'''Joseph Alphonse Marie Colruyt''' (2 August 1928, [[Uccle]] - 6 October 1994, [[Puget-Théniers]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandlonline.com/IMG/pdf/archives_mm_ef_entreprise.pdf Short biography]&lt;/ref&gt; was a Belgian business owner. He was the son of [[Franz Colruyt]], founder of the [[Colruyt]] company. Under his leadership, the company began the Colruyt retail chain known for its "lowest price" strategy.

== Career ==

When Colruyt took over the company from his father Franz in 1958, the company was a dry food wholesaler. As it became more expensive to deliver small-volume orders to smaller stores, he opened the first ''Cash &amp; Carry'' (briefly called 'Cash') in Hall in 1964: a self-service formula for independent shop keepers.

In the mid-1960s, Jo Colruyt chose to switch to retail and took over the self-service business Verloo in [[Elsene]] and launched his lowest prices policy, offering famous brands 10% cheaper.

This was when the struggle for efficiency, simplicity and economy typical of Colruyt stores began. At the time, the company was nearly broke. In 1976 all stores took the name Colruyt.

=== Less successful initiatives ===

At the end of the 1970s and into the early 1980s, Colruyt launched various businesses with varying success. Examples include an auto rental agency, selling wooden homes of Finlandia Hus, 'Auto Frit' mobile chip stalls and 'Green Pepper' self-service restaurants. These businesses were suspended in the mid-1980s.

=== Turnabout after crisis situation ===

In the mid-1980s the Colruyt company was almost bankrupt, competing with newcomer [[Aldi]]. From 1988 the company slowly returned to profitability. Activities included the continuation of low prices on about 300 products. In 1987 the company replaced the [[punched card]] with price labels and 'full scanning' at the cash register. Replenishment, stock management and orders were automated with [[bar code]] scanners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Colruyt India|title=History|url=http://www.colruyt.in/colruytindia/static/colruytAboutColruytReadMore.htm|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Management ===

Colruyt introduced a horizontal corporate structure with as few managers as possible. He paid attention to employee participation and viewed training in personnel as important.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DST24121999_051|title=Biznews Jo Colruyt|date=23 December 1999|work=[[De Standaard]]|accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==

After 35 years as the head of the company Jo Colruyt died in 1994. His son [[Jef Colruyt]] took over company management.

== Recognition ==

In 1992, Jo Colruyt was elected Manager of the Year by the magazine ''Trends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=DST09012003_101|title=Honorary citizen of Beersel|date=16 July 2012|work=[[De Standaard]]|accessdate=2013-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jurassic World Evolution''''' is a [[Business simulation game|business simulation]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Frontier Developments]]. Based on the 2015 film ''[[Jurassic World]]'', the game was released on 12 June 2018, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. In the game, players construct a dinosaur park on Las Cinco Muertes [[Archipelago]], a group of five islands also known as the "Five Deaths". The game features more than 40 types of dinosaurs; their [[gene]]s can be modified to introduce new features. Players are given contracts to fulfill by three divisions, Science, Security and Entertainment, allowing them to progress. A sandbox mode set on [[Isla Nublar]], the setting of the film, can be unlocked.

The game was created by a development team of approximately 100 people with a budget of around £8 million. Its development began in 2016, after [[NBCUniversal]] approached Frontier Developments about creating a game to accompany the theatrical release of ''[[Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom]]''. To do this, Frontier staff inspected different dinosaur models and reference materials sent by Universal, watched the ''Jurassic Park'' films, read the novels and fan theories. The team consulted paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] when they designed the dinosaurs. [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] and [[B. D. Wong]] reprised their roles from the ''[[Jurassic Park]]'' film series, voicing remarks to players and contributing to the game's narrative.

Announced at [[Gamescom 2017]], the game received a generally mixed critical reception. Critics praised its dinosaur designs and graphics, but the game's contracts, simulation and management gameplay were less well-received. The game's tutorial and learning curve were also criticized. Five weeks after its initial release, the game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales. The game was supported with free updates and [[downloadable content]] upon release.

==Gameplay==

''Jurassic World Evolution'' is a [[business simulation game]] that allows the player to construct a Jurassic World dinosaur theme park with attractions and research facilities. Players must build an Expedition Center, which sends paleontologists to fossil dig sites to obtain dinosaurs' DNA material.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt; [[DNA sequencing]] unlocks new dinosaurs and updates their statistics, such as lifespan and resilience. With enough DNA content, players can use the Hammond Research Center to breed and incubate dinosaurs. Players can also improve the dinosaurs' genes by integrating DNA from modern species with that of the dinosaurs to fill their gaps and allow them to evolve. Modifications to the dinosaurs' DNA change their base statistics, as well as everything from their level of aggressiveness to their appearance.&lt;ref name="EuroGPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-29-jurassic-world-evolution-finds-a-way-to-be-refreshingly-different|title=Jurassic World Evolution finds a way to be refreshingly different|first=Johnny|last=Chiodini|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=29 March 2018|accessdate=29 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024054143/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-03-29-jurassic-world-evolution-finds-a-way-to-be-refreshingly-different|archivedate=24 October 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features a terrain tool which allows players to modify the environment by planting trees and creating water sources.&lt;ref name="demo"/&gt;

Various emergency situations may happen in the park, including power failures, unpredictable weather, and dinosaur breakouts, which must be addressed by players to ensure guests' safety and happiness.&lt;ref name="EuroGPre"/&gt; Players can build an ACU Center and a Ranger Station, which are responsible for maintaining the park's security. They can sedate escaped dinosaurs, medicate sick dinosaurs, resupply dinosaur feeders, transport dinosaurs, fix fences, and more.&lt;ref name="demo"/&gt; Players can also control vehicles from a [[third-person perspective]] such as helicopters and [[4x4]] trucks to complete these tasks.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RBPre"/&gt; Emergency shelters to protect the guests, as well as other security structures like power network redundancies and storm warning centers, can be built.&lt;ref name="RBPre"/&gt; Many of these security facilities can be upgraded to strengthen their efficiency when dealing with emergencies.&lt;ref name="Mashable"/&gt;

If a player's reputation within a division gets too low, that creates a [[sabotage]] in the player's park that will need to be attended to immediately.

To aid in creating the game, the development team closely watched the films and read [[Michael Crichton]]'s novels, ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' and ''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]'', and fan theories. In addition, Universal and the team had discussions about various elements in the game.&lt;ref name=SR&gt;{{cite news|last=Keyes|first=Rob|title=Jurassic World Evolution: Creative Director Michael Brookes Interview |url=https://screenrant.com/jurassic-world-evolution-michael-brookes-interview/|accessdate=3 April 2018|work=Screen Rant|date=2 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141838/https://screenrant.com/jurassic-world-evolution-michael-brookes-interview/|archivedate=24 October 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; History from each of the films was added to the game.&lt;ref name=Venture/&gt; For example, [[Jeff Goldblum]] reprised his role as Ian Malcolm from the first two ''Jurassic Park'' films.&lt;ref name=Goldblum/&gt; [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] and [[B.

''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' was one of the first dinosaurs the development team began working on. For the ''T. rex'' roars, the game's sound team obtained audio samples from the films and then altered them for originality. The animation team then altered their ''T. rex'' roaring animations to fit the sound effects. To design the dinosaurs the development team primarily referred to the films for consistency, while incorporating some of the latest scientific discoveries to add to their designs. The team also studied birds and other animals to aid in designing the dinosaurs. In addition to their designs, dinosaur behavior was based on a combination of the films and scientific findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krupa|first=Daniel|title=How Jurassic World Evolution Made Its T.

Critics praised the dinosaurs featured in the game. Sam Loveridge of ''[[GamesRadar+]]'' liked the variety as well as the [[cutscene]] that was displayed when a dinosaur is released from the incubation center. He enjoyed being able to control the jeep and the ACU helicopter from a third-person perspective, a mechanic he applauds for allowing players to relate to the dinosaurs. He added that he "lost entire evenings to [the game] without even thinking" due to its relaxing nature.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; [[Game Revolution]]{{'}}s Paul Tamburro praised the dinosaurs' design, in particular, Frontier's attention to detail and the dinosaurs' animation.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; James Swinbanks of ''[[GameSpot]]'' agreed, praising the dinosaurs. He also enjoyed the need to learn each dinosaur's personality, requirements and behaviors, adding the process is "surprisingly satisfying".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' {{'}}s Daniel Tack liked that players can experiment with different genes, though he commented that it was not a "freeform experience".&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Dan Stapleton of ''[[IGN]]'' disagreed and felt that unlocking genes was tedious, describing the process as a series of "mandatory robotic actions".&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; While he liked the dinosaur variety, he lamented the lack of ''[[pterosaurs]]'' and aquatic prehistoric reptiles at launch. ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Dam Roemer commended the inclusion of lesser- known dinosaurs species, singling out ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' and ''[[Deinonychus]]''.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; 

The simulation aspect of the game received mixed reviews. Loveridge held a positive opinion regarding dinosaur management, as each species has their own needs and niches that players must fulfill. He felt the park management aspect, including the construction of facilities and utilities, was "minimal".&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Tamburro compared the simulation to ''[[RollerCoaster Tycoon]]'' and ''[[Zoo Tycoon]]''. He enjoyed the chaos created when dinosaurs break out, but he was disappointed that dinosaurs did not attack the park's staff carrying out maintenance inside the enclosures.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Philippa Warr of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' praised the dinosaurs but criticized the lack of attention to missions and individual guests' views and happiness ratings on the park. She also noted the simulation lacked depth, as buildings looked largely the same and the environment soon became stale.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt; Swinbanks felt dealing with natural disasters and dinosaur breakout was exciting initially, but soon became repetitive. He also lamented the lack of new challenges presented in the later stage of the game.&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Tack criticized the tiresome aspect of simulation and the constant need to wait for objectives to be completed, comparing them to a [[mobile game]].&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Describing the simulation as "shallow", Roemer criticized the lack of time constraints, cleanliness ratings, and a full day-night cycle. He was also disappointed by the small size of each island, which made park building "unfulfilling".&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Stapleton agreed, saying that the small islands limited players' creativity. He noted that players cannot speed up time in the game, a signature feature in many other simulators and builders, and criticized its exclusion as it forced players to wait aimlessly to get enough cash to perform an action.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;

The game's contracts garnered mixed opinions. Loveridge believed they helped introduced a structure to the game, though he commented that these missions did not form a cohesive narrative.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Tamburro enjoyed the process of progressing from one island to the next, as each island has its own unique layout and landscape prompting players to create a new park that is different from the previous ones. He noted that the contracts helped players to unlock new items, but he felt they were not "exciting".&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Warr criticized the lack of variety featured in the missions, with different scenarios only presenting minor modifications and adjusting the difficult slightly. He also disliked the contracts for occasionally forcing players to complete missions that do not make sense, such as releasing a dinosaur to kill guests.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt; Swinbanks also criticized three contract factions, adding that players' need to satisfy and balance all three parties demands as "arbitrary".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Roemer praised Goldblum's performance, though he noted the overarching plot "goes nowhere". He described the game's progression system as "awful" and wished to skip them entirely.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt;

The game's tutorial and guidance to players was criticized. Loveridge noted that certain missions were confusing with some late game objectives being presented too early, forcing him to dismiss them to progress. He singled out the tutorial section for being incompetent, failing to inform players about key aspects of the game such as power distribution and landscaping tools, which often create obstruction. and terrain errors that prevent players from constructing certain buildings and modifying the landscape.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Warr noted pacing errors with the tutorials, saying that some of them showed up way too late.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt;

Reviewers had mixed opinions of the game as a whole. Loveridge called it an intricate simulation game that fans of the series would enjoy, and he commended the many references to the film featured in the game.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Tamburro agreed and called it the best ''Jurassic Park''-themed game, though he noted that the game had more constraints than Frontier's previous park builder, ''[[Planet Coaster]]''.&lt;ref name="GameRevRev"/&gt; Initially impressed by the game, Warr was disappointed after extended play time feeling the game was lacking depth.&lt;ref name="PCGUSRev"/&gt; Swinbanks noted that despite its shortcomings, the game was "faithful" to the franchise. He felt that it was "a good park management sim in its own right".&lt;ref name="GSpot"/&gt; Roemer felt that the game's development was rushed, and the lack of depth was problematic.&lt;ref name="DestructRev"/&gt; Stapleton called it a "bad" game for being largely boring.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt;

Five weeks after its initial release, the game had sold one million copies through digital and physical sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/19/jurassic-world-evolution-hits-1-million-copies-sold |title=Jurassic World Evolution Hits 1 Million Copies Sold |first=Shabana |last=Arif |work=IGN |date=19 July 2018 |accessdate=19 July 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720115530/http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/19/jurassic-world-evolution-hits-1-million-copies-sold|archivedate=24 October 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Mang-Kwong Low''' is a [[Chinese in Fiji|Chinese-Fijian]] businessman and political leade.  He unsuccessfully contested the [[Fijian general election, 1999|parliamentary election]] of 1999 as a candidate for the General Voters Party (GVP) for the [[West Central (General Electors Communal Constituency, Fiji)|Western Central (General Electors) Communal Constituency]].  He also lost the [[Fijian general election, 2001|Fiji national elections in 2001]] for the Suva City (General Electors) Communal Constituency, where he was the candidate of the [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] (SDL),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/54263/425822/article.html|title=Tension rises ahead of Fiji vote|date=24 August 2001|publisher=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was appointed to the [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] as one of nine nominees of the Fijian [[Prime Minister of Fiji|Prime Minister]], and became Vice-President of the Senate on 28 February 2005, the first Chinese-Fijian to do so, following the appointment of the previous Vice-President, [[Doctor (title)|Dr]] [[Ahmed Ali (politician)|Ahmed Ali]] to a Government Cabinet position.

==Family background==
According to Low, he was born in [[Chongqing]], [[China]] at the end of [[World War II]] and came to Fiji at the age of 10. He is a third generation Sino-Fijian with his grandfather Low Fong arriving in [[Fiji]] in 1908. Low's father Low Kum-Tim, came with his family to Fiji from [[Hong Kong]] in 1955 as a school teacher in the Lautoka Chinese School. In Hong Kong, Low Kum-Tim and his two partners, Chiang Yu-Loong and Ma Kok-Yu operated the "Green Sea Farm" for 5 years after leaving mainland China. The farm had received government awards for being the best and most progressive chicken farm, and Low Kum-Tim had published 3 books on "Diseases of Chicken and the cure" during this time from experience in raising chicken commercially.

Low Kum-Tim was an artist in traditional [[chinese painting]] of the Chinese grand master [[Qi BaiShi]] school,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.QiBaishi.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and had held many exhibitions in the Fiji Arts Club in the 1960s together with [[Sec-Poy Fong]], managing director of [[On Wah Chang]], Suva. In June 1966, Low's parents and brothers migrated to the [[United States]] and lived in [[New York City]]. Low Kum-Tim continued his passion for painting in NYC and had held several exhibitions in New York and [[Philadelphia]]. He died in 1993 after battling Parkinson's disease for almost 20 years.

==Education==
In 1966, Low left Fiji to study [[architecture]] at the [[University of New South Wales]]. After graduating in 1970, he remained in [[Sydney]] and commenced private practice in architecture from 1974. He was also a registered Gold Licensed Builder in N.S.W. from 1978. Low taught Architecture and Construction at the Sydney College of Technical and Further Education from 1976-1978. Whilst teaching, he also completed his Diploma in Education in 1978.

Low returned to Fiji in 1983 and set up his private practice in architecture and construction until the 1987 coup. He then returned to Sydney and undertook construction contracts. But in 1991, Low again returned to Fiji, to practise architecture and also as a property developer and investor.

Low, who is the founder (1994) and President of the [[All Chinese Business Association of Fiji]], worked to promote trade directly between Fiji and China.

==Senatorial service==
During his time as Senator, Low joined much of the Fiji-born Chinese community in calling for a crackdown on illegal immigration (mainly from mainland China) which he said was detrimental to the local-born Chinese and the Chinese reputation as a whole.  He alleged in the Senate on 8 November 2005 that corrupt immigration officials in Fiji were granting Fijian citizenship and visas to illegal Chinese immigrants, for financial and sexual favours, and called for a full inquiry into what was going on.

==Career after politics==
Low retired from the Senate in June 2006 and did not participate in the 2006 national elections.

Low is now actively promoting and fostering better relationships between Fiji and China. Today, Low remains the Chairman of Board of Directors, and is the current Manager of the [[Lautoka Chinese School]]. In 2003-2004, Low increased the number of classrooms and upgraded the school hall.

The '''Lord Baltimore Hotel''' is located at 20 [[Baltimore Street|West Baltimore Street]], on the northeast corner of the intersection with North Hanover Street, and one block west of the main downtown thoroughfare of [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles Street]], in the [[Downtown Baltimore|downtown area]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

==Description==
The hotel was designed by [[William Lee Stoddart]] and opened on December 30, 1928.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-699.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Lord Baltimore Hotel|date=March 1982|accessdate=2016-04-01 |author=Fred B. Shoken|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 22 story hotel, designed in the [[French Renaissance architecture|French Renaissance]] style, has a dark red brick veneer with limestone trim over a steel frame.  The building, which is 289 feet tall, is topped with a tower featuring a [[mansard roof]] of copper, now aged with a green patina. It replaced the smaller but substantial Hotel Carswell, built shortly after the [[Great Baltimore Fire]] of 1904.

In 1958, after the [[Baltimore City Council]] considered but failed to pass an ordinance prohibiting [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] in public accommodations, the Lord Baltimore Hotel voluntarily ended its restrictive guest policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rasmussen |first=Frederick N. |title='Toward Equality' Pamphlets took the Pulse of the State's Race Relations |newspaper=The Baltimore Sun |page=A10 |date=6 Feb 2011 |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-backstory-race-relations-20110204,0,7253942.story |accessdate=6 Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following the redevelopment of the downtown area in the 1990s, the hotel is within walking distance of many Baltimore attractions such as the [[Inner Harbor]], [[Camden Yards Sports Complex|Camden Yards]], and the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore|National Aquarium]].

The Lord Baltimore Hotel closed in 1982, needing a major renovation.&lt;ref&gt;http://lordbaltimorehotel.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/july-25-1982-sunday-sun-lbh-feature.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by a partnership headed by local developer Saul Perlmutter in 1983 and was renovated in 1985. The partnership filed for bankruptcy in 1987 and the hotel was then taken over from its defunct creditor by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) during the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-04-27/business/1991117048_1_lord-baltimore-hotel-liens-partnership&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel was managed by [[Radisson Hotels]] through much of the 1990s as the '''Radission Plaza Lord Baltimore'''. The FDIC sold the hotel to Universal Equities, a Washington, D.C. group, in 1992 for $8.5 million.&lt;ref name="lordbaltimorehotel.wordpress.com"&gt;http://lordbaltimorehotel.wordpress.com/page/5/&lt;/ref&gt; Universal, in turn, sold the hotel in January 1997 for $30 million.&lt;ref name="lordbaltimorehotel.wordpress.com"/&gt; The new owners, Davidson Hotels, ended the association with Radisson.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-01-31/news/1997031020_1_baltimore-hilton-lord-baltimore-hilton-towers&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel became, for a time the '''Hilton Baltimore &amp; Towers'''.

The hotel was sold again in 2001&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-05-12/business/0105120002_1_lord-baltimore-baltimore-hilton-radisson-plaza-hotel&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Carlson Hotels]], the owners of the [[Radisson Hotels]] franchise,&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-05-17/business/0105170190_1_downtown-hotels-radisson-lord-baltimore&lt;/ref&gt; regaining its previous name as the '''Radisson Plaza Lord Baltimore'''.

The hotel was sold to Rubell Hotels of [[Miami, Florida]] for $10 million (US) in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2013/08/lord-baltimore-hotel-drops-radisson.html&lt;/ref&gt; It dropped the Radisson flag and reopened in 2014 as an independent hotel after undergoing a total remodeling of guest rooms, and restoration of the building's public spaces.

The hotel was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1982. Lord Baltimore Hotel is a member of [[Historic Hotels of America]], the official program of the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]].&lt;ref name=hha&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lord Baltimore Hotel, a Historic Hotels of America member|url=http://www.historichotels.org/hotels-resorts/lord-baltimore-hotel/|publisher=Historic Hotels of America|accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22875">'''Marriage privatization''' is the concept that the [[state (polity)|state]] should have no authority to define the terms of [[personal relationship]]s such as [[marriage]]. Proponents of marriage privatization, including certain [[minarchism|minarchists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[libertarianism|libertarians]], and opponents of government interventionism, claim that such relationships are best defined by private individuals and not the state. Arguments for the privatization of marriage have been offered by a number of scholars and writers. Proponents of marriage privatization often argue that privatizing marriage is a solution to the social controversy over [[same-sex marriage]]. Arguments for and against the privatization of marriage span both [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political camps.

==Advocacy==

===Libertarian advocacy===
In 1997, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[David Boaz]] wrote an article for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' titled “Privatize Marriage: A Simple Solution to the Gay-Marriage Debate." In the article, Boaz suggests privatizing marriage in a way that models the nature of standard business contracts. Boaz's idea is to allow two (possibly more) individuals to set the terms of their own private marital contract in a way that is best for the individuals involved. "When children or large sums of money are involved, an enforceable contract spelling out the parties' respective rights and obligations is probably advisable. But the existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the parties."&lt;ref&gt;Boaz (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boaz the government could be called upon to enforce the contract but may have no other role in developing the contract and setting the terms.

In 2002, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] echoed Boaz's business contract model in an essay for ''Ifeminists'' titled "It's Time to Privatize Marriage."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage should be privatized. Let people make their own marriage contracts according to their conscience, religion and common sense. Those contracts could be registered with the state, recognized as legal and arbitrated by the courts, but the terms would be determined by those involved.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McElroy has also said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is marriage declining? One reason is that it has become a three-way contract between two people and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0702/0702marriage.htm |title=It's time to privatize marriage |publisher=Enterstageright.com |date=2002-07-22 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, political columnist Ryan McMaken, writing on [[LewRockwell.com]], raised the issue of marriage privatization arguing that the rise of state-sanctioned marriage coincides historically with the expansion of government. In his article titled "Married to the State," McMaken wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question we are then left with today is one of whether the churches and individuals should be looking to privatize marriage yet again and to begin making a distinction between secular contracts between private citizens and religious unions that should be kept beyond the power of the State. Such a move, of course, would bring with it new assumptions about the role of the State in divorce, children, and a variety of other aspects of family life. The State will not give up control over these things easily, for the assertion that the importance of marriage makes it a legitimate interest of the State is only true from the point of view of the State itself, for as the foundation of society, marriage and family cannot be entrusted to governments just to be blown about by the winds of democratic opinion, for the same government that has the power to protect can just as easily destroy.&lt;ref&gt;McMaken (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a similar libertarian vein, the radio talk-show host [[Larry Elder]] endorsed the privatization of marriage. In "The State Should Get Out of the Marriage Business", a 2004 article published in on the website Capitalism Magazine, Elder wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How about government simply getting out of the marriage-license-granting business? (Ditto for government licenses necessary to cut hair, drive a taxi, open a business or enter a profession.) Leave marriage to non-governmental institutions, like churches, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship or private institutions. Adultery, although legal, remains a sin subject to societal condemnation. It's tough to legislate away condemnation or legislate in approval. Those who view same-sex marriage as sinful will continue to do so, no matter what the government, the courts or their neighbors say.&lt;ref&gt;Elder (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, law professor Colin P.A. Jones wrote an article appearing in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' titled "Marriage Proposal: Why Not Privatize?" following the business model for privatization Jones writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject to certain statutory constraints, businesspeople have long been free to form whatever sort of partnership they felt appropriate to their needs. Why not make the same possible for marriage, which is a partnership based on one of the oldest types of contractual relationships? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage proposal: Why not privatize? / Partnerships could be tailored to fit|url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Marriage-proposal-Why-not-privatize-2523603.php|website=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, author and journalist [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote about getting the state out of marriage in ''[[The Times]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's also get the state out of the marriage union. In spite of the dress and the flowers, marriage is a business contract. Women, generally, don't understand this, until it hits them over the head upon divorce. Let's take a lead from our gay and lesbian friends, who, without state marriage, often create domestic partnerships with financial autonomy and unity spelt out. A heterosexual parallel: celebrate marriage with a religious or emotional ceremony—leave the state out of it—and create a business- or domestic-partner contract aligning the couple legally.&lt;ref&gt;Times (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Gary Becker]], a winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], has said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With marriage contracts that set out the couple's commitments, there is little reason why judges should retain their current involvement in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Every Married Couple Should Sign a Contract". Gary S. Becker. ''Business Week''. New York: December 29, 1997. Iss. 3559; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2015, the only known members of [[US Congress]] to support privatization of state marriage are Sen. [[Rand Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3939374/rand-paul-gay-marriage-supreme-court/?xid=fbshare | work=Time | title=Rand Paul: Privatize Marriage | date=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. [[Justin Amash]] (R–Michigan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/justin-amash-doma-repeal_n_2981622.html|title=Justin Amash Backs DOMA Repeal On Twitter|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rep. [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]] (R–Alabama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/10/abortion_marijuana_and_same-se.html|title=Abortion, marijuana, and same-sex marriage: District 6 candidates state their positions|work=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious advocacy===
[[Pepperdine University]] law professor [[Douglas Kmiec]] told the ''[[Catholic News Agency]]'' that churches that do not accept same-sex marriage have a genuine concern that they be subject to penalties such as losing public benefits or receiving lawsuits. He argued that the state should just allot people "civil licenses", with the terminology "marriage" left "as a religious concept" for groups to debate outside the scope of government.&lt;ref name=Kmiec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/kmiec_proposes_end_of_legally_recognized_marriage/ |title=Kmiec proposes end of legally recognized marriage |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal advocacy===
Though often introduced from [[conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|commentators]], marriage privatization has received attention from advocates on the left. In 2003 left-leaning political [[columnist]] and [[journalist]] [[Michael Kinsley]] wrote a second essay to appear in ''Slate'' on the topic. Kinsley's essay is titled "Abolish Marriage: Let's Really Get the Government out of Our Bedrooms." Kinsley follows the model set by his libertarian counterparts Boaz and McElroy; like Elder's he emphasizes marriage privatization's potential to end the controversy over same-sex marriage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If marriage were an entirely private affair, all the disputes over gay marriage would become irrelevant. Gay marriage would not have the official sanction of government, but neither would straight marriage. There would be official equality between the two, which is the essence of what gays want and are entitled to. And if the other side is sincere in saying that its concern is not what people do in private, but government endorsement of a gay "lifestyle" or "agenda," that problem goes away, too.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marriage privatization received attention from the legal scholar [[Alan Dershowitz]] in 2003 when Dershowitz wrote a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorial titled "To Fix Gay Dilemma, Government Should Quit the Marriage Business." More so than commentators from the right, Dershowitz frames his view on the topic in terms of [[church-state separation]]; unlike libertarian leaning discussions Dershowitz maintains that the state does have an interest in the [[secular]] rights of marriage. Dershowitz proposes that civil-unions as a [[secular]] replacement for state sanctioned marriage, be extended to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Under Dershowitz's conception of privatization, couples have a choice as to whether or not they wish to be married by a [[clergy]] willing to perform a [[Wedding|marriage ceremony]] or to exclusively partake of secular/state-sanctioned civil unions. Dershowitz writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only would this solution be good for gays and for those who oppose gay marriage on religious grounds, it would also strengthen the wall of separation between church and state by placing a sacred institution entirely in the hands of the church while placing a secular institution under state control.&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public policy advocacy and academia===
In 2007 the [[Center for Inquiry]], a secular [[think tank]], released a position paper authored by analyst Ruth Mitchell titled "Same-Sex Marriage and Marriage". The paper argues from the separation of church and state that as long as marriage is available to heterosexual couples it ought to be equally available to [[LGBT]] couples. Nevertheless, the position paper claims that state endorsement of civil unions for both types of couples is the most appropriate policy in light of separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument for marriage privatization has also been formulated in [[academic]] scholarship. In 2008 an argument for marriage privatization appeared in the [[public policy]] journal ''Public Affairs Quarterly''. In that issue philosopher Lawrence Torcello offers a detailed model of marriage privatization based on the later political writings of the 20th century [[political philosopher]] [[John Rawls]]. The article is titled "Is The State Endorsement of Any Marriage Justifiable? Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions, and The Marriage Privatization Model."

In the 1993 book ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', Rawls argues that arguments in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[society]] must be hashed out in terms that all members of that society can understand if not endorse. This means that in making public claims one must refrain from religious or otherwise controversial [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claims that cannot, in principle, be equally endorsed by reasonable persons. In doing this, one is relying on what Rawls refers to as [[public reason]].

In his article, Torcello claims that any state endorsement of marriage represents an inappropriate [[public]] [[Testimonial|endorsement]] of a comprehensive religious or otherwise metaphysical [[doctrine]], which underlies any particular definition of marriage. Accordingly, taking public reason seriously leads to the idea that [[legalization]] of same-sex marriage may be just as neutrally unbalanced as its ban.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"&gt;Torcello 2008 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In place of the public institute of marriage, Torcello, like Dershowitz, argues that civil unions providing the full extent of marital benefits under law ought to be instituted for both heterosexual and homosexual couples.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"/&gt; According to the argument, such civil unions ought to replace the current legal institute of marriage. Once privatized, marriage is open for individuals to define and embrace or ignore as they see fit, within the scope of their [[Privacy|private]] religious or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[belief system]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No religious model that rejects same-sex marriage would be required to perform same-sex marriages under this privatized model. Under this model a couple, either heterosexual or homosexual, would obtain a civil union in order to have public and legal recognition of their partnership; they would have a private marriage ceremony if they so chose in order to honor their private religious or philosophical concept of marriage.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a July 2008 article appearing in ''[[The Monist]]'' titled "Privatizing Marriage" [[Harvard]] Law Professor [[Cass Sunstein]] and [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Richard H. Thaler]] offer arguments for the privatization of marriage. Thaler and Sunstein also take up the topic in their co-authored 2008 book ''Nudge: Improving Decisions about Wealth, Health, and Happiness.'' Sunstein and Thaler argue for marriage privatization among other positions under the heading of what they call "Libertarian Paternalism".

==Arguments opposing the privatization of marriage==
Opposition to marriage privatization, like its endorsement, is equally likely to be found arising from conservative or liberal sources and a wide variety of objections are made.

Conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[baptist]] [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]] has stated that he opposes the privatizaton of marriage because "markets do not always encourage or support moral behavior" and he believes the proposal would "[destroy] marriage as a public institution."&lt;ref&gt;Mohler (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Princeton University|Princeton]] professor [[Robert P. George]] has argued that marriage has an important cultural role in helping children develop into "basically honest, decent law-abiding people of goodwill—citizens—who can take their rightful place in society". Thus, he concludes, "Family is built on marriage, and government—the state—has a profound interest in the integrity and well-being of marriage, and to write it off as if it were purely a religiously significant action and not an institution and action that has a profound public significance, would be a terrible mistake".&lt;ref name=Kmiec/&gt;  This position is seconded by Jennifer Morse of the Witherspoon Institute, who argues that if literally anyone can define marriage as whatever they want, the state forfeits the ability to sufficiently secure the best interests of children.  She goes further, arguing that the logic of marriage privatization "at the expense of children, is a concept developed by adults that will benefit only adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/04/5073 |title=Privatizing marriage is unjust to children |last1=Morse |first1=Jennifer |last2= |first2= |date=4 April 2012 |website= |publisher=The Witherspoon Institute |access-date=11 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Kurtz]] of ''[[National Review]]'' has written that privatization would be a "disaster". He argued that government "still has to decide what sort of private unions merit benefits... under this privatization scheme", and then "we also get the same quarrels over social recognition that we got before privatization." He commented that the government will have to deal with [[polygamy|polygamous]], [[polyamory|polyamorous]], and [[incest]]uous relationships attempting to obtain contracts under the new scheme as well as attempts by heterosexual acquaintances to make "marriages of convenience" to obtain things such as spousal medical insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/117239/privatizing-marriage-stanley-kurtz |title=Privatizing Marriage |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2006-01-22 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[National Review]]'' colleague [[Maggie Gallagher]] has also called privatization as a "fantasy" since "[t]here is scarcely a dollar that state and federal government spends on social programs that is not driven in large part by family fragmentation: crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school failure, mental and physical health problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806085511/http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues involved with privatizing marriage==
In general, a legal contract signed between two or more people will often include penalties for the severing of the contract by a party or parties. However, this generally does not apply to marriages in the US, which usually fall under the legal standard of [[no-fault divorce]]. It remains an open issue as to whether or not these quasi-marriage partnership contracts will be enforced with penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotair.com/archives/2010/08/07/why-is-the-state-involved-in-marriage-at-all/ |title=Why is the state involved in marriage at all? |publisher=Hotair.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4920">'''Mission-driven marketing''', or '''mission-based marketing''' refers to a strategic [[marketing]] approach which uses an organization’s core mission as the foundation and focus of its [[marketing communications]]. Philosophically, it is based on the organization’s desire to promote the purpose, aim, and goals of the organization, as outlined in its [[mission statement]], and to communicate the benefits of achieving those goals to its stakeholders.

The term, mission-driven marketing, has historically been associated with the [[non-profit sector]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ga0.org/nptimes/notice-description.tcl?newsletter_id=2819041 ''Mission-Driven Marketing''], The NonProfit Times Thursday, May 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and [[non-governmental organizations]], as early as 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Leet, ''Marketing for Mission'', National Center for Nonprofit Boards, 1998 (NCNB Booklet, Strategic Issues Series) 24 pp. {{ISBN|0-925299-82-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mission-driven marketing philosophy and strategy has also been applied in the [[healthcare]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/61792309_2.html James E.

==Key concepts==

===Organizational philosophy===
A mission-driven, or [[mission-based organization]] can be non-profit or for-profit, public or private, governmental or non-governmental, philanthropic or [[religious]]. Typically, mission-driven organizations, are formed and/or managed to accomplish goals that extend beyond profits for stakeholders, shareholders, and owners to include a societal benefit. This could include an array of focus areas such as, education, [[youth development]], protecting the [[Natural environment|environment]], caring for the sick, fighting [[poverty]], and promoting spirituality. Companies who adopt [[fair trade]] or [[environmental sustainability]] business practices could also be considered as an organization with a mission-driven focus.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Wall, Mark Sobol, Robert Solum , ''The Mission-Driven Organization: From Mission Statement to a Thriving Enterprise, Here's Your Blueprint for Building an Inspired, Cohesive, Customer-Oriented Team'', Prima Lifestyles, February 24, 1999 {{ISBN|978-0-7615-1881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adherence to core values===
Values based organizations are mission-driven. Therefore, central to mission-driven marketing philosophy is adherence to the organization's core values, and using its mission statement as the basis for planning and implementation of marketing strategy. Market factors are taken into account, but the [[Mission Statement|mission]] is the final determining factor. It has also been defined as being "mission-based and market driven".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter C Brinckerhoff]], ''Mission-Based Marketing: Positioning Your Not-for-Profit in an Increasingly Competitive World.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons (1997). 2nd Edition, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-471-23718-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such businesses are increasingly being referred to as a "[[conscious business]]", or engaging in "conscious capitalism". The organization's values then provide a foundation for its marketing messages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1730">'''George Montegu Black III''' (August 6, 1940 in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] – January 10, 2002 in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]]) was the older brother of media baron [[Conrad Black]] and son of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] businessman [[George Montegu Black II]].

He along with his brother Conrad, attended Toronto's elite [[Upper Canada College]].  In grade 10 he transferred to Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ont. from which he matriculated in 1959.  Monte was an accomplished athlete and played significant roles in the sports life of the school. His leadership role as head prefect of Bethune House was a harbinger of things to come.  He then attended Huron College at the UWO in London, Ontario.  His career path included corporate partnerships with brother Conrad and then in the investment industry with Draper Dobie and Dominion Securities.

With brother Conrad, they once controlled [[Hollinger Inc.]] along with [[David Radler]]. He was also a director of the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] and the HSC Foundation.

Married in 1964 to Mariellen Jean Campbell.  They have three daughters, Tracey Jean, Alannah Christian, and Meredith Shannon, and one son, George Montegu IV.  They were divorced in 1986, and Montegu subsequently married June Kemsley Doull in March, 1989.

Multinational corporations are subject to [[#Criticism|criticisms]] for lacking [[ethics|ethical standards]], and that this shows up in how they evade ethical laws and leverage their own business agenda with capital, and even the military backing of their own wealthy host nation-states.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  They have also become associated with [[multinational tax haven]]s and [[base erosion and profit shifting]] tax avoidance activities.

A multinational corporation (MNC) is usually a large corporation incorporated in one country which produces or sells goods or services in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doob|first=Christopher M.|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society|year=2013|publisher=Pearson Education Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main characteristics of MNCs are their large size and the fact that their worldwide activities are centrally controlled by the parent companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trcollege.net/study-material/24-economics/47-role-of-multinational-corporations |title=Role of Multinational Corporations |publisher=[[T.

* [[Import]]ing and [[export]]ing goods and services
* Making significant investments in a foreign country
* Buying and selling licenses in foreign markets
* Engaging in [[contract manufacturing]] — permitting a local manufacturer in a foreign country to produce their products
* Opening manufacturing facilities or assembly operations in foreign countries

MNCs may gain from their global presence in a variety of ways. First of all, MNCs can benefit from the [[economy of scale]] by spreading [[R&amp;D]] expenditures and advertising costs over their global sales, pooling global purchasing power over suppliers, and utilizing their technological and managerial know-how globally with minimal additional costs. Furthermore, MNCs can use their global presence to take advantage of underpriced labor services available in certain developing countries, and gain access to special R&amp;D capabilities residing in advanced foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eun|first=Cheol S.|last2=Resnick|first2=Bruce G.|title=International Financial Management,6th Edition|year=2013|publisher=Beijing Chengxin Weiye Printing Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of moral and legal constraints upon the behavior of multinational corporations, given that they are effectively "stateless" actors, is one of several urgent global [[socioeconomic]] problems that emerged during the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig-Archibugi|first1=Mathias|title=Transnational Corporations and Public Accountability|journal=Gary 2004|page=106|url=http://dspace.africaportal.org/jspui/bitstream/123456789/8719/1/Transnational%20Corporations%20and%20Public%20Accountability.pdf?1|accessdate=2 February 2015}} {{cite news|last1=Krugman|first1=Paul|title=In Praise of Cheap Labor: Bad Jobs at Bad Wages Are Better than No Jobs at All|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_dismal_science/1997/03/in_praise_of_cheap_labor.html|accessdate=2 February 2015|agency=Slate|date=20 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potentially, the best concept for analyzing society's governance limitations over modern corporations is the concept of "stateless corporations". Coined at least as early as 1990 in ''[[Business Week]]'', the conception was theoretically clarified in 1992: that an empirical strategy for defining a stateless corporation is with analytical tools at the intersection between [[demographic]] analysis and [[transportation]] research. This intersection is known as [[logistics|logistics management]], and it describes the importance of rapidly increasing global mobility of resources. In a long history of analysis of multinational corporations we are some quarter century into an era of stateless corporations - corporations which meet the realities of the needs of source materials on a worldwide basis and to produce and customize products for individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;Holstein, William J. et al., "The Stateless Corporation", ''Business Week'' (May 14, 1990), p. 98. Roy D. Voorhees, Emerson L. Seim, and John I. Coppett, "Global Logistics and Stateless Corporations", ''Transportation Practitioners Journal'' 59, 2 (Winter 1992): 144-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first multinational business organizations, the [[East India Company]], was established in 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/about/globalinc.jsp |title=GlobalInc.

The main characteristics of multinational companies are:
* In general, there is a national strength of large companies as the main body, in the way of foreign direct investment or acquire local enterprises, established [[subsidiaries]] or branches in many countries;
* It usually has a complete [[decision-making]] system and the highest decision-making center, each subsidiary or branch has its own decision-making body, according to their different features and operations to make decisions, but its decision must be subordinated to the highest decision-making center;
* MNCs seek markets in worldwide and rational production layout, professional fixed-point production, fixed-point sales products, in order to achieve [[profit maximization|maximum profit]];
* Due to strong economic and technical strength, with fast information transmission, as well as funding for rapid cross-border transfers, the multinational has stronger [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]] in the world;
* Many large multinational companies have varying degrees of monopoly in some area, due to economic and technical strength or production advantages.

== Legal domicile ==
Multinational corporations can select from a variety of jurisdictions for various subsidiaries, but the ultimate parent company can select a single [[Domicile (law)|legal domicile]]; as of 2014, the Netherlands has been a popular choice, as it has fewer requirements for meetings, compensation, and audit committees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/business/2014/02/24/here-there-and-everywhere|title=Here, there and everywhere|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, [[Great Britain]] had advantages due to laws on withholding dividends and a double-taxation treaty with the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Corporations can legally engage in [[tax avoidance]] through their jurisdiction, but must be careful to avoid illegal [[tax evasion]].

== Regulation ==
Multinational corporations may be subject to the laws and regulations of both their domicile and the additional jurisdictions where they are engaged in business.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillip|first=Blumberg,|date=1990|title=The Corporate Entity in an Era of Multinational Corporations|url=https://opencommons.uconn.edu/law_papers/58/|journal=OpenCommons@UConn|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the jurisdiction can help to avoid burdensome laws, but regulatory statutes often target the "enterprise" with statutory language around "control".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Alternatives and arrangements ==
For small corporations, registering a foreign subsidiary can be expensive and complex, involving fees, signatures, and forms;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://velocityglobal.com/blog/foreign-subsidiary-10-reasons-you-should-not-create-one/|title=10 Reasons You Should Not Create a Foreign Subsidiary|last=|first=|date=2015-07-17|work=Velocity Global|access-date=2018-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125233947/https://velocityglobal.com/blog/foreign-subsidiary-10-reasons-you-should-not-create-one/|archive-date=2018-11-25|dead-url=no|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[professional employer organization]] (PEO) is sometimes advertised as a cheaper and simpler alternative,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but not all jurisdictions have laws accepting these types of arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.china-briefing.com/news/outsourcing-options-fdi-china/|title=Outsourcing Options for FDI into China - China Briefing News|last=|first=|date=2017-07-12|work=China Briefing News|access-date=2018-11-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125234243/http://www.china-briefing.com/news/outsourcing-options-fdi-china/|archive-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dispute resolution and arbitration ==
{{Further|International legal system}}
Disputes between corporations in different nations is often handled through [[international arbitration]].

==Theoretical background==
The actions of multinational corporations are strongly supported by [[economic liberalism]] and [[free market]] system in a [[globalized]] international society. According to the economic realist view, individuals act in rational ways to maximize their self-interest and therefore, when individuals act rationally, markets are created and they function best in free market system where there is little government interference. As a result, international wealth is maximized with free exchange of goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Essentials of international relations |last= Mingst |first= Karen A. |authorlink= |year= 2014 |publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location= |isbn= 978-0-393-92195-3 |page= 310 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To many economic liberals, multinational corporations are the vanguard of the liberal order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Essentials of international relations |last= Mingst |first= Karen A. |authorlink= |year= 2014 |publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location= |isbn= 978-0-393-92195-3 |page= 311 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the embodiment par excellence of the liberal ideal of an interdependent world economy. They have taken the integration of national economies beyond trade and money to the internationalization of production. For the first time in history, production, marketing, and investment are being organized on a global scale rather than in terms of isolated national economies.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"&gt;{{cite book |title= Three models of the future |last= Gilpin |first= Robert |authorlink= |year= 1975 |publisher= International Organization |location= |isbn= |page= 39 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International business is also a specialist field of academic research. Economic theories of the multinational corporation include [[internalization theory]] and the [[eclectic paradigm]]. The latter is also known as the OLI framework.

The other theoretical dimension of the role of multinational corporations concerns the relationship between the globalization of economic engagement and the culture of national and local responses. This has a history of self-conscious cultural management going back at least to the 1960s. For example:

{{quote|Ernest Dichter, architect, of Exxon's international campaign, writing in the [[Harvard Business Review]] in 1962, was fully aware that the means to overcoming cultural resistance depended on an "understanding" of the countries in which a corporation operated. He observed that companies with "foresight to capitalize on international opportunities" must recognize that "[[cultural anthropology]] will be an important tool for competitive marketing". However, the projected outcome of this was not the assimilation of international firms into national cultures, but the creation of a "world customer". The idea of a global corporate village entailed the management and reconstitution of parochial attachments to one's nation. It involved not a denial of the naturalness of national attachments, but an internationalization of the way a nation defines itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 1983 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Australia in the Corporate Image: A New Nationalism | url= https://www.academia.edu/33644385/Australia_in_the_Corporate_Image_A_New_Nationalism_1983_ | journal= Arena | issue=  63 | pages=68}}  See also, Richard Barnet and Ronald Muller, Global Reach: The Power of Multinational Corporations, New York, Simon and Schuster, 1974, p. 30. On page 21 Barnet and Muller quote the Chairman of the Unilever Corporation as saying: "The Nation-State will not wither away. A positive role will have to be found for it."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A transnational corporation differs from a traditional multinational corporation in that it does not identify itself with one national home. While traditional multinational corporations are national companies with foreign subsidiaries,&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Global Economy and the Nation State |last= Drucker |first= Peter F. |authorlink= |year= 1997 |publisher= Council on Foreign Relations |location= |isbn= |page= 167 |url= http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:VdRGUsk0-R4J:home.aubg.bg/students/NEN070/pos333/global_economy_nation_state.pdf+%22The+Global+Economy+and+the+Nation+State%22+Peter+F.+Drucket+transnational+corporation+borderless+world&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjWkMhIHM_XJYeV71BNfj8faEl1sg0m6Wmx88iireJl1zTm4CoQtVKcLf12QKc3TvjucPLMHQnjEqnnXWAF7CEjoOJmAx8CsA6aJm3pMPzfg-gVJ0qmHD8jpxaS0bmyKkXT-O09&amp;sig=AHIEtbSZrlgTuJjrY50zW5PnhPkv0LfGVA}}&lt;/ref&gt; transnational corporations spread out their operations in many countries to sustain high levels of local responsiveness.&lt;ref name="Case study: The Relationship between the Structure/Strategy of Multinational Corporations and Patterns of Knowledge Sharing within them"&gt;{{cite book |title= Case study: The Relationship between the Structure/Strategy of Multinational Corporations and Patterns of Knowledge Sharing within them|year= 2009 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= http://www.oup.com/uk/orc/bin/9780199534975/01student/cases/case_ch04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a transnational corporation is [[Nestlé]], who employ senior executives from many countries and tries to make decisions from a global perspective rather than from one centralized headquarters.&lt;ref name="Schermerhorn"&gt;{{cite book |title= Exploring Management |last= Schermerhorn |first= John R. |authorlink= |year= 2009 |publisher= John Wiley and Sons |location= |isbn= 0-470-16964-8 |page= 387 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=dkd98RXEzmEC&amp;pg=PA387&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;dq=nestle+transnational+not+multinational#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[Royal Dutch Shell]], whose headquarters are in [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]], but whose registered office and main executive body are headquartered in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]].

During the process of [[decolonization]], the European colonial [[charter companies]] were disbanded,&lt;ref name="Micklethwait, John 2003"/&gt; with the final colonial corporation, the [[Mozambique Company]], dissolving in 1972.  However the economic impact of corporate colonial exploitation has proved to be lasting and far reaching,&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Stephen. "Empire by Sea." Empire: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2002. 78-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; with some commentators asserting that this impact is among the chief causes of contemporary global [[income inequality]].&lt;ref name="uib.cat"/&gt;

Contemporary critics of multinational corporations have charged that some present day multinational corporations follow the pattern of exploitation and differential wealth distribution established by the now defunct colonial charter corporations, particularly with regards to corporations based in the developed world that operate resource extraction enterprises in the developing world,&lt;ref&gt;Bakan, Joel. The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power. New York: Free, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]], and [[Barrick Gold]].  Some of these critics argue that the operations of multinational corporations in the developing world take place within the broader context of [[neocolonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Azikiwe, Abayomi. "Burkina Faso: Masses Rise Up Against Neo-Colonial Rule." Global Research. Centre for Research on Globalization, 04 Nov. 2014. Web. 07 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, multinational corporations from emerging markets are playing an ever-greater role, increasingly impacting the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dandc.eu/en/briefings/multinational-corporations-emerging-markets-are-forces-be-reckoned-long-term |title= Dossier about emerging-market multinationals |publisher= D+C, development and cooperation |date= December 2015 |accessdate= 21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{Main|Anti-globalization movement|Anti-corporate activism}}
Anti-corporate advocates criticize multinational corporations for being without a basis in a national [[ethos]], being ultimately without a specific nationhood, and that this lack of an ethos appears in their ways of operating as they enter into contracts with countries that have low [[human rights]] or [[environmental law|environmental standards]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc 'Globalization, Power, and Survival: an Anthropological Perspective', pg 484–486. ''Anthropological Quarterly'' Vol.79, No. 3. Institute for Ethnographic Research, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the world economy facilitated by multinational corporations, capital will increasingly be able to play workers, communities, and nations off against one another as they demand tax, regulation and wage concessions while threatening to move. In other words, increased mobility of multinational corporations benefit capital while workers and communities lose. Some negative outcomes generated by multinational corporations include increased [[social inequality|inequality]], [[unemployment]], and [[wage stagnation]].&lt;ref name="Crotty"&gt;{{cite book |title= Multinational corps in neo-liberal regime |last= Crotty |first= Epstein &amp; Kelly |year= 1998 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn= |page= 2 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Day of Mourning''', or '''Workers’ Mourning Day''' is observed in [[Canada]] on 28 April. It commemorates workers who have been killed, injured or suffered illness due to workplace related hazards and occupational exposures.

Workers' Memorial Day was started when two labour activists, Colin Lambert and Dr. Ray Sentes, were driving in early April 1983 to a union meeting, and were stopped by a funeral procession for a firefighter that had been killed in the line of duty&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BC Labour Heritage Centre|title=Day of Mourning The Untold Story (2017)|date=2017-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP0JvrXjmgo&amp;feature=youtu.be|accessdate=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They worried that other workers who died because of work did not receive similar honours, and recalled how members of the United Steelworkers in Elliott Lake held each year a "Workers' Remembrance Day" for uranium miners who had succumbed to exposures. Lambert and Sentes sought endorsements from union officials for the idea to hold a national day of mourning, and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) passed a resolution to that effect at its annual convention in 1983, and the Canadian Labour Congress followed suit at its annual convention the following year. The AFL-CIO declared a day of mourning in 1989 and a "workers' Memorial Day" is observed in over 100 countries.

In December 1990, this day became a national observance in Canada with the passing of the Workers Mourning Day Act, so that on April 28, 1991, it was officially the National Day of Mourning for persons killed or injured in the workplace; making April 28, an official Workers’ Mourning Day.&lt;ref name="Manchester"&gt;[[Greater Manchester Hazards Centre]] Fact Sheet 28 April 2006 (GMHC is part of the [[Hazards Campaign]] recognised and affiliated to the UK [[Trades Union Congress]]) Author Hilda Palmer, (no ISBN); available at {{cite web |url=http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518055811/http://www.gmhazards.org.uk/WMDLft06.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-18 |df= }} Also '''Safety Express' March/ April 2006 Page 5'' 'April 28th is...Workers' Memorial Day' (no ISBN); published by The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents]] ([[ROSPA]]) UK [[registered charity]] No. 207823&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ohs"&gt;TUC Certificate in Occupational Health &amp; Safety course notes 2004/5 Section C page 69 (no ISBN); more info available at {{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217003146/http://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/index.cfm?mins=293 |archivedate=2010-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries and deaths in the workplace continue to be a matter of important concern across Canada. Many Canadians members work hard each day in an effort to minimize accidents and incidents.  Risk is an inherent element of many jobs, and this is why safety should be one of the core values in any workplace. Since its inception, the observance has spread to over 80 countries around the world, but is known is most other countries as the [[Workers' Memorial Day]]. The date 28 April was picked because on that day in 1914, the [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/workers-compensation/ Workers Compensation Act] received its third reading. In 2001 the [[International Labour Organization]] first observed World Day for Safety and Health at Work on this day.  Commemorating those who have been hurt or killed in the workplace shows respect for the fallen, while serving as a reminder of the importance of occupational health and safety.

The Canadian flag is flown at half-mast from sunrise to sunset on all federal government buildings, including on Parliament Hill. Workers and employees observe this day in various ways including lighting candles, donning ribbons and black armbands, and observing a moment of silence at 1100 hrs. The purpose of Day of Mourning is twofold- to remember and honour those lives lost or injured and to renew the commitment to improving health and safety in the workplace - to prevent further deaths, injuries and diseases from work.

==Young Workers==
Young workers aged from 15-24 are more likely than any other group to be injured on the job, in fact 1/3 of all injuries occur in this age group, and males are twice as likely to be injured as female workers.&lt;ref name="YoungStats"&gt;[[WorkSafeBC]] Young Workers Rights and Facts, http://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/6-FactSheet-Bugged-Revision-3-.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The highest rate of injury happens in construction and hospitality industries. These rates have led to specific laws in many provinces that provide for additional and special training for young and new workers.&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;[[WorkSafeBC]] Young Workers Resource and Fact Page, http://www2.worksafebc.com/Topics/YoungWorker/Home.asp.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these statistics, there has been renewed push to use this holiday to educate young workers of their rights in schools.&lt;ref name="Schools"&gt;Day of Mourning, BC Schools Project, http://www.labourheritagecentre.ca/domschoolsproject/&lt;/ref&gt;

OTP Group started its activity in 1949 when OTP Bank was founded as a state savings and commercial bank. '''OTP''' stands for '''O'''rszágos '''T'''akarék '''P'''énztár (National Savings Bank) which indicates the origin purpose of establishment of the bank.
The bank went public in 1995, and the share of the state in the bank capital decreased to one preferential gold share, which also eliminated shortly thereafter. Currently most of the banks' shares are owned by private and institutional investors, which ensures stable ownership structure of the company. OTP has a high [[free float]] shareholder structure, the free float ratio reaches the 68,61%.

==History==
The predecessor of OTP Bank, called the National Savings Bank (OTP Bank) was established in 1949 as a nationwide, state-owned, banking entity providing retail deposits and loans. In the ensuing years, its activities and the scope of its authority gradually widened. First, it was authorised to enter into real estate transactions. Later, its role was extended to provide domestic foreign currency accounts and foreign exchange services; there was a subsequent diversification into providing banking services for Hungarian municipalities.

Since 1989, the bank has operated as a multi-functional commercial bank. In addition to continuing its previous retail and municipal activities, the bank has been authorised to solicit corporate loan accounts and deposits, and to provide commercial loans and banking services for correspondent banking and export-import transactions.

In 1990, the National Savings Bank became a public company with a share capital of HUF 23 billion. Its name was changed to the National Savings and Commercial Bank. Subsequently, non-banking activities were separated from the bank, along with their supporting organisational units. The state lottery was reorganised into a separate state-owned company and OTP Real Estate was established as a subsidiary of the bank.
[[Image:Otp bank Logo old.svg|thumb|150px|left|OTP Bank logo used between 1991 and 2007]]

OTP Bank's privatisation began in 1995. As a result of 3 public offers along with the introduction of the bank's shares into the Budapest Stock Exchange the state's ownership in the bank decreased to a single voting preference (golden) share. Currently the bank is characterized by dispersed ownership of mostly private and institutional (financial) investors.

After the realisation of its own privatisation process, OTP Bank started its international expansion targeting countries in CEE{{clarify|date=December 2016}} region.  OTP Bank has completed several acquisitions in the past years. Besides Hungary, OTP Group currently operates in 8 countries of the region via its subsidiaries: in Bulgaria ([[DSK Bank]]), in Croatia (OTP banka Hrvatska), in Romania (OTP Bank Romania), in Serbia ([[OTP banka Srbija]]), in Slovakia (OTP Banka Slovensko), in Ukraine (OTP Bank JSC), in Montenegro (Crnogorska komercijalna banka) and in Russia (OAO OTP Bank).

2008 was milestone in OTP Bank history since it was the first time to sell one of its subsidiaries. The French Groupama  S.A. acquired its insurance business line, and part of the transaction they resolved to collaborate in strategic points and crossell their financial and insurance products.  Groupama S.A. has acquired 8% of shares of OTP Group.

In April 2014, it was announced that OTP Bank was close to a deal to acquire the Hungarian [[MKB Bank]] from German firm [[BayernLB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/us-otp-bk-mkb-bank-idUSBREA370HK20140408| title=Hungary's biggest bank OTP nearing deal to buy MKB| publisher=Reuters| date=8 April 2014| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924195628/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/08/us-otp-bk-mkb-bank-idUSBREA370HK20140408 | archivedate=24 September 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French [[AXA Bank Europe]] announced in February 2016 it has entered into an agreement with OTP Bank to sell its Hungarian banking operations, which is considered as medium-sized bank in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.intellinews.com/otp-agrees-to-buy-axa-s-hungarian-banking-unit-89925/?source=bne-banker| title=OTP agrees to buy Axa's Hungarian banking unit| publisher=IntelliNews| date=2016| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404103744/http://www.intellinews.com/otp-agrees-to-buy-axa-s-hungarian-banking-unit-89925/?source=bne-banker| archivedate=2016-04-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant Colonel '''Olga E. Custodio''' &lt;ref group=note&gt;'''Custodio''' is the surname by marriage.&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1953) is a former [[United States Air Force]] officer who became the first female [[Hispanic]] U.S. military pilot. She was the first Hispanic woman to complete U.S. Air Force military pilot training. Upon retiring from the military, she became one of the first female Hispanic commercial airline captains.&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt;

==Early years==
Custodio was born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Her father, a sergeant in the [[United States Army]], was often stationed in various countries where the [[United States]] has its military installations. Custodio and the rest of the family would accompany him on his overseas assignments. Custodio began her primary education in [[Taiwan]]. She also attended schools in [[New Jersey]], [[Iran]] and  [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt;

The family returned to Puerto Rico when she was 15 years old. She graduated high school at age 16, and was immediately accepted into the [[University of Puerto Rico]]. Custodio's father, and all the traveling she did at a young age, were key factors in her choice of career - she decided to join the military. While in college she attempted to join the university’s ROTC ([[Reserve Officer Training Corps]]), but at the time only men were admitted into the program.&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt;

==Military career==
[[File:T-38 560FTS RandolphAFB 2001.jpeg|300px|thumb| A USAF T-38A Talon from [[560th Flying Training Squadron]], Randolph Air Force Base Texas]]
Custodio earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Puerto Rico and worked for various industries before landing a job in the accounting department of [[Prinair]] (Puerto Rico International Airlines). There she met Edwin Custodio, with whom she would eventually have two children. She later worked for the [[US Department of Defense]] (DoD) in [[Panama]]. With the support of her husband, she presented herself before Headquarters, Air Force Military Personnel Center (AFMPC) to apply for the United States Air Force [[Officers Candidate School|Officer Training School]]. Upon admission, Custodio was accepted as a pilot candidate to become a United States Air Force pilot.&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt;

She entered the Flight Screening Pilot Officer Training School in January 1980.  After successful completion of Flight Screening she entered Officer Training School and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant]]. She qualified for Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) at [[Laughlin Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] and graduated the following year, thus becoming the first Latina to complete the U.S. Air Force military pilot training.&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt;

Her first military assignment was that of instructor pilot at Laughlin AFB. She was the first female to become a [[Northrop T-38 Talon]] (T-38) UPT flight instructor at that base.&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt; The T-38 Talon is the Air Force’s two-seat, supersonic jet trainer.  On one occasion a bird struck the engine of her plane in bad weather while she was in flight. She was able to overcome the emergency and safely land her plane. Because of this she was recognized by the Air Force, and awarded the HQ AETC Aviation Safety Award for superior airmanship.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

Custodio was later assigned to [[Randolph Air Force Base]] where she was also the first female T-38 Instructor Pilot.&lt;ref name="FLMP"/&gt; During her career she also served as Pilot Instructor Training; T-41 Flight Screening - Operations Officer and Check Pilot.

==Life==
He was born in [[Govan]], Lanarkshire, the son of James Barr, a mill owner, and his wife, Mary Findlay. From a seed shop in [[Glasgow]], he moved to a seed merchant's in [[Newry]], and then went into business in 1852 in a partnership in [[Worcester]], concentrating on [[bulb]]s.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

After a change of partners, Barr in 1860 was in the bulb trade in [[King Street, St James's]] in London. He was known for his catalogues, and for gaining the interest of British gardeners in daffodils, then neglected, inspired by the work of [[John Parkinson (botanist)|John Parkinson]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The Peter Barr Memorial Cup is awarded each year by the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] to somebody who has done good work in relation to daffodils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/pdfs/plant-registration-forms/barr-cup-recipients.pdf |title=THE PETER BARR MEMORIAL CUP |accessdate=6 August 2018 |last= |first= |coauthors= |date=3 November 2016 |work= |publisher=Royal Horitcultural Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peyton Randolph''' (September 10, 1721 – October 22, 1775) was a planter and public official from the [[Colony of Virginia]]. He served as [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], president of [[Virginia Conventions]], and the first [[President of the Continental Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D71E39F934A25756C0A9649C8B63 New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/frommers/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/virginia/williamsburg/frm_williamsbu_0172022160.html New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Randolph was born in Tazewell Hall,&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.history.org/Files/Archaeo/MajorStudies/Tazewell.pdf Archaeological Excavations of Tazewell Hall Property]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/987717 Tazewell Hall: A Report of Its 18th Century Appearance]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Williamsburg, Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=R000049 Peyton Randolph] – Biographical directory of US Congress&lt;/ref&gt; to a prominent family. His parents were [[John Randolph (politician)|Sir John Randolph]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~warejamesbakercalder/randolphsirjohn0001.htm Descendents of Sir John Randolph]&lt;/ref&gt; the son of [[William Randolph]], and Susanna Beverley, the daughter of [[Peter Beverley]]; his brother was [[John Randolph (loyalist)|John Randolph]]. Peyton Randolph was 16  when his father died.

Randolph attended the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], and later studied law at Middle Temple at the [[Inns of Court]] in [[London]], becoming a member of [[bar (law)|the bar]] in 1743.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.org/almanack/people/bios/biorapey.cfm Peyton Randolph] – Colonial Williamsburg&lt;/ref&gt; He lived his adulthood in Williamsburg.

==Political career==
Randolph returned to Williamsburg and was appointed [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]] of the [[Colony of Virginia]] the next year.

He served several terms in the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], beginning in 1748. It was Randolph's dual roles as attorney general and as burgess that would lead to an extraordinary [[conflict of interest]] in 1751.

The new governor, [[Robert Dinwiddie]], had imposed a fee for the certification of [[land patent]]s, which the House of Burgesses strongly objected to. The House selected Peyton Randolph to represent their cause to Crown authorities in London. In his role as attorney general, though, he was responsible for defending actions taken by the governor. Randolph left for London, over the objections of Governor Dinwiddie, and was replaced for a short time as attorney general by [[George Wythe]]. Randolph resumed his post on his return at the behest of Wythe as well as officials in London, who also recommended the Governor drop the new fee.

In 1765, Randolph found himself at odds with a freshman burgess, [[Patrick Henry]], over the matter of a response to the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]]. The House appointed Randolph to draft objections to the act, but his more conservative plan was trumped when Henry obtained passage of five of his seven [[Virginia Stamp Act Resolutions]]. This was accomplished at a meeting of the House in which most of the members were absent, and over which Randolph was presiding in the absence of the Speaker.

Randolph resigned as king's attorney (attorney general) in 1766, as fellow Burgesses elected him as their Speaker upon the death of his relative, the powerful Speaker [[John Robinson (Virginia)|John Robinson]]. Sitting as the General Court, they also appointed Randolph one of the executors (with George Wythe and [[Edmund Pendleton]]) of the former speaker's estate, which was a [[John Robinson estate scandal|major financial scandal]]. As friction between Britain and the colonies progressed, Randolph grew to favor independence. In 1769 the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the Governor, [[Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt]], in response to its actions against the [[Townshend Acts]]. In 1773, Randolph chaired the [[Virginia committee of correspondence]]. The next Governor, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], also dissolved the House of Burgesses in 1774 when it showed solidarity with [[Boston]], Massachusetts, following the [[Boston Port Act]]. Afterwards, Randolph chaired meetings of the first of five Virginia Conventions of former House members, principally at a Williamsburg tavern, which worked toward responses to the unwelcome tax measures imposed by the British government. On March 21, 1775, he was president of the [[Second Virginia Convention]] in Richmond that debated independence (the site of Patrick Henry's famous "give me liberty" speech). In April, Randolph negotiated with Lord Dunmore for gunpowder removed from the Williamsburg arsenal during the [[Gunpowder Incident]], which was a confrontation between the Governor's forces and Virginia militia, led by Patrick Henry. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North's]] [[Conciliatory Resolution]]. Randolph, who was a delegate to the Continental Congress, returned to Williamsburg to take his place as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not been sent to the Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass the Continental Congress). The House of Burgesses rejected the proposal, which was also later rejected by the Continental Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virginia Resolutions on Lord North’s Conciliatory Proposal, 10 June 1775|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-01-02-0106|work=National Archives|accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph was thus the [[List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Burgesses|last Speaker]] of the House of Burgesses (their role was replaced by the Virginia Conventions and later the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] in 1776). Randolph also served as the president of the [[Third Virginia Convention]] in July 1775, which as a legislative body elected a [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] to act as the colony's executive since Lord Dunmore had abandoned the capital and took refuge on a British warship. Edmund Pendleton would succeed Randolph as president of the later conventions.

Virginia selected Randolph as one of its delegates to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in 1774 and 1775. Fellow delegates elected him their president (Speaker) of both the [[First Continental Congress]] (which requested that King George III repeal the [[Coercive Acts]]) as well as [[Second Continental Congress]] (which extended the [[Olive Branch Petition]] as a final attempt at reconciliation). However, Randolph fell ill during each term. [[Henry Middleton]] of South Carolina succeeded him as president from his resignation on October 22, 1774, until his return on May 10, 1775. He was again elected President of Congress, but Randolph left for Virginia four days later and was succeeded as President by [[John Hancock]]. Randolph returned as a Virginia delegate but suffered a fit of [[apoplexy]] and died in Philadelphia on October 22, 1775.

==Death and legacy==
His remains were returned to Williamsburg and were interred at the chapel of the [[College of William and Mary]]. Because the Continental Congress assumed governmental duties for the American colonies as a whole, such as appointing ambassadors, some consider Randolph to have been the first President of the United States, even though he died before the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.russpickett.com/ushist/uscont.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Continental Congress honored Randolph by naming one of the first naval frigates as the [[USS Randolph (1776)|USS ''Randolph'']], as well by naming a fort at the junction of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Kanawha River]]s as [[Fort Randolph (West Virginia)|Fort Randolph]].

[[Randolph County, North Carolina]], [[Randolph, Massachusetts]], and [[Randolph County, Indiana]], were named to honor the colonial statesman.

During World War II, the early ''Essex''-class aircraft carrier [[USS Randolph (CV-15)|USS ''Randolph'' (CV-15)]] was named for him. Furthermore, the [[Peyton Randolph House]] in [[Colonial Williamsburg]] was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970.

'''''Play Meter''''' (initially ''"Coin Industry Play Meter"'', ultimately ''Play Meter - "The Operators´ Choice"'') is an American [[trade magazine]] focusing on the [[arcade game|coin-op and arcade game]] industry. It was founded in December 1974 by publisher and editor Ralph C. Lally II and it is published in physical form by Skybird Publishing on a monthly basis. ''Play Meter'' has published several bi-monthly and annual special issues throughout its history and it maintains a website where online content is also published monthly. The magazine is generally regarded as the premier trade magazine of the American [[video game industry]] and as the earliest example of [[video game journalism]],&lt;ref name=smejkal/&gt;&lt;ref name=rignall/&gt;&lt;ref name=weston/&gt; establishing such practices as individual video game reviews&lt;ref name=fontenelle/&gt;&lt;ref name=wolf/&gt; and the ten-point assessment scale for video game reviews.&lt;ref name=audureau/&gt;

''Play Meter'' also served as the parent organization of the first coin-op-oriented spring [[trade show]] (forerunner to North America's annual [[Amusement Expo]]), and together with rival publication ''RePlay'' (founded 1975) it represents the only trade magazine to chronicle the arcade industry in its nascency, through market fluctuations like the video game [[Video game crash of 1977|crashes of 1977]] and [[Video game crash of 1983|1983]], and through the rebirth and maturation of the medium through the 1980s.&lt;ref name=carless/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14900">'''Policy Governance''', informally known as the '''Carver model''', is a system for organizational [[governance]]. Policy Governance defines and guides appropriate relationships between an organization's owners, its [[board of directors]], and its [[chief executive]].

The Policy Governance approach was first developed in the 1970s by [[John Carver (board policy)|John Carver]] who has registered the term as a [[service mark]] in order to control accurate description of the model.&lt;ref name="ServiceMark"&gt;CarverGovernance.com [http://www.carvergovernance.com/faq1.htm#registered "Why is Policy Governance a registered service mark?"]&lt;/ref&gt; The model is available for all to use without royalties or license fees and has been adopted by commercial, nonprofit, and public sector organizations.

==Principles of Policy Governance==
There are ten Principles of Policy Governance.&lt;ref name="Principles"&gt;International Policy Governance Association (IPGA) [http://www.policygovernanceassociation.org/resources/principles-of-policy-governance.html "Principles of Policy Governance"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Principles 1-3 define an organization's ownership, the board's responsibility to it, and the board's authority. Principles 4-7 specify that the board defines in writing policies identifying the benefits that should come about from the organization, how the board should conduct itself, and how staff behavior is to be proscribed. Principles 8-10 deal with the board's delegation and monitoring.

In general, if a board applies ALL of the principles of Policy Governance in its process and decision-making, then the board is likely practicing the model. If a board applies fewer than all the principles, it weakens or destroys the model’s effectiveness as a system.&lt;ref name="Reinventing Your Board"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carver|first=John|title=Reinventing your board : a step-by-step guide to implementing policy governance|year=2006|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, Calif.|edition=Rev.|author2=Miriam Carver}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38–39}}

==Claims for the model==
Authors of the Policy Governance model say it is a paradigm shift from the traditional practice of governance and that it provides a clear differentiation between governance and management responsibilities in organizations.

Policy Governance begins with a definition of governance as "Seeing to it that the organization achieves what it should and avoids unacceptable situations."  From this definition, board governance is at an arm's length from operations.

The board's primary relationship is with the organization's 'ownership'. As a result, governance is a downward extension of ownership rather than an upward extension of management. In this space, the board, as a single entity, assumes a governance position that is the link between ownership and the operational organization.  That governance position is a commanding authority. The board exists to exercise that commanding authority and to properly empower others. "Proper empowerment" means to define the results to be achieved by the organization (Ends), and define what would be considered unacceptable in terms of ethics and prudence (Executive Limitations).  The board delegates the job of achieving its Ends within the parameters defined in policy to the CEO.  To complete the delegation, the board rigorously monitors performance to policy to uphold accountability of the CEO.

In Policy Governance, the board has three primary jobs:  Ownership Linkage - connecting with owners to learn their values about ends that are desired and means that would be unacceptable; Policy Development - writing those values as guidance for organization and for the board itself; and Assurance of Organizational Performance - monitoring to ensure the organization demonstrates reasonable progress toward desired ends and reasonable compliance with policy guiding means.  The board's focus is at the broadest level of policy informed by the ownership's values.  When writing policy, the board only goes into as much detail as needed, and stops making policy when it can accept any reasonable interpretation of its policy language.

Experts in the model argue boards should govern with an emphasis on (a) outward vision rather than an internal preoccupation, (b) encouragement of diversity in viewpoints, (c) strategic leadership more than administrative detail, (d) clear distinction of board and chief executive roles, (e) collective rather than individual decisions, (f) future rather than past or present, and (g) proactivity rather than reactivity.

Templates of policies are provided in the literature &lt;ref name="Reinventing Your Board" /&gt;{{rp|233–255}} &lt;ref name="That Create Value"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carver|first=John|title=Corporate Boards That Create Value: Governing Company Performance from the Boardroom|year=2002|publisher=Jossey Bass|author2=Caroline Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141–175}} &lt;ref name=Playbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Carver|first=Miriam|title=The Board Member's Playbook: Using Policy Governance to Solve Problems, Make Decisions, and Build a Stronger Board|year=2004|publisher=Jossey Bass|author2=Charney, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255–277}} and by those trained in the model in order to illustrate what model-consistent policies might look like.  However these templates are not themselves the model and their use does not substitute for a board developing its own policies using the model’s principles.  Each policy that a board adopts should be an organizational value statement that reflects the shared values of that organization's ownership.

Many people confuse modification of policy language so that it fits their organization with changing the model itself.  Model-consistent practice is assessed by considering whether board performance aligns with the model's principles, not by reviewing the policy language that is adopted.

==Criticism of the model==

Industry Canada in the ''Primer For Directors of Not-For–Profit Corporations'' expressed concern about Policy Governance. They argue that “Some models of board governance—notably originating in the United States—advocate that directors limit themselves to policy matters only and leave responsibility for administration and day-to-day matters with the executive staff of the corporation. This limited role for directors does not reflect the obligations that are legally imposed upon directors.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Primer for Directors of Not-for-Profit Corporations|year=2002|publisher=Industry Canada|isbn=0-662-32550-8|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cilp-pdci.nsf/eng/h_cl00688.html|editor=Peter Broder|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}}

Hugh Kelly QC of the Canadian legal firm Miller Thomson LLP responded directly to this criticism concluding that:  “The board of a Canadian charitable corporation that adopts Policy Governance has performed 'due diligence', and fulfilled all legal obligations imposed upon its directors. On a comparative basis, such boards and directors are far ahead of most corporations, even those in the world of commerce, in observing their legal and moral obligations.” &lt;ref name="PG in Canada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=H.M.|title=Carver Policy Governance in Canada|journal=Miller Thomson LLP Charities and Not-For-Profit Newsletter|date=July 2003|pages=7–9|url=http://www.millerthomson.com/assets/files/newsletter_attachments/issues/charities_july_2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Others have expressed concern that the Policy Governance model may not be as universally applicable as suggested by Carver and that the model has a tendency to break down during times of crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.voteanthony.com/?p=67&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing the universality concern, proponents of Policy Governance argue that, because the model is rooted in the generic purpose and nature of board authority rather than current practice of the specifics of any industry, at the level of its fundamental principles Policy Governance is indeed applicable to all governing boards.&lt;ref name="That Create Value" /&gt;{{rp|10}} Proponents also argue that at times of crisis, holding onto the  precepts of Policy Governance is in fact key to organizational survival and that rehearsing the use of the system in light of various scenarios can help build an organization's resilience to risk.&lt;ref name="That Create Value" /&gt;{{rp|110}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=When Crisis Strikes|journal=Governing Excellence: The Voice of the International Policy Governance Association|year=2002|volume=2002|issue=4|page=3|url=http://www.boundarymanagement.com/ipga%20documents/ipga%20newsletter%20winter%202002.pdf|editor1-first=Caroline|editor1-last=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two more widely accepted criticisms are that the model demands a level of precision that boards can find hard to achieve—even though it is usually no more than they demand of their staff—and without care, that the model's use can deteriorate over time and its protections fail to function. Many proponents point to the challenges presented by board member turnover and the need, as with any other professional discipline, for boards to continuously invest in their own training and support.&lt;ref name="Reinventing Your Board" /&gt;{{rp|222–229}} &lt;ref name="Getting Started" /&gt; {{rp|178–187}}&lt;ref name=Fieldbook /&gt; {{rp|161–190}}

Some authors and users of the model may misinterpret the distinction between 'ends' and 'means' to require a strict separation of responsibility between the board, which should focus exclusively on 'ends', and management, which should focus on the 'means' by which to achieve those ends.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/svbenoit/policy-governance-reviewed&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oneota-critique"&gt;http://ouroneotacoop.blogspot.com/2009/02/policy-governance-is-system-of.html&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is not supported by a close reading of the Policy Governance model. Carver states: 
"because the board is accountable for everything, it is accountable for means as well. Accordingly, it must exercise control over both ends and means, so having the ends/means distinction does not in itself relieve boards from any responsibility".&lt;ref name="Carver-NP"&gt;http://www.carvergovernance.com/pg-np.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, related, misinterpretation is a belief that boards following Carver's model should not involve themselves with detailed understanding and/or monitoring of the organization's activities.&lt;ref name="Oneota-critique" /&gt; This belief is based on Carver's caution against excessive intrusion into the operational details. However, Carver is clear that boards remain accountable to their owners for all operational details and must therefore control them—the question is how to make this practical. As a way to avoid excessive intrusion, he advises the use of 'nested sets' of expectations, in progressively more narrow policy language, in order to define its meaning with greater precision until: "At some point, the board will have narrowed its words to the point that it can accept any reasonable interpretation of those words. Now the board has reached the point of delegation".&lt;ref name="Carver-NP" /&gt;

Because a board has ultimate power over the organization, to include all its operations, some critics point out that a board should not delegate any of its authority, because it ignores major areas of its responsibility if it "hands over" part of its power to the CEO.  This criticism points out that delegation, the granting of authority to the CEO, can become an "abdication" of the board's responsibility to control all organizational actions.  Delegation can become an abdication if it occurs without adequate supervision.  Delegation accompanied by careful monitoring to ensure it achieves the results intended is an exercise of the "due diligence" expected of the board.

Further criticism relates to the failure of some boards to follow their own policies.  Following policies that guide the board in its own governance process, and its relationship with the CEO, is an act of self-discipline by which the board imposes checks and balances on its own power.  These self-limiting policies protect staff from board actions that might get in the way of successful organizational performance.  They also protect the CEO, and the board itself, from possible actions of individual board members.  A board may give a false sense that it is acting in the best interests of the organization while ignoring its own policies, and therefore promotes a "veil" of legitimacy behind which it acts in capricious ways.  Such a board distracts itself from the real job boards should be doing.  Ultimately, whether a board remains true to its own policies is a matter for the board itself to determine.  Carver notes this concern when he acknowledges that Policy Governance will not  make "a bad board good."

[[File:Saul Solomon - Cape Politician and Liberal Activist - Cape Archives.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Saul Solomon, at his seat in the Cape House of Assembly]]'''Saul Solomon''' (25 May 1817 – 16 October 1892) was an influential liberal politician of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]]. A tireless defender of racial and religious equality, Saul Solomon was an important member of the movement for [[responsible government]] and an opponent of [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s disastrous [[Confederation]] scheme.

==Early life and background==
Saul Solomon was born on the island of [[St Helena]] on 25 May 1817 (the nephew of the great St Helena businessman Saul Solomon senior). Although his family were St Helenan, they had close links to Cape Town. Saul spent his first few years at a Jewish children's home in England, where he suffered from the malnutrition and rickets that physically affected him for the rest of his life. He then had a rudimentary formal education in South Africa before beginning work as an apprentice in a printing business. He later acquired the business and built it into the largest printing business in the country, founding the ''[[Cape Argus]]'' newspaper. He was also one of the founders of [[Old Mutual]], today one of the largest insurance firms in South Africa.&lt;ref name="wikispaces1"&gt;[http://1820gw.wikispaces.com/2.3++Saul+Solomon+Family ''1820gw – 2.3 Saul Solomon Family'', accessdate=2012-12-06]&lt;/ref&gt;

As representative for Cape Town, Solomon entered the very first [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope]] (Cape Parliament) when it opened in 1854. He remained an MP for this constituency until his retirement in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hearl|first=Trevor W.|title=In Search of Saul Solomon of St Helena 1776–1852 |url=http://www.archeion.talktalk.net/sthelena/saulsolomon.htm|publisher=The St Helena Institute|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career (1854–1883)==
Saul Solomon's original election promise had been "to give my decided opposition to all legislation tending to introduce distinctions either of class, colour or creed".&lt;ref name=obiog&gt;Stanley Trapido, ‘Solomon, Saul (1817–1892)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51112, accessed 17 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout his political career he strictly adhered to this manifesto – repeatedly turning down both cabinet and ministerial posts so as to be free to vote according to his beliefs.
He thus assumed a unique role in parliament, being a watchdog critic, as well as sometimes the power behind the government, depending on its policies.

Although he was from a [[Jewish]] background and even funded the establishment of the Cape's first synagogue in 1849, Solomon was openly secular in outlook, declaring himself to be "a liberal in politics and a voluntary in religion". In the first Cape parliament in 1854, he presented his "Voluntary bill" (intended to end government subsidies to churches, and to ensure equal treatment of all beliefs) but it was turned down. He proceeded to put it to parliament every year, only for it to be repeatedly rejected, until it was finally passed under the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno]] government in 1875.

===The Responsible Government Movement (1854–1872)===
[[File:2 Saul Solomon and his pets - Solomon with Cetshwayo Merriman and Molteno - Feb 1879.tif|thumb|upright=1.5|Reactionary cartoon depicting Saul Solomon with the prominent anti-imperialist leaders of southern Africa as his "pets". The pets shown are Zulu King [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]], the Beaufort lion [[John Molteno]] (Cape Prime Minister), and [[John X Merriman]] (shown as a monkey).]]
Solomon joined the movement for [[responsible government]] in the Cape and helped to institute it when it was established in 1872. The leader of the responsible government movement, Prime Minister [[John Charles Molteno]], was an old friend and a great admirer of Saul Solomon's politics. The two men were both businessmen from poor immigrant backgrounds, who had outlooks that were relatively liberal for the times, and saw eye-to-eye on a number of issues. In fact, according to Saul Solomon's official biography, Molteno only accepted the office of Prime Minister after insisting that it first be offered to Solomon, who turned it down however due to his delicate health.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, W. E. C: ''Saul Solomon – the Member for Cape Town''. Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[R.W. Murray]]: ''South African Reminiscences''. Cape Town:JC Juta &amp; Co. 1894. p.79&lt;/ref&gt;
Solomon went on to give his powerful support to the Molteno Ministry on many occasions in the future, though he characteristically refused all offers of cabinet positions so as to be able to oppose the government if and when his conscience required it.&lt;ref group="note2"&gt;Mr Thompson, MLA for Grahamstown, summed up the situation that "...Molteno would not hold a Ministry together for one week if Mr Solomon was in it; and no cabinet could do without him (Solomon)." ''The Zingari''. 9 June 1871, p.94. Reporting on parliamentary session on 7 June 1871.

The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd, 1992. {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}. p.129, ''"The Story of Saul Solomon"''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Cape Separatist League (1854–1874)===
{{main|Eastern Cape Separatist League}}
The [[Eastern Cape|eastern part]] of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] had a long-running separatist movement, consisting of a portion of white settlers (the "Easterners"), led by parliamentarian [[John Paterson (Cape politician)|John Paterson]] of [[Port Elizabeth]], who resented the rule of the Cape Town parliament and wanted stricter labour laws to encourage the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] to leave their lands and work on the settlers’ plantations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmot, A. ''The History of our own Times in South Africa, Volume 1''. J.C. Juta &amp; co., 1899. p.142 &amp; p.227&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with his stated policy that "natives should be allowed to sell their labour as they desired, and that no semblance of coercion should be employed to provide labour for the farmer" and because he detested the Easterners' white supremacist views, Solomon took a strong stance against the separatist movement and for a united, multi-racial Cape.

Famously, when he was addressing parliament about the need to enforce the principles of racial equality that the Cape's constitution called for, the Separatist representatives all stood up and walked out on him. After a second's pause, he reportedly declared: "I would rather address empty benches than empty minds!"&lt;ref name="wikispaces1"/&gt;

In parliament he went on to lead the "Westerners", who backed the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno–Merriman government]] in successfully crushing the separatist league. Separatist parliamentarians branded him a "negrophile" – an intended insult that he in fact accepted with considerable pride, and he went on to push even further for social reform (for example repealing the discriminatory Contagious Diseases act{{clarify|date=January 2014}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofsouthaf02theauoft/historyofsouthaf02theauoft_djvu.txt |title=History of South Africa, from 1873 to 1884|last1=Theal |first1=George McCall |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd, London|date=1919|accessdate=2012-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The imposition of Confederation (1874–1878)===
Starting in 1874, the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], having federated Canada, began an ill-fated plan to impose the same system of [[confederation]] on the very different states of southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;''Illustrated History of South Africa'' p.182 "Confederation from the Barrel of a Gun" (1992) The Reader's Digest Association South Africa (Pty) Ltd,  {{ISBN|0-947008-90-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Cape Colony - 1878.jpg|thumb|The Cape Colony in 1878, on the eve of the Confederation wars]]

Although earlier in his career Solomon had been in favour of a form of federated "United States of Southern Africa", he shared with the Cape government concerns about the form and timing of Carnarvon's confederation project. Of particular concern to many liberal politicians were the repressive "native policies" of [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] and the [[Boer republics]] (which would have affected the rights of many Cape citizens). Saul Solomon joined the Cape government in arguing that the Cape's multi-racial constitution might not survive a session of bargaining with the Boer republics. 
Another issue was the fact that some neighbouring states, such as [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] and the [[Transvaal Republic]], would actually require military invasion to be incorporated into the confederation. Consequently, Solomon ended up vigorously opposing Carnarvon's proposal and the "new and impatient imperialism" which motivated it.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan, Mona (1969). ''Sir Henry Barkly, mediator and moderator, 1815–1898''. Balkema: Cape Town. p.259.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative, Solomon proposed a looser system of federation, whereby the Cape could preserve its multi-racial franchise. Another proposed alternative was the "Molteno Plan" of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Government]], which advocated complete union instead of confederation, but with the Cape's constitution (including the multi-racial franchise) extended and imposed on the other states of southern Africa.
Both suggestions were ignored by the British Colonial Office and over the next few years Carnarvon's disastrous confederation scheme unravelled as predicted, leaving a swath of destructive wars across southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Molteno (1900) ''The life and times of Sir John Charles Molteno, K. C. M. G., First Premier of Cape Colony, Comprising a History of Representative Institutions and Responsible Government at the Cape'', Smith, Elder &amp; Co., London&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sprigg Government (1878–1881)===
To further the Confederation scheme, the British Governor had appointed a new and more compliant government, under the puppet Prime Minister [[Gordon Sprigg]]. Against the backdrop of the wider "Confederation wars" that now swept southern Africa, Sprigg began to institute a more discriminatory policy towards the Cape's Black African citizens, and this led to revolts and further conflicts like the [[Basuto Gun War]].

Although Saul Solomon had initially agreed to accept Sprigg's new government, its discriminatory policies immediately brought down his strongest criticism, which was voiced through his various media outlets. This culminated in his public campaign against the government for its role in the [[Koegas atrocities]].

Sprigg's retaliation was swift. He ordered a review and cancellation of all government contracts with the Argus and other businesses that were linked to Saul Solomon. These were all given to political allies (though without the equipment to fulfill them and at several times the price). Meanwhile, Sprigg's Attorney-General, Upington, launched a series of high-profile lawsuits (bordering on [[show trial]]s) against Solomon himself.

====The "Pro Bono Publico" trial (1878–79)====
Solomon's editor, the brilliant but contrarian [[Patrick McLoughlin (editor)|Patrick McLoughlin]], had supposedly anonymously written several pieces criticising the Sprigg government and the British colonial establishment, the most imfamous of which was entitled "Pro Bono Publico" ("For the Public Good"). A series of libel lawsuits were launched by the Sprigg government, ultimately targeting Solomon, whom it tried to link the pamphlets too.

Although it was never proven that McLoughlin even authored the pamphlets in question (and Solomon believed he had not), the trial and related pressures caused McLoughlin to resign (he shot himself a few years later). The Sprigg party failed however, to bring Solomon himself down.

====The "Fiat Justitia" trial (1879–80)====
The following year, Solomon's enemies had another opportunity. The Argus printed reports of racism and miscarriage of justice regarding the earlier trials for the [[Koegas atrocities|Koegas murders]], which had been sent to it signed "Fiat Justitia" ("May there be justice").

This generated another round of political trials. These attacked Solomon's new editor, [[Francis Dormer]], for libel but again sought ultimately to damage Solomon himself. 
Once again the editor fell, and once again Solomon survived, in spite of losing the trial. Crucially, he produced letters from the Koegas trial judge asking him to publish the information, and detailing the brutal violence of the murders and the racism which had prevented justice being done.

"Fiat Justitia" ultimately turned out to have been Mr D.P. Faure, who had served as the Koegas court interpreter. Faure was driven from his official career by the Sprigg government, but Solomon later sought out the unemployed Faure and gave him a token translator job with the Argus.

====Aftermath====
Solomon emerged from these attacks financially damaged, but largely victorious. The government, frantically cutting back on core infrastructure to avoid bankruptcy from its war expenses, became increasingly unpopular. When its British backers were recalled to London to face charges of misconduct, the Sprigg government fell.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Coates: ''Cape Colonial Parliamentary Publications, 1854–1910, with special reference to documents in the Dutch language''. UNISA. 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details and later life==
[[File:Clarensville House Seapoint - Cape Town.png|thumb|right|Clarensville House in Sea Point]]
Physically, Solomon was partially disabled. Childhood poverty and ill health, aggravated by a bout of [[rickets]], had left him with badly stunted legs. When standing, this made him so short that he needed to stand on a chair to be seen when addressing Parliament. 
His physical condition was particularly drawn attention to by his very high-pitched voice, as well as by the frequent presence by his side of his friend and political ally Molteno, who was unusually tall,&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, D. W. (1971) ''Dictionary of South African Biography'' p.485, Tafelberg Ltd. {{ISBN|0-624-00369-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the image of the two men together was a topic for caricature by the political cartoonists of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heyningen, N &amp; Worden, E &amp; Bickford-Smith, V. (1998) ''Cape Town, the Making of a City'' p.213, Uitgeverij Verloren {{ISBN|90-6550-161-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saul Solomon was nonetheless a famously eloquent and persuasive speaker, with an incredibly sharp mind and a skill for reasoned argument. His proposals were usually painstakingly researched and he characteristically spent long hours studying censuses and other government publications for the precise facts and figures that he believed should inform his opinions. Consequently, he was typically always able to back up his opinions with great quantities of evidence as well as with a clear and sophisticated application of logic. This earned him considerable respect, even from his political opponents.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.samj.org.za/1934%20VOL%20VIII%20Jan-Dec/Articles/03%20March/2.5%20REMINISCENCES%20-%20S.A.%20EXPERIENCES.%20W.%20Darley-Hartley.pdf W. Darley-Hartley (1934) ''Reminiscences – South African Experiences'' Vol.8]&lt;/ref&gt; 
An example is the cautious and guarded homage which writer Stanley Little, a political opponent, later paid to Saul Solomon in his 1887 work on the Cape's political leadership. 
{{Quote
|text= The Honourable Saul Soloman[sic], whom I may call Molteno's ghost, is without doubt the ablest man South Africa has produced. Without his support few Ministers could hold office for long. He is the most remarkable statesman in the Cape. It is he who can pull the wires and bring Jack's house tumbling down about his ears whenever he likes. An able debater, a splendid fighter, an energetic, consistent, upright man, he deserves all honour and praise. He has led a life of steadfast consistency, and has conferred benefits upon the colony, which must earn for his name the unswerving veneration of generations of South Africans yet to come. He secured for the Cape the boon of representative institutions, he stimulated her energies in all matters educational, and that grand educational establishment, the South African College, is vastly his debtor. He has been ever foremost in making every effort to provide for suitable instruction for the people. As to his native policy, he thoroughly believes he is right there. He is animated by noble, generous impulses, but here, if I may make bold to say so, in criticising so great a man, I think his goodness of heart has somewhat thwarted the soundness of his judgment. His whole life has been devoted to preaching the doctrine of the equality of all races and classes. I believe this to be a fallacy, a bitter, mournful fallacy. The French encyclopaedists were all wrong, these ideas are utter nonsense.

His progressive views on equal rights extended to gender relations (for his marriage ceremony he famously asked that his wife should not have to vow to "obey" him), religion (He never officially renounced his [[Judaism]], but he abhorred sectarian attitudes and attended churches as often as synagogues) and class (He asked his employees and household servants to simply call him "Saul").

He lived at Clarensville House in [[Sea Point]], [[Cape Town]] for most of his life. He married [[Georgiana Solomon|Georgiana Margaret Thomson]] at his house on 21 March 1874. She was a head teacher 29 to his age of 56.&lt;ref name=geogiana/&gt; He and Georgiana enjoyed welcoming guests as varied as [[Cetewayo]], King of the [[Zulu people|Zulus]], and the future Kings, [[Edward VII|Princes Edward]] and [[George V|George]]. However, after his daughter tragically drowned near their property in 1881, Solomon's health declined and he withdrew from public life, even handing his business over to his nephews.

He retired from public life completely in 1883 due to poor health and moved to [[Kilcreggan]], Scotland, in 1888. &lt;br&gt;
It was here that he died in 1892, of "Chronic tubular nephritis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancestry24.com/saul-solomon-portrait-of-a-liberal/|publisher=ancestry24.com|accessdate=5 November 2010|title=Saul Solomon.

Saul Solomon's extended family remained deeply involved in politics and law in southern Africa for many years – though they varied greatly in their political allegiance.

'''SEBRAE''' or '''Serviço Brasileiro de Apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas''' (Portuguese: ''Brazilian Micro and Small Enterprises' Support Service''), is a Brazilian autonomous social institution part of the [[Sistema S]] whose aim is to foster the development of [[Micro-enterprise|micro]] and [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|small enterprises]], stimulating [[entrepreneurship]] in the country .

Founded in 1972 with the name of CEBRAE (Centro Brasileiro de Apoio à Pequena e Média Empresa),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sebrae comemora 40 anos de história com livro, mostra e memorial|url = http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/1166919-sebrae-comemora-40-anos-de-historia-com-livro-mostra-e-memorial.shtml|website = Folha online|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was an entity associated with the [[Brazilian federal government]]. In October 1990, it was renamed Sebrae (Serviço Brasileiro de apoio às Micro e Pequenas Empresas), detaching itself from public administration and becoming an autonomous, non-profit social service.

Sebrae's current chairman is [[Guilherme Afif Domingos]]. The president of its National Deliberative Council is Roberto Simões.

A '''sovereign default''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɒ|v|ər|ᵻ|n}}){{refn|group=n|When used as a noun in a financial context, ''default'' takes stress on the second syllable; in other senses of the word, it may take stress on the first syllable, depending on the speaker's dialect.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of "default" |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/default |website=Collins Dictionary |publisher=Collins| accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is the failure or refusal of the [[government]] of a [[sovereign state]] to pay back [[Government debt|its debt]] in full. Cessation of due payments (or receivables) may either be accompanied by formal declaration (repudiation) of a government not to pay (or only partially pay) its debts, or it may be unannounced. A [[credit rating agency]] will take into account in its gradings capital, interest, extraneous and procedural [[default (finance)|default]]s, failures to abide by the terms of bonds or other debt instruments.  Countries have at times escaped the real burden of some of their debt through [[inflation]].  This is not "default" in the usual sense because the debt is honored, albeit with currency of lesser real value.  Sometimes governments [[Devaluation|devalue their currency]]. This can be done by printing more money to apply toward their own debts, or by ending or altering the convertibility of their currencies into precious metals or foreign currency at fixed rates.  Harder to quantify than an interest or capital default, this often is defined as an extraneous or procedural default (breach) of terms of the contracts or other instruments.

If potential lenders or bond purchasers begin to suspect that a government may fail to pay back its debt, they may demand a high interest rate in [[risk premium|compensation for the risk]] of default. A dramatic rise in the interest rate faced by a government due to fear that it will fail to honor its debt is sometimes called a '''[[debt crisis|sovereign debt crisis]]'''. Governments may be especially vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis when they rely on financing through short-term bonds, since this creates a situation of [[maturity mismatch]] between their short-term bond financing and the long-term asset value of their tax base.

They may also be vulnerable to a sovereign debt crisis due to [[currency mismatch]]: if few bonds in their own currency are accepted abroad, and so the country issues mainly foreign-denominated bonds, decrease in the value of their own currency can make it prohibitively expensive to pay back their foreign-denominated bonds (see [[Original Sin (economics)|original sin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. |last=Eichengreen |authorlink=Barry Eichengreen |first2=R. |last2=Hausmann |year=2005 |title=Other People's Money: Debt Denomination and Financial Instability in Emerging Economies |location=Chicago |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-19455-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since a [[sovereignty|sovereign]] government, by definition, controls its own affairs, it cannot be obliged to pay back its debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=E. |last=Borensztein |first2=U. |last2=Panizza  |url=http://vox.lacea.org/fckeditor.html?q=node/25 |title=The Costs of Sovereign Default: Theory and Reality |work=VOXLACEA |date=Nov 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, governments may face severe pressure from lending countries. In a few extreme cases, a major creditor nation, before the establishment of the [[UN Charter]] Article 2 (4) prohibiting [[use of force by states]], made threats of war or waged war against a debtor nation for failing to pay back debt to seize assets to enforce its [[creditor's rights]]. For example, Britain [[Anglo-Egyptian War (1882)|invaded Egypt in 1882]]. Other examples include the United States' "[[gunboat diplomacy]]" in Venezuela in the mid-1890s and the [[United States occupation of Haiti]] beginning in 1915.&lt;ref name="This-time-is-different"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carmen M. | last=Reinhart |first2=Kenneth S. |last2=Rogoff | year=2009 |title=This time is different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (p. 54ff) |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=0-691-14216-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today a government which defaults may be widely excluded from further credit, some of its overseas assets may be seized;&lt;ref name="This-time-is-different"/&gt; and it may face political pressure from its own domestic bondholders to pay back its debt. Therefore, governments rarely default on the entire value of their debt. Instead, they often enter into negotiations with their bondholders to agree on a delay ([[debt restructuring]]) or partial reduction of their debt  (a '[[Haircut (finance)|haircut or write-off]]').

Some economists have argued that, in the case of acute [[insolvency]] crises, it can be advisable for [[regulator (economics)|regulators]] and [[supranational]] [[lender]]s to preemptively engineer the orderly restructuring of a nation’s public debt- also called "orderly default" or "controlled default".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. Nicolas J. |last=Firzli |title=Greece and the Roots the EU Debt Crisis |journal=The Vienna Review |date=March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nouriel |last=Roubini |authorlink=Nouriel Roubini |title=Greece’s best option is an orderly default |newspaper=Financial Times |date=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek debt crisis|the case of Greece]], these experts generally believe that a delay in organising an orderly default would hurt the rest of Europe even more.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Armitstead, "EU accused of 'head in sand' attitude to Greek debt crisis" ''The Telegraph'', 23 June  2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] often lends for sovereign debt restructuring. To ensure that funds will be available to pay the remaining part of the sovereign debt, it has made such loans [[conditionality|conditional]] on acts such as reducing [[corruption]], imposing [[austerity|austerity measures]] such as reducing [[public sector|non-profitable public sector]] services, raising the tax take (revenue) or more rarely suggesting other forms of revenue raising such as [[nationalization]] of inept or corrupt but lucrative economic sectors. A recent example is the [[European sovereign debt crisis#Greek government funding crisis|Greek bailout agreement of May 2010]].

== Causes ==
According to financial historian [[Edward Chancellor]], past instances of sovereign default have tended to occur under some or all of the following circumstances:&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/files/2010/07/chancellor.pdf ''Reflections on the sovereign debt crisis''], Edward Chancellor, GMO White Paper, Juli 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A reversal of global capital flows
* Unwise lending
* Fraudulent lending
* Excessive foreign debts
* A poor credit history
* Unproductive lending
* Rollover risk
* Weak revenues
* Rising interest rates
* [[Terminal debt]]

A significant factor in sovereign default is the presence of significant debts owed to foreign investors such as banks who are unable to obtain timely payment via political support from governments, supranational courts or negotiation; the enforcement of [[creditors' rights]] against sovereign states is frequently difficult. Such willful defaults (the equivalent of [[strategic bankruptcy]] by a company or [[strategic default]] by a mortgager, except without the possibility of the exercise of normal creditors' rights such as asset seizure and sale) can be considered a variety of sovereign [[theft]]; this is similar to [[expropriation]] (including inadequate repayment for the exercise of [[eminent domain]]).&lt;ref name=theft&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Mark|last2=Tomz|first2=Mike|editor1-first=William |editor1-last=Hogan|editor2-first=Federico|editor2-last=Sturzenegger|title=The Natural Resources Trap: Private Investment without Public Commitment|url=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/mlwright/research/workingpapers/Papers.html#Theft|accessdate=6 November 2011|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA, USA|pages=69–110|chapter=Sovereign Theft: Theory and Evidence about Sovereign Default and Expropriation|chapterurl=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/mlwright/research/workingpapers/TomzWrightExpropriationDefault.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Is Walking Away From Your Mortgage Immoral? | first = James R. | last = Hagerty | date = 2009-12-17 | journal = [[The Wall Street Journal]] | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2009/12/17/is-walking-away-from-your-mortgage-immoral/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{Who?|date=October 2018}} also believe that sovereign default is a dark side of globalization and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allisayis.com/sovereign-default-the-dark-side-of-globalization-and-capitalism/ |title=Sovereign Default-The dark side of globalization and capitalism |publisher=AllISayIs.com |date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insolvency/over-indebtedness of the state===
{{duplication|date=March 2014}}
If a state, for economic reasons, defaults on its treasury obligations, or is no longer able or willing to handle its debt, liabilities, or to pay the interest on this debt, it faces sovereign default.  To declare insolvency, it is sufficient if the state is only able (or willing&lt;ref name=theft/&gt;) to pay part of its due interest or to clear off only part of the debt.

Reasons for this include:{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*massive increases in [[public debt]]
*declines in employment and therefore [[tax revenue]]
*government regulation or perceived threats of [[Financial regulation|regulation of financial markets]]
*popular unrest at [[austerity]] measures to repay debt fully

Sovereign default caused by insolvency historically has always appeared at the end of long years or decades of [[Government budget|budget]] emergency ([[overspending]]&lt;ref name="Baqir, Reza"&gt;{{citation|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/2192.html|title=Districts, spillovers, and government overspending|author=Baqir, Reza|publisher=World Bank|date=30 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;), in which the state has spent more money than it received.  This budget balance/margin was covered through new indebtedness with national and foreign citizens, banks and states.

===Illiquidity===
The literature proposes an important distinction between ''illiquidity'' and ''insolvency''. If a country is temporarily unable to meet pending interest or principle payments because it can not liquify sufficient assets, it is "in default because of illiquidity". In this concept the default can be solved as soon as the assets which are "only temporarily illiquid" become ''liquid'' (again), which makes illiquidity a temporary state - in contrast to insolvency. The weakness of this concept is that is practically impossible to prove that an asset is only temporarily illiquid.

===Change of government===
While normally the change of government does not change the responsibility of the state to handle treasury obligations created by earlier governments, nevertheless it can be observed that in revolutionary situations and after a [[regime change]] the new government may question the legitimacy of the earlier one, and thus default on those treasury obligations considered [[odious debt]].

Important examples are:
*default of debts of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] France after the [[French Revolution]].
*default of bonds through [[Denmark]] in 1850, which were issued by the government of [[Holstein]] instated by the [[German Confederation]].
*default of debts of the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government came to power in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Landon-Lane J., Oosterlinck K., (2006), "Hope springs eternal: French bondholders and the Soviet Repudiation (1915-1919)", Review of Finance, 10, 4, pp. 507-535.&lt;/ref&gt;
*repudiation of debts of the [[Confederate States of America]] by the [[United States]] after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] through the ratification of Section 4 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].

===Decline of the state===
With the decline of a state,{{clarify|date=November 2011|reason=how is this distinct from successor governments discussed above?}} its obligations are turned over to one or several [[succession of states|successor state]]s.

Lost wars significantly accelerate sovereign default. Nevertheless, especially after [[World War II]] the [[government debt]] has increased significantly in many countries even during long lasting times of peace. While in the beginning debt was quite small, due to [[compound interest]] and continued [[overspending]]&lt;ref name="Baqir, Reza"/&gt; it has increased substantially.

== Approaches to debt repayment ==
There are two different theories as to why sovereign countries repay their debt.

=== Reputation approach ===
The reputation approach stipulates that countries value the access to international capital markets because it allows them to smooth consumption in the face of volatile output and/or fluctuating investment opportunities. This approach assumes no outside factors such as legal or military action because the debtor is a sovereign country. Debtor countries with poor reputations will lack access to these capital markets.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/why-sovereigns-repay-debts-external-creditors-and-why-it-matters|title=Why sovereigns repay debts to external creditors and why it matters|last=|first=|date=|website=VoxEU.org|jstor=2296886|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment approach ===
The punishment approach stipulates that the debtor will be punished in some form, whether it be by legal action and/or military force. The creditor will use legal and/or military threats to see their investment returned. The punishment may prevent debtors from being able to borrow in their own currency.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;

==Consequences==
Creditors of the state as well the economy and the citizens of the state are affected by the sovereign default.

===Consequences for creditors===

The immediate cost to creditors is the loss of principal and interest owed on their loans to the defaulting country.

In this case very often there are international negotiations which end in a partial [[debt cancellation]] ([[London Agreement on German External Debts]] 1953) or [[debt restructuring]] (e.g. [[Brady Bonds]] in the 1980s). This kind of agreement assures the partial repayment when a renunciation / surrender of a big part of the debt is accepted by the creditor. In the case of the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)]] some creditors elected to accept the renunciation (loss, or "haircut") of up to 75% of the outstanding debts, while others ( "holdouts") elected instead to await a change of government (2015) for offers of better compensation.

For the purpose of debts regulation debts can be distinguished by nationality of creditor (national or international), or by the currency of the debts (own currency or foreign currency) as well as whether the foreign creditors are private or state owned. States are frequently more willing to cancel debts owed to foreign private creditors, unless those creditors have means of retaliation against the state.&lt;ref name=theft/&gt;

===Consequences for state===
When a state defaults on a debt, the state disposes of (or ignores, depending on the viewpoint) its financial obligations/debts towards certain creditors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The immediate effect for the state is a reduction in its total debt and a reduction in payments on the interest of that debt. On the other hand, a default can damage the reputation of the state among creditors, which can restrict the ability of the state to obtain credit from the capital market.&lt;ref name=theft/&gt; In some cases foreign lenders may attempt to undermine the [[Monetary Sovereignty|monetary sovereignty]] of the debtor state or even declare war (see above).

===Consequences for the citizen===
If the individual citizen or corporate citizen is a creditor of the state (e.g. [[government bonds]]), then a default by the state can mean a devaluation of their monetary wealth.

In addition, the following scenarios can occur in a debtor state from a sovereign default:
* a [[banking crisis]], as banks have to make [[Writedowns|write downs]] on credits given to the state.
* an [[economic crisis]], as the interior [[demand]] will fall and investors withdraw their money
* a [[currency crisis]] as foreign investors avoid this national economy

Citizens of a debtor state might feel the impact indirectly through high unemployment and the decrease of state services and benefits. However, a [[Monetary sovereignty|monetarily sovereign]] state can take steps to minimize negative consequences, rebalance the economy and foster social/economic progress, for example Brazil's [[Plano Real]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lim |first=Richard |url=http://www.soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/brazil-battle-against-inflation/ |title=Brazil's Battle Against Inflation |publisher=Soundsandcolours.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
With the reputation of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] &amp;ndash; [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]] and [[Fitch Group]] &amp;ndash; coming under fire since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], many have questioned their ratings methods. Marc Joffe, a former Senior Director at Moody's and now Principal Consultant at [http://www.publicsectorcredit.org/ Public Sector Credit Solutions] (PSCS), has recently argued that economists and other academic social scientists, via logit and probit [[Econometric model|econometric models]], are better equipped than ratings agencies to assess the default risk of sovereigns and municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econjwatch.org/articles/rating-government-bonds-can-we-raise-our-grade |title=Joffe, Marc. "Rating Government Bonds: Can We Raise Our Grade?" Econ Journal Watch 9(3): 350-365, September 2012 |publisher=Econjwatch.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support better ratings methods, PSCS (in partnership with [[Wikirating]]) maintains a comprehensive public database of sovereign defaults, revenues, expenditures, debt levels, and debt service costs. PSCS has also developed the [[Public Sector Credit Framework]], an open source budget simulation model that helps analysts assess default probabilities.

==Examples of sovereign default==
{{main article|List of sovereign defaults}}
A failure of a nation to meet bond repayments has been seen on many occasions. [[Philip II of Spain]] defaulted on debt four times – in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596 – becoming the first nation in history to declare sovereign default due to rising military costs and the declining value of gold,  as it had become increasingly dependent on the revenues flowing in from its [[Spanish Empire|mercantile empire]] in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geology.ucdavis.edu/~cowen/~GEL115/115CH8.html Gold and Silver: Spain and the New World] University of California&lt;/ref&gt; This sovereign default threw the German banking houses into chaos and ended the reign of the [[Fuggers]] as Spanish financiers. [[Republic of Genoa#Golden age of Genoa|Genoese]] bankers provided the unwieldy Habsburg system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further military ventures.

In the 1820s, several Latin American countries which had recently entered the bond market in London defaulted. These same countries frequently defaulted during the nineteenth century, but the situation was typically rapidly resolved with a renegotiation of loans, including the writing off of some debts.&lt;ref name="jorgensen"&gt;Erika Jorgensen and Jeffrey Sachs, "Default and Renegotiation of Latin American Foreign Bonds in the Interwar Period" In: Barry J. Eichengreen and Peter H. Lindert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=K42LgBw0zqMC The International Debt Crisis in Historical Perspective]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A failure to meet payments became common again in the late 1920s and 1930s; as protectionism by wealthy nations rose and international trade fell especially after the banking crisis of 1929, countries possessing debts denominated in other currencies found it increasingly difficult to meet terms agreed under more favourable economic conditions.  For example, in 1932, Chile's scheduled repayments exceeded the nation's total exports (or, at least, its exports under current pricing; whether reductions in prices – forced sales – would have enabled fulfilling [[creditors' rights]] is unknown).&lt;ref name="jorgensen" /&gt;

More recently Greece became the first developed country to default to the International Monetary Fund. In June 2015 Greece defaulted on a $1.7 billion payment to the IMF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/06/30/news/economy/greece-imf-default/index.html|title=Greece defaults on $1.7 billion IMF payment|last=Liakos|first=Virginia Harrison and Chris|date=2015-06-30|website=CNNMoney|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Susan was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and graduated from [[Omaha Central High School]]. Her father, [[William Hertzog Thompson]], was a minister, psychologist, [[Dean (education)|dean]] at the [[University of Nebraska-Omaha]], and one-time campaign manager for [[Howard Buffett]].

Though her parents and Warren's knew one another, they met at [[Northwestern University]], via Susan's roommate Roberta Buffett, Warren's sister.

Susan and Warren married in 1952 at the Dundee Presbyterian Church in Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpcomaha.org/ Dundee Presbyterian Church, Omaha website]&lt;/ref&gt; They had three children together: [[Susan Alice Buffett|Susan]] (born July 30, 1953), [[Howard Graham Buffett|Howard]] (born December 16, 1954), and [[Peter Buffett|Peter]] (born May 4, 1958).&lt;ref&gt;[http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/t/h/o/Daniel-J-Thompson/GENE9-0007.html Family Tree Maker's Genealogy Site: User Home Page Genealogy Report: Descendants of David Thompson b. 1774, Ireland d. 1859 Ohio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She occasionally performed as a [[cabaret]] singer and, in 1977, had a one-night performance at an Omaha theater. Encouraged by songwriter/musician [[Neil Sedaka]] to pursue a singing career,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article464196.ece| work=[[The Sunday Times]]| date=August 1, 2004| title=Wife's death puts the spotlight on Buffett empire | location=London | accessdate=May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; she left her husband and moved to San Francisco.  She started out living in a small apartment in Gramercy Tower on [[Nob Hill]].  Later she moved into a large condominium on Broadway near Scott Street in [[Pacific Heights]] with views of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] and [[Alcatraz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schroeder | first = Alice | authorlink = | author2 = | title = The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 452, 460, 523, 667 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-553-38461-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained married and on good terms with her husband, vacationing together with him and spending time assisting charitable groups.  She performed in New York and released several CDs. According to [[Roger Lowenstein]]'s 1995 Random House biography, ''[[Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist]]'', while Warren encouraged Susan to pursue her career in music, he was soon heartbroken by her move.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;

In 1978, Susan introduced her husband to [[Astrid Menks]], who moved in with Warren in their Omaha home, and after Susan's death, married him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/business/01buffett.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin| title=How Does Warren Buffett Get Married?

The Buffetts never divorced and even attended public functions as husband and wife though they hadn't lived together for more than half of their marriage. The Buffetts even signed [[Christmas card]]s Warren, Susan, and Astrid&lt;ref name="lowenstein"&gt;{{cite book | last=Lowenstein | first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Lowenstein | title=Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist | isbn= 0-8129-7927-3 | publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were often seen together as a trio.

==Oral cancer and death==
In October 2003, Susan was diagnosed with [[oral cancer]]; she underwent surgery, [[radiation therapy]] and [[facial reconstruction]]. Warren flew out from Omaha to be with her every weekend during her recovery and the couple would later contribute $6 million to five California doctors for the study of oral cancer.  She had recovered enough to attend the annual [[shareholders' meeting]] of Berkshire Hathaway in May 2004, leading a singalong at the [[Borsheim's Fine Jewelry|Borsheim's]] reception.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Susan died at the age of 72 after suffering a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] during the summer of 2004 in Cody, Wyoming. [[Bono]] performed "[[Forever Young (Bob Dylan song)|Forever Young]]" and "[[All I Want Is You (U2 song)|All I Want Is You]]" at her funeral.  Warren was so grief-stricken that he did not attend.  She left approximately $50 million to her children's charity while each of her children received $10 million and each grandchild received $100,000.  She also left a number of friends and employees substantial sums, including $8 million to John McCabe and $1 million to Ron Parks.  Nearly all of her Berkshire Hathaway shares, valued at nearly $3 billion at the time, were left to a foundation that would later bear her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schroeder | first = Alice | authorlink = | author2 = | title = The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2008 | location = | pages = 800–806 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-553-38461-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT)''' is a form of habituation therapy designed to help people who suffer from [[tinnitus]], a ringing, buzzing, hissing, or other sound in the ears when no external sound is present.  Two key components of TRT directly follow from the neurophysiological model of tinnitus. One of these principles includes [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|directive counseling]] aimed at reclassification of tinnitus to a category of neutral signals,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} while the other includes [[neurologic music therapy|sound therapy]]&lt;ref name=Jastreboff2&gt;Tinnitus Retraining Therapy Implementing the Neurophysiological Model, Jastreboff, P.J. and Hazell, J.W.P. (2004). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at weakening tinnitus related neuronal activity.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jastreboff|first=P.J.|title=Tinnitus retraining therapy|journal=Progress in Brain Research|year=2007|volume=166|pages=415–423|issn=0079-6123|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079612307660403|accessdate=23 March 2013|doi=10.1016/s0079-6123(07)66040-3|series=&lt;!-- --&gt;|isbn=9780444531674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of TRT is management of tinnitus; there is no evidence that TRT can attenuate or eliminate tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The efficacy of TRT in reducing the distress of tinnitus has not been established.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} TRT is not a medical treatment for tinnitus or any other condition, and is not administered by a medical doctor or other medical professional.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

An alternative to TRT is [[tinnitus masking]], the use of noise, music or other environmental sounds to obscure or mask the tinnitus.  Hearing aids can provide a partial masking effect for the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler et.al.|first1=R.S.|title=Tinnitus Retraining Therapy: Mixingpoint and Masking are Equally Effective.|journal=Ear and Hearing|date=2012|volume=33|issue=5|pages=588–594|doi=10.1097/aud.0b013e31824f2a6e}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a review of tinnitus retraining therapy trials indicate that it may be a more effective treatment than tinnitus masking.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips|first=John S|author2=Don McFerran |title=Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) for tinnitus|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2010|issue=3|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007330.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applicability==
Not everyone who experiences tinnitus is significantly bothered by it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} However, some of the problems caused by tinnitus include annoyance, anxiety, panic, and loss of sleep and/or concentration.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt; The distress of tinnitus is strongly associated with various psychological factors; loudness, duration and other characteristics of the tinnitus are secondary.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

TRT may offer real although moderate improvement in tinnitus suffering for adults with moderate-to-severe tinnitus, in the absence of hyperacusis, significant hearing loss and/or depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauer, et.al.|first1=CA|title=Effect of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy on the Loudness and Annoyance of Tinnitus: A Controlled Trial.|journal=Ear &amp; Hearing|date=2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=145–55|doi=10.1097/aud.0b013e3181f5374f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone is a good candidate for TRT.  Factors associated with suitability for TRT and predisposing for favorable outcome are: lower loudness of tinnitus, higher pitch of tinnitus, shorter duration of tinnitus since onset, recognition of tinnitus attenuation by sound generator, lower hearing thresholds (i.e. better hearing), high Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newman, et.al|first1=CW|title=Development of the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory|journal=Arch Otolaryngol|date=1996|volume=122|issue=2|pages=143–148|doi=10.1001/archotol.1996.01890140029007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and positive attitude toward therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariizumi|first1=Y|title=Clinical prognostic factors for tinnitus retraining therapy with a sound generator  in tinnitus patients|journal=J Med Dent Sci|date=2010|volume=57|issue=1|pages=45–53|pmid=20437765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other secondary hearing symptoms===
Despite the fact that there haven't been any recent studies which concluded in its optimal treatment, tinnitus retraining therapy has been applied to treating [[hyperacusis]], [[misophonia]], and [[phonophobia]].&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

===Limitations===
There is no evidence that TRT or any other treatment can eliminate or decrease tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Tinnitus is a symptom, not a disease. As such, the optimal treatment strategy should be directed toward eliminating the disease, rather than simply alleviating the symptom.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} More than half of people with tinnitus have a comorbid psychological injury or illness (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, stress, dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, etc.) that can exacerbate the tinnitus.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Cause==

===Physiological basis===
It has been proposed that tinnitus is caused by mechanisms that generate abnormal neural activity, specifically one mechanism called discordant damage (dysfunction) of outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

===Psychological model===
{{See also|Neuroplasticity}}
The psychological basis for TRT stems from the fact that the brain exhibits a high level of plasticity. In turn, this allows it to adjust to any sensory signals as long as they do not lead to negative effects. TRT is imputed to work by interfering with the neural activity causing the tinnitus at its source, in order to prevent it from spreading to other nervous systems such as the limbic and autonomic nervous systems.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff/&gt;

==Methodologies==

===Classification===
Clients are classified into 5 categories. These categories are numbered 0 to 4, and based on whether or not the patient has tinnitus with hearing loss, tinnitus with no hearing loss, tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis, and tinnitus with hearing loss and hyperacusis for an extended amount of time.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Counseling===
{{Further|Cognitive behavior therapy}}
The first component of TRT, directive counseling, may change the way tinnitus is perceived. The patient is taught the basic knowledge about the auditory system and its function, the mechanism of tinnitus generation and the annoyance associated with tinnitus. The repetition of these points in the follow-up visits helps the patient to perceive the signal as a non-danger.{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Efficacy==
Measuring the efficacy of TRT is beset by confounding factors: tinnitus reporting is entirely subjective therefore not reliable; tinnitus or at least subjects' perception of it varies over time and repeated evaluations are not consistent. Researchers have noted that there is a large placebo component to tinnitus management.  In many commercial TRT practices, there is a large proportion of dropouts; reported 'success' ratios may not take these subjects into account.

There are few available studies, but most show that tinnitus naturally declines over time (years) in a large proportion of subjects surveyed, without any treatment. The annoyance of tinnitus also tends to decline over time.  In at least some, tinnitus spontaneously disappears.&lt;ref name=Jastreboff2/&gt;

A Cochrane review found only one sufficiently rigorous study of TRT and noted that while the study suggested benefit in the treatment of tinnitus, the study quality was not good enough to draw firm conclusions.&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt; A separate Cochrane review of sound therapy (though they called it masking), an integral part of TRT, found no convincing evidence of the efficacy of sound therapy in the treatment of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006371.pub3|chapter=Sound therapy (masking) in the management of tinnitus in adults|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2012|last1=Hobson|first1=Jonathan|last2=Chisholm|first2=Edward|last3=El Refaie|first3=Amr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary in The Lancet concluded that in the only decent study, TRT was more effective than masking; in another study in which TRT was used as a control methodology, TRT showed a small benefit.  A study which compared cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) in combination with the counselling part of TRT versus standard care (ENT, audiologist, maskers, hearing aid) found that the specialized care had a positive effect on quality of life as well as specific tinnitus metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baguley|first1=D|title=Tinnitus|journal=The Lancet|date=2013|volume=382|issue=9904|pages=1600–07|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60142-7|pmid=23827090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical practice==
Tinnitus activities treatment (TAT) is a clinical adaptation of TRT that focuses on four areas: thoughts and emotions, hearing and communication, sleep, and concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler, et.al.|first1=RS|title=Tinnitus activities treatment|journal=Prog Brain Res.|date=2007|volume=166|pages=425–34|pmid=17956807|doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)66041-5|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444531674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive tinnitus management (PTM) is a 5-step structured clinical protocol for management of tinnitus which may include tinnitus retraining therapy. The five steps are:
# triage – determining appropriate referral, i.e. audiology, ENT, emergency medical intervention, or mental health evaluation;
# audiologic evaluation of hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis and other symptoms;
# group education about causes and management of tinnitus;
# interdisciplinary evaluation of tinnitus;
# individual management of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henry, et.al.|first1=J|title=Using Therapeutic Sound With Progressive Audiologic Tinnitus Management|journal=Trends Amplif.|date=2008|volume=12|issue=3|pages=188–209|doi=10.1177/1084713808321184|pmc=4134892|pmid=18664499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) now employs PTM to help patients self-manage their tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Henry, et.al.|first1=J|title=VA Clinical Practice Recommendations for Tinnitus|url=http://www.ncrar.research.va.gov/Education/Documents/TinnitusDocuments/TinnitusPracticeGuidelines.pdf|website=National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
* Sound therapy for tinnitus may be more effective if the sound is patterned (i.e. varying in frequency or amplitude) rather than static.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reavis, et.al.|first1=KM|title=Patterned sound therapy for the treatment of tinnitus. Hear Jour. 2010;60(11):21–24|journal=Hear jour.|date=2010|volume=60|issue=11|pages=21–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For persons with severe or disabling tinnitus, techniques that are minimally surgical involving magnetic or electrical stimulation of areas of the brain involved in auditory processing may suppress tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridder, et.al.|first1=DD|title=Magnetic and electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex for intractable tinnitus|journal=J Neurosurg|date=2004|issue=100|doi=10.3171/jns.2004.100.3.0560}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Notched music therapy, in which ordinary music is altered by a one octave notch filter centered at the tinnitus frequency, may reduce tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henning, et.al.|first1=S|title=Customized notched music training reduces tinnitus loudness|journal=Commun Integr Biol|date=2010|volume=3|issue=3|pages=274–277|pmid=20714412|pmc=2918775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Cognitive behavior therapy===
[[Cognitive behavior therapy]] (CBT), the counselling part of TRT, as a generalized type of psychological and behavioral counselling, has also been used by itself in the management of tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyung, et.al.|first1=JJ|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Tinnitus: Evidence and Efficacy|journal=Korean J Audiol|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=101–104|doi=10.7874/kja.2013.17.3.101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hearing aids===
If tinnitus is associated with hearing loss, a tuned hearing aid that amplifies sound in the frequency range of the hearing loss (usually the high frequencies) may effectively mask tinnitus by raising the level of environmental sound, in addition to the benefit of restoring hearing.

=== Masking ===
{{See also|Tinnitus masker}}
White noise generators or environmental music may be used to provide a background noise level that is of sufficient amplitude that it wholly or partially 'masks' the tinnitus (tinnitus masker).  Composite hearing aids that combine amplification and white noise
generation are also available.

===Other===
Numerous other non-TRT methods have been suggested for the treatment or management of tinnitus.
* pharmacological – No drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating tinnitus. However, various pharmacological treatments, including antidepressants, anxiolytics, vasodilators and vasoactive substances, and intravenous lidocaine have been prescribed for tinnitus
* lifestyle and support – Things like loud noise, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, quiet environments and psychological conditions like stress and depression may exacerbate tinnitus.  Reducing or controlling these may help manage the condition.
* alternative medicine – vitamin, antioxidant and herbal preparations (notably ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' extract, also called [[EGb761]]) are advertised as treatments or cures for tinnitus.  However, none are approved by the FDA, and controlled clinical trials on their efficacy are lacking.

The '''Unfair Commercial Practices Directive''' 2005/29/EC&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, L149/22 – L149/39, 11 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; regulates [[unfair business practices]] in [[EU law]], as part of [[European consumer law]]. It requires corresponding laws to be passed that incorporate it into each member state's legal system.

The Directive is concerned mainly with the "substantive" law (meaning in this context the standards of behaviour required of traders). To some extent it leaves to member states the choice of appropriate domestic enforcement procedures and penalties for non-compliance (Articles 11 to 13 of the Directive).

==Contents==
===Recitals===
The recitals state the objective of the Directive to reduce barriers to free trade in the EU while simultaneously ensuring a high level of consumer protection. At issue was the fact that the consumer protection laws are different among the various member states (see Article 1 of the Directive and the recitals to it). The Directive is supposed to reduce these differences while establishing a required minimum level of consumer protection across all member states. This is expected to benefit both business and consumers, as businesses receive a more standardised legal system under which to operate and consumers receive a sufficient and standardised level of protection, regardless of where they choose to make purchases.

The Directive is designed to achieve what is called "maximum harmonisation" of business-to-consumer fair trade.  The idea of "maximum harmonisation" is that it requires [[List of European Union member states|member states]] of the European Union to apply the standards set out in European legislation and prohibits those states from applying lower or higher standards. In other words, the Directive tells European countries to give consumers no more and no less than the level of protection set out in the Directive. That maximum harmonisation is not yet in force.

===Chapter 1===
The Directive starts with a general prohibition on unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices (Articles 3(1) and 5(1)) and then goes into progressively greater detail defining what that means.

Article 3(2) states the Directive is expressly "without prejudice to contract law and, in particular, to the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract" (see also the 9th recital to the Directive). It does not seek to harmonise [[unfair competition]] law regulating "...commercial practices which, although not harming consumers, may hurt competitors and business customers" (8th recital to the Directive).

===Chapter 2===
Article 5(1) says that "unfair commercial practices" are prohibited, and under article 5(2)(a) these are practices that are "contrary to the requirements of professional diligence" (see further Article 2(h)) and that are likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of the average consumer (Article 5(2)(b)). The effect of commercial practices on particular kinds of consumers, especially those who are unusually vulnerable, can replace the "average consumer" test if the practices are directed at those kinds of consumers or will foreseeably affect them (Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3)). The Directive describes two major categories of unfair commercial practices:- those that are misleading (Articles 5(4)(a), 6 and 7) and those that are aggressive (Articles 5(4)(b), 8 and 9). Annex 1 to the Directive sets out a list of "commercial practices that are, in all circumstances, considered unfair" (a black-list of bad behaviour). These are divided into "misleading commercial practices" (23 examples) and "aggressive commercial practices" (8 examples).

On a literal reading of the Directive, misleading or aggressive commercial practices that would not affect the average consumer's economic behaviour, but would distort the economic behaviour of particular kinds of consumer, may be prohibited only by the general clause in Articles 5(1) to 5(3), and not by the specific clauses in Articles 6 to 9. This is because the latter provisions refer exclusively to the "average consumer" (although Article 9(c) also refers to the "exploitation of any specific misfortune or circumstance of such gravity as to impair the consumer's judgement, of which the trader is aware..."). However, it might be fairer to read Articles 5(2)(b) and 5(3) as supplanting the references to the "average consumer" in Articles 6 to 9 in appropriate cases. The UK Government's [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] published a consultation paper in December 2005, which suggested that that was indeed the intention. There is no clear basis in the text for the favoured interpretation, but the UK Government supports its interpretation with reference to the European Commission's Explanatory Memorandum. This could be important because depending on the answer to this question it may be easier or harder to pin down a breach of the Directive.

The rules referred to in the actual text of the Directive in relation to codes of conduct are quite limited (e.g. Article 6(2)(b), prohibiting non-compliance with codes of conduct in some circumstances, and Article 10). However, the 20th recital states: "It is appropriate to provide a role for codes of conduct ... In sectors where there are specific mandatory requirements ... these will also provide evidence as to the requirements of professional diligence in that sector. ... consumers' organisations could be informed and involved in the drafting of codes of conduct." Subscribers to a code of conduct drafted with the input of and endorsed by a major consumers' organisation could seek to argue during enforcement proceedings that compliance with the code of conduct is therefore evidence that they have not engaged in unfair commercial practices. Those charged with promoting and administering membership of codes of conduct will take note that Article 11(1) in effect contemplates the possibility of class-actions brought by consumer groups against code-owners where the code promotes non-compliance with legal requirements. Taken together, these provisions may be an incentive for those who administer and promote codes of conduct to consult with consumers' groups and take careful legal advice in relation to the drafting of such codes.

===Chapters 3 and 4===
Chapter 3 envisages a role for businesses in the industry to draft codes of conduct about practices among their competitors.

Chapter 4 requires that member states have, under article 11, "adequate and effective means exist to combat unfair commercial practices". This includes ensuring that consumer groups have standing to take representative legal action on behalf of the people whose interests they represent, or make complaints to the consumer authorities. Article 11(2) requires that public authorities exist (for instance, the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] or the [[Bundesamt für Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit]]). Article 11(3) requires that they should be impartial in fulfilling their role of protecting consumers against unfair business practices.

==Implementation==
The Directive required the member states to pass laws by no later than 12 June 2007 incorporating it into their own internal [[law|national law]] by 12 December 2007. However, until at least 12 June 2013, Member States will continue to be able to apply more protective national rules diverging from European directives insofar as it is necessary and proportionate to do so (Article 3(5)), meaning that maximum harmonisation may not be complete before that date. There will be a major review of the operation of the Directive by 12 June 2011 (Article 18).

'''Value Delivery Modeling Language''' ('''VDML''') is a standard modeling language for analysis and design of the operation of an enterprise with particular focus on the creation and exchange of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Value Delivery Modeling Language (VDML)|url=http://www.omg.org/spec/VDML/|website=Object Management Group|accessdate=26 August 2015|ref=OMG_spec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummins|first1=Fred A.|title=Value Delivery Modeling Language (VDML): An Update|url=http://fredacummins.blogspot.be/2013/02/value-delivery-modeling-language-vdml_4878.html|website=Building the Agile Enterprise|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Object Management Group]] (OMG) launched a Request for Proposal (RfP) to develop a standard for value modeling. The goal of this RfP is to integrate the different existing value models and give a complete overview of the business logic of an organisation. To reach this goal, the standard has to satisfy nine requirements:
# The [[Metamodeling|metamodel]] must satisfy the characteristics of the [[Meta-Object Facility]] (MOF) metamodel. MOF is a standard developed for model-driven engineering and is structured in 4 layers. The top layer (M3 model) consists of a language that is used to construct metamodels. These metamodels are the second layer (M2 model) and they describe the third layer (M1 laer). The last layer, the data layer is used to describe real objects. 
# The metamodel must support the analysis of the activities of the [[value chain]] to support the identification of differentiators. The internal value chain should as such be part of the metamodel.
# A capability analysis must be possible. This is closely linked to the second requirement. A capability is the possibility to execute some sort of activity. The quality of an activity is as such dependent on the capabilities of the organisation. As such the metamodel should include a way to analyse these capabilities.
# The value model should have an adequate level of detail to include both activities and capabilities on the operational level. However a value model focuses on the inputs and outputs unlike a process model such as [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN]]. 
# The value model should be able to aggregate activities at multiple levels to analyse them from different angles (e.g. strategic vs operational).
# It should be possible to couple performance- and cost aspects to the activities
# The relationships with other organisations such as competitors and strategic alliances should be included.
# The events that trigger an activity should be included in the metamodel
# The user should be able to include its own specifications.

The VDML standard integrates 7 existing value models:
* [[Value chain|Porter's Value Chain]]
* [[Business Model Canvas|Business Model Ontology]] of Osterwalder
* [[Value network analysis|Verna Allee's Value Network Analysis]]
* E3-Value analysis
* [[Resources, events, agents (accounting model)|Resources, Events, Agents (REA)]] analysis
* [[Value stream mapping|Value Stream Mapping]]
* [[Service-oriented architecture|Service-Oriented Business Architecture analysis]]

The use of VDML diagrams to support business model innovation is discussed in&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berre|first1=Arne J.|last2=de Man|first2=Henk|last3=Lindgren|first3=Peter|title=Business Model Innovation with the NEFFICS platform and VDML|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1006/paper5.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VDML has been applied to a use case in manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Man|first1=Henk|last2=Berre|first2=Arne J.|title=VDML Manufacturing Use Case|url=http://files.modelbased.net/vdml/12-11-10.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308201944/http://files.modelbased.net/vdml/12-11-10.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 March 2016|publisher=NEFFICS|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It demonstrates the use of VDML for modeling and analysis of a proposed change to an
as-is business system.
